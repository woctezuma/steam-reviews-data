The interface is similar to old fallout games but without the feedback on whether or not actions may lead to a certain result. Too many menus within menus. Too much RNG grind in the hopes that you might find enough gear before getting eaten by random dogs; or killed by a stranger who is always faster than you, and for some reason, is really fond of your hospital gown because that's the only thing of value on your character. I say random dogs because stray dogs are apparent. Random dogs just show up on top of you.\n\nThere's really no variety to the gameplay other than the few story choices that only lead to one result. The randomness that does exist is clearly skewed against the player. I have to replay the same starting sequence of events for 15 minutes each time I have to restart. Just let me skip it.

You can also store things in it and use it to boil water. Ok combat time... did you remember to empty it before the encounter? OH NOES now the game won't let you attack or pull out the objects because your opponent closed to range too quickly. Worst of all... THE GAME DOESNT TELL YOU ANY OF THIS WHILE IT IS HAPPENING so it feels like you're glitched and simply can't attack.\n\nYou can save your progess on exit but only have 1 character going at a time.

L E L\n\nTrue gritty post-apocalyptic survival games (that do it right) are hard to come by. That's why I was excited after seeing NEO Scavenger's intricate gameplay, despite its underwhelming aesthetic presentation. Unfortunately, after about 7 hours of gameplay, I can say for sure that NEO Scavenger is wasted potential.\n\nTo break down the flaws of this game - and there are many - let's address the largest of the bunch: the UI. I'm not doubting the dev's intelligence, but I can't wrap my head around how someone could push through a UI as clunky and confusing as NEO Scavenger's. Everything about it is plain awful. And this is not a generality - the ENTIRE UI is a nightmare to navigate. Crafting. Combat. Exploring. Making in-game decisions. All of it is unbelievably tedious due to the UI. Its difficult to get more specific when everything about it is so poorly implemented. All I can recommend is to gut the UI completely. There's no saving it. Its THAT bad.\n\nNext up is the audio. NEO Scavenger from first glance seems like it has good atmosphere, and you'd think a gritty post-apoc survival game would benefit greatly from good audio, but NEO Scavenger fails to impress. Items have stock sounds when you click them. Players make footsteps only when you move a tile. There's music... occasionally. But other than that, the majority of the game seems to have no sound or ambiance whatsoever. Combat has no sound effects, so that coupled with the UI makes for an underwhelming experience, as is most of the rest of the game in this regard.\n\nThere's a growing trend with indie games to make stupidly difficult, rogue-like, Dark Souls-esque games for the sake of \"challenge\". NEO Scavenger tries to jump on this trend as well, but does it even more poorly than the rest. The game's learning curve, first and foremost, is a 90-degree incline upwards. You have to waste at least a few hours dying and restarting, along with consulting the wiki, to figure the game out. Learning the game was a small bit of fun for me, but was easily eclipsed by the tedium of dying of hypothermia, reselecting my character traits, fighting the dogman, rinse and repeat. A huge problem with the game's formula is that each death sets you back far more than what's reasonable. Its similar to Getting Over It by Bennet Foddy, except each time you fall (death), you go back to the beginning of the game. Having to start at step one again and again is the definition of tedium, and entirely ruins the experience - I'm not kidding. The game gives you zero incentive to want to rescavenge the world, collect a trove of items, suit yourself up, and set off into the wilderness, because death can quite literally be random. You could accidentally drink tainted water. A dogman could kill you in your sleep (even with half a dozen noise traps lying around). In-combat RNG could just hate you at that particular moment. Several events can even kill you in a Choose Your Own Adventure Book fashion, which in a game like Scavenger, is uncalled for. You may as well spoil the story for yourself on the wiki too, because the story in-game is anything but compelling or intriguing, and not worth pursuing by itself. Overall, crafting/item collecting and permadeath together is akin to a peanut butter and anchovy sandwhich - the two do NOT mix. Its just bad game design, plain and simple, and its tragic that NEO Scavenger went this direction. It would be so much better otherwise.\n\nI previously mentioned dying of hypothermia. This is what all new players will face when starting the game. You wake up in a hospital gown (not a preferred outfit to survive the post-apoc) and you quickly become hypothermic. If you can't find warm clothing in the first 6 to 8 in-game hours, you die, and go back to square one. No competent game does this for its early-game. You at least let the player experience a meaningful tidbit of the game before shoving them into the meat grinder. What Scavenger should have done is offered the player warm but low-quality clothing that will quickly degrade, as to at least give them a fighting chance to scavenge for more clothes and give a more consistent early-game experience (no, being forced to choose the Trapping skill to get the Dogman fur coat doesn't cut it). Consistency is another issue - the world map is, for the most part, randomly generated, and this means that not all new games will allow you to find clothes in time. You just have to die and start over because you got a bad roll - sorry bucko. The game tries to show how brutal and unforgiving it is, but instead flops on its back, twitching and making spit bubbles.\n\nNot necessarily part of the NEO Scavenger experience, but I did notice that the game advertises another Steam game, Project Zomboid. I was hugely disappointed the dev chose to do this. Project Zomboid is a game stuck in Early Access hell, where the developers have overpromised and underperformed for years, and do a weekly monday blog blathering about nonsense instead of delivering the product people paid for. What's worse is that anyone who criticizes the dev team or their moderators are quickly banned for \"bad behavior\". They are also known to demonize and strawman critics if banning isn't enough. I'd pick NEO Scavenger's flawed game any day over a more-refined-by-comparison game like Zomboid soley due to Zomboid's disingenuous developer team. Its very disappointing that Blue Bottle Games would advert for them, and they've done so for years at this point.\n\nThere are more minor grievances I have with Scavenger, like how sterilized water shouldn't include other sterilized water in its recipe, the \"no moves left to craft\" UI nuisance, combat chance % never given despite life or death depending on it, but that would take much longer to write up. Overall, with what I've put forward here, people will get the jist of the huge flaws with the game, and will make more informed decisions as to whether or not a purchase is warranted. Its been years since the last update (which is unfortunate), but I do hope Blue Bottle Games revisits NEO Scavenger and makes meaningful changes and updates to the game, because it really did have a lot of potential, and would be worth its $15 price tag rather than $10 or less.\n\nFor now, though, its about as rickety and run down as the buildings you loot from.", "timestamp_created": 1518728194, "timestamp_updated": 1518741028, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486145", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40055941": {"recommendationid": "40055941", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976301306", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518613955}, "language": "english", "review": "Is this game good?

There are some balance issues, but it really all adds back to the experience. I have yet to have another game deliver the feeling I have playing this game other than S.T.A.L.K.E.R, in which I actually constantly feel in danger while also being stunned by all that the game world has to offer me. The game is also aesthetically pleasing in the same way S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is in the sense that everything is very rustic/post-apocalyptic, similiar to other titles such as Rust where there is a true sense of a civilization that has once collapsed, rather than just a few abandoned structures placed willy nilly there are actual houses/cities in a tile-based environment with lengthy descriptions attached to them that are an absolute treat to read into.\n\nThe game also hosts an excessive amount of content, so much so that you could play hours upon hours of the game and still be enthralled by it. Every piece of content you discover serves it's own purpose as well. Even the most redundant looking of things can be used in their own fashion. Being chased? Just throw rocks at whatever is chasing you. I guess what I'm trying to say is that no content is just there to be there. Nearly everything serves it's own purpose, be it sinister or not.\n\nSpeaking of sinister, the game's lore/backstory is probably one of the most interesting to read into. Within ten minutes of launching the game and starting your first run the first few thoughts you will be having is \"Just how did the world end up like this?\". The best part of it all is that this question is never really specifically answered, (at least it hasn't been for me yet) but there are multiple pieces of information scattered around the world such as old newspapers, the conversations you have with people and the creatures you come across that allow the player to make their own conclusions on the subject. \n\nOne thing that must be said about Neo: Scavenger, however, is that the game is not for the fient of heart. Those who have a hard time wrapping their heads around a plethora of game mechanics will quickly find themselves dying unfairly from a rather large amount of things simply because they do not know how to approach the subject. One of the game mechanics I got stuck on for a while is the combat. I was dying from some of the easiest foes rather quickly because I did not know how to properly fight at all. I had the proper equipment, but I just was simply pulling it off all wrong. This was especially annoying because of the fact that Neo: Scavenger has a rather punishing perma-death mechanic, but in the end it all became clear and soon I was dispatching those same enemies with ease.\n\nWhile I was having a relatively easy time with those enemies, they certainly weren't underestimatable. A swift blow to the head by one of them could land you concussed or stunned and make the fight unexpectedly more harder for you. Certain enemies also exhibit pack-like behaviour, (not just dogs!) which could land you in some sticky situations. Every fight I've ever gotten into in this game feels like a real fight for my life, and the outcome is never truly understood untill the fight is finished. Sometimes it isn't even the fight that kills you, but the wounds or other effects afterwards that can send you to your grave, such as the Blue Frog cult, a dangerous cult that intentionally infects people with a disease they worship.\n\nOverall the game is very pleasureable (in a masochistic way) to play and extremely punishing yet rewarding. The blend of mechanics in the game is superb, the combat is superb, the lore is superb, the feel of the game is superb, just everything about it is fucking superb. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who is even a slight fan of rogue-likes, survival games or just a fan of a fun challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1517704047, "timestamp_updated": 1517704164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39799727": {"recommendationid": "39799727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054369686", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517683934}, "language": "danish", "review": "Det her spil er helt vildt grinern.

Some seem obvious, like boiling your drinking water. Others far less so. Anyway...the game starts with you waking up in a cryo chamber with no memory whatsoever. Worse? Something is coming, and you don't have much time to react. Quickly now...\n\nLike many rouge-element games, this one has you managing the usual suspects regarding your character: hunger, thirst, sleep, etc.  It also contains some character customization parts that you select at the game's start and generally easy to learn mechanics (like you need Botany to scavenge and identify which plants are safe vs. poisonous and someone with Trapping makes more use of animal carcasses, etc.).\n\nAnyway, I measured my progress as a player not in how many enemies I killed/avoided, or how much I explored, but in how much of the story I uncovered and how long I had survived in-game.  Seems kinda silly, but when you first start playing surviving an in-game week is nearly impossible. Even seasoned players still find it challenging sometimes. The random events were a neat touch too, adding another flavor of tension to the game of survival.\n\nSo take a crack at it, die a few times and then come up with a seemingly genius plan....find all the right stuff you need....and then die anyway because you forgot to cover your tracks and a thug found you while you were sleeping and blasted your head off (been there). Then realize you don't know jack, and that until late game you'll be flying by the seat of your pants the whole way. No plan is perfect, and this game proves that very well.

Perhaps the whole 'dying' aspect has a part in that. But something truly rewarding comes along with the sour taste of a bullet tearing through your fur coat and hospital gown. This game has no true direct path, But many smaller ones that you, The player decide. Every little move could be your last, It could be deciding to leave those bullets behind, Only for a good seven weeks later, You run out of ammo for your handgun or rifle, And really regret not dropping your scraps of cloth for those rounds. Or it could be deciding to not prepare a suitable camp for the night, and a 9 foot beast come tearing through your camp, and you. It could even be greed, Going for that guy with the cozy looking coat, Only to be on the recieving end of a crowbar from his buddy. This game truly is not for the faint of heart, But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun to die in the most horrible ways. This game is perma death, And you can die in an instant, But it's fun to close a door and open another. I'd give this game a solid 9/10. Of course, No game is perfect, There's some tedious menus that could be fixed, A lot less clicking to craft or switch turns, But that's one of my few and more notable complains. Here's a more simplistic list.\n\nPros:\nImmersive descriptions of post apocolyptic Detroit, or modern day depending on which side of the city you're on.\n\nIn depth medical system. You can get the runs from drinking dirty water, Or slowly die of infection from a stab wound.\n\nCombat is rather good, A lot of variety on what to do, Including talking, Taunting, Tripping, Hiding, Shooting, Poking with a sharp object, and more.\n\nMassive map. I have played my fair share, And have yet to see the whole world. Not to mention it is randomly generated with a wide variety of events.\n\nLoot. You can find everything. From ketchup packets to high caliber sniper rifles, To CDs and laptops. (That actually work!)\n\nAnimals and enemies. While there are a basic set of enemies, There's enough variety to give unique encounters and risk, From wild dogs to armored soldiers with machine guns.\n\nArmor system. You can wear masks to protect from disease such as mold or airborne viruses. You can wear coats to protect from the cold, Shirt, Pants/shorts too. You can sling your crowbar or rifle onto your back for carrying. You can put binoculars around your neck for easy access, Even left and right shoes, And so much more. Not to mention some of the amazing mods that add gloves and scarves and misc items into the game.\n\nVehicles. While, Understandably, There are no cars or trucks in the game without mods at the least, There are shopping carts, sleds, box carts, and such to carry even more valuables. This does however, Give you major speed debuffs. So haul carefully.\n\nCrafting. This game has a rather large array of crafting, From trapping to herbalism, To ranged weapons, to sharpening a spear or making a glass shank.\n\nStory. While the story is a bit basic, It gives that New Vegas vibe. There's an end goal, But it's not something you need to focus on. Of course, If you want to win you have to, But you're going to want to drink and eat a wee bit before you go on a crusade.\n\nCons:\n\nMenus. The menu system can be a bit finnicky, It involves a lot of tabs you have to manage to open things as you go. Thankfully, You kind of get used to it, And it's a turn based game so you don't have to worry for time.\n\nPunishment. While this may not seem like a negative to most, Not even to me, It is understandable that this game can be rather angering. One wrong move and you can lose hours of progress and have to start over. Make sure you know what you are getting yourself into before you buy. It's no casual game.\n\nEncounters. While some encounters are brilliantly crafted, There are a few that can be end game scenarios. Such as one, Which I will not give specifics, Where you must go investigate something or you can leave. If you investigate, it is an instant death, With no chance to save yourself. These events occur often, Even into late game, so do be careful for those as they can be the most punishing out of all aspects of the game.\n\nBalance. While I do believe this game has done amazingly well for the survival feel, I can't help but point out that it is extremely difficult to do without specific perks. Such as botany which allows you to forage for berries. I've always had a lot more difficulty not choosing botany, As you can go many turns without seeing so much as a can of soup or stale crackers. This isn't really a major issue though, As it's not game breaking.\n\nThat is all I have to say about this game, It's very very fun, I certainly suggest buying it if these pros and cons sound fair. If you disagree with anything I have to say, Feel free to comment. If you have questions, Feel free as well.

But this game has a large ammount of flaws\n\nPros: \nThe game has a lot of content and you can tell. Whether it be events, Uniqe locations and items there feels like a lot in the game and unlike most rouge likes it will take many playthroughs to really understand the mechanics. 22 hours in and i still feel like a beguiner when it comes down to things\n\nThe combat is brutal and fair and fast. Its simple and works really well but does take some imagination.\n\nThe medical system works wonders. Instead of looking at some health bar you need to manage everything from your imune system to blood loss and pain and more. Around half your deaths will just be from infections and water based dieses. \n\nReplayability is something ill bring up again but the game is quite replayable. The map is randomly generated to an extent (Uniqe locations spawn in the same spots but the map layout itself is random) \n\nThe game is pretty fair. Unlike some games you dont really have these rng dice role events. When you die it feels like it was your fault and your fuckup and you will find yourself saying \"well i wont do that nextime\" \nYou get infected, learn to purify water\nYou get shot in the chest and bleed out, Dont attack the DMC guards with a sauce pan\nYou starve to death, Resort to canibilism\nYour character starts to become a maniac and fears he will run out of human meat to eat, Just go back to normal food\n\nTheres plenty of mechanics to also keep things detailed. Spying and hiding to body heat and plenty of skills\nThe game is relativly balanced and it is quite adicting to gear up and have fun\nThe game will also not hold your hand and your basicly free the entire game\n\n\nCons:\nDeath sucks in this game. Unlike many other rouge likes theres not much of a progression system exept for personal knowlage and a few random skills. But the bigest killer is restarting\nYou will die tons of times and the game doesnt diffreneciate itself enough to render you really dont much diffrent run to run. Sure you will learn but it will turn to you going through the exact same motions many times of loot, fight, die over and over. You will almost always head to detroit then do whatever quest the hatter gives you and you will do this many times as you learn from experience what to do and not to do. It can make playing this game for long periods of time very frustrating.\n\nNPC's are a disapointment to me. Back in early access it was fine to have the \"Conversations\" be basicly a \"fuck off\" from every npc willing to talk and a crowbar to the face from the rest. There is basicly no interaction to be had with random npcs in the world. You can either\nKill them\nSurrender\nMake them surrender\nCease fire\nRun away\nOr talk. And talking usually is nothing but them saying \"i dont want to talk\" and walking off. There are no real conversations to be had and the few that you do have usually are very short and formulaic with no real branch off's and as you replay this game over and over again you will read the same things over and over again. Its just disapointing\n\nThe game may be fair but its also brutally hard. This is a pro and a con depending on the person but there are many times you will just die for shit that is almost unavoidable. You get infected with Blue rot because you accidently went 4 tiles in range on some random npc then see ya. Unless you know exactly how to get the one cure in the game through an event then your as good as dead.\n\nThe UI can just feel cluncy and weird at times. Like scavanging mutliple buildings sometimes requires you to go through 3-4 menus and sometimes will boot you out if you find nothing. It gets pretty annoying over time.\n\nDetroit is a disapointment in a lot of aspects. Its basicly 5 little buildings inside with little to do and a couple of shops and shit outside. Theres not much to do and not much to even talk about\n\nQuests and events are very scarce. You will usually just do the hatters quests but if you choose to go in some other direction the game is basicly just run around and survive till you go to detroit\n\n\n\n\nconclusion: the game is fun for 1-2 hour segments every few days or so but gets frustrating in long play throughs and can feel pointless at times. its a great airplane or trip game on a laptop and it is fun but dont expect some amazing rpg. This is basicly a combat symulator with some rng loot thrown in.", "timestamp_created": 1516403384, "timestamp_updated": 1516403384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553350", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39465209": {"recommendationid": "39465209", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975959439", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516392387}, "language": "english", "review": "Just one more turn!!!\nCould use a repair option for containers...", "timestamp_created": 1516388884, "timestamp_updated": 1516388884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39422609": {"recommendationid": "39422609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128651601", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518495406}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know why I bought this game, I don't remember it's been a while since I have it.\n\nBut trust me, I don't regret it one bit.\n\nGraphics don't make a game and this is a great exemple.

No. Does it need to be? No.\n\nWhat you get is an in-depth survival game set in a post-apocalytic Michigan, with added mythical/urban legends and light supernatural touches. It's a sandbox that you can play until your character dies, or you delete the save to start over, but it does indeed have an actual storyline that comes to a conclusion. It's rather difficult to complete the story as you need to balance survival as you do it, but it's there.\n\nThe game isn't easy, you can easily die within your first handful of turns if you don't know what your doing. The game starts you off in an encounter with one of the game's most dangerous enemies. You will have at least one (albeit very poor choice) option on how to handle this encounter, but picking certain traits before starting will open up new and better options for this and future encounters. However this feeds into the difficulty, taking combat orientated traits will make fights easier, but it probably won't help much with finding food, warm clothing and doesn't give much help with the storyline. Of course the opposite is true as well, some traits offer better survival aids, or open up easier routes through the storyline, they all offer an advantage, just not always the best one.\n\nOh and you're no longer going to die from hypothermia by turn four 90% of the time anymore.

This is one of the better ones in overall concept imo but unfortunately its also broken in many ways, and frustrating for the wrong reasons, not because of the difficulty but because of random nonsense, like why can't I light a torch with the lighter? Often you just get screwed right out of the gate, like getting chased all over the map 2 hexes in by a wraith that apparantly can't be battled, atleast not that early in the game, and you cant just end the game you have to go through sometimes dozens of interactions just trying to get them to kill when you're in a losing situation so you can start over. No explanations for anything as others have mentioned, you will spend hours just trying to figure out how to use the ui. Not nearly as bad as complete s#&t shows like \"the forest\" but still gets old fast when you're losing right off the bat for the wrong reasons.\n\nIf you're addicted to being frustrated then you will probably love this game.

The kind of darkness that hid all manner of terrible creatures that the mind could only imagine, and even some beyond that. It was the darkness of the void that came before the light and the firmament. \n\nDamascus wore it as a cloak around him. \n\nWhere other creatures hardly strayed far from the the light, his kind lived and even thrived without its warm touch. The light was as much of a stranger to him as the Yuctou Sea was to the lesser beasts of the Endless Desert. But he did not need the light to \u2018see\u2019. He observed all around him as he made his way through the forest by sound alone. He could hear ever chirp, every chitter, every rustle as the breeze blew through the trees. He could hear all manners of nocturnal creatures hunting their prey, just as he was.  \n\nHe moved his feet deftly as he made his way through the forest, his feet avoiding any branch to break and leaves to rustle as he silently made his way closer towards the road that cut through the woods, and towards his quarry. \n\nOdd, Damascus thought to himself as he caught sight of his prey. \n\nThe carriage had stopped in the road, surrounded by men with torches. From here he could hear their voices, geering and snickering. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple matter, gentlemen.\u201d said one of men, \u201cPay the toll, and we let you walk away with all your innards staying where they belong, otherwise...\u201d He was talking to the driver of the carriage who sat atop it, holding the reins of his horses , doing his best to keep them from panicking. The driver simply looked at the man, saying nothing. Brigands most likely Damascus thought. \n\n\u201cMaybe your ears don\u2019t work,\u201d he growled and began to speak louder, \u201cI sai-\u201d he was cut off as an arrow hit him in his chest. He sputtered and groaned as he fell to the ground. The other brigands around him didn\u2019t have time to panic before they too were taken out by more arrows flying through the air. Not one missed their mark. Not one arrow didn\u2019t result in a dead man. \n\nSeveral men dressed all in black, wearing bows and quivers on their backs, approached the carriage and knocked on the side. Damascus was surprised he hadn\u2019t noticed them before, but he knew his quarry wasn\u2019t going to travel alone. He was content as they hadn\u2019t noticed him either. \n\nHe was going to have to do this next part carefully, he thought to himself. He readied a stone into his sling, and starting to swing it, slowing picking up speed to make sure the sound didn\u2019t travel far.\n\nA portly man dressed in opulent clothes opened the door of the carriage and leaned out the side. \u201cIs that all of them?\u201d he asked one of the men in black. He nodded. \u201cGood work. I\u2019ll make sure your men receive a bonus once we reach Middlerei-\u201d He stopped for a moment when he noticed one of the men in black turn towards the woods. \n\n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d he asked. One of the men had noticed Damascus, staring right at him in the darkness as he swung the sling. There was an attempt to scramble for a bow, but it was too late. He sent the rock flying at tremendous speed, hitting the portly man between the eyes. He slumped forward and hit the ground with a loud thud. \n\nDamascus didn\u2019t have time to celebrate his kill, though, as the men in black started to fire arrows at him. They were well trained, and perhaps could see well in the dark, but the forest was too dark to keep track of his moving form for long as he weaved through trees and brambles with deftness no human could manage. Many arrows came close though, some too close. He had to dodge one at the last second after hearing it whistling through the air towards him. \n\nHe had ran a mile through the trees before he could no longer hear the men chasing after him, safe once again in the comforting darkness, for now... \n", "timestamp_created": 1513462974, "timestamp_updated": 1513462974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38313054": {"recommendationid": "38313054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405603533", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511406322}, "language": "english", "review": "Good but lacks content.

It's a punishing game, make no mistake. You will die, and often.

It's not a very intuitive system and you might have to turn to user guides to figure out how to even cook meat, because nothing is obvious and this game holds its mechanics like Gollum would the One Ring... the only difference being that this game isn't the one to rule them all. \n\nI don't mean to rag on the game. I'm impressed that there are people that can not only survive, but thrive- and enjoy themselves while they do so.

This game is pure luck, no strategies. I watched a youtube video and the guy got four backpacks in five turns, tons of tools and useful items. I played six times, died after two or three days each time, never found  a backpack-all I got were plastic bags that broke down after three turns and lost all of the accumulated supplies- rarely found any useful tools, never found any drinkable water.

Not for everyone, this devious mix of a Survival game and a Roguelike is incredibly brutal but it makes you feel GOOD when you manage to survive for more than two turns.\nIt makes you be constantly on the lookout- both at your own stats, for better equipment, and for enemies that can spell your doom but can also spell your next lunch.\n\nOverall, It's incredibly immersive, what little story exists is incredibly well-written, and I've never been so arelieved at  finding good shoes.\n8/10 would make a coat out of a dogman again.", "timestamp_created": 1507746932, "timestamp_updated": 1507746932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35641165": {"recommendationid": "35641165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110658674", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493586821}, "language": "english", "review": "NEO Scavenger definitely attracts a wide range of people, and that's one of its most charming aspects. First and foremost, the ultimate genre is survival, so people who like survival games such as Don't Starve or even This War of Mine, a less well-known title, will enjoy NEO greatly because it doesn't fall off this path at any point. There's a storyline no doubt, but it isn't the key focus of the game and I easily played it without paying attention to what my character's goals actually were. \n\nIt's a text-based game which, I must say, is well-scripted. There are few typos or grammatical errors that I've noted, and, although white text on a black background is bound to wear the eyes out after a long enough session, the words themselves are very readable and humorous at times.\n\nThe gameplay is easy, but you won't start the game with much success. You begin by choosing the skills of your character, from benefits like 'Medic' to flaws like 'Feeble'. By adding more flaws, you can choose more skills. This is often where you'll fall at the first hurdle. It takes a bit of trial and error to find your perfect set-up, which gives you a bit more value for your money, though I must say the amount of scenarios one can find is limited, or at least from my experience. Certain instances reoccur quite a lot, and it can be hard to overcome that skill curve. The game doesn't tell you how to play it. You really are trying to survive.\n\nIn summary, NEO Scavenger is a decent game. It offers a nostalgic layout with a challenging premise with many interesting concepts and mysteries to delve into (or not). If you want to play it well, an element of strategy is required. There are also battle sequences for Pokemon fans, which is average in nature, and depends wholly on the skills and 'luck' of your current character. NEO is repeatable, but there is a limit on how many hours you can put into it. For \u00a311, this is understandable, and it's an acceptable price, although waiting for a sale isn't a bad idea. \n\nIf you dislike losing, reading, repeating processes until perfection, playing a game without guidance, games without a lot of sound or mouse-based gameplay, it might be worth looking into another survival game, but, if not, NEO Scavenger is a solid purchase which you can play again and again without internet or a gaming computer.", "timestamp_created": 1507736891, "timestamp_updated": 1507736891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35639425": {"recommendationid": "35639425", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972436745", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507856656}, "language": "english", "review": "Years later, I still have great memories of this game.", "timestamp_created": 1507731765, "timestamp_updated": 1507731765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35597349": {"recommendationid": "35597349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119383738", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 20026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518408889}, "language": "english", "review": "Without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time, hope BBG is planning on making a sequel some day\n", "timestamp_created": 1507559723, "timestamp_updated": 1507559723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35575212": {"recommendationid": "35575212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013866773", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439428862}, "language": "english", "review": "The game itself is savage and unforgiving.

The demo is heavily front-loaded, and comes from an earlier version of the game. I was intrigued by the demo's promise - the Choose Your Own Adventure-style mechanics, the sneaking around crumbling ruins looking for supplies, the scary combat that made encounters tense and meaningful.\n\nHowever, this \"final\" version is a hot mess of a game that feels cheap and lazy in nearly all aspects of its design. It's flawed at the very core of its concept, and I can't recommend it at all. Bad/10, don't buy unless you like random coin tosses wiping your saves and making you start over.\n\nLong version (includes playable demo):\n\nIn fact, we can play the game right now, for free, in the space of this review. That's how shallow it is. Are you ready? Okay. I'm flipping a coin. Heads? Tails? Good choice, let's see: oh, you lose. Here we go. Heads? Tails? Interesting tactics. Okay - oh, you lose again. Heads? Tails? Oh, neat, have some random loot. But you also hurt yourself getting the loot. Also, dogs. 20 dogs. They eat you. Oh, well, actually, you can flip a coin to see if you can get away. You want to do that? Okay... oh. Darn. You lose after all.\n\nI'm not exaggerating. The game is almost entirely based on a flip of a virtual coin. Everything you do comes down to absolute random chance. Forget any notion of augmenting the luck of the draw with your virtual skillset - your skills themselves are nothing more than cards in a deck. You've got \"Strong.\" You're good at melee, right? \"Strong and Melee.\" Oh, too bad, your enemy drew \"Strong\" *and* \"Tough.\" Whoops. You're dead. Delete your, say, 20 hour save file and start over from scratch.\n\nThat's really the depth of this game's design. Make the wrong choice in a CYOA event? Dead, save file deleted. And some of this stuff is out-there random, too. It would be amusing if, like in the real thing (good old paper-back CYOA books), you could bookmark at least some of your progress and fix your mistake eventually, but nope - the whole game is based on stupid, abject luck killing you and forcing you to start over. Over and over and over again. In a game this flimsy-floozy, ironman needs to be an *option.* \"Hardcore\" is a distinction you earn by being good enough to rate as a consequence-based experience. This is not that. This is a dozen feral dogs appearing one after another at the whims of RNJesus to arbitrarily kill you for laughs.\n\nCombat is a death sentence if you don't take very specific traits. That is stupid. Even if you do take the token, all-but-required traits, it's still just a toss of a coin whether or not you get killed. There's no strategy. No planning. No real player input. It's all just stupid, basic numbers. It's the laziest type of junk non-game you can imagine. Think you're a maverick and you don't want to play as a Herculean beefcake? You want to try to get by on stealth, cunning, and guile? Maybe get some hits in with finesse? Forget it. Sneak up on a guy with Tough and the best you'll do with your crowbar is tickle his funny bone. He'll then Chris Redfield you, exploding your head with a single punch. If you try to use melee weapons, and you don't have the right traits, you're dead. The enemy will bump you, and you will fall apart. Combat against an enemy with Tough is functionally impossible if you are not similarly equipped - you could catch him completely by surprise, and it doesn't matter a whit.\n\nThe actions you can take are rarely based on logic or the flow of a fight, as you'd perceive it - instead, the game makes no bones about it, and literally tells you that they're randomly available to you. Sometimes you can attempt to dodge. Sometimes you can't. Sometimes you can attempt to kick a downed enemy. Sometimes you can't. And of course, any given action has a chance of failure, even after passing the \"can I even try it\" dice roll. It's just random chance on top of random chance. It's mindless.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with making combat meaningful and deadly - I'd love to see more games give the player reason to actually avoid looking at enemies like loot-and-XP-pinatas - but this isn't that. Enemy encounters are ridiculously random, and the player has scarce few tools to avoid it. More often than not, its Olympian sprinter dogs dodging a million attacks, causing your character to whine, cry, and generally give up on life the instant he's bitten or scratched.\n\nI'm reminded of Unreal World, another \"survival\" game I was fixated on for a long time. After going through hours upon hours of painstaking hunting, building, and gathering, arming and armoring myself against the elements and my enemies, I fell victim to a wretched combat system that just shrugged and said, \"meh, you lose.\" My character in that game was supposedly possessed of excellent skill with a blade. Despite this, I found myself staring in disbelief as my character flubbed every single strike, missed every attack, and ate every swing of a clumsy bandit's rusty handaxe as my only input as the player was \"try to attack again, or just give up on life.\" That's this game in a nutshell, only this game has added \"choices\" that can wipe your progress instantly. Naturally, that means this game is \"better,\" right?\n\nIt's a shame. People have been clamoring for real survival games for years, and this lazy schlocky junk is what we get. Amateurish garbage whose apparent mission in life is to cure us of that desire. It's nipping the genre at the bud, and that sucks.", "timestamp_created": 1505970015, "timestamp_updated": 1505970443, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519124", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35094670": {"recommendationid": "35094670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071315091", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 16279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517162676}, "language": "english", "review": "One of those great games that doesn't hold your hand.

I had actually followed this game for a while and finally got to play it today. I played for about an hour straight and my whole experience was the following : Make character, explore surrounding hexes of beginning campsite area, fail to find any items for 90% of scavenging explored hexes, attract unwanted attention indefinitely, proceed to either get mauled by feral dogs or have to surrender to some random jackass that, from what I understand, removes *at least* one item(including containers which actually takes the container plus all items inside it counting it as a single item) from your inventory(which, to add insult to injury, meant I lost my starting gown and was literally naked - no items at all). Rinse and repeat. No fun at all.\n\nIn fact, it's all because of RNG and the issue is the chance of success when performing actions. You start the game with essentially nothing. Following the first-time tutorial messages, you'll always scavenge the starting area to get a gown and, seemingly useless, shards of glass. Virtually every single start had me next to a small town with storage sheds and abandoned houses/mobile homes but the loot chance bar is at ~5% without any items to help you scavenge. The stealth bar was usually at around ~50% or ~75% without the hiding skill but was still constantly alerting enemies to my location(which then proceeded with me dying). Using the hiding skill reduces loot chance but increases stealth chance(even though I did alert enemies to position using the skill with it increasing it to ~90%). See the issue? Either stick with a very very low chance to get indefinitely useless loot in a spot I kept on spawning next to and alert enemies OR lower that alert chance but get no loot at all. I had *one* single \"lucky\" run in the 1 hour I played and it involved me getting a crowbar, which increases loot chance but lowers stealth. Well, guess, what, completely useless for me in that run because the areas I scavenged with the crowbar consistently resulted in injuries, no loot, and alerting various enemies, which is what ended that run because I quickly got beaten down by 3 dogs. This experience was the whole the 1-hour in, what, 10 runs? \n\nIt's not even like I'm bad at these types of games. I could do literally nothing about the starting of each run since gathering loot is initially very low, entirely run by RNG, and you start with nothing while also having odds of getting loot against you tenfold. I didn't even understand most of the menus because without certain starting-perks, certain stats are hidden against you(which I assume this includes combat too because I didn't see any combat stats like hit chance or item stats such as weapon damage, range, etc.).\n\nTo cut a long story short, it was a disappointing experience because it's yet another game(a rogue-like, too) that depends almost entirely on RNG while giving you no long-term benefits beyond death, meaning you're almost entirely playing against luck itself(and everyone already knows RNG/random number generator mechanics are bullshit. See : Darkest Dungeon) sort of like a gambling game where it's a win-lose 50-50 respectively. You go as far as you want risking it every single instance(e.g. every draw of a card or every individual action in this game), except in this game you get literally nothing if you die.\n\nI would've like it more if it didn't come off as so threatening and hardcore because, yes, a lot of roguelikes suffer from this issue. I still haven't gotten much out of FTL for exact reason, because the game starts off as very overwhelming and hardcore, and I got scared off by it. Same thing happened here.\n\nAlso, as a random aside since it doesn't fit into any of my ranting... Aside from the first couple tutorial messages, the game explained *nothing*. Even crafting was just weird, especially since the game presumably has crafting recipes that you have to find via scavenging. Oh boy... fun.\n\nIf anyone disagrees then I *dare* you to try and create a starting-the-game guide that doesn't essentially tell someone how to play the game, because if you can't then my thoughts will be pointed towards how linear the game would be in the end in terms of progression.", "timestamp_created": 1502427513, "timestamp_updated": 1502427513, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34148697": {"recommendationid": "34148697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089146886", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518435297}, "language": "english", "review": "Cruel, Unforgiving Masterpiece of a game\n", "timestamp_created": 1502377938, "timestamp_updated": 1502377938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656381", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34147267": {"recommendationid": "34147267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036532144", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512656673}, "language": "english", "review": "For when you want to play D&D but don't have friends.", "timestamp_created": 1502374028, "timestamp_updated": 1502374028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34135183": {"recommendationid": "34135183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037336760", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501121137}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't buy it here, get it for free on the android play store", "timestamp_created": 1502320813, "timestamp_updated": 1502320813, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.367005", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34120310": {"recommendationid": "34120310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021177279", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502257290}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the most nice survival simulation around, you will die and you will die often.... and then you'll die and die and die again until you die\n", "timestamp_created": 1502266682, "timestamp_updated": 1502266682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34084766": {"recommendationid": "34084766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279848929", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504406671}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like watching hours of game play suddenly and arbitrarily end, wiping away all progress you've made, this is the game for you!\nGame play can be fun.

I finally did and was ultimately disappointed\n\n    [*]The game is turned based which isn\u2019t where the game went wrong. Being turned based lets you think about actions and plan ahead while also giving lots of options in combat.\n\n    [*]This game is not meant to be what most people expect a survival game to be, where combat or mining resources is not the main gameplay loop. This again is not bad; it focuses more scavenging supplies and staying away from dangers, sounds good right?\n\n    [*]The game starts to fall apart when you play the beginning over and over not really learning from mistakes as it\u2019s really the RNG that will hurt you. Combat is stupid in the sense that a lot of the time you just encounter an enemy, no warning or true way to avoid enemies. You try to run, but it fails a lot. So you get hit and bleed to death. This isn\u2019t fun. I don\u2019t want to fight random enemies if I stay hidden and cover my tracks and won\u2019t let me run away even when I\u2019m athletic carrying nothing\n\n    [*]There are some games in this genre that do focus on a story(War of Mine) and some that don\u2019t(Zomboid). Neo Scavenger said it has a story. I didn\u2019t feel like it did. I didn\u2019t find much in the game. I do know looking it up that it\u2019s found through playing and not spoon fed to you. Some might like this, I didn\u2019t as looking on the wiki anyway seemed like the story was short, sparse and barely even enough to keep me playing. I just didn\u2019t find any reason to care about this world sense it felt so empty.\n\n    [*]Also having no real end to the game means that you real just play till you get bored, as you have no closure of escaping, sustainability, or actually surviving. I know it can be hard to do with the survival aspect as that might hurt replayability, but I think that is false. If the game is fun, you\u2019ll want to play it again and try something new\n\n    [*]Overall having a hardcore survival game experience dependent on the RNG nature can mean that no matter how good you are at the game, a bad roll can mean you die and have to start the same 30 minutes over getting boring fast. The story is so bare that it does nothing to give you a reason to continue playing and with no ending to the game and I have more games to play that will hook me; I\u2019ll pass for games with better survival mechanics.\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]D[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $4[/b]\n[b]Main reason for dislike:  replaying the beginning so much, no real end goal and RNG that hurts the vibe [/b]\n\nBetter games that are similar I recommend: \n[list]\n[*]This War of Mine (has an end, story and no zombies)\n[*]Project Zomboid(no story, zombies, no end atm)\n [*]Darkwood ( story, has an end)\n[*]Sunless Sea ( great world, and story, weak combat, no zombiest, has an end)\n[*]State of Decay 2 (might be cool)\n\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1501890299, "timestamp_updated": 1502028705, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586863", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34026088": {"recommendationid": "34026088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324746695", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508722978}, "language": "english", "review": "who said low graphics means a bad game, this game has killed many nights and weekends as harsh as a dogman killed all my ranged playthroughs", "timestamp_created": 1501888721, "timestamp_updated": 1501888721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34004935": {"recommendationid": "34004935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071126795", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500126539}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

You will die a lot, and you will die to pure randomness sometimes. Is the game bad? Hell no, it's a lot of fun. But if you're not prepared to put up with rogue-like bullshit-RNG at times, it will piss you off. \n\nIgnore [most of] the negative reviews that complain about dying or repetition and all that. These are people that either A) Got very mad and wrote it in the heat of the moment or B) Are just bad at understanding the concept of rogue-likes (Particularly that they are games where you die and you star over, and over and over, with many random elements). \n\nI realize calling negative reviewers 'upset' is in poor taste, and I don't mean to say the game is without flaws. But steams default \"Most helpful\" sorting shows almost half the reviews as being negative, and most are complaining about how 'hard' the game is. (Despite the overall score being 90% and, the recent score as of writing this is also 90% with 40 reviews). \n\nThe game is hard. No dobut. And you will be upset sometimes about dying. As the tldr says, there is a lot of RNG at times. Take a drink of water out of a weird lake? Well, you might die, you might be fine. Sometimes its your only option because loot RNG fucked you and you have no other potable drinking source. \n\nIt's definitely not for everyone, but the same can be said for any rogue-like. I mean imagine FTL, one of the most loved modern rogue-likes. Most of the criticism thrown at NEO Scavenger can be thrown at it as well. It's repetitive (especially after playing several hours in a row), it punishing at times, and the RNG can screw you hard at times. \n\nOne criticism I can sympathize with is that the beginning is repetitive. You start the game out the same way each time. In FTL you can have a wildly different playthrough from each start, but in here, it's the same location and series of events each time. To me, it's not a big deal, I don't find it boring, and it's at most 5-10 minutes before you already have a radically different playthrough. But when you first start playing, you'll probably play through the beginning a fair few times. (Although it's not as bad as it seems, as the beginning can play out a few different times, which will keep you entertained the first couple of deaths). \n\nThere are clunky parts to the game, and for one the art style isn't my favorite. It's pretty, but it looks like it's 10 years out of date to me. It looks like a point and click CRPG from several years ago. Maybe that's intentional, and it's mostly a personal niggle. The quality of the art is fine, but it's the style I am not overly fond of. \n\nBeyond that, there is a surprisng amount of depth here. There are tons of incredibly rare items, and you will fear for your life during most encounters. \n\nIt simulates a post apocalyptic scavenger situation fairly well (in the sci-fi sense, not some preppers training fantasy). \n\nI'm just disappointed by the amount of \"helpful\" reviews that are essentially the same negative reviews over and over. While they have good points, if you know and like what you're getting into, they're not negatives. \n\nBut be aware, it is punishing. The RNG in this one can be especially brutal. \n\nIf you like rogue-likes, especially challenging ones, this is the one for you. \n\nIf you're the kind of person to throw your controller at the wall when you lose at a game, you should probably stay away from this. \n\nTry the demo if you're apprehensive.", "timestamp_created": 1501633220, "timestamp_updated": 1501633318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33941446": {"recommendationid": "33941446", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996339738", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501647761}, "language": "english", "review": "Im a Original Kickstarter, the game is exelent!", "timestamp_created": 1501559411, "timestamp_updated": 1501559411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.345001", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33937910": {"recommendationid": "33937910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249015006", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509438184}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Brief introduction [/h1]\n\nI usually don't write reviews. To be honest, I don't at all. But this game, this marvelous fucking piece of game deserves 15 minutes of my non-precious time.\n\n[h1] Pros\t[/h1]\n\n - Realistic crafting: this game takes it to a whole new level. Want to craft a noise trap but you don't have pebbles? Don't worry, you can use lighters, AA batteries or anything that is small and heavy. Want to cook meat in a fire but you don't a stick? No problem, you can do it with a fucking crowbar, HECK, even with a fucking shotgun. The choices are infinite. You don't need the exact items to craft a recipe, you can always find a substitute that suits best your situation\n\n- Realistic diseases/poison/bleeding/freezing system: I won't discourse much on this one, since it's auto-explanatory.\n\n- Inventory management: This games takes it really serious too, whereas different types of items ocupy different sizes on your bag, but still taking account their weight, encumbering you even if your bag is not full.\n\n- The environment IS harsh: Even if you have rifles and shotguns, there's a big chance you can die if caught off guard, you will never find yourself in peace in this game\n\n- The skills/flaws system is so fucking good: Different skills have different impact on your choices through the game. SEVERELY.\n\n- Your choices DO matter: Never choose an option without thinking first, otherwise the world will punish you pretty bad.\n\n- The world is not centered on you: A lot of stuff happens on Neo Scavenger world, and much of it don't care about the player, pretty much like in a real dystopian world.\n\n- There's A LOT to discover in the game, there's A LOT of random encounters and A LOT of lore to unravel.\n\n- There's a lot of liberty on this game. You can join factions, act evil, act good, help people, kill people, be neutral. Your choice.\n\n[h1] The only con\t[/h1]\n\n[spoiler] Camp Grayling endings will make you mad as fuck [/spoiler]\n\nOVERALL, this games deserves a whooping 9.8/10, the best survival game I ever played in my entire fucking life.", "timestamp_created": 1501542431, "timestamp_updated": 1501542431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757610", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33935568": {"recommendationid": "33935568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093129005", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501866363}, "language": "english", "review": "This was one of the first games I ever bought on Steam, and it's still one of my favorites.

It is a true survivor game, that succeeds in making you feel accomplished by just surviving. You don't just find water or food that is ready to consume. You have to boil water to make it safe to drink, and cook food to prevent it from making you sick. You have to be extremely mindful of the weather and what you're wearing, as you can quickly die from freezing to death, or being wet. Even combat is extremely dangerous, where every threat can bring you down in the blink of an eye. Get shot in the head or heart by a pot shot? Doesn't matter if you're a pro soldier, you're dead. And then, even if you survive a battle, you can die from the infections of your wounds, internal hemorraging, etc. \n\nI should make this clear in that you're not taught anything for this game. There is no tutorial. Experimentation, common sense, and a bit of knowledge about the world can take you a long ways. For example, you're not told to clean bandages prior to dressing wounds to avoid infections. Fire can be used to harden sharpened wood to make them effective weapons. As well as the variety of methods needed to treat sicknesses you can incur on your journies, which are just as dangerous as the guys with guns. \n\nMake no mistake, you will die, many, horrible, deaths. This is not a game for those without patience and dedication. However, if you can deal with the pain of losing quite often, you will find that this game is quite fun. You are not a super soldier. You are not a prodigee of any kind. You're just some dude wearing nothing but a piece of cloth with an arm band.

Either you'll simply find no food while scavenging. Or you'll get an infection while scavenging. Or you'll get ambushed while scavenging. Or you'll get shot by another NPC survivor from several hundred meters away while being armed with as little as a multitool / knife. You'll die to starvation, you'll die to bleeding, you'll die to infection, you'll die to dehydration, you'll die in combat and even more often after successful combat due to injuries taken, you'll die to electrocution, you'll die falling down somewhere .... the list goes on and on.\n\nNEO Scavenger is absolutely brutal, lethal and frustrating, which makes it one of the most deadly roguelikes I have played recently. It does a lot of things right, but it is lacking in two key elements: Accessibility and fun. Sadly, NEO Scavenger is neither. Not due to a lack of presentation, but due to a lack of intuitive controls as well as descriptive tooltips. Every battle is massively lacking in information about status effects or success & failure of actions taken and even taking the actions themselves is resolved in an extremely unwieldy and bothersome manner by picking an action not from a list but from icons which resemlbe items within your squarish inventory, which have confusing icons and no descriptive tooltips whatsoever. NEO scavenger is not only a lot of trial and error, it also leaves the player completely in the dark regarding mechanics and the result of actions taken. More often than not my character died to injuries I wasn't even aware I had taken due to a lack of information during combat or during random events while scavenging.\n\nNEO Scavenger had a lot of potential, but the way it currently is and the way it will most likely remain indefinitely, I am unable to recommend it to anyone, not even die-hard roguelike fans.", "timestamp_created": 1500107599, "timestamp_updated": 1500107866, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514442", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33552546": {"recommendationid": "33552546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100935694", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498623971}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, this game is just your average turn-based zombie survival game.

It's brutally difficult, makes you have to think tactically and strategically. The devs have really put their heart and soul into this game, and you can tell by the in-depth gameplay. From wearing the same rags on your face you used to stop your bleeding, to wearing mismatched shoes on the wrong feet. There was a lot of time and research put into it, so undoubtedly the quality is there. \n\nNo AAA 3D game has been able to capture the helpess, lonesome, sometimes fearful feeling and atmosphere this game provides with the exception of FO3. You will die from black mold inhalation, starvation and dehydration, mauling, having your cranium caved in with a looter's boot and many other miserable deaths before you start to get a grip on the game. No matter how well you're doing for yourself it WILL throw you a curveball that 7/10 times you might not be able to hit. \n\nThe game consists of quite a bit of reading, but I assure you, when you do come across those scenarios, the writers for the game have a gift of making you feel like you ARE the character. Whether you're coming across ZomZom's and feel the sheer terror of the situation you're in, or coming across an eerie bumpkin living in an isotope mine, the written out scenarios are extremely captivating and engaging. And not to mention, EVERY choice you make will have a tremendous impact on how the playthrough pans out.\n\nOnto the combat, it's EPIC, and plays back into what I commented on above, the quality of writing. It will feel like you're battling for an eternity, constantly tripping on the poor terrain and having to choose whether to take a chance on getting up, or roll around dodging your attacker's next move. Chasing down scavengers through the woods as they desperately try to flee your relentless attacks. Or my personal favorite, fighting a evenly matched opponent when you both have nothing but your bare hands for lethal weapons. You will fight, you will fall, you WILL cough up blood, and sometimes you will yet again, get your head caved in after a long and tedious fight. \n\nAnyone, and I mean ANYONE who's a fan of post-apocalyptic games must add this to their collection. NEO Scavenger is living proof that you don't need good graphics to have a fun game. The things you can do in this game are practically endless. There is so much to do, and you have such little time. I'm STILL trying to survive longer than 6 days per playthrough. But the good thing is, you learn something new each playthrough. Whether that be how to play, or a new strategy that works.\n\nThere is no room for mistake, there is no room for impulsive decisions or recklessness. This game is everything a survival game should consist of, and then some!\n\nMy only complain is I've saved a few games to end off for the night, only to return to no saved game. Fullscreen mode is a lie once you unconciously hit escape to leave a screen like we're used to, and there were a few times I had to exit out and reload my save to fix a scavenging glitch (I would press 'E' to scavenge and nothing would happen even though I still had sufficient points left over for my turn).\n\n9/10 - Would hopelessly flee from a Merga Wraith only to run into a Dogman pack again.", "timestamp_created": 1498856626, "timestamp_updated": 1498857054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33004685": {"recommendationid": "33004685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244813534", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511355826}, "language": "english", "review": "The player is killed by The Beast of Hades Glade. 10/10 had no idea what just kill me.", "timestamp_created": 1498762158, "timestamp_updated": 1498762158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32999433": {"recommendationid": "32999433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033242742", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499006902}, "language": "english", "review": "I couldn't imagine I would like a game that looks like it was created in 1994.

There are three types of weapons in this game: melee, bows, and guns. melee is the most common and reliable weapon in this game since they're common and don't need ammo.  Bows are rare and arrows even more since you find most of your items and not craft them since your either don't have the right items or skill to craft or you don't know how to make it since crafting isn't that simple since you need the right tool skill and matrial to make anything and all the good stuff you want to make require skills you either don't have or items that are extremly rare. ok back to weapons guns, you are never gonna use a gun in this game since your are either gonna find ammo, if you're lucky, but no gun for it or if your even luckyer and find a gun but no ammo for it.\n\nduring your searching for items to keep you alive you gonna get hungry and thirsty so you better get some food or water.   \nso you find some water in your scavenging and you're pretty thirsty so you decide to drink it and you get sick and dye of chorlo a few hours later since 99% of all water you find that's not in a bottle are infected and also never eat the berries since you have 50-50 chance of them not posioning you and killing you because if you get sick you can't do anything to cure your self since you either don't have the medician to cure yourself or you don't know how to cure your self. the best chance you have at not dying of thrist is get a can or pot and a lighter, which is the best item in the game since it allows you to make fire to cook and steralize foor and water.\n\nwhile you explore you are bound to find somthing that wants you dead and you're forced into combat which can be summorized as this: no melee=dead, knocked to the floor=dead, wolfman=80-20 chance you maybe alive at the end.\nyou think with a game where text is your main mode of telling you if you are sick or dead in a few seconds but in combat the game only tells you if you hit or get hit not and you debuffs. it doesn't tell you if you get stun or if the bad guy gets stuned, which is all up to luck if you get stunned and die or if bad guy is stunned and you bash there head in and they don't move anymore.\n\nMy biggest problem with this game is how there little room to exprament with since you find out of the like 15 starting perks to choose from only 5 are viable and the flaws are too harmful to justify the little amount of point they give you.\nfor example strong is good because it gives you abonus to scavenging, medic is great since it tells you how much \"health\" you have, trapping for crafting anything with animals or mechanic for technology and late game stuff, and there is your average start since you all the other perks are worthless in comparison and those three take up like 12 or 13 out of the starter 15 points which leaves you room for like maybe 1 or 2 more perks which are pointless.\n\nok so if all this is very annoying and bad then why are you recommending this game?\n\nbecause it's fun when lady luck is on your side and you get the melee weapon and you bash a guys head in with it and eat him to state your food and water problem. it's fun when things go your way and stay that way until a wolf man comes in your sleep and kills you. it's fun not dying for more than two days.", "timestamp_created": 1498708165, "timestamp_updated": 1498708165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32966758": {"recommendationid": "32966758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057754998", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "last_played": 1520801601}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.

I just created a permeate save to remedy that issue during the final part, although permadeath DOES add to the excitement.\n\nNEO Scavenger's strength lies in worldbuilding and it's game mechanics. The combat gives you a plethora of options like kick, drag, roll etc. Nature can assist and endanger you but it mostly endangers you :D\n\nIf you enjoy learning to live off a barren earth and exploring, Neoscavenger is your game.\n\nCons:\nThe AI interaction in random encounters lacks depth unless it's combat. Complex diplomacy is not this game's strong suit. This game makes sure to keep you alone in this world. You also can't attack the societies.\n\nEven though lots of the locations are randomized, the same ones appear on every map, so replay value comes more in experimenting with the menu interface than trekking unknown lands.

Sure, it's not the most important part of the game, but the choice of tiles, buildings, etc. is waaaaaaaay to poor.\n\nSounds: 8/10\nActually pretty good. Keeps atmosphere. Ambient, dark elements accompany the game pretty good.\n\nGameplay: 5/10\nWell... good for the first few hours. \nRogue-like random map and loot, random encounters etc.\nThe problem is that it is yet another game which uses brutal RNG and player's death as an excuse for lack of any in depth mechanics and content.\nOnce you get a grasp of this title, you will realise that there is nothing to aim at, except for maybe very difficult base infiltration mission which is also an end game.\n\nYou see, this game has totally nothing to offer. \n- no skill progression\n- no character progression\n- no camp building\n- no real crafting\n- no loot variety\n- no enemies variety\n- no real missions and NPCs\n- no factions you can actually join in a meaningful way\n- not possible to start a gang of friendly NPCs and roam the land\n\nThere is simply nothing in terms of gameplay that after few initial deaths can hold you to this title. \nIt's all the same - walk around, kill mobs, loot corpses, scavenge, return to camp (now probably ransacked by NPCs.\nFetch wood, boil water, cook meat, repeat till you die of diarrhea or other plagues. \n\nYou can't, for example, raid some bunker or a military base and bar the entrance from the inside, thus being shielded from harm. You can't really upgrade it (there is room 17 in starting location, but I got a bug and it vanished, taking all the stuff with it). You can't start a farm or hydroponics at the camp. Can't make bullets.\n\nWith crafting limited as it is, with no solar panels to recharge all those laptops and batteries and stuff, you are either forced to buy technology from remaining megacity or live like a tribal. \n\nOnly you can't have a tribe because you cannot befriend any of the numberless horde of nameless NPCs.\n\nTherefore this game is only recommended either on sale or to a group of people who enjoy dying and starting over against whatever devilry RNG has conjured against a player this time.", "timestamp_created": 1497301811, "timestamp_updated": 1497301811, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.424306", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32360343": {"recommendationid": "32360343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062042799", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495892445}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0432\u0441\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443. \u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0443\u0442\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441 \u0432\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. \u0412 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430, \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0439, \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432.  \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e, \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1497255583, "timestamp_updated": 1497255583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588349", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32347378": {"recommendationid": "32347378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038947597", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497199624}, "language": "english", "review": "You wake up in a cryo-freezing facilty with no memory of who you are or why you're there.

Esco , la luce... davanti a me un mondo distrutto, vedo in lontananza delle macerie , ci vado e cerco di trovare qualcosa per coprirmi, ho freddo, la temperatura sta scendendo e la mia fame aumenta ora in ora dopo la criostasi, arrabatto quello che posso, creo delle specie di pantofole con degli stracci legati assieme e mi rintano nel primo casermone mezzo distrutto per passare la notte... molto freddo... troppo freddo... vorrei accendere un fuoco, ma con cosa?...\nGiorno 1: mi sono mosso all'alba, non ho dormito molto, traoppo freddo, troppi rumori, sono ancora scosso dalla criostasi e sono sicuro di iniziare ad avere principi di panico dopo che ho sentito qualcosa muoversi al piano di sotto di dove stavo... ho il battito alterato e un principio di congelamento...\nDecido di correre verso un altro cumulo di macerie, trovo degli indumenti, un paio di pantaloni usurati, un sacchetto di plastica e una chiave inglese, niente di che ma \u00e8 gia qualcosa rispetto a niente... in lontananza ho visto un tizio forse mi aiuter\u00e0, quindi decido di avvicinarmi... appena mi vede inizia a correre verso di me, impugnando una bottiglia rotta e nell altra mano ha una sorta di sacca, tento di parlargli, nessuna risposta, tento di avvertirlo minacciando, niente, si lancia verso me , accecato dalla brama di derubarmi? di uccidermi? di.... mangiarmi? \nNella lotta tento di schivarlo, pararlo, buttarlo a terra come posso... diamine sono un medico non un soldato, lo colpisco di fortuna con la chiave inglese, scappa...\nDiagnosi, una gamba lacerata dalla bottiglia, s'infetter\u00e0 se non la curo a dovere... bende, ma devono essere pulite non stracci... antibiotici, magari li avessi... solo cosi sarei sicuro di non morire per infezione... ho freddo... domani dovr\u00f2 cercare da bere qualcosa di potabile, la corsa, lo scontro mi hanno affaticato e assetato. \nDio se sei ancora in questa terra dimenticata, aiutami a resistere.\n\"\"\n\nEcco questo appena descritto \u00e8 solo la punta dell'iceberg del coinvolgimento che ho trovato nel giocare a questa avventura survival, come tutti i giochi ho dovuto imparare la logica che ci sta dietro e capire come sopravvivere al meglio, carpire informazioni, affinare le tecniche, sapere quando potrei farcela o quando non potrei, questo gioco non ha un settaggio di difficolt\u00e0, ma alcontempo ha una difficolt\u00e0 quasi reale e naturale degli eventi, alch\u00e8 crea una sorta di \"magia\" che ti coivolge davvero da dire \"C**** sto morendo di fame se non trovo qualcosa ... sono spacciato\" , in piu il fatto che \u00e8 un gioco settato Hardcore, ovvero hai solo \"1 vita\" , come dovrebbe essere , rende ancora tutto piu interessante.\n\n\n\nPro:  \n-Gioco molto leggero in Flash player non so se ce una versione tablet ma secondo me potrebbe girarci tranquillamente.\n-Meccaniche intuitive anche se non ho trovato un vero tutorial (esiste una wiki in inglese che aiuta molto per\u00f2)\n-Coivolgimento sonoro / ambientazione a livelli inaspettati rispetto al gioco\n-Longevit\u00e0 elevata grazie alla creazione del personaggio differente che ne aumenta o differisce la difficolt\u00e0\n-Ogni partita \u00e8 differente dalla precedente e pu\u00f2 sembrare migliore, ma esser la peggiore della vostra vita o vice versa.\n\n\nContro:\n-La grafica pur essendo settata volutamente in un certo modo forse poteva essere un po piu dettagliata \n-Non ci sono tantissime quest o punti di interesse (ma non credo sia nemmeno lo scopo dei programmatori riempire questo gioco di quest)\n-Ovvie limitazioni da piattaforma e da indi software game portano a pochi aggironamenti e sempre piu radi man a mano che il tempo passa (peccato) Non ho trovato mod o implementazioni esterne, ne traduzioni in italiano per via appunto del Flash che da quanto hanno detto i programmatori in una discussione \u00e8 limitante.\n\nAppunto:\nCredo che il fatto che non si possa salvare e ripartire dalla mossa precedente sia una scelta voluta e giusta, ma creare un flag per lascirare decidere al giocatore che tipo di esperienza vuole giocare o RI giocare o semplicemente cercare di andare avanti il piu possibile ricalcolando mosse potrebbe essere divertente (esiste in realt\u00e0 un modo di salvare, basta copiare ogni tanto un file flash del salvo da un altra parte e rimetterlo quando muori per \"riprovare\" )\n\n\nConcludendo :\nNeo Scavenger \u00e8 un gioco al pc, un libro da leggere e un film nelle vostre menti che scatena il coivolgimento.\ninaspettati esiti , loot casuali e scelte creano un caos ordinato che concluder\u00e0 la vostra storia sempre alla morte, ma ad ogni esito potrete dire \"ho osato troppo, sono stato sfortunato, oppure semplicemente ho fatto il meglio che ho potuto\"\n",

In the end, I'm going with a reluctant thumbs up, though I'd recommend waiting for a sale.\n\nNEO Scavenger is a post-apocalyptic roguelike survivalist game that is also often dubbed a hobo simulator. For good reason: you start the game waking up in a facility with nothing but a hospital gown, a wrist strap and a strange talisman. Once you start playing and get to look at your inventory screen, you will notice that you do not actually have any inventory space. This game does not give you an abstract bag to store your items in. You can carry whatever you carry around in your hand - if you want more, you will need to scavenge a cardboard box or a plastic shopping bag to carry your stuff in (the former you have to carry in your hand, the latter can be used as a backpack). If you are good enough at scavenging, you may eventually be able to find something better, such as a children's backpack - a legit travelling backpack is a luxury you'll have to search a lot for, and either way, even these backpacks will be extremely limiting, so you do have to carefully pick and choose what to carry with you. Eventually, you can get a much bigger inventory by finding an abandoned shopping cart or other similar vehicle you can lug your items around in, but that makes it harder to run away if you get into trouble (unless you ditch the cart and just run for your life).\n\nAnyway, there are strict inventory constraints and you also have to deal with rapid wear and tear on your equipment - some shoddy stuff (hand-crafted weapons, sandals) might fall apart after just a short period of use. You also have to deal with finding food and water - and beyond that, you have to make sure the food is edible, the water is not contaminated, and beyond that, to find a same place to sleep, to find a pair of shoes (that don't give you blisters when you walk in them), and to survive all the encounters out there. All this makes for a very gritty and tough survivalist game and this is actually the strong point of NEO Scavenger. The 'feel' is really good and the challenges of this game are rather unique - not many games have you struggle for basic necessities like this one. Death is permanent - no reloads.\n\nThere are three major weak points, though, which you should be aware of. One of them would not be enough to spoil the game, but the three of them together do, or at least get close to doing so... it is up to you to decide if they are big enough red flags for you.\n\nFirst: NEO Scavenger's survivalism is based around an extensive crafting system. You need to craft in order to ensure your water is not infected (drinking all the water you find makes things much harder, though it's actually possible to survive with the constant diarrhea and other illnesses you get from doing so if you are lucky enough), to light fires for warmth and cooking, to craft primitive weapons and more. The crafting system is quite cumbersome, though, which is a major problem when it is so necessary to use it. It is hard to get into at first, hard to understand all the different options you have, and the interface is a bit unwieldy in general.\n\nSecond: The developers originally started programming this game in Flash, which (according to their own admission, even) turned out to be a pretty bad idea, but they never rebuilt it in a more suitable environment. This means that the game has a few quirks and a few very nasty bugs. Saves seem to have a tendency to get corrupted every now and then, and while there is an autosave option, that introduces other problems in turn (I had my minimap data get wiped while autosave was on).\n\n[Note: apparently some autosave bugs were just recently fixed a few days after writing this review. So there's that.]\n\nThird: despite being a roguelike, this game lacks something most roguelikes have, which is extensive replayability. Unlike in most RLs, there is no leveling or character development - your guy doesn't get any stronger or weaker throughout the game (aside from illnesses/injuries and other temporary buffs/debuffs), so the progression in the game stems solely from you exploring newer areas and finding stronger enemies. There is also only one start (no races/classes, no different starting scenarios) so if you've completed the game once, you've seen it all... aside from any optional areas you might have missed the first time around. Further, quite a few of the challenges in the game don't even stem from poor scavenging strategy or combat - sometimes you just get a brief \"choose your own adventure\" segment where you have to click on various options and hope that you aren't instakilled. Common sense and caution can generally get you through these encounters, but still, this doesn't help replayability. Further, though it takes a while to learn how to survive early on, the game is not actually that hard later on once you're set and since it is easy to just run away from the majority of foes (plus there's little reason to fight them when you can't get XP or essential loot from them - you can get everything you need from just scavenging), you just need to learn what options to click (or not to click) in the choose-your-own-adventure segments and you know how to win.\n\nWell, NEO Scavenger is a good hobo simulator, but not a very good roguelike. So I guess that whether you should buy the game depends on whether you're looking for the former or the latter.

Limped back to base. Fought off a dog on the way. Boil up some clean rags, notice that my wounds have stopped bleeding. Shit this is going to hurt.\n\nTakes out an arrow, bandages (wow, I'll survive this!)\nTakes out another arrow, bandages (Damn right!)\nTakes out third arrow, everything goes fine! I'm going to live! Arrow in 'hand,' move cursor to place arrow on ground, click, not enough room to place. Game decides \"oops, gotta put this arrow somewhere, but there's no room on the ground...\"\n\nGame inserts arrow back into my gushing chest, slicing the pulmonary, kills me instantly.\n\nFucing...hell....\n\nAll because the game designers fucked up the item movement system. (FIX THIS!!!)\n\nSo yeah.\n\n\nOtherwise, it's a pretty fun game, just lacks on content. I know, shocking...but I believe this. The big problem is how do you survive? Once you figure this out...not much left to do. The main storyline is pretty short all things considered (and not really deep or logical when you really try to make sense of it) and there's not terribly many 'random'/'lesser' encounters to keep you busy along the way. None of the guys that walks around ever talks to you, they just try to kill you or run away. \n\nOverall the impression you are left with is that you are fighting a wave of death. This is really cool. But shallow after about 5 hours because everything is so in depth that you are left wondering, \"why isn't the human side of things as complex?\"\n\nThere should be people who are traders. There should be non-combat entities walking around on the map, trying to accomplish their own goals (secure a campsite like you...hunt deer or creatures for their faction). Desperates who are sort of lost, running away that you can interact with. You should be able to form a band of followers, be able to discuss their roles in your little band of survivors and start relationships etc... I feel like other games already do this but that people developing a game pick one main theme to go after then stop, instead of diversifying and branching out and growing.\n\nAt the moment there are some 'encounters' that happen randomly when you enter a square...and these are great!...but there aren't enough. This is sort of like a 'first step' towards humanizing the game.\n\nThere should be an alliance 'system,' so that if a guy with the 'trapper' skill settles down 20 hexes from you and makes that his base, you can go approach him, offer to trade, and develop a relationship. Now you can approach more freely etc...\n\nHere's another idea: Instead of adding human-centric 'content' in the form of side quests and dialogue trees, try and think of some ways you can mix it up. Be innovative. If you can add something that completely shocks people because they don't expect it from a video game, they'll love you forever and your game will be remembered.\n\nWhat I think is funny is that the devs tried to hook a story onto the game without any of the above 'humanization'. You get a thrill from uncovering the story but the SECOND you know what happens, you stop caring. The devs should hire some literacy major who just graduated and is working at BK (this would cost next to nothing) to take a look at their game and write some story in for them. Might even do it for free for the resume.\n\nSo my advice: \n1) Add some more 'systems' (like the allegience, like seriously expanded dialogue, like other NOT-PLAYER CENTERED characters etc.). Every system you add on top of what you've got will expand the scope, audience, and profit of the game geometrically.\n2) Hire someone who knows how to write a story and populate a world with characters. If you're going to end the story like you did (and hint at a sequel like you did), you need to have a reason for us to follow the guy we play as. For the audience to care, you need a good characterization and some intriguing humanization.

The menus are unintuitive and a bit of a mess to navigate effectively, but eventually it becomes more or less second nature. \n\nRemarkably detailed sprites represent everything in the game world, including your \"paper doll\" character avatar. There's really not much else to say about the graphics: it's not a super high tech 3D game. The screenshots should give an idea of how it will look like.\n\nOn the sound front, the effects are equally simple: crunchy footsteps when moving on the map, cracking and popping firewood when you get a campfire going. The little slurp sound when consuming water is especially satisfying when you're heavily dehydrated, even if it may only buy you some time in the end. Music is ominous when it does trigger.\n\nYou start the game by choosing your character's desired positive skills and negative traits - aside from Unstoppable and Elusive reputations and one surgery, you gain no more skills or traits throughout the game, so choose wisely what you'll stick with on your playthrough. Your character then wakes from a cryo pod, with an imposing and lethal dogman approaching his location. Your abilities and any found items can provide additional responses to encounters and combat, even some which may not be immediately apparent.\n\nOnce having escaped from or dealt with the dogman, you're pressured into finding means of regulating your temperature, quenching your hunger and thirst, and any other bodily ailments. Scavenging is a big part of the game, but even bigger is [b]smart[/b] scavenging. Moving on the map leaves trails, which get more intense if you decide to run, if you're suffering from certain ailments or if you're pure and simply bleeding. Searching for loot in promissing places is always a tradeoff between the chance of winning something, the risk of being stuck or hurt by collapsing structures, and of making a big enough racket that you get spotted.\n\nCombat is a difficult affair; it's less about striking with the biggest stick than it is about dancing around your enemy and exploiting any vulnerable states while covering your own flank, and exploiting the environment whenever possible. In general, fallen combat entities are at the greatest risk, as they can't do anything but crawl, roll dodge and get up. For a pleasant change from the norm, melee weapons have their own ranges: a crowbar will reach further than your own two fists. Firearms, of course, are even deadlier, but they use hard to find, expensive munition, and are cumbersome to store.\n\nOnce combat is resolved, the surviving party needs to tend to their wounds. A fairly in-depth medical system presents itself with bruises and cuts, which may bleed, and demand different types of care. Pain accumulates from multiple wounds or a couple severe ones, like crippled limbs, and too much pain will interfere negatively with all of your activities, culminating in passing out (usually a death sentence in combat). Blood loss remains a concern both in and outside of combat, as penalties to your physical prowess and temperature regulation pile up if you run low, but using dirty rags to bandage wounds is generally a bad idea. In the longer term, immune system strength determines how easily you're able to fight back against things like cholera and infected wounds. The standard survival needs appear too, and they, too, negatively affect your actions if you go too hungry, thirsty, tired, carry too much load, and are too hot/cold.\n\nThe game does seem to have an unintrusive overarching plotline, with the first player nudge appearing in the first night: the distant lights, promise and opportunities of the Detroit Mega City. Trudging through marshes and ruined suburbs and high rises, popping pills to keep the pain of fighting under control, setting noise makers when camping to stand a chance at catching trespassers before they do you in, going cannibalistic, random encounters with unfavourable actions and outcomes, are all just some of the things you'll face on your journey to survive in Michigan.\n\nWhile permadeath remains a staple of modern, indie survival games, it is a bit of a shame to lose the progress of a highly developed plotline to seemingly random deaths. I guess that's what makes this game that little bit more special than the droves of survival sandbox games coming out in recent years: a sense of purpose.\n\nIt is a good game with great replayability.

Be warned, there is a learning curve and a high difficulty level, enough that more casual gamers may be turned off, but if you can push through, you'll find a deep and fascinating game.", "timestamp_created": 1485537413, "timestamp_updated": 1485537551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29523948": {"recommendationid": "29523948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174943043", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515619609}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego de supervivencia muy bueno para my gusto solo espero que saque la traduccion del juego al espa\u00f1ol", "timestamp_created": 1485536258, "timestamp_updated": 1485536258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29509632": {"recommendationid": "29509632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049595373", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516564992}, "language": "english", "review": "The best scavenging of All Time", "timestamp_created": 1485466543, "timestamp_updated": 1485466543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435233", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29465122": {"recommendationid": "29465122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007502435", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485377417}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, if you like bullshit. I was in perfect condition, no wounds, full health, everything. Out of nowhere, I get \"Poison stage 2\" \"Sepsis\" \"Severe Abdominal Pain\". So I go to the hospital. Get \"Treatment for all sicknesses and Poisons\"(fucking nanorobots!). Painkillers. Anitbiotics.\nIt does nothing. \nAll of a sudden I get \"Blood loss\" (without wounds btw). \"You are getting colder\" AND \"you are suffering from heat exhaustion\"(at the same time lol). Bam, dead. Btw, this is WITH a trait that says: \"You have a strong immune system\".\n\nIn the Forum, I find a bunch of posts a la: \"Sepsis uncurable\" etc.\n\nSo yeah, lots of bullshit RNG. Like enemies RIGHT NEXT to you being able to escape, etc.\n\nLet's get into it.\n\nRight off the bat, this is a really amatureish game. It runs in Abobe FLASH PLAYER (lol). You can't take screenshots. If you click \"New game\", it doesn't even ask whether you want to delete your old save. It just deletes it instantly. So one misclick, and you're fucked.\n\nThe inventory system is really bad; just your basic grid inventory. There is an auto arrange function. But that's it. No logic. Can't flip items. Can't put items in your hoodie's pockets, if you have a coat over it. Got some wire? You can hang a crowbar over your shoulder! But not a spear.\nCrafting is stupidly tedious. You have to drag items into the screen, to even see what you can make. WHY? How about you just show us what we can make from all our items? Nope.\nRecipes are nothing but written instructions. Have fun scrolling through pages of text. Intuitiveness = 0.\n\nAlso, it's got the most basic quest system I have EVER seen in a game. IF you can get someone to talk to you, they give you one sentence, end of conversation. I say IF, because even if you hold someone at gunpoint, they won't talk to you. BUT you waste a turn, so now they can hit you in the face. And then escape. Seems legit.\n\nAlso, just a little PSA to all wannabe game desingers out there: Items do not BREAK so quickly in real life. This is a survival game TROPE, and it needs to die. It's stupid.\n\nSurvival Games \"survive\" on REALISM and LOGIC, and this game is just sub par in those regards.\n\nThe fact that there is no help/tutorial whatsoever doesn't help either... Dying of some bullshit is NOT \"experiencing\" or \"learning\". It just sucks. I refuse to play another mediocre survival game, while having to read the FUCKING wiki...\nThat's another fucking survival game trope. Gtfo!\n\nThat being said, the game CAN be fun at times, in the usual survival game fashion. But seeing as this BS is making me consider just stopping this game already, I think it warrants a \"thumbs down\"\nIf this was the first survival game ever, it would be ok. But survival games come a dime a dozen, since over a decade, so you should have the genre figured out by now. And being an \"Indie\", is not an excuse.\n\nVERDICT: Low production value survival game with BS RNG mechanics, lack of logic, and -occasionally- fun.\n\nBuy at your own risk. Don't expect a great game.\n\nUPDATE: Just died in a fight. I had a knife. It \"Scratched\" him. Guy hit my arm with the blunt end of a pistol. I passed out from \"unbearable pain\" (hahaha). Guy kept hitting me.

Every step forward could mean a miracle of a find or certain death. A good, solid play that requires strategy and good old fashioned luck.\n\n~\n\nNeo Scavenger uses a turn-based RPG system of gameplay that sees you move your character over a tabletop of hexagons, each tile representing something from ragged abndoned cities, wide open fields, and whatever else lay dormant in the wasteland.\n\nThe gameplay is challenging and is almost purely startegy and luck. You need to make do with whatever you can find, even when it's practically nothing. The skill comes in knowing what to do with what you have. Though the game doesn't neccesarily take it upon itself to point a few things out that could potentially save your life, you're going to need to experiment some with what options you have on screen. The user interface itself is a bit confusing at first but isn't terrible once you get the hang of it.\n\nThe visuals used are excellent and the pixel art for things like objects, enemies, and landmarks are all easily discernible from their sprites alone. Even your own player character will eventually start to look like a real bonafide survivor after not too long, the rag tag mashup of loot, weapons, and accesories included. Cut scenes use their own original art for each one.\n\nThe soundtrack adds a brooding atmosphere to the game, one fitting a world where everything is in tatters and nothing is new. Other than the soundtrack, sound effects mainly come from moving or using items. Not much else makes noise and their is no audible dialogue.\n\nAll in all, this is a great, solid game that anyone with a taste for survivng, scavenging, and strategising could get into.", "timestamp_created": 1484591593, "timestamp_updated": 1484591593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29279748": {"recommendationid": "29279748", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984305500", "num_games_owned": 776, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 37512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511573305}, "language": "english", "review": "love it, 459 hours of my life - gone", "timestamp_created": 1484503789, "timestamp_updated": 1484503789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29271124": {"recommendationid": "29271124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058955350", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484417238}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just great survival experience, if you get past the graphics it's the most realistic survival game I've played.\nHighly recomend it.", "timestamp_created": 1484481977, "timestamp_updated": 1484481977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29237450": {"recommendationid": "29237450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042113623", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 11227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510588601}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the first games i got on steam, and hands down the best survival game ive gotten - rivaled only by The Long Dark.

Period. End of story.\n\nI do not understand the modern trend of making these rogue-type games with no difficulty slider. (Teleglitch, I am looking at you.) I mean, you make a game to garner profits, then make that game so hard that only die-hards will even bother to buy it, and that is somehow the new model? Why not make the game approachable to a lot more people by having a difficulty slider, and then special achievements for those brave enough to try the hardest settings?\n\nFar Cry Primal, for example: It has an easy setting that a 3-year-old can play, but it also has a very very very difficult survivor expert mode that 99.9% of players will never even play, let alone beat. Often, with games like Far Cry and Metro and Fallout, I beat it on an easy setting first, then go back for punishment later. I get a lot of hours out of these games, and the key: they are FUN. I mean, I am not necessarily asking for excessive hand-holding like the quest indicators in Skyrim, but just asking for a decent save system and a difficulty slider.\n\nGames like Teleglitch and NEO Scavenger are absolutely terrible for the elitist attitudes they promote. Those games have nothing to do with FUN and everything to do with hollow acomplishments few people can even relate to. So why am I angry or even bothering? I am bothering because other than the difficulty levels, these games are interesting and COULD BE a lot of fun.\n\nConsider the absurdity of Teleglitch. That game advertises hundreds of custom guns, but guess what? 99% of those guns you will never find or even get to shoot on this side of 1000 hours of play due solely to the difficulty of the game. I just do not think that is cool. For this nightmare, NEO Scavenger, I have put in quite a few hours, and I have never even found a gun. Ever. Never won a fight. Ever. I fixed the HVAC heater, fixed the electricity, found sleeping and mummy bags, found shopping carts, and really that is about it, and I always always always died for stupid reasons that in real life would never happen. \n\nSo sad that the difference between a no-star review and a 5-star review is the simple addition of a difficulty slider and custom achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1484262273, "timestamp_updated": 1484262273, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459295", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29207632": {"recommendationid": "29207632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132718305", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519508812}, "language": "italian", "review": "un survival  apocalittico rpg molto bello, purtoppo non c'\u00e8 la lingua in italiano e il testo \u00e8 molto difficile da comprendere anche nei combattimenti, cmq rimane il migliore nel suo genere \n\nvoto 9", "timestamp_created": 1484242651, "timestamp_updated": 1484242651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29202323": {"recommendationid": "29202323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148685021", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501461173}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u660e\u660e\u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6211\u597d\u53cb\u90fd\u7528\u5b83\u6765\u559c+1\n\u4ea4\u6d41\u7fa4223678545", "timestamp_created": 1484225282, "timestamp_updated": 1484274527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497942", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29201162": {"recommendationid": "29201162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011121307", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484753889}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0433\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0438 \u0432\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044c. \n\u041d\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e ~150-200 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0432. \n\n\u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0442\u044b \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0433, \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e, \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0444\u0430\u043d \u0441 \u0434\u043c\u0441 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0442.\u043f \u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438.

I can see it a few miles off in the distance... and I can't do anything about it... I might as well keep pushing along and hope I can hide when it catches up.\" That kind of horror.\n\nThe music does a great job of adding to this atmosphere as well. Good music is hard to come by in games these days. Usually you find bland formless soundtracks, or stuff that just \"gets the job done\", but in Neo-Scavenger the music is an essential part of the experience.\n\nThis is a very good adventure game with unique gameplay and a very original setting.", "timestamp_created": 1483758203, "timestamp_updated": 1483758203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29059215": {"recommendationid": "29059215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046556564", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483764760}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me just say this at the outset: even though I've put more than 50 hours into NEO Scavenger, I still haven't beaten the game. Not because it's dense (it is), not because it requires you to wrestle with brutal RNG (it does), and not because it can kill you whenever it darn well pleases even after hours of scavenging and gearing up (it can--and it will). I haven't beaten this game simply because I haven't felt the need.\n\nThere is a story here: after picking your traits (ranging from combat and technical expertise to wilderness lore) and weaknesses (like nearsightedness and physical fragility) you wake up in a cryogenic facility in a world struck by a mysterious apocalypse. At first you have nothing but your name, a hospital gown, and a mysterious amulet. But with a lot of scavenging and a lot more luck, you can find and craft the gear necessary to fend off the raiders, disease-ridden cultists, and horrifying creatures that roam the wilds as you search for your identity and uncover the secrets of the world.\n\nThe game is broken up into two sections: the hex-based overworld and text-based encounters. On the overworld, you move from hex to hex to get from Point A to Point B, stopping at urban hexes to scavenge for items and wilderness hexes to scavenge/hunt for food. When you enter the same hex as an NPC, you initiate an encounter in which you can choose to offer a ceasefire and go your separate ways, or engage in combat (the more likely event). Scavenging, combat, and most story events are presented in a choose-your-own-adventure-style: the situation is explained to you in detail and you can decide from a number of options (others being open or closed to you depending on your traits and equipment). Most choices you make are basically dice rolls. In combat, for example, dodging and attacking requires you to roll your luck against your opponent. Actions that are unlocked by specific traits or items (for example, luring an enemy into a trap with your trapping skill) are always successful. \n\nBut because of the nature of the game, it doesn't always matter how careful and prepared you are: you can and will be one-shotted by powerful enemies. Even average enemies can kill you if they sneak up on you in your sleep, or get lucky with a good strike, or if you fall during combat and can't manage to get up. And if you die, that's it. You have to start from the beginning.\n\nSo with that said, if you get this game and want to beat it, prepare to be frustrated. Prepare to lose a lot of important rolls. Prepare to get a game over based on trial and error in which a single choice leads to your death without any warning or indication beforehand. And if none of these things bother you, then prepare for a lot of reading and a lot of experimentation just to find out how to craft a decent starting weapon or light a fire.\n\nIf, however, you're like me and don't care about finishing the game, then you will find a surprisingly satisfying survival simulation with brutal combat and a crafting system that will make you feel like a genius. It's perfectly possible to ignore the main quest, set up camp somewhere, and live day by day off the land and your luck. In fact, I'd suggest you do this for your first few playthroughs--even if you ultimately want to beat the game--because you'll learn what works and what doesn't.\n\nHere's the bottom line: NEO Scavenger is a dense game that doesn't have much in the way of flash. But it's got a lot of depth and surprising complexity. It's a game that relies a lot on luck; you can fight and kill a giant man-wolf-beast with a spear, then die the next day because of some bad water. But this can be mitigated to some extent by knowledge, which you will only gain from playing--and dying--a lot.", "timestamp_created": 1483707142, "timestamp_updated": 1483707142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29053019": {"recommendationid": "29053019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105669406", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506564053}, "language": "english", "review": "Man do I love simulating the life of a homeless man, lapping at puddles on the ground for hydration, beating people to death for a left shoe, mind you for your right foot.

Brutal and unforgiving though it is is does manage that rarest of feats in providing an emergent story. The moment you get cocky you're toast. Complaints against the RNG element are not without basis, but then survival is like that. I'm not a massive rogue-like fan and would usually prefer the ability to save, but I realised this game had something special when I died after a 6 hour solid playthrough and smiled rather than rage-quit. The graphics are abysmal, the menus somewhat clunky and I come from an era that had to live through low res graphics and don't find them charming and rretro. But never has a game drawn so heavily on the imagination, and never have I experienced a game that manages to bring a crappy low res hex to life.\n\nThe combat is what sets it apart from Project Zomboid, apart from the deep joy of not having to deal with ***king zombies. Whilst somewhat barebones it does make you very careful about how you go about it. In addition there doesn't come a time when easy mobs are trivial bore to swat away. That feral dog can still trouble an unfortunate or over-confident veteran. Every encounter has the potential to send you into a downward spiral if not handled with care.\n\nThe luck cuts both ways, I had a very fortunate shot with a sling that set me up nicely with very useful loot, which I lost because I thought it made me king of the hill. \n\nIn short if you really want a zombie free realistic survival experience and you have the imagination to paint the picture in your mind rather than have it rendered in technicolor for yo,u then this game is a must buy.

Expect it and enjoy the ride.\n[*] Until you get some experience with the game, I recommend stacking your skills to how you want to play then branch off and try other skills later.\n[i]i.e. If you prefer to avoid combat, take hiding, athletics (running away) and tracking (seeing where others are/have been).[/i]\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Long:[/u][/b]\nI wanted to first address some of the issues presented in the couple negative reviews I saw in the hopes that it presents some additional perspective.\n[olist]\n[*] \"It's too hard\" -> Grow up. You can't (and shouldn't) expect to win a game on your first time out. There's a learning curve. It's a fantastic addition to the game.\n[*] \"The Interface\" -> It is different, yes. It can be difficult sometimes, yes. But every game out there has a different UI from one another. Just takes some getting used to.\n[*] \"Too random\" -> Honestly, I think this makes each time you play so wonderfully different than the last ... But for a large amount of the random items you get an indication of how things will go. What items will you get? What enemies? Will you find food or starve?  There's dice rolls involved, and sometimes it sucks. A lot. (After saving to buy a really expensive item, only to die just outside the city to a creature type I had defeated several times in the past... I was so angry. It even managed to stop me from playing ... for like a day. Then it was a 'how can I do this better' situation.) Sometimes sh*t happens, we just have to pick up and keep going.\n[*] \"Permadeath\" -> ?? ... It's a SURVIVAL game ... If there was no permadeath, then there would be no survival! If dying means nothing, then surviving means nothing...\n[*] \"Save game system\" -> Yep, it's flash. Yes, it can get wiped if you clear your web files. Yes, it can't save if you have flash blocked. It's not perfect, but it's how this particular game was made. Over 100 hours played (plus 10 or so on the demo before I purchased it), and I have not had any issue with losing a saved game.\n[*] \"Poor graphics\" -> Ok. Yes, it's not the out-of-this-world 3D modeled everything that make for pretty cutscenes, but I don't think the graphics detract from the gameplay experience. Look at it one of two ways: It's charmingly retro, OR It's a post-apocalyptic game where civilization has collapsed and tech is very limited so this was what could be produced ;)\n[*] Some info lacking -> Not in the reviews I saw, but definitely an issue I had with the game. Additional info about certain items should be available from NPCs at least. I can understand the character not instantly knowing all the information about a particular item (weapon for instance), but a guard probably should or a shopkeep. Why can't I ask them so I don't have to guess it's effective range or drawbacks?\n[/olist]\nI think those were the main things that caught my eye. Now on to the good stuff!\n\nI wish under \"Do you recommend this game?\" there was an option for \"Abso-freaking-lutely!\"\nI love this game. I'm not even sure I could explain exactly why. But I do.\nIt's single player only, but my friends and I have mused at how this could work multi-player. (We have no clue.) But for now, it's entertaining to narrate little stories about our adventures while we play. (One friend [spoiler]turned to cannibalism[/spoiler]... oh the stories with those playthroughs...)\n[list]\n[*] There is lots of... -> There's lots of items. There's lots of ways to use items. There's lots of status effects. There's lots of ways to die. There's lots of ways to live. There's lots of area to explore. There's lots of places to scavenge. There's lots of pockets and bags. There's lots of ways to interact.\n[*] Common sense is useful... -> Drinking dirty water might make you sick. Eating rotten food will very probably make you sick. A sling's effective range isn't as far as a rifle's. A meat cleaver will hurt more than a fist. Freezing is bad. [spoiler]Wearing a left shoe on my right foot will give me blisters[/spoiler]. [spoiler]A tree provides a better hiding spot than bare, open ground[/spoiler]. Etc...  \n[*] Living is hard... -> This is no piece of cake. Nor should it be. Surviving in a post-apocalyptic world on your own with nothing but a hospital gown would be VERY difficult, if not impossible, for most. NEO Scavenger brings this reality to us with rng, some punishing encounters and permadeath. The better suited you are for battle, the better you will do, but victory is never guaranteed. \n[*] That's not how it went last time... -> Ah, good old RNG. Always remembered for being infuriating and not for the times you should have died, but didn't. Just as places, items, scavenge results, etc... are random, so are the creatures/NPCs. Their stats can vary from one to another even if they are the same type (although the same types will have a range for stats). It keeps the game varied as you really don't know if that creature will attack viciously or run after a few wounds.\n[*] What happens next... -> The story and writing are quite enjoyable. Drawing you in and making you want to keep coming back and progress to find out what's going to happen. There's the occassional, \"wtf did that just say?\" But overall, it's a definite pro.

As an artistic experience, it succeeds, but not in a way that makes for a playable video game.  The bottom line, however, is that you almost certainly should not play it.\n\nThe writing is excellent, and not just by video game standards.  The dev could write good sci-fi fiction.\n\nThe game has permadeath.  The core game loop is good, but clunky.  Progress is punishing.  It takes 10 real life minutes to make a bunch of arrows, which aren't particularly effective, but they're what you get.  I recommend the sling.  Even taking all precautions, you can die instantly because a dogman or blue frog pops up at close proximity or in your sleep and kills you in one round.  You realize that there's nothing you could have done, and often there's nothing you can learn from to prevent it in the future.  \n\nBecause getting a character into survival state, which allows exploring the story, takes several hours, the clunkiness becomes an insane ping-pong of clicks (left screen, right screen, ten ping-pong clicks to sleep; seven to scavenge a single building; repeat until you die or quit, then repeat some more).  I view this as an artistic statement about life that, like the sudden and unpreventable deaths, cannot be understood until wearily experienced.\n\nThe problem is that the game breaks into choose-your-own-adventure encounters that are both the reason to play the game and what breaks it.  A majority of the options in these encounters will instantly end your game.  Single encounters will have branching choices, the majority of which will end your game.  They cannot be predicted.  Because of their branching nature and the immense real life time to get to the point where you see them, you cannot realistically finish the game.  Further, the game hard-limits your exploration; you get X number of choices, then time's up.  The internet is full of gnashing and wailing, true believers who spent over 100 hours on the game begging the dev to release the text files of the end-game, which he basically did by telling people what to search for in the XML files.\n\nIf you do buy it, some guy made a batch file that acts as a save-game manager.

Playing it, you really get the impression that the experience of surviving (or not surviving, probably) in a post-apocalyptic future would be this difficult. I recommend it with a few warnings:\n\n- It's a Flash game. That fact annoyed me for some reason when I learned it. Probably because there's no animation and it feels kind of \"cheap.\" It creates the impression of a big, hex-based board game. Also, I'm not sure if it's because of the Flash-based game engine, but I lost all of my \"map\" progress when the game failed to save properly once.\n\n- The pixelated, retro-style graphics work, but they don't cover up the fact that the game is rather ugly--and not because of the apocalyptic setting.\n\n- There is some groan-inducing writing. Most of the writing is nice, though. It's not anything that detracts from the experience.\n\n- The game is random to a fault sometimes. You're going to come across things that can instantly kill you. Or they'll come across you while you're sleeping. It's not fun to lose hours of progress when a thug caves in your head with a monkey wrench because you picked a poor campsite...or RNGesus didn't give you his blessing.\n\n- Despite the game's randnomness, certain events never change. When you die, you're going to have to redo certain key events to be able to have a decent chance of advancing to the real progression. This can become monotonous after a few new games.\n\n- There are no save slots. This is unconditionally an ironman-mode game.

The basic premise is promising - post-apocalyptic survivor wakes up with nothing and is left to fend for themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, you are totally at the mercy of the RNG in this game, meaning that one bad result = game over. Given how almost all mechanics apart from crafting in the game are RNG-based, that means a lot of die rolls and a lot of potential for that one unlucky roll to come up. This is particularly evident in combat, where one lucky roll/critical hit means game over. You can mitigate this somewhat by trying to avoid combat. But you will not be entirely able to avoid combat and retreating is, you guessed it, RNG-based. \n\nNow of course, RNG-based games always feature bad luck - it's what the R stands for after all. What separates the wheat from the chaff (and where NEO Scavenger desperately falls short) is whether you can recover from \"bad luck\", i.e. to what extent you are at the mercy of factors outside of your control. Good games always give the player a sense of control over their own destiny \u2013 even if the RNG is brutal. When I play something like nethack and die, I normally think, \"had I done XYZ differently, I might have survived \". \n\nNEO Scavenger is far too unforgiving in this respect. A single hit can one-shot you. An unlucky stumble in combat can mean game over. However much you can hedge your bets, the nature of a RNG means that at some point you [i]will[/i] be unlucky. When I die in NEO Scavenger I think, \u201chad the RNG been kinder, I might have survived\u201d. That's a bad sign.\n\nThis is a real shame, because the combat in itself is interesting and tactical enough to be engaging initially. But a few games in, and combat no longer interests me. Why not just throw a die at the start and see if I get one-shotted and save me the hassle of trying to be tactical/retreat? This sums up my core problem with NEO Scavenger: it feels like the game is a single dice throw that simply determines how and when you will die; not whether you will die. And that's why it\u2019s not fun.\n\nOther ways to die include dying of hypothermia (= the RNG didn\u2019t spawn enough clothes in the first ~10 turns), infected wounds (=the RNG didn\u2019t spawn a fire-proof canister for boiling water; or alcohol) etc. It\u2019s essentially a glorified version of Snakes & Ladders or Ludo, games determined purely by luck of the dice. \n\nThere are a number of other obvious flaws that would be forgivable if the game itself was fun: Flash is a terrible choice of platform, there are several bugs still in the game (e.g. the act of changing, not wearing, footwear gives you blisters; visual glitches) and the interface (particularly crafting) is clunky to say the least.

Some games are good, because you remember the time you met that NPC that you felt engaged, and connected too, and of how believable they were, and because of the epic landscape that makes you feel like you were living an alternate reality then a program installed onto your computer. And then there are some that have unecesary and game breaking mechanics that is more of a nusciance and a story that fells like it was put together with no thought and imagination making the experience into an endurance test. so where does Neo scavenger come in, it is a role playing, post apocalyptic survival game with a top down perspective on a map that closly resembles to a board game. The game in my opinion is one of the most emmersive games i have played for awhile and i have considerably played enough to know the positives and negatives and heres why:\n\n[u]positives[/u]\nif you watched the trailer of the game, you would have noticed that it has still images and is text based, thats because it is. It is a turn based game simmilar to the rpg genre but unlike most turn based rpgs, your actions are in sync with the npcs. whenever you talk to someone in a confrontation you could be at risk at being shot with a range weapon because, when were about to talk, that person blasted your head off because it was their intention. you can sneak up to npcs and kill them but the problem is that you dont know who your sneaking up to. you could end up killing a harmless scavenger then a raider makeing confrontations even harder. the game does a great job at making confrontations meaningful and difficult to handle without felling cheap and half fasted.\n\nyou woundering what the story is about like what most games have, well NEO scavenger has a story which is unique and enagaging. The world has many factions that has changed the world in their own ways, but it more happens in the background and what you do have little to no affect on them. Because you cant be a force of nature saviour or villian, it is because you are human. You do not have any special superhuman skills that games secretly slip into your character and instead make random events and point of locations intense. you instead have to think through things because if you don't your going to die, alot. Did i mention that when you die, you die for good and that you have to restart the game. This is the level of detail simmilar to darksouls, only more soulcrushing as the world is belevable and you are quickly reminded your human because you tried to play hero against a healthy dogman.\n\nThe survival mechanic has been thrown around recently in alot of indie games because game developers impiment this, but end up copy pasting and being bland because they forgot what makes survival fun. The developers have managed to make the survival genre good in their game as it makes you feel like your recovering from wounds and actually hunting and cooking food. Whenever you attempt to patch yourself up or feed yourself you have to do it manually and organically, you have to think whats right and wrong theres no indicator except for the multiple bars on the right that can be summed up as your health bar. Even fighting feels visceral and brutal. The game uses text to explain what part of the body you hit on an npc and that npc can be   also knocked out through pain (the same can happen to you).\n\n[u]negatives[/u]\nThe game has its annoying nitpics that i have witnessed throughout the game like, why do i have an imaginary pocket for my cash and, why can i reload my gun and patch myself up in ONE TURN like im the flash (whenever you acsess your inventory the npc can now have a prolonged turn because you were busy BUT ONLY THIS as you can manage your inventory for as long as you want and the npc can't do anything about it). There are the problems with the limitations of the flash engine as sometimes your save file could be deleted (this only happened to me twice).\n\nskills can be a mixed bag. You can be a tough, melee botanist but end up dying because you didnt have the athletic attribute that can help you outrun the dogman or a feble, frail survivor thats good at hacking, electronics, mechanics with eagle eye and tracking but died to a good punch to the face from a raider skilled in melee. I managed to stop this with a mod called big bad cheater which give you a defect called mega human that gives you all the traits and still make you feel human without turning you into a god. Go to the blue bottle site and search it up, instaling is dificult so go to youtube to get help.\n\n[u]conclusion[/u]\nI remeber having fond moments with i fight i had with a crazed, infected man with a loaded bow, got shot, pulled the arrows out which caused him to beg for mercy after what he witnessed, and killing him with multiple hatchet blows because he would have killed someone or infected them with a disease simmilar to the plague (the hatchet is not in the game it is a mod called Mighty Mini Mod of Doom which adds more equipment and an extended story line. It also works with Big bad cheater, i highly reccomend it). Neo scavenger is a game that may not be for everyone so in summary do you want:\n\n*be emmersed in a believable world\n\n*feel more of a human than a walking tank\n\n*get into fights with bloody detail, simmilar to manhunt\n\n*organicly complete tasks and naturally survive with a permadeath system\n\n*actually care about your actions\n\nif this interests you, buy it you will never experience anything like this. The developers have done a great job at making a game true to their genre and i hope that they make games in the future with this much thought and imagination put into them like this simply made but absorbing game.", "timestamp_created": 1479964029, "timestamp_updated": 1483439097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557247", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27024385": {"recommendationid": "27024385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010007021", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481424951}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth the money, especially during the frequent sales.", "timestamp_created": 1479962779, "timestamp_updated": 1479962779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26959975": {"recommendationid": "26959975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087199187", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 16913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488089181}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is p good even though i dont have a ton of time in it", "timestamp_created": 1479947092, "timestamp_updated": 1479947092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26955936": {"recommendationid": "26955936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007214556", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 3302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512405966}, "language": "german", "review": "bestes Survival-Crafting game was ich bis jetzt gezockt hab", "timestamp_created": 1479946202, "timestamp_updated": 1479946202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26953531": {"recommendationid": "26953531", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962397513", "num_games_owned": 1218, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479945564}, "language": "english", "review": "I have nominated this game for The \u201cI Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award\u201d Award.

It is sorta RPG because despite having almost no character progression to it you'll pick up a bunch of traits at the start and both skill checks and inventory management will be paramount to your survival, and sorta tabletop because you'll move across hexes using said abilities and items to gather, fight and resolve the situations you'll find yourself in.\n\nThe graphics are reminiscent of the DOS games of the early 90s and the sound design is minimalistic but effective.The player model will reflect equipment changes and every item has it's own art, and hexes have varied art that will let you know what to expect from each. Everything is functional, but the real star of NEO scavenger is it's gameplay and game design, and its biggest make or break factor.\n\nThe most important part of the game is undoubtedly the RNG, since it dictates how successful you'll be when scavenging, what you'll get, how combat will go, or whether you'll catch one of the many incredibly deadly diseases that plague the wasteland. There are some things that the player can do to nudge said rng one side or the other trough their abilities and gear, but make no mistake: take a whiff of blue rot or drink from the wrong water and you're pretty much done for, without being able to do much else about it.\n\nThe beginning of the game is the toughest and most frustrating part of it, because you'll start out virtually naked and extremely vulnerable, to the point that an idiot with a frying pan will be able to do you in. Avoiding confrontation is without a doubt the most effective way to play the game, but the implacable entropy will eventually force you into taking risks be it food or gear. Combat can be equally frustrating since being in the wrong place at the wrong time can earn you being 1 shotted by a hick with a rifle, although I gotta admit when that happens to you killing an enemy with just one bullet feels badass and satisfying as hell.\n\nWhen you finally reach Detroit Megacity things get substantially easier. You'll be able to scavenge the surrounding areas and sell the loot for money, and you'll basically be doing scavenging trips while way better equipped and with better fallbacks. You'll be given missions regularly that will take you to stupidly dangerous places so you'll have to still stay on your toes. But having access to DMC is a far cry from scuttling around in a hospital garb praying to make it without shitting yourself to death due to cholera or freezing to death inside an abandoned building. You'll likely have to retry the first weeks over and over again, but once you manage to get a character rolling it gives you a great sense of accomplishment. Of course the game includes a full compliment of biological needs to take care of, but ironically those are one of the easiest parts of the game with the right perk or once you get some of the very early gear.\n\nIn closing NEO scavenger is a very long, hard and replayable game that you'll either hate until you love it or just plain hate it.

Her body shot upward from the sleeping bag. She felt her grip on it loosen as she began to calm down. Her eyes adjusted to the dim lighting of the shed.  She listened to her racing heart and the rain on the shed\u2019s metal roof.\nFor a moment, a mere moment, the girl felt relaxed by the noise. Rain was soothing. The unbroken rhythm of each drop.\nBut the ease was lost when she heard a grumbling noise from the pit of her stomach. Her eyes traveled to her stomach. She placed her hands on her stomach, and tried to remember a time where she felt full. As proof, she wore a protruding ribcage.\nHer attention was then drawn to the door of the shed. She could go out and search for food, risk death for food. Or stay here safe from the outside world and risk starvation.\nAnother grumble from her stomach made up her mind. The young girl found the dagger behind her dirty pillow. She gazed at it\u2019s worn appearance for a moment. A dagger was not much but she had not much else.\nWith as must courage as she could muster, she slid out of the sleeping bag and crept slowly out of the shed. With one last look at the place she considered home, a dusty area with only one hole for light to penetrate through and a small space, she turned away from the shed.\nHer eyes looked around the forest and felt goosebumps as rain tickled her skin.\n        The air was coated in a thick fog and the air was stale. What little left of trees stood, but various scraps decorated the ground.\n        At the age of fifteen, she had been on her own since she was five. Well that what she could remember at least. Whatever happened to the world, she could not recall. The only thing she could recall was her name, or what she had been called at the time. Merida.\n    Merida shivered feeling the rain soak into her clothes, or what little there was of her clothes.\n    The scrawny young girl moved away from the shed. She crept through the forest, feeling her muscles tense. A few snarls, growls and footsteps reminded her that she was not alone in the woods. It was dangerous here.\n      A few moments of walking and she heard something. A bush rustled. Her eyes darted to the bush and she stopped suddenly. She moved quickly behind a log across from the bush. A small rabbit wandered out of the bush. It's ears twitched for a moment. Luckily, it seemed to not have noticed Merida's presence. The rabbit sniffed at the ground for a moment and turned it's back to the log.\n      Hunger outranked patience, and Merida suddenly leaped forward towards the rabbit. She aimed her dagger for the creature, but missed. The rabbit, startled, begin to ran. Merida eagerly chased the rabbit farther. Her legs ached as she forced herself to continue.\n  It wasn't until a while, when Merida managed to chase it to the outskirts of the forest. Caught up in the chase, she had not noticed where she was until she tripped on a tin can. She fell down the hill and into the heaps of scraps.\n      The dagger in her hand had slipped from her grasp. It fell along with her.\n      With a sudden stop downward, she caught a glimpse of the rabbit running through the scrapyard. Her eyes wandered around, and she felt fear gnaw at her. She had never been here before. She had never left the forest before.\n      Merida tried to catch her breath. Her small body was not strong enough for the run. Pain engulfed her right leg. She noticed a red liquid spilling from her leg. A large cut rested on her knee. Various scratches decorated her body as well.\n      She guessed the fall into the scraps had managed to give her the mark, along with the blade of the dagger. Tears threatened to seep out her eyes but she dare not cry.\n      The girl struggled to stand. But her leg was badly injured and the weight of body was too much.\n      So she crawled forward. After a few attempts, the girl gave up. The pain in her leg was unbearable.\n      There she lay, amongst the scraps, with a still empty belly, a damaged body and lost hopes.\n      'There's no one, no one here to help me..', she thought to herself in despair.\n      With that, she shut her eyes, and awaited death. She knew she was not dying at the moment; but without shelter, food, and with her wound, she didn't think she'd last a night.\n***\n      Night was present when she heard the noise of the beasts. Creatures of all variety were known to come out at night time. Her eyes tried to make out her surroundings in the darkness.\n      The night brought cold air to her. She shivered, and wished for her shed. At least it was shelter there.\n      Merida heard something rustle near the scraps. She shook in a terrified motion as the sound came closer. Clomp. Clomp. It almost sounded like footsteps. Merida tried to move her legs, but they felt numb.\n    She struggled to move, anything to avoid what ever it was.\n    The noise drew closer. All she could manage to do was hold her breath. A light as well, a red glow, was now close to her. She tried to avoid looking towards whatever it was, in fear that it would see her glancing.\n    The noise was now there near her. And the glow surrounded her. She close her eyes in fear. Suddenly, something cold and metallic touched her. She opened her eyes slowly, and saw two glowing eyes looking at her. The glow showed a mechanical being made of metal, gears and scraps.\n      And that was when she drifted into darkness.", "timestamp_created": 1477221723, "timestamp_updated": 1477221723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26170442": {"recommendationid": "26170442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055082446", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502039517}, "language": "english", "review": "You can kill anything with your bare hands but then you die of starvation or something like that 9/11 cant fight starvation with bare hands", "timestamp_created": 1477168586, "timestamp_updated": 1477178544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26156288": {"recommendationid": "26156288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158260129", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 8234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 69, "last_played": 1521392968}, "language": "english", "review": "Heres how 1 game of NEO scavenger went.

NEO Scavenger illustrates this state more accurately than most single-player survival games. Here you are not completely alone with wildlife in a sandbox like in The Long Dark; but you're also not stranded on an island with mutant cannibals like in The Forest. Instead, you find yourself competing for resources with other survivors, some of them in desperate conditions like you are at first, and others thriving in the desolation and lawlessness. Once you manage to grasp the basics of survival, after several \"nasty, brutish, short\" attempts resulting in horrible deaths, you will also thrive in this chaos.\n\nThis is a game built upon brutal trial and error, and the errors will often cost you all the progress you've made, with all the cool loot you've scavenged. But each death makes you stronger, smarter, more adapted: you live, you die, you live again. And it's this very brutality that makes it so rewarding. Even when you are several days in, thriving in the chaos like a badass, you can still get seriously sick and die abruptly, no matter how much you try to avoid the inevitable. But you soldier on. I did, and somehow I made it to the ending, which, according to this [url=http://www.reddit.com/r/NeoScavenger/comments/2w9xvz/camp_grayling_is_awful_game_design_spoilers/]Reddit post[/url], is very hard to reach even after several tries. [url=http://dumptext.com/0fa6HjYE/raw/]Here[/url] (MASSIVE SPOILERS) is my ending log, just in case anyone wants to check or compare.\n\nIt also stands apart as an RPG as much as a survival game. Openly influenced by classic tabletop RPGs with creative problem solving through skills, it feels somewhat like playing the original Fallout for the first time once again (and that also means dealing with clunky UI and mechanics). The encounters with characters and factions often have branching storylines and different, sometimes irreversible outcomes. The writing is a bit too purple sometimes, but that's a genre thing, and considering that it's a one-man development team, it's still better than the writing in many AAA games.\n\nThe UI can be irritating, and I can only advise that you pick up on the hotkeys ASAP and get used to them, it'll make life easier and counterbalance the addictivity of the scavenging mechanic, the real rough core of the game, which manages to keep you busy for hours and hours while you search for that one left boot in good condition or whatever. Realism isn't a defining factor exactly, but it's well-balanced so that it plays like a challenge, but also not complete scarcity. There is loot aplenty once you learn how to optimise the scavenging.\n\nI've put 110 hours into it according to Steam, but since it is a game that you can just leave in the background while you browse, I didn't spend every hour playing it in a frenzy. This is a game that walks the fine line between casual and hardcore in a fascinating way. It's a background game that can hook your attention for hours in between other things that might hook your attention. And I believe it has immense replay value beyond the seemingly endless cycle of scavenging and dying. I intend to try another character build at some point and see how the story will develop.\n\nThe worldbuilding has potential to develop into a franchise and evolve into bigger, more complex gameplay mechanics, and I don't mean necessarily in first-person, though that could be interesting. As a launching effort, NEO Scav is a brilliant little game, a real diamond in the rough of clunky UI.", "timestamp_created": 1476904142, "timestamp_updated": 1509657821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26086307": {"recommendationid": "26086307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081960580", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519526986}, "language": "english", "review": "scavenged for 3 days killing anything in my way killed 4 guards and took all their shit\n\ndied from Blue Rot\n\n\n10/10 would play again", "timestamp_created": 1476710354, "timestamp_updated": 1476710354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26079815": {"recommendationid": "26079815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170168958", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497476488}, "language": "english", "review": "So I found myself writing this huge post about how I recomend this game, and how I got it back before 2015, but then steam said I had to play the game for atleast 5 minutes. So I open the game, then come back here. I made the unfortunate mistake of pasting it back here while the game was loading, so I lost the whole thing, and have to start over.\nI don't feel like re-writing all of it, and I don't honestly remember what I said. So here's the summary:\nI got this back when Desura was still an option for getting games.\nI played it until I was so tired I nearly had to make another pot of coffee, which says a lot since I was on my third, and I'm still thinking about making it.\nMy first death happened almost 10 minutes later. I had a good backpack, a rifle, a crowbar, perhaps I even had a few hundred kills to my name. How did I die? A looter with a monkey wrench... Yup.\nBut thats one of the reasons I love this game. Every time I play this game I find a new way to end my run. So far I think I've been killed by random people around the map more than anything else... Anyhow, about a year and a month or so later we could starting modding, and oh boy did people mod it fast. I loved the game, and I love the mods.\nNow I'm not saying this is a game for everyone. Infact, I would suggest doing quite a bit of research before buying it (Like, say, getting the demo!). A lot of people say this game has a big learning curve, it's not actually that big, but it could be hard for first time players to get a hand on what's going on. Now, the game also has permadeath, which many people have complained about in the past. So again, do a little research before buying, but I guess that goes for all games... er, um...

It's an intriguing mashup of genres - take The Road crossed with The Mist with a little dash of Blade Runner and throw in a sprinkling of cryptozoology and Unsolved Mysteries and you've got NEO Scavenger in a nutshell. It works extremely well despite this hodgepodge of influences, and the world at no point feels contrived or artificial.\n\nIn any case, I'm getting ahead of myself: at the beginning of the game, none of this concerns you. Waking up in a deserted cryo-facility three-quarters naked and knowing nothing but your name, your most immediate priority is survival. You have several routes to achieve this, but all of them involve the same basic points: eat, drink, sleep, stay warm, don't get sick and don't get wounded, and if you do get wounded, take care of yourself promptly. \n\nYou accomplish this basic survival through two main methods. The first is scavenging, which involves travelling across the hex-based overworld map, choosing a tile to scavenge, and then choosing a specific location within that tile to scour, and at last choosing what abilities and items you'll use in the process. The yields are seldom all that great, but this is the game where you will feel exuberantly grateful for plastic shopping bags, worn flip flops, plastic bottles and old pots - where an intact shopping cart by comparison is an unimaginable score. Most of these things you use in crafting, in which you turn things you find into marginally more useful things.\n\nIf it sounds easy, believe me when I say it's not. Comestibles are scarce, and there's only so much nutrition you can get out of 50-year-old bags of chips and snack cakes. The pressing threat of starvation can lower you to the point where you're wandering across the land eating every little thing that seems the least bit edible to buy a few more hours of life, a threatening prospect when your character lacks the botanical skill to identify poisonous foodstuffs.\n\nWhat to do when you run into a stray feral dog thus becomes a no-brainer. When pressed enough, you might even contemplate the unthinkable. Encounters with both animals, people and [i]other things[/i] are both somewhat rare and appropriately tense. You most often can't judge a person's intentions by sight alone, and trying to talk things out can leave you extremely vulnerable if they turn out hostile. In some cases, if you stumble onto a face-to-face encounter with someone, you may not even try to talk, given that even that moment of hesitation would be enough for them to stick a meat cleaver in your skull.\n\nThe combat in this game is a little bit of an odd duck. It's a bit similar to the original Wasteland, turn based, highly abstracted and without a tactical map - every enemy has a number representing their distance from you, and you have a number of options - advance or fall back, charge or run away. If your target is within range of your weapon, you can attack, and you can pull various special maneuvers or defensive moves depending on the circumstances. It can get a bit mechanical if you know what you're doing and are fairly well kitted, but when you're more down on your luck it can be fairly exciting in an 'oh god please let me live through this' sort of way, as playing it safe can become less justified if it means prolonging an encounter where every moment threatens death. Altogether though, the combat lacks dilemmas, in that there is almost always an objectively optimal action to take in each given situation. Not that it doesn't still have interesting situations - enemies with guns are an interesting example, as you have to weigh the possibility that they're bluffing with that of them actually having bullets and plan accordingly, and this is after all a game where you can win the fight but die slowly and painfully in your camp of an infected cut, huddled up in a sweaty sleeping bag and shivering with fever.\n\nDeath, I should mention, comes easy and takes many forms, if that wasn't already clear. If a scavenger stumbled onto your camp while you sleep, there's little you can do. Even if you manage to wake in time, you might be better off running blindly rather than risking a fight in the dark. But you don't need to fight to die. Cholera, food poisoning, diarrhea, infection, hypothermia, exposure to chemicals, yet more exotic diseases - there's plenty of ways to die and none of them are pleasant. One of my bigger problems with the game plays into this - there's certain encounters where you're given choices that can kill you instantly. On one hand, this makes every choice feel grave. On the other, it's kind of a cheap shot, and you can suffer immense penalties from consequences you had no way of foreseeing.\n\nOne of the things that I found immensely interesting as a possible consequence of the above is how the wasteland comes to warp your sense of morality. Whereas in other games you might be inclined to do good because you think you're a good person, here, the stress of constantly looming starvation, predation by other humans and the ease with which death comes can make you rather disinclined to stick your neck out for others. Even if you throw a good deed or two out now and then, putting yourself in harm's way for someone else's benefit is not something that the world encourages. If you find yourself in a state of pressing enough need, you might even find reason to screw an innocent over for your own benefit. Once you're put in that situation, you kind of start to sympathize with all the people trying to kill you for your stuff. At the very least, you can't really blame them any more, not when they're in the same shitty situation as you. In that way, the game is an excellent illustration of how irrelevant morality becomes when survival is at stake, and the horror that results from that.\n\nThe game does have story, I should mention, and even a vague sort of plot. The writing is very good, the world building is great and the atmosphere is amazing. I should warn you that this game is incredibly bleak - it's not the sort of wacky post-apocalyptic amusement park of the more recent Fallout games, or even the relative optimism of the originals and FONV - it is a world of misery, starvation, murder, cannibalism, despair, negligence, scarcity and extinction. It isn't actively malicious, the depiction of suffering is not gratuitous - the world is callously indifferent, and this comes across in the writing marvelously. The world doesn't center around the protagonist, and for most purposes you're just another wasteland ragman whom nobody gives a hoot about. Some locations and encounters could have used a little more fleshing out - in one particular instance I imagined that my character could have the opportunity to finally get some answers about the state of things in the world, but to my disappointment I couldn't even ask about even the littlest point of interest. Incidentally, I found that the odd bits of old newspaper offering scattered details about the world's backstory far more interesting than the plot involving the protagonist's past.\n\nIn that vein, one of my bigger problems was a relative lack of content. There's plenty for the price, but a few more locations, conversations, quests, NPCs, cryptids to encounter and supernatural horrors would have done wonders for a relatively small investment. In the course of my first successful playthrough, I've seen just about everything there is from one point of view. There's still time to start new playthroughs and see how things turn out for different choices and to explore bits of missed content, but overall there's still less than I'd have liked, in an ideal world.\n\nUltimately though, NEO Scavenger was one of my favourite video game experiences of recent memory. It's engaging and atmospheric, and weaves gameplay and narrative seamlessly together.

If you are a cry baby or a wimp, buy something else.\n\nMe being both a cry baby and a wimp, I probably shouldn't own this game either having given games like WazHack a bad review for using permadeath coupled with randomly generated deathloops as a bad gaming experience.  However, I have given this a thumbs up because I feel that the text based playfield gives the player the illusion of a fighting chance where as the graphics based games are basically just deathloops without strategy.  If you don't shoot fast enough you die coupled with the fact that randomized loot against randomized monsters is usually bad for the player which if I was honest is probably true here too but the game is called neo scavenger, not dungeon explorer.  \n\nScavenging vs. Adventuring, is there a difference?

One thing that survival games tend to forget is that survival is a very tedious business, and they compress the timeframe a bit for emphasis of that particular aspect, but that just tends to make it even more tedious. This tends to detract from exploration or story-telling: you can't care about those things if the only priority you can possibly have is just making it to the next day. NEO Scavenger seems like it has a very rich and detailed story behind it and a setting that has the potential to be deeply immersive, but none of that matters if you simply die within the first week most of the time. \n\nIt doesn't help that the game is somewhat obtuse about a lot of extremely important mechanics, such as the combat system, or health, or that drinking unfiltered water pretty much guarantees that you get cholera or are poisoned. Sure, that last one is pretty obvious in retrospect, but what that implies is that a decent portion of the time you have is going to be spent sterilizing all your water, and hoarding water, etc., which is just about as fun as it sounds. \n\nItem durability is also a terrible system. I don't think it was ever fun or strictly necessary in any game in which it was ever implemented. Yes, on some level, it intuitively makes sense, but it's overly simplistic in its implementation and just keeps forcing you to obsessively hunt for more junk.\n\nThe skill system is interesting at face value, but your choices are limited from the start, and since they're fixed this drastically limits the options available to you (particularly at the start of the game) and you are always made painfully aware of it whenever you craft or interact with anything. It doesn't help that some are incredibly useless or situational.\n\nPermadeath is a good thing, I guess, but it also discourages the player from taking risks. There is always an element of risk in everything, but if you're dealing with an unknown and don't know how to assess the risk, you will eventually come to the conclusion that chancing it isn't worth it in most situations, which, again, runs counter to the player's natural drive for exploration. If you're gonna have permadeath in a game, that's great and all, but you gotta throw the player a bit more of a bone here.\n\nI think this game certainly has potential so I'm not gonna trash it utterly.

The interface is simple and the graphics are basic but this masks a game that is flush with choices and possibility.  \n\nYou awaken with nothing on you and no knowledge of what has happened to the world.  From the moment you are revived at the beginning of the game until you die due to exposure (or starve to death...or get torn limb-from-limb...or...) you are constantly pressured by the environment and your characters own survival needs to move ahead.  Death is far more likely than survival and the options to keep yourself going can get pretty deep and dark (for example, eating the flesh of other humans is a perfectly acceptable way to go...if you don't mind a growing ravenous hunger for the flesh of the living).  To be completely honest, I've yet to get anywhere close to the end of this game but  never stop revisiting it because the sheer diversity of options always leaves me feeling like there were other choices and that any of those other variations might have led to a profoundly different outcome (IE - death by some new lurking horror or contraction of an unexpected disease).", "timestamp_created": 1467826460, "timestamp_updated": 1467826460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24111337": {"recommendationid": "24111337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089667318", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 697, "last_played": 1521531102}, "language": "english", "review": "I personally really enjoy this game! Its very remenesent of original fallout titles, but I feel like this game expands on Turn based actions and combat. (for example, the tough ability, since it gives you the ability to headbutt someone.)\n\nI find that the abilities and flaws you can choose from give the game a lot of replay ability, and can be either incredibly angering, or extremely useful. \nThe difficultly makes you really try to find good ways out of a situation, and plan ahead, but even if you plan you could freeze, dehydrate just a hex before a river, or find a pack of feral dogs/Looters. IT makes you actually panic when you see your character in danger, since you know that if you take one small step in the wrong direction, you have to restart.\n\nthe random situations in the cities make you feel as though you really are helpless at times, becuase sometimes no matter what you do you wont be helpful, It paints a grim picture on how far humanity had fallen, and really helps set the scene.\nI've gotten to the DMC around 4 times, though its hard to last long after that for me! After finding out that strong + trapping the wolfman in the beginning of the game gives you a warm coat, Dehydration has been the worst for me. \n\nThe only issues I've found with the game is that the \"New game\" and \"save and quit\" button are the same, so if you don't pay attention, you'll press new game by reflex, and I've lost 2 DMC saves to that. \nAnother is that there's no setting to turn off permadeath, I know some people who would love to play this game, but the difficulty and permadeath keep them away(like a lot of people with dark souls, haha)\n\nA large glitch I've found is where you will be able to see the \"scavenge\" button, but it refuses to activate scavenging, though its available in the area (you are notified of scavengeable area's with a glass icon) and you have to turn your game off and on again to fix this. People have talked about this glitch for a long time now, but it hasn't been resolved. \n\nIn short, the game is one I'll be recommending to a lot of people, Since I really enjoy it.

The simple fact that you can't tell whether water in a bottle is purified or not without dumping it out exemplifies what I mean.

I played it for about 15 minutes, and was so turned off by the way it looks and the unintuitive interface that I pretty much immediately uninstalled it.  This was a big mistake.\n\nI recently re-installed it, determined to give it another shot, and what I discovered, underneath the (genuinely off-putting) flash game look and feel, is a game of truly staggering complexity and compelling depth.\n\nNEO Scavenger is a game in which you can wrap a rag around your face when exploring buildings to avoid inhaling toxic mold, pry open the lock on a storage shed with your crowbar, find an empty soup can and a left shoe, and pump your fists into the air in triumph IRL because now you won't have to worry about getting blistered feet, and you can boil the water you've been finding to make it safe for consumption.  Now, if only you had some pants...\n\nSimilarly, no other game has ever filled me with such joy and sheer relief at finding an adult-sized backpack.  Such an item enables you to carry enough wood and water that you don't have to keep stopping every few spaces to make camp, and you can make much better time on foot towards that mysterious glow in the East!\n\nOne game, I was attacked by a feral dog, who I beat to death with my bare hands, falling down into the mud and becoming exhausted.  Using a shard of glass, I skinned the beast after it died from internal hemmorhaging brought on by my pummeling.  I took its meat and cooked it over a fire, overjoyed that I'd figured out how to do so.  Delicious, life-giving dog meat.  I used its hide to wrap around the glass shards and make a crude shiv, not knowing what else to do with it.  I was then set upon by a bandit who'd heard my struggles with the dog, to whom I surrendered, knowing I stood no chance.  He left me naked and near death from hypothermia.  I ran into the woods and quickly built a fire as night fell, plotting my revenge, sleeping fitfully on the ground.  When dawn broke, I went to the nearest building and by sheer chance, found some clothing and a crowbar.  I went in search of the bandit who took my dog meat, only to find him dead near some other buildings.  The wastes are cruel indeed.\n\nIf you miss Wasteland 1, if you think Fallout 2 really badly needed detailed wound dressing and immune system mechanics, this is the game for you.

Devs started with an internet flash game, and ended with an internet flash game. they can't even code the save files into real save files so that long-run gameplay (about a month or two in in-game 'time') doesn't start lagging. seriously, a game that is not server based and has low quality graphics lagging because devs can't code a proper save file. sad too, it had potential.\n\nEDIT:The fact that it is a flash save file IS the issue.\nthe file being deleted upon cleaning your computer is just one of the problems that arise from the issue.\n\nIf you clean your temporary internet files, even through chrome, firefox, or IE, like any halfway tech savy computer user from time to time, your save file WILL be deleted, as the files are stored in your temporary internet files, which is what gets wiped. This is something the devs SHOULD have anticipated, unless they are idiots who never maintain their computers\n\nThere is also the fact that the save file for one game gets HUGE because flash is not meant to save long term memory. While I have over 7TB hard drive space on my computer, so a 6GB save file goes practically unnoticed, this is not the case for everyone, and this also creates bigger problems that are not related to how much space you have\n\nThe biggest issue is that the more you play the more the game lags because of this saving method, as flash games are not meant to continuously read and update a save file that big. The lag isn't apparent at first, but play and survive in the game for a few ingame months. you will start to notice stuttering and lag no matter what kind of computer you are running it on, beacuse the issue is with the game itself and flash player. A 2GB plus flash save file is unacceptable and just bad foresight by the devs, not to mention 6GB+ when you've been playing the game for a while.\n\nSo yes, you could blame google chrome, firefox, CCCleaner, whatever for the save file deletion. But you have to blame the devs for using such a stupid system. For not knowing how or wanting to code a good save system. THEY are the ones who chose to put a decent sized persistant universe into a flash save file. THEY are the ones who decided to give their game a save system that will eventually make your saves unplayable.\n\nYou can argue all you want, but the devs are the ones who made the decisions that gave thier game a crippling handicap. Maybe the game was never meant to be anything more than an online flash game, and for that game, that would be ok. But to package it as a game on steam when the game has that kind of major flaw? That is entirely dev screwup\n\nEDIT 2:\nTo show that this is not the only issue with the game, but the one that overshadows everything else into making me write a negative review, here's some critiques i gave to an idiot who has his head to far in the sand:\n\n\"The fact that I cannot rely on my save game's integrity, either due to the way the game saves or the lag in a single player game that is a result of that flaw, is a HUGE deal breaker for me, the rest of the game notwithstanding. The fact that it's a rogue-like game amplifies that, as all of my progress is that much harder to replicate. \n\nAnd as for \"lots and lots\" of content, no offense to the devs on this one, but there just isn't. The creatures and NPCs are pretty basic, storyline is minimal, and \"completing\" this game is both unsatisfactory, and ends the game without the option of continuing, There are also many events in the game that can happen either randomly or from you entering an area that can either kill you no matter what, no matter how geared or skilled you are, just because you chose the wrong option, or even better you chose the right option and it still has a chance of instantly killing you, or can kill you due to you not having one specific item that is absolutely useless under any other curcumstances and normally just takes up space in your pack.\n\nThere's also an event that only happens when you character is asleep and is basically unblockable that [spoiler]leaves your character permanently blind ( a creature literally steals your eyes) and you have to move one hex at a time to the main city (which takes forever, even if you are close), while every creature and most NPCs that see you trying to murder you, and EVEN IF you make it to the city, you have to pay an ungodly amount of money for cybernetic eyes[/spoiler], JUST to resume your normal play.\n\nThe thing is, I can look past all that, the other shortcomings of the game, and can still get enjoyment from it. If it weren't for the issues with the save files. Which is why I wrote a negative review citing the save files, because as I said, everything else I could look past as part of the challenge, dealing with a buggy and vengeful game that hates you. But the fact that on top of everything else, one of the main things you expect to have no issues with, your save file, has major issues, is a huge irritation to me.\"\n\nTL/DR: The game has great potential and is fun if you don't intend to play it for long.

There's surprising depth in the crafting, combat, and survival aspects for a game without any animation.  You need a tin can, a lighter, and some twigs to make sterile water to drink.  You need the same things plus a dirty rag to make a clean rag.  If you get hurt and are bleeding, you need to wash the wound with sterile water (or another antiseptic) and then bandage it with a clean rag.  I died of massive infections twice by the time I realized how to properly care for myself after a fight.  I died several times in combat before I realized how to play defensively and wait for openings.

I recommend you give this a try, although I do recommend picking it up when it's on sale, $15,- seems a bit of a steep price in my opinion.\n\nYou start off the game by creating your character, selecting strenghts and weaknesses, after which the proverbial shit immediately hits the fan.\n\nYou find yourself just awoken from cryo-sleep in a facility when you notice a strange-looking beast approaching you. You can deal with this using strenghts you've previously selected, after taking care of the wolf-like creature you start to wonder where you are, or who you are, you remember next to nothing, and as you set foot outside the facility you notice everything has changed, buildings are in poor condition, and there are no signs of life to be found.\n\nYou must scavenge for survival, your first order of business is protecting yourself from the elements, finding clothes is your #1 priority. After getting yourself warmed up and safe from hypothermia, you should probably find a way of protecting yourself, and scavenging for weapons can be a tedious task, but the excitement you get from finding a mint-condition rifle or shotgun is more than worth it, I won't spoil any more of the game, but I will say this: it's extremely unforgiving and I myself have never survived for more than 25 days, unraveling quite a portion of the story, but not close to all of it.\n\nTL;DR\nNEO Scavenger is an unforgiving and exciting survival game, and I'd definitely recommend it if you're a fan of the genre, but you will die.

Repeatedly clicking the \"kick when down\" option in combat, each time seeing your fallen opponent gain increasingly grisly status conditions, packed a surprising emotional punch.

Never in a game have you been so happy to find a plastic bag, so afraid of a lone dog, so desperate for a drink of clean water. The very central crafting system, while inefficient, is fairly intuitive and visually interesting. After I'd played for a while, a central occupation became setting up camps decorated with the bones of my enemies. The story was interesting, though you'll have to play hard or get lucky to see all of it. Modding to allow saves broke the game in that it destroyed the haggard, roguelike grind for survival. How quickly, failing to plan ahead, you'll find yourself surrounded by a pack of dogs or caught out in the open at night makes every decision important, and the longer you survive the more is at stake. Without saves, however, I wasn't able to gather the resources necessary to explore the hacking and electronics mechanics, or to wholeheartedly play the story encounters, which are often deadly, without being afraid of losing my entire enterprise to a single bad decision.

I was worried but I had some Antacids on me so I swallowed them and kept going unknowing of what was happening. about a day later I saw I had a disease called 'blue rot' it was stage three. Having no clue of what this was and fearing for my characters life I looked it up on the wiki. Turns out naturally I only had a 30% change to survive it but If I found a certain NPC in a certain place (I wont tell you here) Then I could be cured and immunized. the problem was that in 72 hours there was a 70% chance I would be dead. Panicked by this I began to search the map frantically to the point where I was running through a forest at night when something approached me... I searched and searched but couldn't find anything due to the low light conditions I was stuck in. Then suddenly I was slashed in the stomach by what was revealed to be a dogman (think of a werewolf with no human form.) Startled I took my equipped crowbar and smacked it in the face stunning him. This didn't come without a cost however as the dogman swung again causing my leg to start bleeding profusely. I saw that the beast was stunned took my opportunity and ran while I could through sheer luck I lost it.  Wearily I continued my search for this illusive NPC well into my second sleepless night when I saw them. My dogman problem had tripled. Three dogmen 20m away. I didn't want to use it but I saw no other option. I took out the only item of value I had (a pistol with a full mag) from my bag and began to shoot knowing that running was out of the question due to their speed. 6/7 of the shots hit the pack but they were starting to close the distance. I took my bow from by back dropping the pistol and began to unload all five of my arrows into them. One of the dogmen had collapsed due to the pain I had inflicted but that still left two. There was now only 5m between me and them, my two sleepless night had left me on the verge of collapsing and even if I somehow survived this the blue rot would likely kill me. I wanted to die a hero at least. I dropped everything but my trusty crowbar. I braced for impact then swung with all my might at their leader. I was immediately slashed, battered and bruised but I had nearly got the leader at least. It was then that my sleepless nights  combined with effectively a marathon got the better of me. My battered body unable to continue collapsed of sleep deprivation and there unconscious I was torn to pieces and devoured by dogmen.\n\nThis was only of of the epic moments of this life. From this game I have so many stories I could tell from wandering out of the cryo chamber for the first time to reveal the ruined world I was surrounded in to hunting a deer for an entire day with a single spear to turn its skin into a bag of which I hauled around the best cuts of meat I could get from it.

you die you rarely get upset and think; \"I could have done that instead\" or \"maybe that wasn't a good idea, I should avoid doing it again\" (only time I've gotten upset is when I die fighting a bad medusa gang member, almost dieing, then getting killed by a stray dog)\n1. The game is terrible when it comes to forgiving mistakes, which makes it brutally fun as you either get punished or punish others for making a bad move like attacking you without weapons while you have a large knife and the strong skill. It can also destroy you if you make a bad move and give you no chance to save yourself\n2. The npcs seem player like, some either hunting you down and causing trouble just because they can, others thanking you for not trying to stab them while on their way to go do something. Some ignore you too. Great realism to how some people see, like they would act in an event like this\n3. It's a hard game, both to learn and play when you at least think you have the ropes down, a pocketknife, and a yellow canary lighter in your jean pockets since your grocery bag is full of more grocery bags and food. And don't think \"oh it must be the bad kind of hard because you need to learn stuff yourself and everything is brutal\" since it's a fun game and the only time the game isn't hard is maybe the first few moves when absolutely nothing can move yet and get you. It's a good kind of hard that makes you feel warm with the feels for your characters health and well being as he try's to figure out what the fuck happened and why he can't remember shit.\n4. Even when you think you got things going well it can still go bad. The run I was the most equipped on was ended by a dogman who was hungry for human flesh, mine to be specific after he killed an npc and ditched the body.

You cant even beat a normal person armed with stones when you're at full health and have weapons. As soon as you leave the starting area you're suddenly afflicted with hypothermia and tracked and attacked by dogs that you also have no chance of beating. Then, each time you start a new game you have to pick your traits all over again for the 5 minutes that you're going to live. You'll often die a day or two after leaving the starting area from hypothermia even if you do everything you can to not freeze to death. The first few turns, if you aren't lucky enough to find yourself some clothing and a rudimentary weapon, you can bet you're going to die in your sleep or as some dog (or Dogman)'s lunch. I love the concept and the style. A turn based survival that works off of hexes? Pretty clever. But the execution is far too brutal and with not even the most simple of tutorials to learn basic survival from, it's even more unforgiving... and not in a fun way.

Apr\u00e8s un Day Z plut\u00f4t orient\u00e9 shooter, et un Lone Survivor plus old school, un ancien de chez Bioware d\u00e9cide de mettre son grain de sel en pr\u00e9sentant un jeu un peu particulier. Sous le nom Neo Scavenger, pr\u00e9parez vous \u00e0 un jeu de r\u00f4le, tour par tour de survie post apocalyptique. Plaira t-il au joueurs?[/b]\n\n[h1]THE WALKING (8bit) DEAD[/h1]\n\nNeo Scavenger se veut \u00eatre un survival au tour par tour, et nous le fait comprendre d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but. Notre h\u00e9ros est enferm\u00e9 dans un laboratoire abandonn\u00e9, se r\u00e9veillant totalement perdu et sans souvenirs de son pass\u00e9. Nous choisissons d\u2019abord ses capacit\u00e9s parmi un nombre donn\u00e9. Si l\u2019on choisit la comp\u00e9tence \u201cStrong\u201d, le personnage sera plus fort physiquement et aura tendance \u00e0 choisir la mani\u00e8re forte en toute situation. A l\u2019inverse la comp\u00e9tence \u201cMechanics\u201d donne au h\u00e9ros la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser les \u00e9quipements \u00e9lectroniques pour \u00e9chapper aux dangers qui arrivent sur lui. Un dernier exemple int\u00e9ressant est la comp\u00e9tence \u201cBotanics\u201d. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 elle on peut concocter de quoi se soigner avec les objets ramass\u00e9s \u00e0 Terre, mais de mani\u00e8re plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, tester toutes les mani\u00e8res de faire de sa vie la moins mis\u00e9rable possible.  L\u2019action est modifi\u00e9e en permanence de ce fait, et les embranchements seront semblables a un livre dont vous \u00eates le h\u00e9ros. Mais qui dit survival, dit personnage faible et d\u00e9s\u0153uvr\u00e9, et avec les comp\u00e9tences arrivent les faiblesses.  Serons nous faibles? insomniaques? ou myopes? toujours est il qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019inverse d\u2019un jeu de r\u00f4le, on ne joue pas un h\u00e9ros mais un homme affaibli. Cela se sent \u00e9galement par le fait que nous commen\u00e7ons l\u2019aventure sans affaires et sans v\u00eatements si ce n\u2019est un habit d\u2019h\u00f4pital. Un grognement se fait entendre au loin, et nous devons vite nous en sortir. On sent une influence post apocalyptique \u00e0 ce point qui sera confirm\u00e9e par la suite, et le d\u00e9but de Neo Scavenger fait grandement penser \u00e0 \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d. Mais assez divagu\u00e9, rentrons plus en d\u00e9tail dans le jeu.\n\n[h1]SEUL CONTRE TOUS[/h1]\n\nNous sommes donc dans le laboratoire, et devons nous d\u00e9cider, ce qui prend la forme d\u2019un texte avec plusieurs choix. Comment couper l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la b\u00eate r\u00f4dant dehors? En fon\u00e7ant ( Strong) sur la porte pour la bloquer avec les moyens du bord bien sur! Seul probl\u00e8me, on s\u2019\u00e9puise plus que de nature.  On se dit alors qu\u2019il y a moyen de pirater les portes pour emp\u00eacher l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de l\u2019in\u00e9vitable, et \u00e7a marche! On en profite pour soigner notre amn\u00e9sie gr\u00e2ce aux carnets de bord probablement laiss\u00e9s par les scientifiques. Une fois le silence revenu, le h\u00e9ros que nous sommes r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 sortir et voit un environnement totalement d\u00e9vast\u00e9. Le jeu prend alors la forme d\u2019une immense carte divis\u00e9e en hexagones.  On se d\u00e9place sur celle ci par \u00e0 coups, en fouillant chaque case. Parfois c\u2019est juste la plaine qui s\u2019offre \u00e0 nous, ou des for\u00eats voire m\u00eame des villes abandonn\u00e9es. Par le biais d\u2019actions, on peut se cacher, fouiller, dormir ou encore fabriquer des objets. Mais pour avoir des objets, vu que l\u2019on est quasi nu, il faut trouver les endroits ou chercher. C\u2019est surtout dans les villes que ce sera le cas, et l\u00e0 o\u00f9 un bout de chaussure et un verre de whisky vont nous aider \u00e0 passer la nuit, des journaux parsem\u00e9s vont donner des infos sur ce qui est r\u00e9ellement pass\u00e9. L\u2019aventure prend donc une tournure \u00e0 la fois survivaliste et historique, car on apprendra \u00e0 la fois des choses sur le monde qui nous entoure, sur nous m\u00eame et sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements  qui se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s. La d\u00e9couverte sera de courte dur\u00e9e, car une menace ext\u00e9rieure sera pr\u00e9sente sur notre chemin, sous la forme d\u2019une entit\u00e9 extra terrestre. Le jeu se rajoute \u00e9galement une composante \u201cchat et la souris\u201d, ou la guerre de la moindre goutte d\u2019eau se heurte aux affrontements contre les bestioles. Et il ne vaut mieux pas les affronter justement, \u00e0 moindre d\u2019avoir des armes d\u00e9di\u00e9es\u2026mais c\u2019est une autre histoire. Toutes ces composantes donnent un jeu plut\u00f4t complet et prenant. Seuls quelques petits d\u00e9tails viennent g\u00eaner l\u2019exp\u00e9rience.\n\n[h1]DES OMBRES AU TABLEAU SOMBRE[/h1]\n\nNeo Scavenger est \u00e0 la fois un jeu dont nous sommes les h\u00e9ros et \u00e9galement un jeu de d\u00e9placement par hexagones. C\u2019est un hommage voulu par les d\u00e9veloppeurs, mais \u00e9galement un inconv\u00e9nient \u00e0 cause de l\u2019interface. Tout flaire les ann\u00e9es 80, avec des combats se terminant en 34 clicks, les menus o\u00f9 l\u2019on se perd rien que pour sauvegarder et les objets r\u00e9cup\u00e9rables par 3 clicks, le joueur le moins t\u00e9m\u00e9raire peut perdre vite le fil. La qualit\u00e9 technique du titre se veut simple et r\u00e9ussit son pari, avec seulement le n\u00e9cessaire pour distinguer l\u2019action. On aurait voulu un peu plus de d\u00e9tails pour s\u2019y retrouver, surtout avec l\u2019interface, mais le parti pris est bien visible. Enfin, une grosse barri\u00e8re se monte devant vous si vous avez la facult\u00e9 de ne parler que le langage de Moli\u00e8re: toute l\u2019interface est en Anglais. On peut s\u2019accommoder dans les menus, mais le jeu en lui m\u00eame d\u00e9borde de textes, allant m\u00eame jusqu\u2019\u00e0 couvrir la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9cran. Pour les gens souhaitant tenter leur chance prenez un dictionnaire. Des choses un peu g\u00eanantes mais qui pourront \u00eatre surmont\u00e9es par tout joueur courageux.\n\n[h1]A retenir[/h1]\n\n[b]Vous aimez la survie? Et bien vous aurez de la survie! Neo Scavenger ne laisse que tr\u00e8s peu de marge de man\u0153uvre au joueur. On doit survivre, en \u00e9tant quasi nu, sans armes, et avec des caract\u00e9ristiques et faiblesses particuli\u00e8res. On progresse en surveillant chaque pas, et construisons notre aventure en apprenant plus sur ce qui est arriv\u00e9 dans ce monde d\u00e9vast\u00e9, dans une aventure complexe. Par contre, l\u2019interface est tr\u00e8s aust\u00e8re, en Anglais, et seulement les plus courageux vont aller jusqu\u2019au bout. A essayer pour soutenir le d\u00e9veloppeur, mais en \u00e9tant pr\u00eat \u00e0 souffrir pour \u00eatre fort.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1455286781, "timestamp_updated": 1455313814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21119791": {"recommendationid": "21119791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026999552", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 2328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455101694}, "language": "english", "review": "Wasted potential.

You're going to be clicking on things at least five times more than you have any right to. What's worse, once you explore the map a bit, the game begins to be unreasonably slow and unresponsive.\n- - - - Game suffers from bugs that have no right to be in the final product. For example, if you get exiled from the city, get a different tracking bracelet and try to get it again, the game will treat the new bracelet as the old one and won't let you back in. What's worse, the only way to get back is to literally wait (!!!) for an entire year of game-time (8760 turns).\n- - - - Unimmersive; for a survival game, surviving stops being any challenge whatsoever as soon as you reach the city outskirts and stay there. You can live safely and comfortably indefinitely while earning a shootload of money, and the only reason to leave safety is to push the story forward. Also, the character is supposed to be someone who got dropped into this post-apocalyptic world out of the blue, yet in the extremely limited NPC interactions he somehow already knows about things he hasn't even come close to seeing.

It's actually very short, which is probably a good thing because it's so difficult. However, despite the amount of random bullshit that seems to kill you in this game, I never had a death where that I couldn't see why it was my fault. The world is extremely harsh, but you'll mostly find out about the stuff that kills you early in the game, or it's common sense, so you won't get to the endgame only to be insta-killed unless YOU do something stupid. Just be aware that the minute you DO do anything stupid, you will probably die. This, together with the core gameplay around surviving, is what kept me coming back to the game, even after ragequitting in frustration and deciding to never play it again. The different systems around survival -health, scavenging, combat, crafting, character creation, bartering, and inventory - work together extremely well. I have a weakness for survival and sandbox games, especially rogue-like survival games, but I'm also very harsh on them. I have a lot of problems with games like Minecraft, Rust, Ark, Terraria, DayZ and more. NEO Scavenger has been the perfect survival experience for me though. It's not something to spend hundreds of hours on, no. Based on my playtime so far and the playtime of other reviewers, 70ish hours seems to be the cap before interest dives. That's when I felt like I had thoroughly learned how the game worked. What makes this an engaging experience is going from knowing nothing about the game to being able to take on any challenge it thows at you. Amazingly, it succeeds in being an experience both fantastic and realistic.\n\nIt's not perfect, of course. The story events and random events have some problems, but even though these choose-your-own-adventure style events can kill you, they're actually surprisingly lenient compared to the core mechanics of the game. You usually have to screw up pretty bad to get killed, and most frequently you just get a slap on the hand if you didn't choose exactly the right path through event. Since I died so much outside of the events, it was pretty fun to see how different paths and different character builds affected the outcome. Other than that, I personally couldn't care about the story and events very much. It's interesting, moderately good quality, and original. I normally love narrative and world-building in games, but in NEO Scavenger it took the backseat to the core gameplay. The only negative thing I can say about that is it could just use MORE. The art style, while flat, is exactly what it needs to be for the game, but everything definitely looks the same after only an hour or two. If there were a few more hex-types and some variation in textures, and especially if there was some physical depth, as in changes in elevation, to the terrain, it would be much more visually interesting. The item count is decent, but if there was just a bit more customization possible it would be awesome, and then every single npc wouldn't look identical. The map is actually quite large, and it can take a long time to get across it when you're looting everything that's even slightly lootable and fending off all manner of dangers along the way, but it could really use a few more unique locations with events tied to them, even though I said that's not what I'm here for. The character building is great: it really does feel like original Fallout and it totally determines what you can do and how you play, but for a system so deep it just feels so small. The world NEO Scavenger takes place in is very interesting, but outside of vague newspaper articles there's not actually all that much to explain it all. With a more cohesive and expansive lore, I could really get into this world. The story, like I said, is very short, and I frankly don't care that much about it; it's good enough for me. But it does have this interesting problem that unless you explore everything you can easily \"complete\" the story in just two \"quests\". It's pretty hard to tell what kind of story NEO Scavenger wants to tell, and how. I don't think it needs to be longer. With multiple paths and endings and the difficulty of the game it benefits from being short. But it does need a few more storytelling mechanics, and probably a better, more dense distribution of the story throughout the gameplay. As is, you play the core game and progress for a long while, and then you get a big chunk of wall-of-text story.\n\nAll in all, if you want a solid survival role-playing game, this is what you want. I think that for the type of people who enjoy this game you can expect as much as 70 hours of extremely engaging time with this game, which is definitely worth $15.

I probably logged over 100 hours.\n\nAnyways...\n\n\nWhat this game does right is giving you lots of options when it comes to survival. Too often survival games feel limited, like things you should be able to do easily in a real life situation just aren't available in game. A couple examples that come to mind:\n\n- Need to boil something but don't have a cooking pot? Use a tin can!\n- Need to make fire but don't have a lighter? Rub two sticks together or use sunlight and a piece of glass!\n- Need a container to carry items but don't have a backpack? Use a plastic shopping bag!\n- Need bandages? Rip clothes, get rags. Need clean bandages? Boil rags.\n- Need string? Rip rags.\n\nNice features include:\n- 'Building' your camp: pick an abandoned building with the appliances you need, place traps, leave a sleeping bag... Not a whole lot of options but you do feel like you have your own personal secure spot you can come back to.\n- An engaging storyline that makes you want to find out about what happened to the world and yourself. An interesting lore as well.\n- Lots of crafting options to get the stuff you need to survive.\n- Skills that give you special abilities\n- Pretty good learning curve: you'll have to keep trying at first until you learn the basics. Then you'll manage to survive fairly well, and you'll still have many more things to learn and discover. There's lots of stuff you'll have to figure out on your own (or you can use the wiki).\n- Overall, enough content to keep you engaged for many hours.\n- Low hardware requirements. Will probably run on that $200 laptop you bought to take notes in class (check the specs to be sure though).\n\n\nCons:\n- The game is text-based with a graphical interface. Nothing is animated, few things are drawn, most is just described through text. The combat system especially takes some getting used too as well. It's very playable and some people like that style, but for some people it's a deal-breaker. So be warned.\n- Only one save/permadeath (although you can easily circumvent that).\n- Not being able to pick all skills can make the game feel limited, forcing you to play again to explore other things (you can mod the game to get all skills though).\n- The randomness can be harsh sometimes and force you to restart many times before you'll get lucky, have a good start and actually get somewhere.\n- Many random encounters don't have a \"good\" resolution to them, sometimes making you feel like the game just ties your hands excessively and won't let you try hard enough, or making you feel like your skills are useless. Some encounters can actually punish you severely, with no way for you to predict that your decisions will lead to a really bad outcome. This is in deep contrast with the rest of the game where you have so many options to accomplish what you want to do.\n\nOverall I recommend it to people who enjoy the survival genre, have the patience to fail, learn and try again repeatedly, and who can overlook the game sometimes throwing you in tough situations without you being able to do anything about it. People who aren't so hardcore can just mod the game a bit to make it easier and can circumvent the one save/permadeath feature.", "timestamp_created": 1452298383, "timestamp_updated": 1452298521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.998334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20388969": {"recommendationid": "20388969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048619953", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461165420}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game, Well put together.\n\nThe fighting is terribly unbalanced, If you get into a fight you cant run from, expect to die. \n\nThe game is a lot of fun, however you will get frustrated at spending a few hours building up your character and collecting items and then one enemy will kill you in 2-3 attacks. \n\nI reccomend it, however i absolutly hate the fighting.", "timestamp_created": 1452223109, "timestamp_updated": 1452223109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483356", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20388244": {"recommendationid": "20388244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092329613", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457064734}, "language": "english", "review": "Neo Scavenger is a one of a kind game!

I was going to sell these spare bullets, and buy a real gun and maybe some night vison goggles. I was going to be unstopable, moreso than I already was. Hell, already people were running as soon as I got in the same area as they were.\n\nLike a fool, I traveled at night, with nothing out to help me see. Suddenly, I was attacked. I took cover and laughed. \"Probably some Bad Mutha trying to kill me, I'll show him,\" I thought as I readied my new-found bow, and fired into the night mist. The arrows wizzed by, missing anything that could possibly be near. Suddenly, a fist slammed into my face, and in that second I was able to make out my attacker. I wasn't lucky enough to get a Ba Mutha or a random looter, but instead my attacker wore a hospital gown. A Blue Frog.\n\nI wasn't able to ready my crowbar quick enough, and found myself on the recieving end of a beat down. I managed to crack my crowbar on the man's head a few times, which would normally kill anyone else. At one point, the man went down, and I had a choice. I could have run, and possibly gotten out fine, but I was a fool.\n\n\"I've gotten so far. This jerkoff won't be the end of me,\" I thought to myself, as I readied the crowbar, intending for it to pierce the man's skull.

I figure this run would end pretty quick, because I know death is apparently frequent in this game (aka roguelike).

After feral dogs jump up and rip your face off with their teeth for the fifth time, I bet you'll appreciate having a robot butler to care for you, you big cosseted ghost town lover!\n\nYeah, you think you're hot shit because you dunked a few Fat Mans into a Super Mutant's face? You're nothing. You have never been in a post-apocalyptic wasteland until you're running around, frantically searching for clothes in abandoned buildings to keep from freezing to death. You haven't lived because you haven't frantically searched for a soup pan to boil water with, because you know all the water laying around is an invitation to kill you. You haven't really survived because you know that the world knows about fifteen different ways to snuff your life out, and is cold and indifferent about everyone one of those ways because that's how hardcore and brutal planet Earth is. You haven't known the true terror of conflict as another one of your kind stalks you with a hunting rifle for all the batteries and water bottles you have.\n\nYou like being in constant danger? Good, because that's how the game masks its short length. From the very start, half of the game's goal is just living long enough to reach the Megacity of Detroit. It's a short walk, but it's a short walk fraught with danger that will kill people dead (especially if you decide you're too good for guns and try to go for a Melee-only character). It's an open world and there's all sorts of fun secrets to find. If you live long enough to get there, that is.\nBut if you do, you'll suddenly realize just how cramped it all seems. And yet, it feels a bit unreasonable to ask for more, because the journey to finding the secret is a bunch of little experiences in and of itself.\n\nAlso the random encounter roleplaying sequences do a great job illustrating how depressingly hostile the world is, but also rarely try to kill you outright. And I understand why they're there - even the hardest of motherfuckers in the wasteland will go down easy - but VERY SUDDENLY losing a character I've grown to love after playing for thirty hours carting shit back and forth to the DMC because I chose poorly really rubs me the wrong way. I'm not saying this is entirely a bad thing (I was choosing rather carelessly), but a little forewarning to sudden death is appreciated.\n\nAnyway!

Enjoy!\n\n**Story may contain Spoiler**\n\nThis is the story of my latest adventure\n\nDay 1: I woke up in a strange facility, I have no clue who am I and why am I here.. Suddenly! Surprise Dogman appeared! I beat the living s**t out of it like there was no tomorrow until it stopped twitching.\n\nIt was a good work out I don't remember when was the last time I had a work out or if I even work out at all. My stomach made a rumbling noise so I went to search the place for food but only found a green bag with a white cross sign inside it was just a bunch of dumb pills.. I stared at the dead dog like creature feeling somewhat regretful for killing.. perhaps it was just trying to help me.. So I chopped his body into pieces and brought some wood from the nearby forest to make fire to cook it.\n\n\"This is what it would've wanted me to do\" I thought to myself silently thanking it for becoming a meal and a coat but also silently hating it at the same time for not bringing any condiments with it.\n\nAfter satisfying my stomach I went to stroll into the nearest town looking for any sign of civilization but nobody was here the streets were empty and ocassionally I'd see a few skeletons laying around, perhaps it's halloween and they're having a huge hide and seek event.. YES! that could only be the most logical reason!\n\nI looked around inside buildings ocassionally taking items with me \"I'm just gonna borrow this stuff I'm sure they wouldn't mind\" I thought to myself as I grabbed as much stuff as I could carry.\n\nIt was starting to get dark and I was afraid if a stranger would walk up to me and offer me a sugar free candy, so I went back to the facility I woke up in and decided to call it home.\n\nI saw a faint glow of light in the distance and I knew it.. they were hiding from me.. nobody hides from me.. nobo.. *falls asleep* zzzZZZzzzZZZzz...\n\nDay 2: I had a good sleep last night but my stomach was beginning to complain again.. I went out and made myself a hardened spear before heading out any further.. just in case I encounter any stranger danger..\n\nAs I headed out toward where I last saw the glow of light I spotted more Town! as I sprinted toward the town I came across a friendly stranger.\n\nHe was carrying a revolver he must be dressing up as a cowboy and he was also wearing a pair of croc so I asked him to give me all of his stuff because my stuff sucks, but he refused and start to charge at me, The nerve of some people I tell you! So I poked him on the head with my sharp stick, he fell and was crawling away from me as he beg for mercy so I gave him what he wanted and kept poking him with my sharp stick until he was no longer in pain.\n\nI was pretty happy that I could borrow his croc I saw that cool kids wear these kind of sho- err sandals..? what ever it is.. the cool kids on the old worn out poster wear it so I'm a cool kid now.\n\nOH! and he also had an expired cracker and some ketchup! So I hack him and whack him and chop him since there's no point to let him go to waste no siree! he would've want me to eat him or else he would've told me stories about starving childrens in some distant foreign land! So being the civilized human being I am, I cooked him as best as I could with the few ingridients he had on him that I'm sure would've made Gordon Ramsay proud.\n\nToday was a good day I said to myself as I went to sleep.\n\nDay 3: A noise woke me up today.. it was a guy! He tried to take my precious empty bottle in the corner! \u201cMy Precious!!!\u201d I shouted as I charge toward him and knocked some debris toward him, the debris made him vulnerable and as he tries to recover I stabbed him with my sharp pointy stick and carved a hole in his right arm.\n\nI kept stabbing him with my pointy stick as I hissed at him aggressively, nobody touches my precious! Nobody but me!\n\nI lacerated, gashed and carved him into pieces there was no mercy.. it was the sacrifice my precious neede- Oohh!! He had a crowbar! Now I can dress up as Gordon Freemsay the Angry crazy canibalistic chef with a Phd!\n\nAnd so I ventured out as Gordon Freemsay! Suddenly 3 Dog appeared! I knew it.. I should\u2019ve double tapped him when I last met him at Galaxy News Radio.. now he reappeared before me as an actual 3 Dog! \n\nSo I demolished one of the closest dog\u2019s head using my crowbar! That really got the attention of the other 2 Dog and again I demolished the other dog head, it seem that knocked some sense to the last dog as it tries to fall back from me but it knew.. it knew it was too late.. it knew that it had done f**ked up and \u201cWHACK!!\u201d that was the last thing it heard.. \u201cnobody.. mess with Gordon Freemsay..\u201d I said to it in a silent hiss.\n\nAs I went on my way I was again approached by more meanies.. they just don\u2019t know when to quit..\n\nAfter slaughtering about 2 more Dog and 2 Stranger with an angry mother issue, I went off to go shopping for a sauce pan and back pack and found a cool sled and since I\u2019m not a thief I left my plastic shopping bag with some rotting left over cooked human meat as a trade in case the owner came back.\n\nIt was another great day, I cooked some water from a nearby lake so I can wash my boo-boo away and bottle some more in case I made some more boo-boo.\n\nI also did an art and craft project by stringing small can with a handful of strings and pebbles it made music if people step or trip on them! It will be a great addition to my house!\n\nDay 4: My art and craft project ringed in the middle of the night.. *sigh* I guess it\u2019s time for a midnight snack, it was a dogie! \u201cChinese food it is then\u201d I lured it into a trap but it still managed to scratch my coat before I stabbed a new nose into it\u2019s lung and bled all over the floor.\n\nGreat.. now I\u2019m gonna have to clean that up.. *sigh* why do they have to make things difficult I grumble to myself as I enjoy my midnight snack and went back to sleep but as soon as I closed my eyes another stranger ringed my welcome bell.. I got up and quickly took cover.. I couldn\u2019t see where or who this stranger was so I lashed out and swinged my sharp pointy stick wildly to where I think he\u2019s at but this stranger managed to shred my upper left leg, I fell to the ground and just then I knew.. I done goofed.. and all the horrible things I\u2019ve done.. I\u2019ve become a monster.. and I didn\u2019t want to acknowledge that.. I was in denial all this time.. this is it.. my time has finally come.. I am ready.. do your worst Karma.. and just like that I passed out..\n\n...\n\nEverything was silent.. I woke up.. there was a bright light as if the sun was shining upon me..\n\n...\n\nWait a minute.. it actually is the sun! And sure enough! there he was.. The f**ker that tried to kill me! Laying on the ground with a hole in his chest.. Boy~! I sure didn\u2019t learn a single thing from that experience so I cut that f**ker up and ate him. It sure was a glorious day in this man army! And it was pretty nice of him to bring me a hunting rifle with a scope, strap and there's even a bullet in it aww that's so sweet of him.\n\nI enjoyed the rest of the day munching on the left over while reading the outdated newspaper man.. I wish I had some fava beans and a nice chianti to go with this live- shh!! There were noises outside.. and sure it was another stranger waiting in the nearby outskirt of the forest.. and so Gordon Freemsay continues his rampage in this post-apocalyptic world..", "timestamp_created": 1450944045, "timestamp_updated": 1450944143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19880690": {"recommendationid": "19880690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071147456", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446250828}, "language": "english", "review": "Sehr lecker!

Also Neo Scavenger supports Project Zombiod and Project Zomboid supports Neo Scavenger (not as well though read my Project Zomboid review to find out more) The only bad thing was that it lacked a certain aspect so you would continuously play it like after a big loss of a great game (So annoying man).

Hear me roar.\n\nI played for 14 hours, slaughtered COUNTLESS beasties, raiders and robbers. I killed something called a \"melonhead\" and I've slaughtered so many dogs I could wear their skins and pretend to be the wolf-man.\nIt was at that time - as I munched down another human steak, made on the desecrated remains of a man who had tried to steal my sled in the middle of the night, that I was assaulted. Well, it was actually while I slept after having eaten the corpse of the aformentioned adversary, seeing as time apparently stops when you eat things.\n\nIn any case, let me recount to you, the story of Philip the Doghide boy.\nPhilip, just as any man, awoke from cryogenic stasis in a secret lab, where he was quickly faced with a hideous creature screaming like the midnight wind 'cross a praire of bones so sharp as knives. And much like that praire of bones, the dogman was soon still and dead. You see, Philip was a total badass, and he vanquished this horrific beast with a few swift uppercuts and rock-hard right-left combos. The beast lay dead, and not satisfied with merely having sent this beast's soul to dogman-heaven, Philip decided that it's skin looked comfortable. He grabbed a shard of glass, cut it open and wore it's pelt - face and all, possibly while dancing to some trance-music and smearing cheap lipstick on himself. Naked. In front of a mirror.\n\nAfter that psychadellic trip, Philip wandered out into the wilderness, wearing nothing but the skin of his dead adversary. He was messed with. Attacked by rabid dogs and feral.. Dogs. And more dogs. This game has a lot of dogs. If you don't like killing dogs, this is probably not the game for you.\nAnyway, needless to say, dogs never really posed a problem for Philip. Philip had two good pairs of hands, and he had a shank made of glass in one of them. Philip was not to be fucked with.\n\nNow, Philip was a hulking mass of death, even when armed with nothing but a shard of glass, so I'll assume you understand what happened when Philip found a crowbar and a loaded shotgun in a shed. That's right. Philip turned into a lean, mean, psychopathic killing machine. This brings us to a dark chapter of Philip's life. The killing. The killing never stopped.\n\nPhilip was a soulless husk of a man, and that crowbar whispered sweet things in his ears at night. It craved for blood. Lusted for it. Philip was renamed \"Philip Mordake\".\nPhilip tried to fight it, of course. Philip was no murderer.. Philip merely loved to kill dogs, but that didn't matter. For each person that crossed Philip's path, the crowbar screamed. It pleaded, begged and demanded of Philip.. Terrible things. Great things. But terrible things.\nIt drove him to insanity, the whispering. The screams. They all melded together as Philip gave in to the crowbar's crazed yelling. He'd separate flesh from bone, and smash until there was nothing left but something that barely resembeled a human. He'd eat the flesh. Why not? Cut it loose with a shard of glass, and eat chunk by chunk until he was no longer starving.\n\nPhilip's path on this strange earth was carved from the blood and bone of any that entered his path. Any that dared touch his sled. Philip was a cruel God on this earth, his fury tempestous and his retribution violent and brutal as it was swift. He cut many a foe from existance, and wore their remains as trophies.\n\nThis brings us to the end of Philip's journey. For Philip had been surprised to wake up in the middle of the night, at the sound of somebody stealing his sled! That could not happen - no not at all. And Philip's recourse to this - though predictable - was a thing to behold. He knocked down that poor thief, and whaled with his crowbar until there was naught left of his adversary. Philip hadn't even been injured at this. He was in perfect health, and continued to be so as he smeared himself with the blood of his enemy (note; you can't actually do this in the game. You'll wish you could, though.) and sat himself down again. He dozed off, and once more awoke. This time, to the face of the very first foe that he'd faced.\n\nIt was a Dogman, looming above him like a gaunt, shadowy behemoth. The crowbar awoke. It screamed. It begged for blood, and Philip didn't have to be asked twice. He leapt for the creature! He cut it down, and bit it's flesh with that accursed crowbar time and time again! A hailstorm of blows weakened the beast, and it desperately slashed out!\n...\nPhilip was struck in the heart, and died immediately. And the crowbar fell from his hand, going silent.. It was just a normal crowbar.\n\nNow, you might think that's an amusing story. Or maybe you hated that story, but let me tell you what.\nI spent 14 HOURS. 14 BLOODY HOURS ON PHILIP.\nPhilip was a GODDAMNED MONSTER! He was the toughest thing since diamonds armed with shanks in a cuban jail.\nHe'd survived battles with up to three opponents at once, and though injured, he'd come out on top.\nAnd now he just got killed instantly because of some fantastic stroke of good fortune for some psuedo-werewolf.\n\nThis game is interesting, but it's interesting for about 10 minutes. If you've discovered amazing loot in one house, you've basically found all there is in this game. Sure, there are random events and such, but very few of them actually lead anywhere. You're Philip, and you'll always be Philip. Not Philippa, or Sam, or James the Jive-ass Jukebox Jockey. Philip.\nYou'll pick your perks, disadvantages and roll out. You die because of silly reasons or because you had a bad start. And then you have to start all over, without any progress having been made.\nAfter a while, it becomes tedious. It's not fun to micro-manage your campfire, clothes, hydration and hunger-levels, as well as spend the ENTIRE GAME TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP, I MEAN SHIT. JUST FALL ASLEEP, MAN! YOU JUST MASSACRED AN ENTIRE VILLAGE!\n\nAll in all, I'd refund this game if I hadn't hatefucked 14 hours of gameplay out of it.

Then my boot fell apart. Then I was mauled by a feral dog, and presumably eaten. Now I have to go back for more. 10/10\n\nFINAL REVIEW: After playing more, my opinion of this game has come to change. I still recommend it, because it is enjoyable, but buy it on sale. Starts as a 10/10, finishes as a solid 7/10. \n\nThe mechanics are fantastic. It has the right \"feel\" for a game that has Scavenger in its name. The storyline is intriguing, and well presented through random newspaper articles. Combat is a treat, taking a break from standard \"X ability does Y damage\" combat, instead simply treating combat as any other encounter, and allowing you to determine which skills to use each turn. But there is simply not enough to go around.\n\nThe beginning of the game feels like you're dipping your toe into a vast, deep, dark lake. But after a while, when you begin to figure things out, you realize that you aren't stepping into a deep dark lake filled with unknown dangers and treasures. No, you are simply looking at a puzzle, with pieces scattered, a system of parts that just need to be put together in the correct order. Don't get me wrong, puzzles can be fun. But they don't have the replayability that I seek from a roguelike. No matter how many times you dump the pieces out in a random order to start with, the end is always the same. \n\nOh, and speaking of a lake...why no fishing? You can eat a squirrel. You can eat a dog. You can eat a person.

Ogni abilit\u00e0 ha determinati punti (in totale ne avrete 16). Sono presenti anche abilit\u00e0 negative in modo da farvi acquisire ulteriori abilit\u00e0 positive. Non \u00e8 possibile scegliere il sesso del protagonista, il gioco \u00e8 stato concepito con in mente un personaggio maschile e con un determinato nome. Ma vi assicuro che non \u00e8 importante.\n\nOvviamente le abilit\u00e0 che sceglierete avranno dei vantaggi: se scegliete \"Melee\" sarete forti in corpo a corpo, ma \u00e8 anche una delle abilit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 costose perch\u00e9 vi fornisce un enorme vantaggio soprattutto ad inizio gioco quando la maggior parte degli incontri sono di tipo ravvicinato.\n\nVi risveglierete in un cryolab con indosso solo la classica camicetta leggera da ospedale e il braccialetto, vi guardate intorno e... no, non spoilero.\n\nLo spostamento sulla mappa, lo scavenging e persino il combattimento si svolgono a turni selezionando l'azione che il personaggio dovr\u00e0 effettuare cercando di \"prevedere\" ci\u00f2 che far\u00e0 il nemico.\n\nQu\u00ec niente \u00e8 lasciato al caso: le condizioni fisiche, il crafting, tutto \u00e8 stato studiato nei minimi particolari. Il livello di realismo \u00e8 ESTREMO: per esempio se bevete dell'acqua senza prima averla fatta bollire, successivamente ne risentirete. Se trovate un carrello della spesa senza rotelle che potrete magari usare come \"veicolo\" (inteso come mezzo di trasporto per oggetti), lo dovete trascinare a forza, con la conseguenza che vi stancherete prima e avrete pi\u00f9 sete/fame del normale.\n\nOppure: se non avete l'abilit\u00e0 \"Botanica\" tutto ci\u00f2 che troverete nei boschi (funghi, blu berries, red berries ecc...) non saprete se sono commestibili o meno. Potete provarci, ma se sbagliate la pagherete molto cara.\n\nEd \u00e8 fantastico, perch\u00e9 quando farete un errore (ho messo \"quando\" e non \"se\", non a caso...), imparerete qualcosa in pi\u00f9, quindi la prossima volta starete pi\u00f9 attenti.\n\nA proposito di \"prossima volta\"... le locations sono generate randomicamente, quindi ogni volta \u00e8 un'esperienza diversa. Longevit\u00e0 assicurata.\n\nPurtroppo anche in questo caso (come con Terraria) non c'\u00e8 un tutorial, partirete sparati all'arrembaggio. La wiki sar\u00e0 un ottimo punto di partenza (per esempio non sapevo che le ricette occorre metterle in mano per impararle): http://neoscavenger.wikia.com/wiki/NEO_Scavenger_Wiki\n\nConclusione: gioco eccezionale, gi\u00e0 a prezzo pieno ne vale la pena, con gli sconti \u00e8 da prendere assolutamente.

By hardcore, I'm talking perma death, just about everything can kill you easily, and you're kind of lady luck's bitch in regards to how well you can do sometimes. That said, this is a great game. It's a thinking man's title, borderline unfair (I mean that in a begrudging good way),  and it will take you a long time to really master the concept of it. Coupled with a gigantic procedurally generated world and you'll find yourself playing a new set of variables each time, particularly as you can pick a handful of your starting skills before stepping into the frying pan that is NEO Scavenger.\n\nStory-wise, it's kind of an end of the world scenario, except more dealing with mutants, mad men, and bandits, rather than zombies. The plot is kind of backseated to the gameplay, however. I found almost all the NPCs to be universally hostile or locked into a constant fight/flight mentality. Don't expect dialogue or too much revealing information- your character wakes up as a corpsicle in a cryo vat and you're basically thrust into an unknown landscape. You have to gather what you need to survive and you need to do it FAST. Freezing to death is very easy and this game does not hold a newcomer's hand whatsoever. You will be hunted, attacked remorselessly, robbed, and yes, you can literally be killed in one round by the wrong person if you're unlucky. As such, this is about SURVIVAL. Not racking up xp and going nuts with a pea shooter.\n\nWhile I like NEO Scavenger, there's some things that are a needless hassle about the gameplay. The interface is extremely clunky for your items, the crafting system is a bit vague (I have a sharp edge like the recipe says... I can't harvest this dog because...?), and the biggest issue to me, is the game saves via Flash cookies, not on Steam.\n\nImagine my disgust when I kept finding my save games erased after every play session. Hours and hours, gone. So I checked my Flash and found I had it enabled to allow cookies to be saved. So something else was deleting them. According to the developers, it could be one's antivirus or any of a number of things. With all due respect, I don't really care to go searching every minute infrastructural maintenance program I have to find out which program is deleting the cookies beyond Flash and what might need an exclusion to NEO- this should have been saved in the Steam Cloud or however many other games here do it without issue. I really REALLY wish the developers would have done something about this instead forcing the player to find a meta solution. Unfortunately, from what I've read, they're not really doing anymore updates and the game is considered completed. :/ Which is a shame, because I loved everything else about this.\n\nI would heartily recommend NEO but the issue with saves is not something I can overlook after finding this out several hours in. If the developers would or could somehow make the game save within Steam and not through cookies, I will happily change this to a Recommendation.

( particularly campsites )\n- Extremely difficult to complete on your first few runs, requiring you to playthrough once or twice to learn which options to avoid.\n- Limited options for character creation.\n- Very limited building options for shelter / bases.\n\nAll-in i would deffinitely recommend this game if you are into hardcore roguelikes, there is a lot of depth beneath the surface and the randomization and character skill system brings a variety of ways to play the game.

You can also encounter enemies (and you'll sure as hell encounter them), gather in forests, loot in buildings, and just overall scavenge your way to your next safe haven... or unknown!\n\nThe game is very fun and fufils that thrill/gamble factor with almost every action you take, as it is very luck-based with a few ways to bend it in your favor. It can be a little aggrivating on occasion (what game isn't?), but once you master what to look out for and keep in the early stages of the game, it seems pretty much clear sailing.

Maybe you'll take a step back and wonder how things got this way - huddled in some burnt out building, greedily eating packets of ketchup and saltines, washing them down with questionable river water. You might even find yourself in an unthinkable situation. You might manage to hold your own against a bandit. He came upon you while you were sleeping and tried to loot your camp. You woke, and he punched your head in a panic. You stand and brandish a crowbar. He turns to run, but he trips. You seize the opportunity. You strike. Again and again.

I haven't played many like it, and certainly not any that I have enjoyed as much. It's a complicatedly simple game. It nearly masters survival against the elements, finding and cleaning water to drink, gathering plants for food or beating a deer to death with your bare hands for food.\n\nIt's style will put a lot of people off. It is a text game at it's descriptive and story core, something I am absolutely fine with, coupled with a hex based pixelated landscape. The controls are entirely mouse based or a combination of mouse and keyboard, and while it can seem strange and complex at first, a few playthroughs and you'll master them.\n\nAnother thing that will put people off is it's genre. It is that, no common, \"rouge-like.\" When you die, you're kaput for good, and you start another play through. I liken it to Faster Than Light, in that aspect. Not just for it's art style and rouge-likeness, but for how you can upgrade your character, or ship/crew in FTL, and progress in the story only to die horrbily.\n\nOne great thing about NEO Scavenger is it's story. What is its story? I can tell you that you play as Philip Kindred who, after some odd years of cryo-stasis, wakes up in a world vastly different from what used to be. Kindred doesn't know that, of course, since he's conviently lost his memory. That's what you learn at the start, and that's where the story can end for you.\n\nYou can spend all of your time in NEO Scavenger simply getting better loot and surviving for as long as possible. The only way to advance the story is to seek it out activly. On the surface, it's a great survival rouge-like, but under the surface lies a vast and complex story filled with multiple branches, characters, challenges, and intrigue. There is an ending to the game. I didn't even know there was one, and I've been playing since early access. Honestly, I die or screw up before I make it far in the story.\n\nThe storytelling is all driven by you. You see a strange glow at night, follow it for a few days, and suddenly you find yourself surounded by life at the Detriot Mega City. What is this strange DMC? Ask some people, read some newpaper scraps you find while scavenging. Or don't. Go somewhere else, advance the story in a different way. I've found three ways you can \"start\" the story, and all of them require you to think and act proactivly.\n\nThe enemies and lore behind them is also great. I won't spoil what they are, but this game is supposed to be a realistic survival sim-like thing while also having deep roots in the supernatural. If you wonder to yourself,\" Oh my god, what the hell is that creature from the bowels of my worst nightmares,\" then google it and you'll likely find an real urban legend from Michigan that the enemy was based on.\n\nNEO Scavenger is one of the best games in existence, in my opinion. Unlike a lot of other games, it has a demo! If you're on the fence, play the demo. If you think you like it, buy it without a doubt and get into it. I don't rate games, but for the sake of this review, I give it a 9.5/10. Why a 9.5, you ask. Because I'm super biased about this game, but I admit it's not perfect. \n\nSo go play the demo, fall in love, and buy this game. Throw yourself full heartedly into the world and lore that surrounds NEO Scavenger. Explore the DMC, find awesome old-world loot, investigate strange amusement parks, derilect cities, and even face otherworldly horrors in the pursuit of Philip Kindred's epic story.\n\nOr don't. It's up to you, but be warned: you'll likely freeze do death anyway. Seriously, Michigan is cold and it rains a lot. I'm talking ALL the time. Fuck rain.\n\nOh, and go ahead, take off that talisman. Seriously, it's no big deal.\n\nJust don't lose it.

Flora und Fauna oder auch Medizin, Nahkampf, Fernkampf usw) man hat 15 Punkte zur verf\u00fcgung und kann daf\u00fcr entsprechende Skills ausw\u00e4hlen die alle unterschiedliche \"kosten\" haben.

Well, I got drunk one night and impulsively hit 'buy'. So now I have it, and I like it enough to give a review, which I don't usually do.\n\nNEO is brutal. This isn't the type of game where you play the ultra-altruistic \"Hero\" that saves everybody and looks good doing it. You'll live a lot longer if you take the attitude of \"desperate homeless guy that doesn't want to get involved in your shit\". \n\nWhen you die, it's over. No going back to a previous save. You just start over from scratch.\n\nThe learning curve is a little bit steep, but so rewarding once you get there. My first several hours I went through at least half a dozen deaths. I learned to avoid fights. To clean my wounds before bandaging them. I learned to not ever eat yellow berries. I rage quit twice. I came back twice.\n\nNow, I've got a rifle (with ELEVEN bullets!), a warm coat and enough clean water to last me a week. I'm unstoppable, king of all there is in this wasteland. \n\nExcept that I'm not. I still run away from everything that moves, I only camp in secluded buildings, diligently cover my tracks behind me and always keep an eye over my shoulder.\n\nAnd that's how it should be. I survived for this long because I learned how to live in the wasteland. I didn't get a bunch of XP from slaughtering hundreds of enemies and then suddenly become immune to a bullet to the brainpan.\n\nThat's what I love about this game. The \"XP\" is your own damn brain. Learning how to craft the things you need. How to avoid those looters in the distance. Knowing that I've gotten as far as I have by not making mistakes. \n\nNEO has an outrageous amount of complexity that you would never know exists until you go looking for it. If you're on the fence, just buy it. Well worth the money spent.\n\nOne last tip: If you're new, take botany. Makes the game a little more forgiving since you won't really have to worry about food & drink.\n", "timestamp_created": 1439244349, "timestamp_updated": 1439244349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17472929": {"recommendationid": "17472929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064798766", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497313328}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun and detailed game", "timestamp_created": 1439214884, "timestamp_updated": 1439214884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17452256": {"recommendationid": "17452256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021008068", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512346383}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend this game, it is a great survival game as well as it keeps its self interesting with tons of unique events, a couple of very unique locations which your very actions there can lead to profit, horrific injury or even sudden and terrible death, every action you make counts, no way to boil water? take a risk at drinking unidentified water and see if you die or not, hungry as hell nothing to eat? resort to canniblism to much and you go insane, as well as you'll have a faction hunting you down, get to confident? well a couple of dogmen will fix that!

While the game is not without its flaws, I still think it was very worth playing.\n\nThe problem with a review like this is that it is hard to recommend the game without exposing story or gameplay elements that are in a lot of ways crucial to the game experience.  As with many roguelikes, game knowledge is crucial to success.  Unlike many, NEO is on of the few roguelikes that uses fixed story and locations and events.  The random elements come in the form of items found from looting and NPC encounters.  The game does not require any combat to complete it, and much of the items lack the progression and semi-uniqueness found in fantasy roguelikes.  There are shotguns, but no +3 shotguns of ammo conservation.  Skills are chosen at the start of the game and do not improve, and you cannot level up.  Thus a large part of the experience is in exploring the unknown of the map, the story, and the game's mechanics rather than the depth of its progression mechanics.  This is both a unique appeal of the game and a flaw.  It fits the setting and feel of the game with the player as a normal person and lends to a stronger story, but further playthroughs are not so meaningful when you know where to go on the unrandomized map and what dialogue options to choose and what items to craft.  If you want a Binding of Isaac, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, or Tales of Maj'eyal, this is not the same game.\n\nThe story and setting deserve a special mention before I talk about the gameplay.  The content that is there is a good amount of content that allows for diverse approach, good for someone exploring the game for the first time.  However, by the end my feeling was there wasn't nearly enough of it.  The game map is large but a certain portion of the map is lacking in almost any of the game's unique elements.  While the game does indicate the location of a major world feature near the beginning, by chance a new player could decide to explore in the wrong cardinal direction and end up wandering around finding nothing but RNG encounters and generic locales for many many hours.   There are a few locales given extra detail in presentation but with no story attached to them nor reason to revisit, and given the fixed nature of the game's events at this locations it would have been nice for the developers to make more of them.  These and some various 'random' events are presented in a Choose Your Own Adventure book style with events presented in text with a few choices for action.  The fixed events are well written and choices can be very meaningful, but in the random events the choices dont reflect outcomes very well or nearly at all thus making those outcomes feel mostly arbitrary.  Compared to how good the fixed locale events are [spoiler]House at Seven Gables I'm looking at you[/spoiler], the random ones feel like low-effort filler at best and an excuse to abuse the player character at worst when things turn out badly for no good reason.\n\nAdditionally, it is bizarre to me that while the game is a permadeath one it doesn't delete your save after giving you a you a time-limited info dump at the end of the game.  When game knowledge is so crucial to the experience and the story, why freely let the player reload the game at his last save and ask different questions at the info dump?  I'm not against the info dump in principle, its just strange.  This ties into my discussion of game mechanics next as it is important to note here that once you finish the game it becomes apparent that the main thing preventing the player from progressing to the end of the game and rolling the credits is just not knowing where the location for that event is the first time they play.  As I said before, game knowledge and first time experiences are the meat of the game here.\n\nMechanics wise, the game is very solid when it comes to combat and health as well as how it treats item management.  Its a nice unique spin that doesn't just use HP and stat points like most, has some good surprises, and gives the player plenty of incentive to pick any of the skills at character creation.  Hunger, sleep, and weather are important more than just their immediate lethality from running out and triggering a game over.  Combat has a great mix of options and interactions as you play out whether you attack or wait for a good moment, or space yourself and try to run.  The only real disappointment I had with the game's item selection is that there wasn't MORE to pick from!  I wanted more cool things to find from poking around city ruins and by the time you finish the game you will very likely see every item the game has to offer with no +3 shotguns to spice up the mix.  Item crafting is slightly clunky but useful, but again only game knowledge prevents you from crafting one of the best melee weapons in the game two minutes in.  The game even has diseases but [spoiler] it is practically inevitable that during the normal course of the game the player character will become infected with a disease that for any non-wiki spoiled player will be almost unavoidably lethal[/spoiler], which makes for a very odd check of the player's skill.  \n\nLastly, the permadeath nature of the game is a strong contributor to the feeling of being a very mortal normal person that the game tries to present.  I clocked in 46 hours into the game, most of it in a fairly exploratory playthough where I spend a fairly good amount of time hording supplies and  preparing for unknowns with caution.   This felt appropriate, and I still died quite a few times despite my preparation.  I engaged in a fairly modest amount of savescumming for this one playthrough. and it is only apparent afterwards that the preparation wasn't so necessary and that the unique locales and events therein are not required to finish the game.  Again, the wonder of the game is in your first time experiencing what it has to offer.  Either I was supposed to learn to be more YOLO and careless and suicide rush to find new unexplored content, or I was expected to make an even larger time sink than I did from my cautious play.  46 hours is a lot, so seeing a sort of soft-death (such as saving only every 3 in game days or the like) might have been nicer than permadeath or savescumming.\n\nAll in all, I loved the game's mechanics and the genuinely emotion invoking experiences it provided.  Absolutely worth the full $15 in my mind.  I would highly reccomend it to those wanting a story and setting focused roguelike, less so to those not experienced with the genre.

First of all, the game is out of Early Access and is feature complete(to my knowledge), and does have an end-game scenario. It's just not that easy to do. 195 hours in the game and I have yet to \"beat\" it. Ususally for me the story comes second to the survival gameplay. The story is unique and interesting from what I've uncovered(and read about), though some things can take a long time to complete, and usually I'll die before I come close to completing my objective.\n\nThis brings me to my second point. The game is hard, yes, but it's not as impossible as some people make it out to be. Jumping right in to the game with no prior knowledge, like I did, will be tough. You'll die quite often until you start to make some sense of the mechanics and gameplay. You will also get unlucky at times and be woken from a dead sleep by a creature which can mess you up bad. But, like I said, it's not impossible. You just need to try new skill combinations and ways of going through the world. Taking the strong/tough perks will allow you to wreck NPCs that you come across, but when you're faced with a life or death story scenario, you may not be as well equipped to deal with dangers as you may have thought. At the time of writing this, I've been playing a no-combat-skills build. I've taken Hacking, Medic, Botany, Lockpicking, Eagle Eye, Tracking, Athletic and Electrician, along with Fragile and Insomniac for the extra points. I've been playing this character for three or four real life days now, and I've gone through at least thirty in-game days. Without dying. \n\nPlaying like this forces you to reconsider everything you've been doing. Before, I'd walk right up to that feral dog and turn it in to a pin cushion with my bow. Now though, I'm fragile and unskilled at any combat. All I have for protection is a war club, which, in my hands, is about as deadly as a shoe. If I even see a feral dog, I'm headed in a new direction. I've also found out that running away [i] is fucking useful! [/i]. I may not be able to kill that guy and eat his body, but I'm alive for another day. And I didn't even need his man meat. I've got the botany skill and can just forage around some forests and fill up on berries. In this current game, I've also not used any noise traps when I sleep, because I don't have the room. I get burdened easy, and only carry a couple small backpacks. Still, I have yet to die. \n\nYou just need to think a little before commiting to an action. Before I try to get some rest, I hide and wait for a few turns to see if anyone's in the area. If no one has wandered into my camp, I sleep. And since I have insomnia, I usually wake up before anything gets too close to me. I know there's a terrible and unfortunate death waiting for me in the future, but until then I'll keep scouring this wasteland, looking for the RFID spoofing software I need in order to advance a story encounter I have yet to complete.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, but for me, it's definitely in my top 5. It's easy enough to pick up and play for 30 minutes of down time, or I can spend hours in the game, completely immersed and elated when I find a text file worth nearly $2000 in a laptop that's been sitting in a building for years, and which would have been useless to me were it not for the hacking trait. \n\nIf you're undecided, just play the demo or watch some videos. There's quite a bit of content missing from the demo, but you'll get the gist of things and be able to make a more informed decision on whether or not this is your type of game. To anyone buying this game, I sincerely hope you like it, as it's like no other game I've played before, and absolutely one of my favorites.

It can be truly unforgiving, but that to me was one of the things that drew me into the world of NEO Scavenger. The survival aspect is a lot more engaging to me than most other survival type games I've played, and you quickly learn to pick your battles very carefully. Just like in reality, a single wound can end up killing you if you're careless and don't have access to modern medicine, and nature itself can be equally lethal. This is something I've found to be missing from most other survival games. \n\n\nThe story is fairly interesting as well, but some of the choice based encounters are a bit harsh. And losing a character that survived for a long time in one of those is rarely fun. Still, the game kept drawing me back in until I had beaten it, and I'm looking forward to what the developer has in store for us next.\n\nIf you want a challenge, love the roguelike aspect of dead is dead in a post apocalyptic setting and can look past the graphics then you can't really go wrong with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1435704411, "timestamp_updated": 1435710416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16803535": {"recommendationid": "16803535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027936826", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489886418}, "language": "english", "review": ">Found decent clothing\n>Didn't die from hypothermia\n>Crafted a sling\n>Beated some bad muthas\n>Got some nice loot\n>Made a good camp in some woods\n>Hunted dogs and deer for food\n>Everything goes pretty well\n>Crafted a bow and some arrows\n>Ambushed a stranger\n>Shot him in the stomach\n>Stranger took off the arrow\n>Stabbed me in the chest\n>Kicked me until death\n\nRespect for that badass stranger. 11/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1435646711, "timestamp_updated": 1435646711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16800834": {"recommendationid": "16800834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156542182", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520433761}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of the best if not best survival games I've ever played.\nI played the demo for a few months on Blue Bottle Games site and I fell in love with it, I spent hours playing, crafting, getting as far as I could then starting all over again.

Each number, represents a different game from the start.\n\n1. I came out of the building, felt disoriented and not sure what to do. Something nasty came to me and attacked. I tried to defend myself but I bled out after the series of injuries.\n\n2. This time I had time to wander some more, I found some mushrooms, berries, sharpened a big stick and waited for trouble... but I froze to death.\n\n3. Shortly after I came out, the feral dog sneaked on me and attacked. I was fighing furiously with my punches, until I damaged his brain with concussions. I would have never thought that reading about the combat could be so exciting: bruises, cuts, bites, concussions, bleedings... all those details were amazing. My brain did the rest, imaging myself fighting for life with this dog. When he dropped dead, I patched up my wounds, took some painkillers and gutted him, took 2 small pieces of raw meat into my small medkit and moved along to find some clothes before I freeze to death again. I went to the city and scavenged it. I found plenty of goody goodies: crowbar with strap, binoculars with strap too!, cardboard box, cargo pants (with pockets!=more slots, yea!), T-shirt and some straps. Now, I am afraid to go out, because I don't want to loose all my treasure :( . T-shirt, cargo pants, hospistal gown on top of it all, holding crowbar in one hand and cardboard box with my treasure in the other one... time to move on. I go to the next building, I must be lucky, plenty of other  goods but I have no space to take it... First dillemma: break bottle and use it to make small campfire or leave it as a container for water later on? To hell with it... I might not live so long and I need warmth. OMFG! I had not enough points and had to end the turn, now the sun is gone... After a while it came out again, now I sit in front of a campfire, eating a cooked dog meat and think what to do next. The fire is not big enough, I move to the forest for more wood, some stranger attacks me, I try to talk to with him, he's confused but still charges at me... Time to cave his head in with the brand new crowbar. WTF!? He is some kind of a boxer! He keeps punching me and avoiding my crowbar! I cough up with blood and have got internal bleeding! After a short fight, I pass out and this guy is checking for loot on me... I wake up, beaten drastically, he retreated. MOTHERF**ER stole my cardboard box with goodies!!! I was on my way back to the camp when I have found an old car and a sleeping bag in it. Resting in the filhty but warm sleeping bag in abandoned IT office building, curing my heavy injuries, a mysterious horror creature woke me up. I had to run away, leaving my sleeping bag behind... After a while of running away, I had to go back, the cold rain has started to rain and it was a night... I know that my end is near but I keep sneaking in the dark trying to get into my warm sleeping bag... I just hope it is not sleeping in it... LMAO I threatened it with my crowbar and it ran away!!! I can't believe it!@ Sleeping, resting and healing in my precious filthy sleeping bag. After many hours, something is creeping on me once again. It's dark and we do not see each other yet, I will run away, I need some water anyways. It was a feral dog, I took some bites and I am bleeding but the dog is dead. I rest some more, take a bottle and go to look for some water, I find a small lake, drink a lot and take some with me, in a small plastic bottle.\n\nNO SAVE DATA FOUND... great... just f*cking great... Game is made in flash, so when I was cleaning my pc with ccleaner, it must have deleted some macromedia old cookies and my save file... how f*ucking hard can it be, to make seperate none-flash savegame file!?\n\n4. Tracked and killed by Merga Wraith\n\n5. - Chopped a poor fellow to death with a meat cleaver... He refused to fall back. No regrets.\n\n- WTF!? I met three bandits cooking something (I was hungry), there was also a terrified woman with a little baby in her arms. I had not a lot of options, but I think I have picked the wrong one! They have cracked her skull with a crowbar!!! \" What happens next is not worth mentioning, apart from feed. You can't remember how long it's been since you have eaten that well.\" WTF HAVE I DONE!?\n\n- apart from all that, I am doing incredibly well. Got two shoes, nice clothes, meat cleaver to defend myself, made a campfire and cleaned some dirt rags for future needs. The only thing that bothers me is the guy with a rifle wandering around me somewhere.\n\n- ok he tried to kill me when I went to sleep! He shot at me! I took cover and now he offers to talk! Oh, no buddy I am coming to get your with my meat cleaver now! He keeps shooting and missing because I use covers, soon brand new rifle with a scope will be mine!

Inside these an assortment of the finest junk ever seen by man: Empty bottles, cigarette lighter, a t-shirt, twigs, a sauce pan and even more crumpled plastic bags, in case the current ones rip apart. Let me tell you, plastic bags are the superior container for almost anything you might want to carry at some point in the post-apocalypse.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2K3mihtzrA\n\nOh and don\u2019t drink unboiled water \u2013 I did and it was a mistake. A few days later while trying to sneak up to a sleeping stranger at night (To rob him, obviously; I needed a pair of new shoes), I got diarrhea. Uncontrollable stomach cramps made me fall down and curl up into a ball. The moaning woke up the stranger who\u2019s been in a very bad mood. I started to bleed from my nose \u2013 probably from a virus like cholera I\u2019ve ingested by drinking the water from a pond days earlier. I was indeed particularly thirsty the last few days.\nThe stranger sprinted towards me and a few moments later, without asking questions, he clubbed me to death with the butt of his rifle \u2013 not because of my pain, but to conserve ammo. I think it was for the best, I would have died from internal bleeding anyway. My life was over before I even knew it.\n\nThe interesting part here is that all of this did not feel \u201cunfair\u201d; I made a mistake hours before (drinking contaminated water) and could have prevented it (by boiling the water).

Combine...and see what happens.\n-The turn-based battle system with different movesets depending on your talents is functional and efficent. That feeling of satisfaction when you stab a feral dog to death with a wooden spear crafted by your own hands and sharpened with a glass shard.\n-The storyline so far is intriguing and you get this sense of \"Where am I? Who am I? What is going on?\" constantly.\n-Because of the game's setting and environment, finding so much as a shopping bag to hold your stuff feels like the greatest success. You'll know what I mean when you play.\n-The idea of drinking water straight from a pond is hazardous at best.\n-Eat berries, dog flesh, human flesh, cooked food, soup, scavenged snack cakes. The world is your buffet table!\n-Josh Culler's submissions for the soundtrack of this game are short...but VERY, VERY suitable. \n\nCONS:\n-The game is programmed for Flash. Depending on your PC and stats and some measure of bad luck-you ARE going to get some frustrate-level crashes. Save often and make sure the game doesn't bug out randomly because it pretty much means you're going to lose your progress. It doesn't happen often but when it does...damn. Hard luck. TIP: run the game in fullscreen and set your cache for Flash at 10MB to prevent random lockups.\n-The game tilts itself against you unfairly sometimes, especially when you decide to settle down in an area for extended time and the enemy spawn rate tends to increase. Not exactly fair when you're someone who likes having a \"base\" to call home but the gameplay is meant to keep you mobile. Not stuck in one spot. Explore at will but know that if you hang around somewhere long enough, the game WILL start pushing you out to go do something else or go somewhere.\n-The amount of enemies that can populate one tile per battle sometimes goes a little overboard. Nothing more rage inducing than getting strangled to death in your sleep by 4 enemies, 3 of whom took apart your noise traps and the other strangled you to death with a pounce. Not sure if this is intentional but it still is frustrating when it happens.\n-Not all the recipes work seamlessly. Sometimes you HAVE to check your recipe book to see if you've learned it by accident and you need to click the RECIPE to craft said item in the first place.\n-No way to repair items CURRENTLY at the time of this review without mod assistance. It's pretty annoying to have to play vanilla, find a backpack on 3% and lose it the next turn to decay, go play a mod and then come back to find out that there are still some minor frustrations.\n\nThe reason I approve this game is because the community contributes ideas, help, bug reports and helps design its own mods. So far there's 3 main stable ones that are available at the website forums and they add SO MUCH to the game already. You know you've succeeded with a game when people are climbing over themselves to add content and mods to your game, free of charge. \n\nVERDICT:\nBuy this if you like roguelikes, turn based and making decisions via micromanagement of inventory and move turns. You'll spend a good few hours with this game and still find yourself coming back for more. The gods help you if you add a mod. Might as well quit your day job while you're ahead! :D\n\nAnd now for your typical funny lines: \n\nAlways use Botany.\n\nWounds infected?\nTannin Tea!\n\nThirsty?\nTannin Tea!\n\nPooping blood?\nTannin Tea!\n\nVomiting?\nTannin Tea!\n\nWanna make money?\nTannin Tea!\n\nInfected and sick?\nTannin Tea!\n\nSurrounded by 6 Dogmen and all you have is a rock?\nTannin Tea!\n\nTannin Tea!

She is probably going to die of an infection, but hey he gave me 500 dollars so who's complaining?\n\nDay 40: finally got to a civilized area, I got in line to get in the city but I wasn't allowed in because I didn't have what appears to be a bracelet for cool kids. Right after that some dude with a neat hat told me to follow him, I didn't listen to him because he was boring, when he began looking at me like he wanted an answer I got nervous and shouted \"it's a trap!\", he was impressed of my trap finding skills so he gave me a cool kids bracelet or something. I put it on so I looked cool in front of the people who kicked nerds out of the line to the city, when they saw my watch they let me in. Luckily because I sold my twenty left footed gumboots and some poisonous berries I was able to afford eye surgery\n\nDay 50: I set up three noise traps, one tarp shelter and a sleeping bag somewhere in the forest, also I killed around six Dogmen without being hit. I also learned to make tea.... that's cool right? Anyway I digress, later that day I was stabbed by some cultist from Isis or blue frog, one of those two, so I poured some boiled water onto my open wound and covered it with a clean piece of cloth. Now there is a 0% chance of getting an infection\n\nDay 60: people started running away from me on sight, maybe it has to do with the fact I'm wearing the skin of a Dogman as a vest and squirrels as gloves not to mention I'm carrying a loaded hunting rifle while having one strapped to my back with no ammo. I also have a nifty broad spear that is covered with the blood of my past twenty or so enemies, also I have a sled with extra fire wood in it\n\nDay 65: a melon head was no nice as to bring me a shopping cart basket with no wheels! That is now where I'm going keep all 10 of my left footed shoes.\nI've been proceeding to kill as many evil people as I can, I don't care if they won't bother me I kill them because them because they are on my lawn, I only spare ATN warriors and any other possible neutral that is holding a gun.\n\nDay 70: Never taking my talisman off again.... Don't ask why...\n\nDay 80: Just remembered I was supposed to talk to that guy with the hat like 39 days ago. Better not go back there, instead I will go explore whatever is north from my base\n\nDay 83: the nearest source of water is 3 hexes away, better drink my own piss\n\nDay 84: Note to self the yellow liquid is not piss, it is an energy drink\n\nDay 85: I was almost starving to death until I came across a true messiah, a looter with tomato sauce sachets it was so nice of him to uhh\u2026 die for me\n\nDay 86: I just ate four forest hexes worth of edible berries and mushrooms\n\nDay 90: I am beginning an investment; from this day forth I swear to sell all of my Dogmen skin to replace my eyes with robotic night vision ones. Or so the people around the city for cool kids said I could\n\nDay 100: Came back to base, I found several guns and some ammo during the scavenging\n\nDay 105: I made a sling, time to get some looters \u2018stoned\u2019\n\nDay 110: Today I was shot by a Bad Mutha who had a pistol. Rocks weren\u2019t working so I killed him with my spear and soaked the wound with alcohol and bandaged it with clean rags.

It *LOOKS* rough on the edges but is actually incredibly well made. \n\n* TL;DR*\nWell made game about making tough decisions to survive a wasteland in a rogue-like setting. Almost a Darksouls/Fallout child with survival and exploration focus. Prepare to die, pretty often, and have fun.\n* *\n\nThe game is all about making those tough decisions. From the get go what traits you feel you'll need or use best, and what hindrances you're willing to cope with to take on all of those useful traits/skills. \nFairly regular scenarios in which you make decisions based on the items you have, the skills you've acquired, and your environment, whether it be setting up camp in a crumbling building or out in the woods, to drink water of questionable origins, eating berries that may or may not be poisonous (a choice you can ignore with the botany skill), knowing eating said berries could stave your growing hunger a little longer, but also that it may end your game with you sweating and shitting your life away... unless you find the right medicines. Was that the red pill or the blue pill (should've taken the medic skill)? \n\nThis game pulls no punches. It's hard, it's frustrating, and it can feel like your progressing very slowly... and you will. But you'll learn. You'll find what works for you. If that's a spear-wielding bandit, preying on others, chopping off their legs for a nice roast, go do it! If you want to hide in the forest, hunting game, living off berries and scattering sound and animal traps amidst your domain, go haunt those woods why don't you? \n\nThe game's replay value is high. (Mostly) randomly generated, with no real reason to follow the story except personal interests. If you want to make a life for yourself in the wastes, there's nothing (but everything) to stop you.

Ultimately the scavenging and crafting are alright but the combat system is really what gets me.

Scavenger bedeutet unter anderem auch Aasfresser, also Tiere, deren haupts\u00e4chliche Nahrung aus Kadavern besteht. Das Bild eines Menschen, der ein altes Geb\u00e4ude seiner letzten wertvollen Bestandteile, quasi seiner Innerein beraubt, hat durchaus etwas Hy\u00e4nenhaftes. Darum sage ich: Herzlich willkommen in der Welt von Neo Scavenger, wo die Hy\u00e4ne lacht und der L\u00f6we stolpert - oder stirbt.\n\nAlle Metaphern verdaut und noch dabei? Neo Scavenger bietet schwere rundenbasierte Kost im postapokalyptischen Michigan. Doch bevor unser Charakter mit dem Namensb\u00e4ndchen am Arm aus dem K\u00e4lteschlaf erwacht, d\u00fcrfen wir Ihn mit einigen n\u00fctzlichen F\u00e4higkeiten ausstatten, die ihn ausserhalb seiner Kapsel am Leben erhalten. Dabei hat der Spieler eine m\u00f6gliche Anzahl an Slots, die durch einzelne Skills belegt werden. St\u00e4rke klaut mehr Platz als Elektrik, Mechanik nutzt gesundes Mittelma\u00df. Genau hier wird festgelegt, was ihr sp\u00e4ter beherrscht. Die Starken k\u00f6nnen mehr tragen und sind geschickt im Nahkampf, Mechaniker reparieren T\u00fcren, Trapper bzw. Fallensteller sind gut im Verwischen von Spuren und wer Fernkampf w\u00e4hlt hat bessere Chancen darauf, mit seiner Schleuder auch mal zu treffen. Wer mehr Slots braucht, kann seinem Charakter z.B. Insomnia, sprich Schlaflosigkeit spendieren. Eure Spielfigur wird dann deutlich schlechter einschlafen und f\u00fchlt sich dadurch deutlich weniger ausgeruht, hat dann aber mehr Slots f\u00fcr weitere Skills. Dazu rate ich nur sehr erfahrenen Spielern.\n\nIn der Welt angekommen, wird man direkt mit der ersten Bedrohung konfrontiert, welche man als taktisches Tutorial betrachten sollte. Bei dieser wie auch vielen anderen Begegnungen hat man die M\u00f6glichkeit, vorhandene Skills oder Gegenst\u00e4nde einzusetzen um den Ausgang zu beeinflussen. Springe ich aus dem Fenster und verletze mich wom\u00f6glich? Nutze ich den Elektriker in mir und verschlie\u00dfe einfach die T\u00fcr? Im weiteren Verlauf des Spiels werdet Ihr auf viele weitere Gegner treffen. Kommt es zum gewaltsamen Aufeinandertreffen, wechselt das Spiel in den Kampfmodus. Dabei sollte man weder tolle Zwischensequenzen noch animierte 3D-Modelle erwarten. Dieses Spiel arbeitet viel mit Text, daf\u00fcr ausf\u00fchrlich und in einer Art und Weise, die es erm\u00f6glicht jeden Umstand im Geist zu visualisieren. Dazu passt dann auch die relativ schlichte 2D-Pixelgrafik, bei der trotzdem jeder Gegenstand klar und deutlich definiert wirkt. Der Kampf ist rundenbasiert und ben\u00f6tigt jede Runde eine ausgew\u00e4hlte Aktion. Die Bandbreite reicht von Weglaufen, In Deckung gehen bis hin zu Fallen stellen oder Kopfn\u00fcsse verteilen, geizt aber manchmal nicht mit unerwarteten und unsch\u00f6nen Zuf\u00e4llen. Wenn der L\u00f6we stolpert..\n\nDie Karte, auf der wir uns getreu dem Rundenmotto mit Bewegungspunkten von einem Hexaeder zum n\u00e4chsten bewegen, ist isometrisch, schlicht aber aussagekr\u00e4ftig. Gro\u00dfe Arien lauscht man hier vergeblich, erlebt aber zweckm\u00e4\u00dfige Musik, die ein glaubw\u00fcrdiges Endzeitszenario erzeugt. Ist das Wetter schlecht, wird es Nacht, die Spielfigur Barfuss oder das Terrain unwegsam, stehen mir weniger Bewegungspunkte zur Verf\u00fcgung. Nutze ich Sonderaktionen wie Spuren verwischen oder \"Verstecken\", steigt der Verbrauch der Bewegungspunkte pro Zug. Gezogen wird bis alle Punkte auf 0 sinken oder der Zug selbstst\u00e4ndig beendet wird. Dabei ist wo und wann entscheidend f\u00fcr euer weiteres Dasein. Soll sich die Spielfigut ausruhen, bet\u00e4tigt man das Kommando Sleep und euer Alter Ego wird sich an Ort und Stelle niederlassen. Drei Balken werden euch dann darauf hinweisen, wie gut ihr vor Umwelteinfl\u00fcssen gesch\u00fctzt seid, wie erholsam eurer Schlaf wird und wie schnell ihr auf ungew\u00fcnschte Eindringlinge aufmerksam werden, sprich: aufwacht. Im Zweifelsfall kann man sich merken: Wer sich ungesch\u00fctzt den Gezeiten aussetzt oder gut sichtbar auf einem H\u00fcgel schl\u00e4ft, wird zwangsl\u00e4ufig bald sterben.\n\nNeo Scavenger ist nicht einfach nur ein Spiel ums \u00dcberleben, nein ich wage zu behaupten, es ist der Prototyp. Halbnackt werdet ihr mit allen Widrigkeiten konfrontiert, die das postapokalyptische \u00d6dland zu bieten hat. Denn wer schon mit leichter Unterk\u00fchlung aufbricht, wird nicht lange unterwegs sein..\nKurzum: Wer nicht isst, stirbt.  Wer nicht trinkt, stirbt. Wer nicht schl\u00e4ft oder zuviel tr\u00e4gt ist zu ersch\u00f6pft um weiterzulaufen - und stirbt. Und im Gegensatz zu anderen Survivals hat der Spieler kein vorgefertigtes Inventar. Er hat 2 H\u00e4nde. Mit viel Gl\u00fcck findet ihr am Anfang eine Plastikt\u00fcte oder eine Jeans, in der ihr wenigstens ein St\u00fcck Fleisch lagern k\u00f6nnt. Erfrieren erw\u00e4hnte ich bereits, bleibt also noch verbluten. Verletzungen k\u00f6nnen durch viele Umst\u00e4nde entstehen. Ursache Nr.1 bleibt zwar der Kampf gegen andere \u00d6dlandbewohner, allerdings k\u00f6nnen auch Geb\u00e4ude einst\u00fcrzen w\u00e4hrend der Spieler pl\u00fcndert. Das ist mir zwar erst einmal passiert, war dann allerdings umso \u00e4rgerlicher als ich starb. Und Neo Scavenger kennt nur tot - oder lebendig. Gespeichert wird beim Verlassen des Spiels,  wer stirbt darf daraus lernen und von vorn beginnen. Zur\u00fcck zur Ersten Hilfe. \n\nVerletzungen k\u00f6nnen unterschiedlich stark und gef\u00e4hrlich sein. Das geht von Kratzern \u00fcber Schnitte bis hin zu Br\u00fcchen. Und wie alles in diesem Spiel, werden auch diese nicht wie von Geisterhand abheilen sondern ben\u00f6tigen zur Heilung eine realistische Vorgehensweise. Wunden sollte man auswaschen um eine Infektion zu vermeiden, alte Stofffetzen mit Alkohol desinfizieren und dann als Bandage nutzen. \u00c4ste k\u00f6nnen in Kombination mit Pelz zu einer behelfsm\u00e4\u00dfigen Schiene umfunktioniert werden. Erfindungsreichtum ist gefragt. F\u00fcr viele im Spiel vorhanden Rezepte sind unterschiedliche L\u00f6sungen m\u00f6glich. Eine Fackel muss nicht zwangsl\u00e4ufig aus Ast und Stoff bestehen, sofern ein Stab und etwas brennbares verbaut wird. Eine Plane, ein paar St\u00f6cker und B\u00e4nder lassen sich zum wiederverwendbaren Zelt umbauen und und und..\n\nWas ist nun eigentlich das Ziel eurer Entbehrungen, Schmerzen und Anstrengungen? Abseits von Hunger, Durst und Kampf wollt Ihr nat\u00fcrlich wissen: Wer bin Ich und was mache Ich hier? Wie der Spieler dem nachgeht bleibt ihm \u00fcberlassen. Verfolgt die Story indem ihr Hinweisen nachgeht, euch mit Kultisten austauscht und Richtung Detroit aufbrecht oder verharrt im \u00d6dland und erlebt, wie lange ihr durchhaltet. Dabei m\u00f6chte ich nochmal kurz ins Tierreich abgleiten. Wer immer L\u00f6we ist, in den Kampf rauscht und f\u00fcr sich das Recht des St\u00e4rkeren beansprucht, wird m\u00f6glicherweise schneller sterben als ihm lieb ist.

Don't waste your time and money.\n\n* Unweildy Menu Navigation\nThe game plays in a window by default, which in and of itself isn't a bad thing. The problem comes when trying to back out of a menu just to end up closing the entire game instead (and losing any progress in the process). The menus themselves, such as inventory, crafting and the map are not very intuitve and require a lot of trial-and-error to figure them out. Saving a game is unweildy, too, because there is only one option; \"Save & Quit\" from the main menu. \n\n* Lack of Information and Direction\nVery little information is given for each item beyond \"condition\" which is how well in a state of repair an item is. For example, when tying to compare weapons, stats such as range and damage are inaccesable to the player; You have to guess which weapons may or may not be better! Same goes for clothing; There are no stats beyond condtion that tell a player how well protected they are. Lack of stats and lack of other useful information leaves the player in the dark. Trial and error helps, but the game is so inconsitant that trial and error will only get you so far.\n\n* Nearly Impossible Early Game\nI like a challange, but this game has too many variables. The map, encounters and looting are all random, which could be a good thing. However, the game starts you out with next to nothing and already suffering from exposure to cold weather. When you need some basic supplies just to survive, and the only way to get those supplies is by a series of lucky random events, then the game becomes more about luck-of-the-draw and less about any real strategy.\n\n* Bad Combat Encounters\nOn top of just trying to survive the elements, there are things out there that want to kill you, and you have next to nothing to fight back with! Your choices are fight with a poorly-designed combat mechanism or try to run and ineveitably get overrun anyway. Even if you win the fight, it's likely you will succumb to the injuries sustained in combat, because you don't have the supplies you need to properly treat yourself.\n\nSo on top on the bad, unhelpful UI design are a series of random events that will kill you rather quickly, because you never get a chance to get what you need to survive. This game is NOT fun, but rather frustrating, to have to start over and over again and get nowhere in the process.

This is the game in its entirety. I've played several survivor horror games in the past and I was looking forward to something different. Text/ turn based survival horror appealed to me.  At first, you kinda have to get used to the controls. Click this tab to do this, click this tab to do that. Click this button to turn off the text so you can do the only thing available to do. Speaking of, skills in this game are pretty much worthless. \n Ya, some skills actually do stuff. Melee does help in combat, you can Hide while you explore the map, Botany gives you more loot to choose from in forest tiles, some cutscene you use tracking to reveal more text about something that happened when they just could have told you in the first place what happened. Other skills don't matter. Mechanical and Hide give you the ability to scavange buildings safely but reduce the probability of loot while scavenging.  Medic give you the ability to scavenge for medical supplies in the spawn point and gives you better healing but if you don't have any medicine ...who cares! \n Your best bet is to hit the road and gather as much as you can to help you survive. The very first town you find will give you a cutscene and a little back story and that's usually it. Most times than not, this town is empty of stuff to take. So, you move out and explore the area around. And as you wander, in the cold and rain, you start suffering from hypothermia. You \"could\" build a fire but in the thirty five- fourty games straight that I played (because you almost always die within the first two in game days) I've found a lighter twice. \n Now, as you reach near death due to freezing to death , you get a cutscene about an abondoned car. The car has a sleeping bag inside and if you use the Tracking skill, you will find one left boot. You can grab the sleeping bag and carry it to your camp, which camps always attract dogs, and if a dog or a soldier doesn't come into your camp and kill you, you can sleep for a few hours and warm up . But that just slows the inevitable.

Y la desesperaci\u00f3n de conseguir recursos est\u00e1 muy conseguida. Un Fallout en toda regla.\n\nLa profundidad de interacci\u00f3n con el mundo es muy elevada, aunque a\u00fan no he avanzado lo suficiente como para tener muchas charlas con los personajes. Mantenerse vivo es lo que m\u00e1s nos va a costar y divertir. Formas de morir hay muchas, incluso las b\u00e1sicas, como morir de fr\u00edo, sed o hambre.\n\nLa m\u00fasica y el sonido, ni destacable ni pobre.\n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos, son su punto d\u00e9bil, aunque son lo suficientemente buenos como para no causar repulsa. De vez en cuando tenemos alguna imagen de ambientaci\u00f3n.\n\nEl juego est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s, y comprender los textos es importante. Tampoco hay prisa ya que se trata de un juego a turnos y pod\u00e9is consultar un diccionario. Es importante que sep\u00e1is todo lo que leeis para disfrutar correctamente de la ambientaci\u00f3n, debido a la falta de gr\u00e1ficos impactantes.\n\nLa fabricaci\u00f3n de objetos es muy amplia aunque al principio, cuando no lo entendemos, nos pueda resultar frustrante. Asi que aconsejo empezar cogiendo alguna habilidad inicial de profesi\u00f3n (trampero por ejemplo) y ver las recetas que tenemos desbloqueadas desde el principio gracias a ella. Una vez que dominemos la ventana de crafting, podemos pasar si queremos a poner los objetos directamente. Aunque si os gusta descubrir recetas por vosotros mismos, adelante.\n\nEl mejor consejo es: no mir\u00e9is una gu\u00eda. El juego se disfruta mucho a base de morir y aprender. No hace falta tener unos conocimientos extremadamente amplios como en Dwarf Fortress.\n\n\nPD Es posible que se os borren partidas si ten\u00e9is algo que borre cookies en vuestro ordenador.

The interplay between different systems and the really neat environment and design decisions should have made a great game.\n\nIt didn't. There's not enough content for this game to shine, and because there's so little content the problems it has are made starkly apparent. Permadeath is not an inherently good or bad decision, but what it does in a game like NEO Scavenger is force the player through the same few bits of content over and over again. That content has an optimized solution, which means the first 5-10 minutes of every play-through are doing the exact same thing, every time, with no reason or reward from deviating from it. And then you end up at one of the pieces of game content that you _did_ play before, with functionally identical choices. And then you die, fairly or unfairly (and this game _loves_ unfair deaths; there are a number of places where you can die in a narrative scene because you didn't tag a skill!), and you get to do it again.\n\nA simulation game has to hide its brain to be deeply rewarding.

To be honest, I didn't even like the game at first until I'd suffered about ten deaths or so. Then I began to understand and get a glimpse of what the game had to offer. Like when I let a bandit limp away from a fight only for him to come back five turns later to kill me in my sleep with the cleaver I left behind at a salvage site a few tiles away.\n\nIt also sometimes feels like you aren't making any progress since it's so easy to die (permadeath), but soon you realize that you're surviving a little longer every attempt - 3 days, 5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks. And the game just gets better and better as you begin to master it. What used to seem like a basic combat system turns out to be a nuanced one. What used to seem like a pointless skill/ability becomes your favorite. etc.\n\nMy only complaint is that the UI is sometimes a bit tedious. For example, having to put down the sleeping bag every night and remember to pick it back up in the morning. Or doing the same 10-mouseclick dance with the crafting system to chop wood, light a fire, cook meat, and then eat the meat. But then again, you're usually so happy to find meat that 10 or so clicks is a small price to pay.\n\nAlso, due to the crafting system UI, it's tedious to answer the question: \"What can I craft with the things I currently have in my inventory?\" As I accumulate items, I often find myself flipping through my recipes to see if I can make anything useful, only to do it again in five turns to see if anything changed. The game would benefit from a quick-view of \"Here are the items you can currently craft\" with the ability to click those items to instantly make them.\n\nHowever, the grid-based inventory management system is a fun minigame in itself. It really is addictive to answer questions like \"Should I put the pistol with zero bullets in my pocket or should I fill my pocket with these gummy bears?\" - Oh wait, your worn-out pants are going to disintegrate in about five turns, but you'll probably get hunted down by a mutant wolf before you have to deal with that.\n\nGood luck!", "timestamp_created": 1429824792, "timestamp_updated": 1429825141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15509548": {"recommendationid": "15509548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042341365", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458329790}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game!", "timestamp_created": 1429824631, "timestamp_updated": 1429824631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15508832": {"recommendationid": "15508832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067526704", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498098617}, "language": "english", "review": "78 hours and I'm still enjoying the hell outta this game", "timestamp_created": 1429821257, "timestamp_updated": 1429821257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15506708": {"recommendationid": "15506708", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971089512", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479526955}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great because it gives a feeling of gritty realism while only simulating things that are actually interesting to play.

As you exit the last house on the street tearing an old tee shirt into rags, suddenly hearing a loud clatter you throw yourself to the ground and watch as a large figure resembling Werewolf from old story's lumbers past. It passes by and you release a breath you didn't know you where holding in. Unslinging the rifle from your shoulder you top off the magazine, fighting a dog man today is not something you wish to happen.\n \n       A few days later you stand atop a hill scanning the area with half a binocular you keep slung around your neck searching for any movement while munching on a handful of berries. After several hours you see the flash a blue sash moving out of the tree line, a blue frog preacher not friendly and normally carrying somewhat valuable objects you will have no remorse from ending this ones life. Moving closer as to not waste your valuable ammunition you line up a shot from your rifle. With a loud accompanying crack the figure drops to the ground motionless. as you get close the man jumps to his feet and sprints back into the tree line, Swear under your breath you give chase into the dense forest.\n\n       He couldnt have gotten far you think to yourself examining the blood trail. The trees seem to press closer on you and your draw a small revolver from your cargo pants pocket, your rifle would be ineffective at these close ranges. The blue sash makes it easy to find the lifeless body after a few minutes. Your so focous on looting the corpse you almost don't hear the rustle of foliage, you grab your pistol from where it lay beside the body and scan the woods searching for the source of the sound. A single shot whipes by your head and you throw yourself behind a log still searching for your attacker. You take a deep breath staying here is suicide, you lung forward from behind the log in a full on sprint. Stumbling over the overgrown roots of the trees you feel relieved as you see the light streaming for the edge of the forest. In all fairness you almost make it before the second shot rings out catching you in the leg. Gritting your teeth against the pain you fire blindly behind you as you break out into the field. You leap into the tall grass silently thanking what ever god stays about for the concealment. The third shot hits you in the back going through your lung, you cough blood flying from your mouth and then the fourth and final shot the only you don't hear finally ends your pain.\n\n Neo Scavenger is a post apocalyptic survival simulator. You must contend with food, water, the cold, the weight of your equipment, wild beasts and other people in your struggle to simply stay alive. Neo scavenger also adds in sides mission and a story although i must admit i have no lived long enough to complete any of them. Also random events can happen while moving about the hexagonal landscape ranging from slave auctions to abandon camps. Combat is turn based and visceral in its descriptions, enough to make you slightly uncomfortable with each killing blow. A skill is also in place allowing you to change your play style with each life keeping the game fresh. There can be quite a lot of reading in parts however its is done very very well, each line adds more to the atmosphere and does a good job of giving a visual of the surrounding area.\n\n This is a brutal unforgiving game Death comes quickly to the unknowing and the unprepared. Its not everyone's game by far taking up a niche role in giving a somewhat realistic survival game, probably the closest ive found to a proper simulator. \n\n I give NeoScavenger an 8.5/10 \n Menus can be rather clunky at times and starting off as a new player can be rather brutal but once you grown acclimated to the environment it becomes a rather masochistic joy to play.

If you liked Fallout 1 and 2, and you like survival and roguelike games, I think you'll love this. It's dark, creepy, atmospheric, insanely detailed and can be morbid beyond belief. Don't judge the screenshots - buy this game. Note: I played this off steam, that's why my game time is low. I probably hit triple digits in reality.\n\nHad some of my most memorable gaming experiences with NEO Scavenger while it was in Alpha, and weirdly enough it wasn't even anything dramatic, just stalking deer and making jerky, exploring and braving the elements with my prized and carefully assembled \"kit\" of equipment, feeling like a badass survivor in a totally harsh and unforgiving world. In another playthrough, some truly weird shit went down in an abandoned insane assylum turned cultist haven: At the door, I gave up my prized kit in exchange for a hospital gown, got involved in some crazy masochistic, self-flagellating religious nonsense and cultist court intrigues, left on strange and uncertain terms, and then got shot outside the gates (left me absolutely speechless, like, WTF just happened?)\n\nQuests go weird. Enemies can be unpredictable. Strange things can happen. Emergent gameplay up the whazoo.\n\nThis game offers so much all at once... The detail in it is enough to sattisfy your worst OCD compulsions, because this game has the most detailed inventory management of probably any game ever made (plastic bags that you can crumple up and put in pockets, pill boxes you can stock with individual pills, batteries that you can stock and charge with individual electric cells, etc.) It also has a really detailed and fairly simple to use crafting system, with absolutely tons of stuff. Just ridiculous amount of stuff, much more available through mods.\n\nThe atmosphere and tone is almost uniquely morbid. This is not necessary or recommended, but hypothetically you can kill someone with a sharpened stick, then carry their body to the woods, carve up the body into steaks and make canibal pemmican. That is outrageous, and disturbing, and just knowing the game lets you do that (though I think discourages it somehow), that in itself gives the game a uniquely dark tone (something about the graphic of the enemy's courpse, lying crumpled on its side, taking up your entire inventory and overburderning you, man that image got like burned in my mind I think). \n\nThere are randomly generated scripted events and RPG/Adventure type of quests, choices, storylines.

All the combat is text based, but instead of leaving a lot to be desired, it lets you imagine how the event played out.

I love the game. I do, really. It's awesome, it's fun, it's addictive, and honestly it could teach people a few things about surviving in such a situation that they can't depend on society anymore. Almost all the techniques in the game are solid survival techniques that could very well save your life in the real world. But after a series of deaths before I could even get enough supplies to make the journey east (which I understand is a roguelike feature, but bear with me.), I felt the need to write this review. \nOne word, ladies and gentlemen: Yezinka. There's only one of them in the game world, and it wanders the map until it encounters your player. When it does, it hovers around in the hexes around you, and waits for you to inevitably have to sleep. You can't kill it by jumping it during the day because it can manage to sprint somewhere around 12 paces per move, while you can manage at best 4. It's also very difficult to hit with ranged weaponry (never got to try melee). Now here's the lemon in the wound: When you go to sleep, it immediately beelines for you, and steals your eyes. You can do NOTHING about it. You get around two turns, which is enough to stand up and start to look for it, and suddenly your eyes are gone. You can't do anything to recover them unless you've happened to encounter this late in the game and are near the city, and have been hoarding enough cash for cybersurgery. I say you need to be near the city because the condition \"No Eyes\" seems to flag you and every single enemy creature on the map drops what they're doing and attempts to kill you. I made a valiant effort and managed to kill two bandits and a dog before I was just overwhelmed with going into a new battle every turn (every other turn very VERY occasionally). Maybe if I were given a chance to pack up the things I had and try to luck my way to the city and sell everything I had for a single eye, I wouldn't have such a problem with this. Maybe if I were allowed to live for a bit and get a balancing attribute after a few turns that mitigated the fact that I can't see anymore, that'd be fine too. But as it is, if luck allows this broken monstrosity to seek you out without being killed by other wild animals or lucky NPCs, you are screwed, and there's no preparation at all that you can attempt to save yourself. I cannot in good conscience recommend any game that has a chance of giving the player such an enormous middle finger. But if you can get past that and you think it's not something that will bother you, then buy this game.

Also permadeath is on. A shining example of gameplay over graphics.\n\n[b] Game Detail [/b]\nName: Neo Scavenger\nGenre: Survival, Strategic Inventory Management\nPersonal score: I never knew masochism and sadism was an art form till today. Fun.\n\n[b] What is Neo Scavenger [/b]\nNeo Scavenger is a 2D survival game set in a hex based world where a devastation has happened to the world and well, apocalypse thing happen and you are a survivor of it. In first glance the innocent looking graphic and the non threatening looking trailer may throw you off on how brutal this game is but as people often say, 'you don't know hell till you been there' read on. Permadeath is on btw.\n\n[b] 1:Gameplay [/b]\nThe main gist of Neo scavenger gameplay is well, scavenging old ruins of buildings and forest  to follow the trail of barebone story. Each hex has a protection value from beeing seen, comfort and how alert you can be when something goes near you. Each of this stats can be improved by items, shelter and other craftable. A low protection from the enviromental will make your character slowly freezes during the night and if their body temperature is already low enough they will die. A low alert level will cause your character to not wake up when threats are nearby and bandits/looter/stuff can kill you in your sleep and you will die. A low comfort will cause your character to fight less efficiently and you might suddenly fall asleep and you will die.\n\nAdding to that, the map is hex form and you have a limited numbers of move during the day and far less during the night to move around, scavenge or perform one of the many in game action before needing to end your turn for the AI to move. On each hex you can scavenge supplies with city tiles having more supplies but comes at the increase risk of being discovered by bandits and obtaining injuries. Scavenging is extremely important in this game because it is your only way of getting randomized loots early game. Pretty much everything you need can be obtain by scavenging. Which might leads to a fight should you encounter bandits while on the move.\n\nFighting in Neo Scavenger is a game of chances and luck. A fully kited out bandit can still be defeated by you wielding nothing more than a rock but such a thing would of course take extreme luck due to the hidden diceroll system. Based on the perks you have chosen special attacks may not be available to you and only to the perk wielder. A few way fights can be resolve is through killing your opponent, dominating them and causing them to surrender or simply point your gun at them and watch them flee. Even an empty gun works occasionally to fool the AI seeing as in real life you would of course not attack the man with a gun even though its empty but you don't know that.\n\nShould you get wounded in Neo Scavenger you will have to treat them to prevent the blood loss from draining too much and yes it regenerates slowly. Wound treatment has their own special menu where you apply splints, bandages and meds to your character. Left unchecked a large wound has the potential to end your playthrough instantly. Also water and berries you collected are often time poisones because the game isn't hard enough. This might cause disease that has a similar effect to a tired status or in worse case scenario cause a total system failure which leads to your death.\n\nFrom all the materials you gathered from the scavenging you can use the crafting menu to create items. A wood with a sharp object will yield a spear that you can use to attack. Container with strings and stones will yield a noisemaker to increase the alert level of your campsite. Many other options exist for the player to find themselves.\n\nThe player character will also experience hunger and thirst which can be reduce by eating and drinking, failure to do so will lead to death. But as mentioned earlier, most of the water and food you find in the forest where the risks are low are poisonous and consuming them will lead to death.\n\nInventory management in Neo scavenger are quite realistic in terms of real life, your character has only 2 hands and thus can only hold 1 item in each hands without a bag. With a bag this frees up 1 hand for combat and allows more item to be carried but a bag is not your only means of carrying. Side pockets in pants, shirt and even a sledge can be found and use to help you carry more items which is especially important during end game where you often have to make far away expedition. Any item being held or use will eventually degrade before completely break down into nothing and in fact most of the things found in the wild are actually used goods and so they already have lowered durability. To beat the coldness of the night without a good shelter multiple cloths can be worn on top of each other to increase heat levels during the night and prevent freezing to death.\n\nThe day and night system is also quite important. During the day enemies can spot you from further away and the same holds true for you and the during the night the decreased line of sight cause your action points to be less that during the day.\n\nAs you traverse the deadly world of Neo Scavenger you might come across strange landmarks or building that will lead you to a random event. Success of survival and loot gain depends on the players perks chosen and dialog choices.\n\nAnd lastly the perks. During character creation you can choose several perks with perk points limiting the amount. The best perks are usually the most expensive but to help player with that negative perks can also be chosen that frees up point for more positive perks.\n\n[b] 2:Sound [/b]\nUtilizing more ambient noises instead of spoken dialogs the world of neo scavenger is truly brought to life, The forest shakes and the ruined city exhibit an eerie feeling as the player explores it. \n\nBut well, good filler is better than no filler.\n\n[b] 3:Graphics [/b]\nEverything is sprite based no exception. The characters are sprites, the menu utilizes sprites and even the backgrounds are sprites but like other sprites these are well done enough to pass the inspection. You can clearly tell what an item is at a glance which should be the most important thing in a survival game like this.\n\nAt least they do look pretty.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\nYou will die a lot in this game. That is a fact and i hope i emphasized it enough. But the game definitely do not hold your hand at all from the moment you walk out of the facility till the next moment your guts spilled out from getting stabbed by an alcohol bottle. This game is intense. Fan of survival game should definitely get it.\n\nFInal verdict: Yes.\n\n\n[b] TIPS! [/b]\nFIND A SHOE, SERIOUSLY.\nFIND SOME CLOTHES TOO WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THAT SHOE.\nYOU WILL DIE. AND IT'S PERMAD DEATH SO GET READY TO RESTART A LOT.\nBUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS....\ndon't eat those red berries.\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]\n\n[i]Check out the Original Network Groups.

It sounded like the survival game I'd been wanting for YEARS! But after scavenging only 2 abandoned towns I was shot at and constantly stunned until I died. I was Tough and had clothes on, not sure if that improves my defense or not, and I was behind cover. Infact getting behind cover was the one single action I was able to pull off.\n\nIn my many playthroughs since I have never been able to find another frying pan or torch, and things were even harder. Finding a lighter is so damn hard that I usually starve to death. Or if I just try waiting it out and eating mushrooms in forests, I end up dying of sickness. This isn't a game about surviving, it's a game about taking a while to die. 2 days is my usual record.\n\nThis game relies so incredibly heavily on luck that it just isn't fun. But survival is all about strategy, so this works out horribly. I've tried building a great shelter, but died of sickness. Tried never staying in one spot, but got mauled. There are only ways to lose and no ways to win. Also with the very small amount of recipes available, you'd think the game would give you hints on when you need just 1 more item to make something. Dragging the skills into the crafting table is just really monotonous. It should be doing this itself! It's the Minecraft crafting table all over again, with no user-friendliness.\n\nAnd the skills, they were a selling point for me, but now that I've gotten to play it I only pick the same skills each time. They are just not at all balanced. This is what I'd expect from a game still in beta. I thought I'd be avoiding these huge flaws in a finished game. Incredibly dissapointing. I've tried other survival roguelikes and they were pretty bad too in there own ways.\n\nStarting to wonder if this genre combo simply can never work.\n\nUPDATE: Same day I post this, a wonderful person tells me about a free game in beta called Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. It's got more content than I can handle! And despite it's wonky controls, it has a very clear crafting system, and loads of methods for getting materials. It's also far more immersive with you actually exploring the areas yourself. Just hope you don't need graphics, because that's the game's only flaw. To play it like Neo Scavenger, just turn zombies off and NPCs on. And finally, when you die in it, you learn from it. You play better next time.

Lately I've noticed that many games of this genre are, for the most part, shallow and very boring. Whether it's the oversaturation or my lack of interest, but I just haven't been able to find a good realistic survival game to spark my interest. But then comes Blue Bottle Games and gives us this fantastic, well-thought-out RPG that I just can't stop playing.\n\nThe gameplay is probably my favorite part about it, because it involves turn-based strategy, the best kind of strategy that fits these types of games so well. You will cautiously think about every next move you make. The style is similar to games such as Wasteland or S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but the difficulty resembles that of a Dark Souls game.\n\nI think it speaks volumes when an indie game does a much better job at creating a world so dark and brutal that will make you dread every moment you explore it than most AAA titles with their overblown visuals and lack of originality. Just to make it clear, this one of the best survival simulations that you can experience, this game does not favor sloppiness, you will die until you learn how to survive the wasteland.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n[b] 10 shoes/10 [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1425186226, "timestamp_updated": 1425186226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530826", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14696475": {"recommendationid": "14696475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067193935", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516814440}, "language": "english", "review": "A throw back to RPGs of the 80s, a real testament to the fact that you don't need stunning visuals & fast paced gameplay to be a top notch RPG.\n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1425150338, "timestamp_updated": 1425150338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14689796": {"recommendationid": "14689796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058466700", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 2281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506355595}, "language": "english", "review": "add mods and game becomes better :)", "timestamp_created": 1425122732, "timestamp_updated": 1482444849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14684537": {"recommendationid": "14684537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000106630", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469935327}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're like me, you appreciate gameplay, story, and originality in your games above graphics, but dont let the simple presentation fool you, it's really well executed, and immediately apparent that love and time went into this development.  \n\n The developer is active on the forums, and this game seems to have a growing mod community.

This is their love child. Hands down one of the best survival games I've ever played.\n\nPretty much nails every aspect of survival as it should. Unlike most games you actually have to boil water, not eat every berry you find and not just place a cloth on a severe cut. The thing is if you have knowledge to survive in the wilderness in real life it makes this game a bit easier to play.\n\nI say a bit easier because in reality this can be a very difficult game. Expect to die loads of times before getting the hang of things. However, the game is fun and different enough on each playthrough to keep you going. Lots of times you might run across events or other things that you haven't before.\n\nAnother reason I love this game is all the twists and turns you'll go through when you start uncovering the well hidden story in newspapers and when you first wake up.\n\nThe game doesn't look bad and definitely gives me nostalgia to those old post-apocalyptic video games. You can do pretty much whatever you want to. If you want to run at a guy wielding an ak-47 with a stick, you can. If you want to run around naked stealing other people's stuff, you can. If you want to make a suit of tinfoil and become a crazy hobo you can.\n\nThere is music in the game and it's pretty good, almost sounding like something that would be in the half life series. Sometimes the only sounds you'll hear is the various birds and critter chatter giving you a real sense of isolation. Although when you spot an event or something interesting one of the tracks might start up providing a cool atmosphere.\n\nIt's really hard to talk about this game without spoiling anything, but what I can say it's one of the best survival post-apocalyptic games out there. So while you can go running through the woods butt-naked, you can also try and discover who you are and what exactly happened to the world around you.

No amount of wit or cunning will help when you're ambushed by three to four feral dogs simultaneously while sleeping and ripped apart in a hopeless battle with no escape.

It just doesn't have a tutorial, and is very strict. You'll die, but those deaths are not random; they are because of some mistake you made. Learn from it. Don't die that way next time. And don't forget your skills; if you die of poisoning try to figure out why and not do it again. Maybe it had something to do with those mushrooms you ate? or that rancid swamp water you drank? Did you die of Sepsis? Then maybe try keeping your wounds clean instead of rubbing dirt in them.\n\nOnce you get into the swing of things, it isn't hard to survive, and luck starts to be a fairly minor factor. This can take a bit of learning; even poring over the wiki isn't going to totally familiarize yourself with the mechanics, but it is a good idea to use the wiki for craftables. Not necessary, but helpful.\n\nOne last bit of advice: there's no 100% completion for this game, so keep in mind you do not have to complete every challenge you come across.

The game blends elements of the rougelike genre and the turn based strategy genre to make a very unique experience.\n\n Because of the permenant death feature, you can't just start from a previous save when you die, and you will die..... a lot, it is NOT an easy game. That being said, the permenant death system also allows for a lot of really tough decisions about how to use your resources. As hard as it is to decide if you should drink the water that may or may not be contaminated is, the game takes it a step further.\n\n You will encounter various, random scenarios where the game will go out of it's way to put you in the most difficult position that it possibly can. These situations rarely result in your immediate death (although it is possible), but choosing if you should pay bandits with fresh water to free a woman who's baby they have just cooked and eaten is not exactly an easy choice when you are suffering from cholera and your dehydrated.\n\n Even though there are a ton of tough decisions, at least you get to take all the time you need to make a decision. The turn based strategy format allows you to take all the time you need to carefully consider the decion you are about to make. This limitless time is often needed not just for scenarios like the one above, but also in combat. The combat system is surprisingly very deep. You are offered tons of options for what do do on a specific round in the combat. The game even goes as far as to allow you to attempt to tackle the other person, or in some cases leg trip them.\n\n Although it certainly isn't for a casual gamer, if you are a fan of rougelikes, enjoy a deep strategy game, or are interested in a new experience, this is certainly worth a try.", "timestamp_created": 1424289982, "timestamp_updated": 1469129409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14527237": {"recommendationid": "14527237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030797022", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463992144}, "language": "english", "review": "good fun", "timestamp_created": 1424254719, "timestamp_updated": 1424254719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14527229": {"recommendationid": "14527229", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974422069", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424250647}, "language": "english", "review": "Picked this up on a lark, as I am heavily into survival games lately. I was hesitant due to the low res, pixel graphics, but man am I glad I took a chance on this!\n\nWhat stands out immediately is choice and consequence. You can't have it all. You have to build a character with weaknesses, and weaknesses can just be not having some of the skills you might like to have, or it can be actual weaknesses to give you points to get more benefits.\n\nYou might take Fragile for example, making you take more damage than normal if you get hit, and you might do this because you really want the points it gives you to take Trapping so you can make fire right away at the start of the game.\n\nYou might take Strong so you can carry more and Melee so you can close combat better, but this might mean you don't get Ranged skil and therefore cannot make arrows, and have limited range skill with guns and other range weapons.\n\nAnyway, you make your choices and take your shot. Into the game you go and immediately your character choices effect your first encounter, in terms of whether you survive, escape, get hurt or kick the ass of the first opponent.\n\nYou survived the fight (maybe) and now you gotta get fire, you gotta get a weapon, you need clothing, you need shelter, you need a supply of food and water, and you need to get these things without attracting too much attention from the local wildlife. How you do this is up to you and there is little to no help from the game. You gotta figure it out, and fast, cause you are getting cold and soon you'll be needing somewhere to sleep.\n\nRnG can help you or hurt you here, and at first I was like, well you need some good rolls to start, but later you learn it's more about playing smart, and persistently scavenging until you get what you want.\n\nYou have to be concerned about the noise you make, the tracks you leave, and even your scent, as you get through those nail biting first turns until you finally get to the point where you are not struggling and can start to carve your way through the world.\n\nNow you start to get pleasantly surprised because you find there is depth in the game. Depth in the combat system, depth in the crafting system, and it's challenging because you are gonna die if you are not careful. You might kill that wolf, but you took a scratch that is gonna get infected because you didn't find or craft any clean bandages, and haven't managed to find something to act as a dis-infectant. Left untreated this may progress to septis, and ultimately death.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are not careful in combat, being tactical, the wolf just may kill you outright.\n\nItems decay, so in the long game you need to be able to get a backup supply... and then you start to find that there is actually a story here... WHAT YOU SAY?!?!?!?! \n\nI thought I was just enjoying a really great survival game, and BAM... all of a sudden I ran into some story elements and again realize this modest little game is actually filled with depth and fun, and a reason to keep playing, try to live longer, try to figure out just why and how you came to be here, and what you can do to go beyond surviving.\n\nThere is a reputation system, and good versus evil behaviour. You can save the damsel in distress or throw in your lot with the bandits. It can be dark, really dark. You don't just kill stuff... you murder it... you rip people apart in scenarios where it's either you or them... fight or die... and sometimes you win just to find out later, you lost.\n\nIf you give Neo Scavanger half a chance, you'll find a real gem here. A game which has been clearly and cleverly thought out to provide many hours of entertainment. I'm about 168 hours in as I write this, and still haven't seen 60% of the map.

Neither does satisfaction. This is a game where complacency costs you 12 hours of gameplay in a single stupid decision. \n\nNeo Scavenger pits you, an unarmed - clueless - protagonist against a motley crew of the worst of the worst. Thrown into a post-apocalyptic world with naught but a hospital gown, you must find clothing to stave off pneumonia. Shelter to rest in. A campsite to stash your laughable scavenged loot - there are no infinite backpacks in this game, you're limited to a realistic carrying amount. Want to pick up a shopping trolley to carry more stuff in? Fine, but it'll cost you; reduced speed, inability to run, being burdened, easier for enemies to pick you off. \n\nNeo Scavenger has a learning curve that is frustratingly high. You will not survive for more than a few hours on your first dozen runs. The first time you think you're playing well, you've maybe got a rifle, 3 or 4 rounds, a place to call home, and some futuristic technology - such as a water purity tester, but then you get cocky. You don't come back to your camp before it's dark, and suddenly you're pulling in a shopping cart 3 hours of work that you refuse to drop, and so you're caught by a group of looters or raiders, and you're dead in a matter of seconds - you're dead before you even realise it. \n\nThis is an ultimate game of survival. You really need to think every decision you make out. There is a feel of grinding to it - you spend hours going from ruin to ruin looting nothing but trash, you stop to scavenge some berries for food and water, then you go back to camp, drop anything of value off, and restart again, slowly finding 1 bullet here, 1 course of antibiotics there, etc. There is a storyline to this game, and various amusing NPCs/Cities in the game for you to explore.\n\nI also feel there really does need to be some sort of step back from the permadeath element. I'm not saying there should be an autosave feature every turn, but some sort of progress saving feature that compensates you from a death due to extreme randomness. For instance I died in the main city of the game due to an ingame mechanic that simply had my character hit by a car randomly while walking the streets, game over, start again from turn 1. That's just outright not fair, and impossible to avoid. \n\nAnyway, fantastic game for those out there who enjoy a challenge.

No skill or tactics to employ, just plain old luck determines whether you'll live each day. Combine this with permadeath, and you find yourself stuck replaying the same day over and over again, having about as much fun as Bill Murray did when caught in the same loop.\n\nI'm being serious, you can fall, cut yourself, and die of blood loss just from *walking* if that's how the dice roll (advancing in combat carries the chance to trip and fall). Whether or not you find shoes and clothes in time to keep warm and not die from hypothermia, pure luck. Whether you wake up in time to defend yourself before an enemy kills you in your sleep, pure luck. Whether you can actually get to sleep because it's random whether or not you'll find a sleeping bag and it rains constantly... again, luck. Whether your very first fire started in a burnt out office building because you are hiding from the rain with nothing but a hospital gown and a large stick attracts an entire pack of feral dogs who you literally have zero chance against... need I go on?\n\nThere's just no meaningful interaction. All of your equipment wears out shockingly fast and it's a crapshoot whether you'll find a replacement. At times it feels like a miracle during an encounter just to close the gap to an enemy without tripping over yourself and falling to the ground before you can poke 'em with your spear. Start a fire to keep warm and attract an enemy you aren't ready to deal with. Lay low and hide, die of hypothermia. Damned if you do and damned if you don't. Either option is viable based solely on luck. You're not playing a game so much as just watching the unluckiest man on Earth die over and over again.\n\nThere is no character progression. You know how to make everything right away. Just put all of your swag into the crafting table and whatever can be made is instantly available. However good you are at fighting and surviving from the moment you wake up is as good as you're ever gonna be. All of your equipment has a ridiculously short lifespan. So even if you find a really good anything, don't get attached. Even crowbars wear out... CROWBARS! Solid bars of pure steel... wear out.  Seriously?\n\nThere's just no feeling of accomplishment. None. If you manage to survive for a week, it's not because you did anything right, you just got lucky. A first playthrough can net you shoes, cargo pants, a hoodie, a multitool, and a saucepan after 12 hours of scavenging. A second playthrough can net you a cut arm, 200 pebbles, a handful of poison berries, and 3 shards of glass after 12 hours of scavenging. The player is reduced to the role of spectator of the very short and uninteresting life of some guy named Phillip.\n\nWithout engagement, without meaningful choices to make, without progression, there's just no game here.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1422026423, "timestamp_updated": 1422026423, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441489", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14120224": {"recommendationid": "14120224", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990507896", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517373198}, "language": "english", "review": "It's been a long time I've played such a good game.\n\nIf you love survival type of games then you can't miss this game at all.\n\nProbably the best game out there.", "timestamp_created": 1421980623, "timestamp_updated": 1421980623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14118974": {"recommendationid": "14118974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077059181", "num_games_owned": 921, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518271177}, "language": "english", "review": "the best homeless simulator ever", "timestamp_created": 1421973732, "timestamp_updated": 1479927263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 233, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14116949": {"recommendationid": "14116949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029041836", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445977801}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing survival game combining survival with turn based formula and best rogue-like elements (all hail the perma-death).

One would expect that a game rated so highly would have sacrificed looks for content, and it certainly is lacking in both -- instead it's a series of instant-death by storyline misadventure or because the character is about as hardy and resiliant as wet one-ply toilet paper... despite being 'tough'.\n\nI wanted to have some nice things to say about this game, but I really can't find anything worth the $15.

I set up camp for the night in a dense bit of brush, threw together a lean-to using a tarp I took off the corpse of some raider who thought he'd take me for all I was worth, laid out my sleeping bag, and went down for the night. \nAround 2 AM I was awoken by a massive *crack* in the woods near my position. Suddenly I remembered forgetting to hide my tracks, that's how it found me: a savage creature the size of a truck with teeth and claws protruding like foot-long razors. It saw me before I saw it, and that was all it took. Its claws tore across my chest before I knew where the danger was coming from sending blood flying all over the campsite along with what focus my eyes had achieved in the 5 seconds since their rude awakening. I was able to bring up my spear before the next attack landed and sliced open the creature's powerful arm, interrupting its strike. Vision fading quickly, I lunged. The beast let loose a shriek as the spear found its mark and dove deeper, piercing the heart. I'm not sure what gave out first, my legs or the crumpled heap of what was once the hulking black monstrosity.\nSomehow I dragged myself to my backpack and fished out some rags. I quickly bandaged the massive gash in my chest, ever mindful that giving in to the swirling blackness meant never waking up. I popped a couple of strong painkillers and some antibiotics to ward off the inevitable infection that comes with a reused bandage (like there was any other choice) and retreated back into the safety of my lean-to to rest and give my wounds time to heal.\nI must have dozed off, I'm not sure, all I remember is the pain. The incredible pain that only follows a crowbar being slammed into your knee. \nTwo thugs stood over me, wearing what appeared to be the mismatched hides of dozens of small animals. I didn't even have time to cry out in pain before the the bigger of the two brought his crowbar down again, silencing me permanently.\nMy vision churned and faded as I fell to the ground. Lying in an ever-growing pool of my own blood, my last sight was the assailants as they picked apart the life I had fought so hard for.

Honestly, there isn't really much I would recommend that the developers change, they were very thorough in making this game. Certainly nothing game-breaking (so far). Bugs are non-existant as far as I can tell.* Lot's of fun for the file size. It has a sense of brutality without relying on gore to get the message across. \n\nI recommend when you play this game that you do *not* look anything up first. The game is intuitive, and a great deal  of fun can be had by messing up. This is a great game for just getting on and having fun. \n\nIf I had to think of a downside, it would be difficult but I would say there are two. The first would be that it is simple, and those that want fancy 3d graphics or a complex game should look to a different genre altogether. Second would be replayability. It has a good story, but there is something disappointing about each part of the story fleshed out: that's one fewer mystery for later. Of course, you can say that about any story-oriented game. \n\nAgain, I would say that the keyword here is intuitive. Easy to pick up the mechanics, more difficult to use them effectively, but overally the difficulty is anywhere from mild to moderate. This isn't an 'easy' game per-se, but it certainly isn't hard. It is a game where risk and reward are both quite high in most encounters. A small slip up can cost you dearly, a well timed strike can earn you incredibly useful loot, so long as you have the space to carry it all. By far the most scarce resource in the game is space. You can't carry everything you find in the beginning, so deciding what is most valuable can be a very tough decision.\n\nAll of the above serve to make it the ideal rogue-like game IMO.\n\n*EDIT: About the bugs, I should mention that there is a minor graphics bug where items will appear partly off-screen, and cannot be selected from boxes. This is uncommon, however, and easily fixed by switching between fullscreen and minimized (you can end in whatever screen you prefer). Probably not worth mentioning except that I had said \"Bugs are non-existant as far as I can tell.\"\n\nEDIT 2: One other critisism: This game does not offer difficulty settings at this time. Initially, it seems difficult. After a few hours, it does seem slightly easy. Hopefully that will change in time, but with a sense of ease often comes recklessness (at least in my case), counteracting any potential for this game to become boring.

You can be very tough or an electrician, whatever floats your boat.\n+ Very hard. This game shows no mercy and shoves you right in. (googling crafting tutorials might be smart)\n+ Crafting. This game is full of unique crafting where you can craft anything from a fire to a wheelbarrow.\n+ Interacting with others. It feels like it isnt just you out there. The world is bustling with Raiders, Looters, and nice people who you can kill, steal from, or just say hi to.\n+ Strategical fighting. The first game I've ever seen with a \"Threaten\" option in the middle of combat.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- Single Player only. This game would be boring with multiplayer, but I wanted to note this just in case you didnt know.\n- Loot Spawning. Sometimes you'll find nothing in a locked shed. Sometimes in an empty field you'll find a loaded shotgun. The loot spawns sometimes are unrealistic.\n- 2D artstyle. I personally am ok with the 2D, but it must be noted you are buying a 2D game.\n- Unusual death. Sometimes you will be well fed, well quenched, and well slept, but die in your sleep from a monster.\n\nI overall would give this game an 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1420415414, "timestamp_updated": 1420415414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629507", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13839308": {"recommendationid": "13839308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013338899", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463330101}, "language": "english", "review": "One of those games where you (inevitably) die and then immediately ask yourself, 'Ok what can I do this next time around to avoid that?'

Not even who you are. Your goal is to make it to \"The Glow\" or Detroit Mega City as you may learn to call it both. Your goal is to make it here, exploring along the way, better equipping yourself with the task of finding out who you are. \nThis is how I would imagine a post-apocalyptic Detroit happening.\nConstantly being bombarded by the ruthless Dogmen, and Bad Muthas, a Detroit street gang of brutal, thuggish cannibals who will NOT hesitate to attack you on sight. Also strangers and looters equipped with scoped hunting rifles, and Detroit Mega City Guards with rifles, shotguns, and full SWAT-type gear ready to exterminate you.\nYou will be excited as ever to just find a pair of old plastic shopping bags and a shard of glass or a broken bottle to arm yourself with. Every little space in your inventory counts, so space management is almost as important to your survival as dealing with combat scenarios with a cool, calm, level head.\n\n[u][b]GAMEPLAY:[/b][/u]\nYou will need to scavenge for loot while maintaining low visibility, otherwise if you think you're tough enough you can brazenly move into an abandoned building, scavenge it loudly and roughly, and hope someone or something doesn't hear or see you. \nThe choices you make for every little situation in this game need to be approached with clear thinking, and taking into account repercussions of your actions is seriously encouraged for this experience.\n\nYou will have random encounters within the story line and others along your travels.\nYou may succomb to diseases from exposure to sick people, bad weather (hypothermia and pneumonia), food poisoning, and even BREATHING toxic fumes over time.\n\nYou will wake up to people stealing your supplies and food or attempting to bash your skull in with a stone. Then be forced to make the decision to flee in complete terror, sneak up on the thief in the dark and take them by surprise, or just stand up from your sleep and attack them in a raging fury.\n\nIf you can get past the clunky UI and lack of animation or intimate graphical control, this game is a dirty gem just waiting to be appreciated by the next \"arachaeologist\" who finds it. I never pictured myself enjoying a game that's 60% text-based, but I quickly fell in love with this game. Here, you can learn quickly from past mistakes and keep pushing forward. If you ever thought it was hard to survive in other \"survival\" games, this is [i]FAR[/i] more unforgiving but also more rewarding to experience. True-to-life combat system that allows your simplest mistakes to be exploted by your enemy, possibly resulting in your death or serious injury.\n\n[u][b]OVERALL RATING OUT OF 10:[/b][/u]\n9.5/10\nEven if you hate text-based games, or games with hexes (I certainly did), you may find yourself immersed and deeply invested into this game.

Except for one story location, there doesn't seem to be anyone anywhere except hostile bandits and looters who are willing to not murder you on sight if you agree to not murder them on sight.  In my opinion, the world should feel just a little bit more alive.\n\nSecondly, the game is TOO brutal.  I get that it's a roguelike and roguelikes are supposed to be tough, but there's a lot of things that, quite frankly, are full of shit.\n\nI once stabbed a guy with a long, pointed tree branch made into a spear.  According to the game text, I viciously stabbed his upper stomach, and according to the in-game status text, he was bleeding heavily, in shock, and on the ground.  Somehow he managed to knock me out in one punch, steal my spear and backpack, and run away before I woke up, got an infection and died.\n\nSeveral times I've started a brand new game just to not find any early game drops and freeze to death within a minute.  No hyperbole, I died within a single minute of starting a new game thanks to the RNG.

It's not like I really had to - I was taking a nap in a small city when a stranger woke me up. I was pissed. I took his soul away with a crowbar and noticed that I'm a bit hungry. Checked it - yes, not surprising - I can use a shard on the corpse and scavenge myself some tasty human meat. Two hexes later in the woods, I've made myself a nice BBQ and I'm feasting on that human.\n\nAs I chew on what was just two hexes ago my rival in an unfair fight, I am suddenly overcome with  disgust. I could have just left the corpse there, and move on to hunt a squirrel or pick some non-poisonous berries. Yet I chose to eat that person. And before doing that I looted him of his hoodie which was in a better condition.\n\nBut karma got to me quick. I was quickly poisoned in some mysterious way and then something wielding a 12-Gauge Shotgun blew me to bits, all my progress and looting down the drain.\n\nNEO Scavenger can be really daunting at first; you'll die a lot. But once you pick it up - it's hard to put it down. It's a wonderful selfishness simulator that is fun and engaging, built on a fantastic crafting system which brings out the curious child in you. The \"old\" graphics do not deter from the enjoyment, quite the opposite \u2013 they only make it eerier and more atmospheric. The soundtrack is great too and generally it feels like a lot of thought was given to the game. \n\nI haven't delved into the lore of the game yet but there are newspapers lying around with bits of info and it seems that there's a bigger story which unfolds as you manage to survive and stay alive. Unfortunately that's not as easy as it sounds, not at all; you can also go great strides (even without turning into a cannibal) and then get blown away by a shotgun or catch a disease. This could hinder the experience for some players who focus on storylines and want to complete the game \u2013 take to heart that this will be [b]VERY HARD[/b]. This game is hardcore as it gets and it doesn't hold your hand at all.\n\nThe best advice is to watch let's plays etc and if you do pick up the game, try it for yourself before picking up a guide. You WILL pick up a guide ultimately but try to experience it without any aid at all. It'll produce unique experiences in which you'll end up dead (in your hospital gown usually). \n\nOverall this is worth much more than its price tag, a very refreshing entry to the world of roguelike which does it very very right - a sort of improved UnReal World with frightening creatures and a darker theme.", "timestamp_created": 1420282900, "timestamp_updated": 1420283002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13798855": {"recommendationid": "13798855", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964216999", "num_games_owned": 381, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451003280}, "language": "english", "review": "It feels like I've still just scratched the surface but it has been a pretty unique survival roguelike experience that introduces a mix of new mechanics that work together quite well.  \n\n+ character attributes: it's not like a typical roguelike where you have you basic generic stats and grind xp. You pick out traits to help define your character (melee, ranged, mechanic, athletic, strong etc) and can pick weaknesses as well which let you get more points on good traits as a tradeoff and allow you to try to balance unique builds. These attributes influence completely what sort of actions you'll have available to you, how you handle conflicts, crafting, trying to find shelter, heat, food and so on. They define and influence your decisions way beyond the normal str,int,con type character building.\n\n+ crafting : there is quite a complex crafting system in place that is entirely based on resources available and the traits you picked. If you find just the right ingredients in the early game to make a decent weapon or clothes you'll have a much easier time, otherwise you'll want to avoid conflicts and scavange more. \n\n+(mostly) combat : deciding whether to fight, and how to fight is very important here.. not because you fight all the time but because the stakes are high and a few bad streaks could see you left bleeding in a field far from your shelter. I like this change to slightly more realistic combat. There's no visible health bar, it's all about waiting till you get a chance to strike, wounding your opponent, and then kicking while they are down. Not particularly heroic but if you make a mistake that leaves you vulnerable and they get a hit in, they'll do the same to you. It comes down primarily to trying to get in range for your weapon, stay out of range from theirs, and defend yourself until you have an opportunity. For example, if you have a melee weapon you can try to rush them but you risk falling on your butt at which point you'd be an open target, or you can advance normally but they'll be able to back away. \n\n- combat balance: My con with this is that your weapons make all the difference and with the random nature and limited weapon types, you can either be useless in combat or feel like there was no risk. In my first play through I believe I hit a guy with a pocket knife like 20 times until he ran away after punching me and then I bled to death. In my second playthrough I tied a knife to a stick to make a spear, with a range of 3 is the longest melee weapon. And then proceeded to kill everyone that didn't have a gun without a scratch because they couldn't get near me without getting stabbed. And those with guns I could sneak on fairly easy and then once I hit them they were too wounded to fight back. It went from combat being impossible to being 'meh'.", "timestamp_created": 1420250888, "timestamp_updated": 1420250888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13798426": {"recommendationid": "13798426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098606921", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420249044}, "language": "english", "review": "More games need to let you shit yourself to death 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1420249078, "timestamp_updated": 1420249078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13795795": {"recommendationid": "13795795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171057990", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432138430}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first saw this I did not think I would like it, but I really wanted a scavenger survival type game.

They start crawling, and you decide to finish them off and loot whats left of the innocent guys corpse. You get a little tired, so you rest in the woods when something wakes you up in the middle of the night. Its a feral dog, and oh shit, youre out of ammo. You decide to stick to beating the thing with the but of your gun, but its no luck. One too many bites means its game over.\n\nIncase you can't tell, you will die a lot in neoscavenger. Like...a lot a lot. The game makes no attempt to hold your hand, and that will inevitably turn some people off, while others will find this a refreshing change of pace. Neo is a tough game for sure, and the survival aspects are fantastic. Of course you have to eat, sleep, drink etc etc but you also have to make sure you don't freeze to death, make sure your wounds are tended to and don't get infected, make sure you have shoes so you don't get blisters on your feet, try and make some interesting moral choices along the way (Do you help the mother and her child escape from the cannibals? How about watching people fight to death in an arena for scraps of food?) \n\nAll in all, I think Neo Scavenger is one of the gems of 2014. I didn't even know about it until searching through steams library. I think if you're a fan of the survival genre and want something that's tactical with a lot of options and a nice change of pace in terms of story other than your typical \"Oh my god! Zombies!\" schtick, I recommend you check it out.", "timestamp_created": 1420135685, "timestamp_updated": 1420135685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13754851": {"recommendationid": "13754851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065970611", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 1371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498933686}, "language": "french", "review": "j'adore", "timestamp_created": 1420099444, "timestamp_updated": 1420099444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13739939": {"recommendationid": "13739939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116898893", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485613047}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game with very high replayability.

Got in another fight, crushed his head, cut him up, and kept his meat around for later. Some guy with a .308 rifle heard me looting and followed my tracks. He shot me in the gut while i ran at him.

I like survival games.  I like rogue-like games.  So a turn-based, rogue-like survival game?  Sign me up!  Except not for this turn-based, rogue-like survival game please.\n\nIMHO rogue-like games like FTL and Don't Starve succeed because they're a streamlined experience, which makes \"dying part of the fun\".  Starting a new game is always exciting and you're confident you can learn from your past mistakes so you'll survive longer this time 'round.\n\nThis is where NEO falls short.  The dev had a vision and built the game to match that vision.  But if his vision of a post-apocalyptic wasteland does not align with your vision of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, prepare to encounter all sorts of frustratingly illogical, immersion-breaking events.\n\nPeople call FTL brutally hard and overly random, but I \"get it\" - it makes sense to me when I play.  I can learn from past mistakes and play better.  NEO makes no sense to me.  The game design decisions are just weird, the interface is clunky, the graphics are grotesque.  Dying for no clear reason, when things seem to be going swimmingly right up until you die, *may* be realistic (?) in the dev's world, but not mine.\n\nYou get the same kind of all-of-a-sudden deaths in Don't Starve but it's always clear that \"I shouldn't have attacked that Pig Man just for kicks\" or \"I shouldn't have tried to chop that last tree before lighting my campfire\" or \"I should have abandoned my hunt for gold and hunted berries instead, so I wouldn't starve\".\n\nPlaying NEO is like being put in a straight-jacket designed by the dev.  \"Play my way or not at all\".  Okay dude - IF your way makes logical sense and there's a clear progression from A-to-B-to-C-to-You Died.   Going A-to-R-to-D-to-You Died does not help me live longer next time!  \n\nSo \"I shouldn't scavenge that random house the way I've scavenged every other house so far, because I should have known the roof was going to cave in\"?  or \"I shouldn't have tried to run away from that particular encounter because I should have known I would trip, fall on my ass and not be able to stand up again even though I'm healthy, rested and well-fed\"?  How do I avoid either of those situations next time around?  That's two of the dozens of deaths that will leave you scratching your head going \"REALLY?!?\".\n\nForumites will tell you, take this skill, that skill and the other skill and you'll never die.  Okay, but what if I *don't want* to take those three specific skills.  What if I want to build the character *I want to play*?  In that case, prepare for many, many, many frustrating deaths because you're not playing his game the way the Dev wants you to.\n\nI don't get some of these other reviews:  \"Dogman killed me while I slept despite the fact that I put down multiple noise traps, Thumb's Up 10/10.\"  WTF?

Every game I played started and ended the same way: I wandered around, scavenged for items, found nothing or barely anything (one game I found some pants; another, a multitool; every other game I would find a single shoe), then got attacked and killed. No matter if I tried to run or hide, I would eventually get attacked by an enemy and die. I couldn't fight, because I found no weapons. I was constantly getting sick, because I found no clothes. I'm all for games being tough, but when literally all I'm finding everywhere I go is dirty rags and plastic shopping bags, it's not fun. Maybe I'm doing something wrong and should look up strategies on how to survive, but I think games should have a minimum amount of playability without having to use outside resources, and this one doesn't, so I can't recommend it. I'm sad about that, because I followed it through Early Access and waited to play until release, really looking forward to it, but there's not holding your hand and there's not giving you any direction at all, and this game falls into the latter category for me.

This game is absolutely fantastic! I've played many games over the years, and I can safely say that this one is the best I've ever played. It ticks all the boxes for me:\n\n1. It's challenging. A game without challenge is pointless. When you first start playing, you will get yourself killed multiple times, in a variety of different ways. This will keep happening unless you engage your brain, and use the tools available to survive. Permadeath means that you can't afford to make mistakes, which makes the game much more intense, and progression is much more fulfilling. I wouldn't have it any other way. 10/10\n\n2. Gameplay. This game is a sandbox turn-based rogue-likeish RPG. Some may not like this sort of game, but I've played many games of this sort, and it's the best of the lot. Most of these sorts of games over-complicate everything, and gameplay suffers as a result. This is not the case for Neo-Scavanger! The sandbox element is the cherry on top - do whatever the hell you want to do. Perfect! :D 10/10\n\n2. Focus is on gameplay and NOT on graphics etc. Too many games these days look nice, but in reality they have no replayability or depth. Neo-Scavanger is the opposite - the graphics and UI allow you to play the game, they are not there to be pretty . It's graphics and art are still great though, proper old-school stuff. Also, there is the added benefit that ANY computer will be able to run this game. It's built in flash, so if your PC can handle some random online flash game, it can handle Neo-Scavanger no problem. 10/10\n\n3. Depth. This game is deep! I have been playing for a few days now, and I have barely scratched the surface. I've just about got the point where I can reliably survive in the wilds, and have yet to actually explore the world. The game is mysterious, it's hard to know what the game will throw at me as I continue to play, and I love that feeling in a game. 10/10\n\n4.Lore and story. I like anything to do with post-apocalytic settings etc, who doesn't? I havn't really played enough to comment on this aspect of the game, but from what I've played so far the writing and story is top-notch. 10/10\n\n5. Thoughtful developers who listen. Having read a few dev posts, it is obvious that they care about this game. They are very open to suggestions and discussion. 10/10\n\n6. Mods. I haven't researched the mods much, but I know that they do indeed exist. Always great to have that option!\n\nSummary: 11/10. Buy this game now! Even if you normally don't like this sort of game, give it a go! It's cheap ;)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1419891098, "timestamp_updated": 1419891098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496278", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13698310": {"recommendationid": "13698310", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975088488", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458091237}, "language": "english", "review": "My last play experience.

post-apocolyptic, open world Survival games. It combines elements of survival, combat strategy, crafting, perma-death, inventory management, rpg, and a real sense of danger just lurking around every hex -- mostly in that order, I'd say. It's also turn-based rogue-like with the map changing slightly each time you begin a new journey. Do not let the modest graphics fool you -- they will be the least of your concerns, I assure you. \n\nThe combat system is actually rather realistic! Based on the character ablities and flaws you choose from the beginning, the combat system allows you to pick from quite a few options such as Charging your opponent, Headbutting, Tackling them to the ground, franticly retreating, sneaking, taking cover, sneaking behind cover, Offer to Talk, Melee combat, kick while down, shooting a ranged weapon -- too many to name, here. Choose wisely, or face the consequenses. I really enjoy the combat aspect of this game, but I imagine there are lots of players who would perhaps prefer stealth over Strength, and trade-based ablilities such as Botanist or Hacking over Athletisism. You can choose from flaws (Examples: bad metabolism, fatiques faster) as well, which allow you pick another ability or two to boost your luck. And it is almost always luck. \n\nI'm currently playing a character with the traits Strong, Melee, Athletic, Botany, and for my flaw -Metabolism.\n\nI have no idea who I am, but I appear to be a hulking, savage vegetarian. It's been 14 days, and I've killed at least 24 people -- I'm losing count, and can no longer remember any of their faces. I've been alerting many opportunists while  scavenging with a pickaxe and a lighter, but in turn, I've killed most all of those who couldn't escape. I'm hunting. Am I even human, anymore? At least I haven't resorted to cannibalism... yet.. and I'm sick with infection somehow. I found a couple of white pills, but without any knowledge of what they are, I fear the result. I've made a temporary home in a high-rise for at least 4 days now, only venturing outside to eat berries and mushrooms, and to gather water while I wait out whatever has me sick. Hopefully, I can make it through just one more night.....\n\nI have yet to finish the RPG portion of this game, but so far the stories and context are both quite fun to read.\n\nI played quite a bit before it was released, and it's also available in your browser!

You play as Philip Kindred, a man who has lost most of his memories after being rudely awakened from his cryogenic-sleep pod in the near future.  The game is set in post-apocalyptic Michigan, with a mix of supernatural/horror and sci-fi elements.  Overall it reminds me of Fallout 1 and 2 in terms of tone and atmosphere.\n\nSomething you should definitely be aware of before buying: Permadeath!  There is only one save slot in NEO Scavenger and when you die the game deletes the savegame, forcing you to start over.  However you can get around this fairly simply by manually backing up your savegame files after you save, so even players who don't like permadeath should still be able to enjoy NEO Scavenger if they save often and remember to back up those save files.  (I believe there is also a mod that adds multiple save slots, or that automatically backs up your save game, or something like that.  I never tried it out myself, so I can't comment on it.)\n\nNEO Scavenger is a text heavy game, and there is no narrator or voice acting.  Talking with friendly NPCs and fighting hostile ones both involve plenty of text.  Not that the game doesn't have a good UI too, but the lore and details of the game are all conveyed through text.\n\nSpeaking of which, the story of the game is told rather subtly, which I like but some people might not.  You'll have to search for clues to who you are and what's going on in the world.  Talking to NPCs, investigating strange locations, even simply finding and reading ancient newspaper article could tell you something important about the world of NEO Scavenger.  My point is you are going to have to really explore the game to uncover the plot.\n\nThere is an end to the story after which you cannot keep playing, but the game is pretty clear that going to that area is a fairly big deal and you are never forced to do so.\n\nOne of my favorite ways NEO Scavenger tells you about the world (and lets you tell the game what sort of person 'your' Philip Kindred is) is through random events.  These events will pop up occasionally as you explore the map, present you with a situation/problem, and a number of choices to deal with said situation/problem.  They're a bit like a single-page Choose-Your-Own-Adventure games.  Though sometimes a bad choice can get you eaten, so keep what I said about backing up your saves in mind if you dislike permadeath.  I've found several dozen of them so far and the choices and their outcomes are generally very satisfying.  There was one that actually let me ask for more information before deciding whether to help a slightly suspicious person, which is something I've often lamented a lack of in other games.\n\nThere's also a small modding scene, despite the lack of Steam Workshop support (flash and steam don't work well together apparently).  Check out the forums of the Blue Bottle Games website or Nexus mods for those.\n\nFinally, I just want to mention that the actual total hours I've played this game are at least twice of what Steam says it is.  This is because I bought the game through the developers website and generally play the version I downloaded there.  Speaking of which. if you do decide you want to buy the full game, you can get NEO Scavenger DRM free on Good Old Games, or directly through the Blue Bottle Games website.", "timestamp_created": 1419771079, "timestamp_updated": 1457193131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13660490": {"recommendationid": "13660490", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961933530", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504500922}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT 10.9.15:\n\nI love this game. One time, I got shot by an arrow. I ducked under cover, then pulled the arrow out. Then I stabbed my assailant to death with it. \n\nOne time, I was attacked by two dogs immediately after starting a game. I was naked (save for a thin hospital gown) and I had no weapons. As they charged me, I grabbed some shards of glass on the ground, and following a lengthy battle that I ultimately won, I used said shards to skin the dogs' carcasses and then made gloves out of them. Then I died of blood loss.\n\nOne time, I was attacked in the middle of a stormy night by two mutants trying to steal my shopping cart loaded with supplies. After I brained one of them, the other scattered. I gave chase, and dispatched it following a cross-tile pursuit. However, upon return to my camp, my cart was gone. The mutant corpse, mysteriously absent as well.

While there's a decent bit of good writing to be found,  you'll probably never discover it unless you edit the game files or get incredibly lucky with your scavenging rewards, as health, weariness and thirst tick down with absurd speeds, areas get tapped out of resources in no-time(meaning that setting up a camp, which is necessary unless you get ridiculously lucky finding backpacks, etc. is useless) and all your items decay with ridiculous rapidity, too. \n\nYou'll never really get to actually PLAY the game, is the thing, you'll be stuck doing nothing but grinding berries, cured meat and boiled water(which you can only get if you're lucky enough to find a saucepan), and then when you finally get enough of it to start moving somewhere... your backpack falls apart and you have to leave it all behind.\n\nBut, okay, let's say you're good at management and overcome that hurdle. Then you may find one of the twenty or so locations you can interact with beyond scavenging(in a map of thousands of hexes, and only a few of them look any different from the surrounding generic town hexes)... and whatever you do roughly has a 50% chance of instakilling you or losing you all your carried stuff.\n\nSo now, good luck, you can do all your grinding again! Hope you're lucky enough to find a saucepan early on this time around, too, or you may as well just restart.\n\nThe combat also boasts a lot of choices to make, but it boils down to either: Have a ranged weapon, keep distance, shoot shoot shoot, or have melee weapon, close distance, beat beat beat. A few of the other options might occasionally be tempting if the game gave any indication of how likely they were to succeed or not(say, percentages or odds or something) rather than just vaguely suggesting a \"high\" or \"low\" chance(what's high? 50+%? 75+%? 95+%?).\n\nLong story short: Needs more obvious mechanics, needs less busywork to pad out playtime, needs to make consequences of choices more predictable/obvious OR it needs some sort of save function.

I was very hesitant to purchase this particular game after my experience with Don't Starve. Although I did enjoy the gameply of Don't Starve, I feel no need to come back to that game, because even with it's rogue-like elements, it feels like the same experience every time. This is something I feel NEO Scavenger did much better. The skill system has so many good choices, that no particular set feels like the \"best\" way to play the game. It simply comes down to which way you actually want to play your current playthrough.\n\nThe other thing NEO Scavenger did particularly well is entry to the game itself. Without limiting the player's choices, the developers found a way to keep the game simple enough at the start that you wouldn't get lost in the incredibly complex mechanics until you actually need to use the particular rules of the game. By starting you with noting to survive the cold weather, you're forced to learn how to utilize the scavenge mechanic, which is the most important decision of the game. If more games that were this complex had openings like this one, I feel more people could explore the depths of these incredible games.\n\nEven though it's clearly done on a budget, the art of the game is very well chosen. I found it easy to destinguish between the different items that I scavenged, and I rarely felt confused by the sprites that were on screen.\n\nEven though the story itself isn't the big draw to the game itself, it's very well written. I found myself genuinely caring about my character and even being sympathetic to some of the people i encountered. These characters were made so well that I genuinely found myself thinking if I really needed to kill the people I came across. Even though it's clearly \"every man for himself\", the difficulty of recovering from fights and the chance of my having to drop my cart and run made each encounter a very difficult choice.\n\nThis is quickly becoming one of my favorite titles that I found on steam.", "timestamp_created": 1419195024, "timestamp_updated": 1419195024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13504191": {"recommendationid": "13504191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101831453", "num_games_owned": 478, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496534740}, "language": "english", "review": "This is by far the best surprise I had in a game.

I can't speak from experience as to how accurate this game nails the zombie apocalypse because personally I have not been in one, but from the fact that I'm a zombie fanatic I can say this game is quite realistic when it comes to living in a wasteland.\n\nYou wake up in a cryogenic facility with something (You later find out it's one of the game's meany creatures, a Dogman) trying to break in. You select your skills and use them to your advantage to defeat the beast, and then you are sent into the massive and unforgiving world that is NEO: Scavenger.\n\nThis game absolutely nails scavenging. You search around for ages finding useless, irrelevant items such as string and broken glass bottles but that feeling of pure, unadulterated satisfaction when you find some of the more useful items such as a backpack or especially a crowbar, is amazing. \n\nDon't get me wrong, this game is unforgiving. As you'll read down below, someone didn't feel like boiling the water they found, got cholera, and died. That's the kind of thing you have to expect on a daily basis from this game. I once forgot to set my noise trap and was murdered by a guy with a meat cleaver in my sleep. I had a shotgun and a noise trap, but it was in my backpack and I didn't feel like getting it out. Another time, I shot and killed a deer, took the meat, put it in my backpack and forgot to cure it, and proceeded to eat it a few hours later after it had spoiled. I got some sort of weird disease and died after hours of diahorrea and blood loss. \n\nAnd while it's unforgiving, it's ultimately very satisfying to play. You find youself getting killed, cursing the game out, and then coming back a few hours later for seconds. And that one rare playthrough where you don't die a horrible, painful death, you just feel awesome. I have tons of screenshots I've taken of the various times when I've had a surplus of stuff.\n\nAlso the developer, Daniel, is always reaching out to his fans.

What at first seemed a little interesting survival game turned out to be a massive and addictive experience, with the most detailed survival mechanics you've ever seen (except maybe Project Zomboid).\n\nIn NEO Scavenger, death is considered a sure thing, the question is how long you will last for. Survive the cold, survive the wounds. Survive the infection, survive the unboiled water you were forced to drink because you had no way to make a fire. Survive the blisters you got because you hadn't found boots yet, while a dogman chases you. Survive the poisoning you got eating unidentified mushrooms. And worst of all, survive the people (NPCs) who want what you've managed to gather.\n\nThe world has unique lore, setting a post-apocalyptic world with paranormal phenomenons happening left and right, but extremely well presented, gradually giving you the information, which is spread through conversations, pieces of newspapers and others.\n\nThe atmosphere is similar(ly angsty) to those of Dark Souls, or EVE online, but more personal and centered around the desperate situation your character wakes up into, like Spec Ops: The Line.\n\nThe combat is quite simple and brutal: He who connects the first hit usually wins.

Game over, you lose everything. \n\nCause you know, stun locks are awesome, especially when NPCS get them and you get no counters to them.", "timestamp_created": 1418914796, "timestamp_updated": 1418914796, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13430112": {"recommendationid": "13430112", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978011687", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419392926}, "language": "english", "review": "-Walked out of spawn...it was cold.\n-Scavenged a few buildings and found two sleeping bags, a right shoe, a sweat shirt and some jeans, along with some other random provisions.\n-Moved on to other places to scavenge, now almost fully equipped...started getting fatigued.\n-Found a nice, warm, empty building to lay down and rest.\n-No option to stop myself from resting once started.\n-Rested until I died of hypothermia...........\n\nBest hypothermia simulator in the world!!!!\n\nIf 17 is \"YEEEEEEHAAAWWWW YIP YIP!!!\" and -2.3 is \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrggghhh!\", I give NEO Scavenger a McDonalds cheesburger/10", "timestamp_created": 1418912482, "timestamp_updated": 1424283960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13428636": {"recommendationid": "13428636", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962402602", "num_games_owned": 1794, "num_reviews": 262, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418903977}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY clunky interface, to the point that it feels like a bad shareware game from 1991.\n\nFound items in a search?

I got it as part of a Humble Bundle and figured it was worth a try. I think I played it for about 5 hours straight that first time. It's probably the greatest random find I've had.\n\nYou have various perks and handicaps that you select to build your character, so you can choose to have excellent vision and mechanical skill but be a weak, feeble insomniac. After you create your character, you wake up in a hospital, with no idea what's going on and why the world has gone to hell around you. Immediately, you have to deal with a dogman who's charging down the hallway towards you. Your traits will affect how you can deal with it. \n\nAfterwards, you venture into the outside world. It is bleak and largely empty. You'll set off, with nothing but the hospital gown on your back. You can forage for food and water, but you should really make sure that the food's fresh. Do you know what berries are poisonous? Can you trust that water? Explore a little further and you'll see some ruined buildings. Scavenge in them and you might find some actual clothes to keep you warm, maybe some preserved foodstuffs or a cell phone. Be careful, though, and try not to make too much noise.\n\nYou see someone on the horizon. You wonder whether they can explain what happened, but then you notice the rough spear that they're wielding. They charge at you, and you try to run. You can't get away fast enough, so you try to fight them off with a broken bottle you've picked up. You take the spear in the shoulder, and you stagger with the pain, but you get in an incredibly lucky thrust with the bottle and your opponent goes down. You shred some of your clothes and wrap the makeshift bandages around your wounds, but it's too late--infection has taken hold. In your last conscious moments you watch night fall, and you see a glow in the distance. It may be an illusion created by your feverish mind, but it almost looks like city lights...\n\nEach playthrough is memorable in this game, even the ones where you freeze to death the first night. If you survive in this strange new world, you can find people and locations that will help you find out background about this world. There is a story here, but you have to go searching for it. Even if you don't find all the backstory, you still have a tale of desperate survival that's incredibly compelling.

Rocks are extremely useful *****\n\ncons:\nsavefile system sucks it's like flash based or w.e so if you clean your computer bye bye save file.\nCould be even more complex and challengeing, it's good don't get me wrong but it could be seriously milked harder into a legendary game.\n\nOut of my expierence of playing almost every game ever made, I give this game these ratings.\n\nfun: 1000/1000 star\ninteresting story: 900/1000 star\nreplayability: 200/1000 star\ncreativity in design: 20/1000 star\nfeeling not like a cloned idea but actually improved apon in it's genere: 1000/1000\nis it a legendary game that will always be fun like mario 6? 1/1000\nTo me it's worth 5-10$\n\nHours of gameplay probably 8 broken up and played when you want to play a game that doesn't use much cpu.\n\nOnce you get op gear will it be boring as hell and never played again? Probably I heard and seen for myself where you can get the good guns and gear easily, it was infact way more easier then it should ever be possible. Really fun story and npc interaction though.\n\nTotal score compared to all the games I've played: 550/1000 good for it's price but not addicting and has a lot of useless starter abilities like electrician that do not really anything currently, yeah it looks good and can be gotten away with until someone uses a wiki, but meh I expected better? Needs a lot more work to become a legendary game.\n\nAlso food for thought I rate world of warcraft a 330/1000 more of a social game.", "timestamp_created": 1418811709, "timestamp_updated": 1418811709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.987531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13412149": {"recommendationid": "13412149", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973809482", "num_games_owned": 760, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426971003}, "language": "english", "review": "Survival Time: 1 days, 11.48 hours.\nPlayer died due to acute bleeding in the lungs.\nI rate this game 1 day out of 11.48 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1418792471, "timestamp_updated": 1418792471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.431894", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13411471": {"recommendationid": "13411471", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990833248", "num_games_owned": 3706, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418792002}, "language": "english", "review": "Difficult to get into, and (sometimes frustratingly) difficult, but also well-written and compelling.

[b]All the time[/b].\nThis costs points. When it's rainy or dark, it will cost more points.\nWhen you reach a city hex, you can loot the location. This, also, will costs you points. Sometimes you will find amazing stuff, and sometimes only scraps of paper. But even those could be useful. Actually, when you start to know the game better, [b]every g\u00f4dd\u00e5mn item is useful[/b]!\nYou will find more stuff if you use a crowbar, or have a light source with you. But beware as this will make more [b]noise and attract people towards your location[/b].\nLooting can also just hurt yourself... like roof collapse. Sh\u00eft happens right?\nSo you loot, equip yourself with what you find, and stroll around. Until some dude approaches and gets to your hex.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nThe combat is [b]textual[/b]. You won't have the map view anymore. But instead, you'll be presented with an interface showing your dude's and opposition's status, and a list of actions you can execute. Everything you will do, like throwing a punch, will have a narrative text describing what's happening. So it's mostly [b]READING[/b] ya hear? No explosions there.\nBut don't be fooled... you can trip on the ground and fall. While on the ground you can try and grab the hostile down, you can crawl back and try to escape, drop your stuff and run like hell, etc. A lot of realistic possibilities here. It is extremely hard. [b]Your first encounter will probably be your last[/b].\n\n[h1]Disease[/h1]\nGetting hurt, bleeding, being cold, drinking sh\u00eft water... these will have [b]consequences[/b]. Try to disinfect your wounds, patch'em up and don't let 'em getting infected.

Hence I created a [url=http://tacticalfreak.blogspot.com/p/neon00b-save-scavenger.html]little tool[/url] to actually still save and, well, cheat. I advise players to die a lot first, and when you feel you are ready, just use my tool.\nBut even if you use it to reload an old save, it won't matter much, because...\n\n[h1]It's random[/h1]\nThe map is randomly generated. But not when you first start the game, nope. It is randomly generated [b]as soon as you discover a tile[/b]. So saving the game and loading an old save will still yield something different :D\nThis is why I am a little \"against\" the permadeath. Loading an old save is not THAT bad. You will experience a whole different game. I would've liked just... ya know, an auto-save every night or something.\nAnyway except for a few spots in the map that will never change, all the rest is random. [b]Random but fair[/b]. You won't like be in a desert without cities for miles ever. They are spawned correctly.\nEven if you are a new player, you CAN make it. Yes because in the end, it's just logic.\nContrary to Faster Than Light (FTL) where there is NO WAY a new player will make it to the end because the randomization is too... random. In NEO Scavenger, [b]the RNG is just right[/b].\n\n[h1]Crafting stuff[/h1]\nAs I said all the items there are useful. Somehow. Because you can craft and even \"uncraft\" stuff. If someone is giving you stuff, or if you finally found something of value... [b]maybe you can try to \"reverse engineer\"[/b] it and discover [b]HOW IT WAS BUILT[/b]. How awesome is that uh? Found a bow arrow? But you have no idea how to create one yourself? No problem!\nThere are also a lot of crafting recipes there. And many different combinations will work. Like you could use your crowbar to roast meat when you don't have a wood stick! Doesn't matter, both categorizes as a kinda \"shaft.\" [b]So it's extremely smart and flexible[/b]. If you are lacking you favorite saucepan to boil water... just think a second... can't anything else, more common, be used as a saucepan? Eh, when I found that out, I literally doubled my lifespan. No sh\u00eft. Think hard.\n\n[h1]Narration[/h1]\nIt reminds me of Fallout 1 & 2. You had that little description box in the lower left which would describe what was going on. Here it's a bit the same. With random encounters or special places being very well described. There is a lot of [b]dark humor[/b] too. If you are not averse to reading you will like it and also find that it's well written.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThere is a story. Your first goal will obviously be to survive, and so, to find something to cover your feet :) But after that painful initial phase, you will [b]meet strange people[/b]. You will find [b]places of interest[/b]. Or you will find new recipes that... use high tech items you had no idea were in the game.\nThe story is interesting and is closely related to the narrative part of the game: the only way to tell you stuff is through old newspapers and stuff. Those are funny as well...\n[i]OX news reporting hoaxes[/i] ;)\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nEvery single one item has its own sound effect. Which is played when you grab the item from you inventory. That's it. But that's HUGE. There is a little music, but it gets a bit repetitive.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIf you like Fallout, post-apocalyptic worlds, a good narration, turn by turn mechanics and a pretty realistic game then don't hesitate. It's a [b]masterpiece[/b].\nYou still unsure? --> try the demo and make your own opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1418721534, "timestamp_updated": 1418800751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 371, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.955194", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13399482": {"recommendationid": "13399482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008697761", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500154122}, "language": "english", "review": "The first time i saw this game i thought it was not a game for me.

Where do I start?\n\nI came to find this game thanks to ''James Recommends'' from Extra Credits. So I knew that, based on his review, this game was going to be good. \n\nBut... when I played it, I realized that my expectatives of ''Good'' were an utter underestimation. The game wasn't ''Good'', it was ''DAMN EPIC!!''.\n\nFor a game with less than 100MB of size, this game stands WAAAAAY HIGHER than many Million Dollars AAA titles when it comes to survival; not even Fallout:New Vegas or State of Decay can hold a candle to NS when it comes to TRUE SURVIVAL. Which, when combined with Rogue-like makes for a WHOLE NEW GAME every time you play it; one in which you can never know if you'll succeed or fail until either of them shows up (Like when I found the Crowbar, some Binoculars and a Sauce Pan on the first town and I thought I was winning, only to freeze to death because I never found any shoes or clothes).\n\nUnlike in those games where you charge into a group of enemies with just a knife and an angry roar, knowing that if you die, you can just hit the Load Save button, in this game, you gotta think out real carefully each of your moves. Just as you would do if you were in the player's shoes (or bare feet). This makes the game feel extremely real and complex. \n\n''Do you sneak up on that scavenger to kill him while he's asleep to steal his shoes and his gun? You already know that almost every gun you see lacks ammo, but what if this one's loaded? What if you trip on something and wake him up? You could end up losing all you've gathered so far, and there's a high chance you won't encounter most of that stuff again.''\n\nThat's the feeling you get. And that's not something I've been able to feel with any AAA titles.\n\nJust a warning, tho; be prepared to die a thousand times, even right after the start. More than once I stepped into the first area just to be torn to shreds by a Feral Dog.\n\n\nMy only critics to this game are the following:\n\n\n-Crafting Instructions are just too vague.\n\nThe crafting system's utterly complex, but the instructions and recipes are even worse. You can't just figure out what do they say or what do they require until you go read the wiki. Perhaps if the items had some sort of Status Screen that told you what properties do they have, it'd be much easier to do this, as just figuring it out can take THOUSANDS of tries.\n\n\n-The Full Map is too hard to understand.\n\nAt simple glance it looks just like a 300% Zoom on a SNES-era Sprite. You can't even tell what's what and even those places that are marked, it's hard to make out WHERE is the mark, as all you see is a big word. (Dunno if the iSlab or Smarphone's GPS Apps make it look better. Never gotten any of those.). I know this must be hard to do with a randomized map, but right now, there's just no real purpose to use the Full Map other than locating the Glow.\n\n\n-The Full Bottles' colors are confusing.\n\nWhiskey are orange-colored when full of whiskey, but also when full of water. Same goes for the Corn-a-Colas which are yellow. This can lead to a lot of confusion at the time of picking up stuff or even drinking. More than once I've been carrying around whiskey bottles filled with both water and whiskey and I've accidentaly drank Whiskey because I thought it was water and got drunk, which often led to death. This issue can be easily fixed with a couple palette swaps, so I hope it's fixed by the time the game leaves Early Access.\n\n\n-MOAR STUFF!\n\nNo, seriously, this game needs more stuff, it's already cool enough as it is, but it could be even cooler. The current Item Pool is just too small for such a neigh-infinite world of random possiblities, so it's a bit sad that, once you manage to get some clothes and shoes to stay alive, they're almost always THE SAME. (Your shoes, the Hoodie, three shirts, some Cargo Pants and a Backpack if you're lucky are what you always end up wearing.). A game this big should have at least twelve variants of every piece of cloth or shoes.\n\n\nAside from those, I have no other complains. This game has the markings of an Indie Masterpiece, and so far, it hasn't let me down. So I hope it has become even more of a Masterpiece by the time it leaves Early Access.", "timestamp_created": 1418531789, "timestamp_updated": 1418531789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13350980": {"recommendationid": "13350980", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970044238", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514170899}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, early access does nothing to hinder the gameplay.

The games combat system is designed to be extremely punishing. Therefore adding a risk vs. reward element into most things you can do. However, even when equipped with the best gear, it often comes down to random luck. I've flat out shot people in the head, had them survive, stay concious and then shoot through my helmet and kill me. Other times, I've shot people in the leg and had them die. It honestly feels like I'm playing turn-based Call Of Duty when using guns. The melee system is even worse. It doesn't really matter what weapon you have or what armor you're wearing if you face a dogman (or any other creature for that matter) and attempt to melee it you're screwed.\nAlso, this game being in a post-apocalyptic setting, you have to scavenge for resources (food, water, clothing, armor, etc.). While normally I would be all for this type of mechanic, especially considering the setting, the speed you run through your resources is ridiculous and, at times, can make the game extremely boring as you get stuck in an endless cycle of, find city, scavenge city, use resources found in city, repeat. While this isn't always true, it is for a large majority of the time. \nHowever, the story elements that are slowly being implemented are making this game much more dynamic and the resource system is becoming less and less of an issue.\nWhere this game shines and puts it head and shoulders about the competition is its realism. Most games shy away from the possibilities of what a post-apocalyptic society could become, but not NEO Scavenger. From the arena, to the gated city of Detroit, this game feels extremely realistic in its setting, something many other games can't claim.\nIf this game was released today, I'd give it a 6/10.

Don't be put off by the mildly ugly graphics.  You will forget them in no time.  What makes this game mind blowing is that it is a rogue-ish game with permadeath, yet it doesn't feel like it.  Sure, the first few times you play you are going to measure your lifespan in hours, but once you get the hang of it you realize that survival is all up to you and completely possible for very long periods of time.  I am writting this after burning a solid 6 hours on this game in a single sitting.  In that entire time I had thrills, upsets, and close calls, but never died.  This is a rougalike game to be sure, but don't let that cause you to run screaming.\n\nThe survival aspects of this game are absolutely awesome.  You find yourself searching for food and water, planning ahead, and deciding when it is worth a risky encounter.  There is no \"I am a bad guy\" badge on people.  See a fellow stranger in the distance?  It is up to you if you want to use surprise to take out a possible threat, or wave and see if he is friendly and wants to talk.  Do you risk a fire to boil water, knowing it might attract a threat?  When it gets dark, do you stumble blindly looking for a good camp, or take a risky spot in the open and hope for the best?  What do you do when you wake up to find a melon head stolen your weapon and backpack; grab a stick and give chase, stalk them, what?  There are always so many options, and that doesn't even get into the tactical turn based combat!\n\nThe combat, while simple on its face is complex and interesting.  Planning is rewarded, but so is on the spot craftiness.   The the game never demands a split second decision, so you have time to ponder your move and roll the dice.  It lets you do so many crafty things and it tends to behave as you would expect.  For instance, imagine you come accross some scary looking person who looks like they want to eat you, and have a host of options.  Do you sneak in close and try and stab him with your trust spear, hoping that this game awesome wound system will let you stun and cripple the guy before he realizes you are there?  Do you try and slip away before he sees  you?  Maybe you decide to bluff and at a distance try pointing your rifle (with no bullets in it) at him, trying to scare him off, if he charges anyways, flip that rifle around and show him the butt of it.  You can jump out of concleament and egg him on, hoping in the rush to get  to you he gives you a solid opening to land the first blow.  Perhaps you get out your old butchers cleaver and start the fight by charging him over onto the ground, and hacking him apart before he can get up.  Hey, he might not even a bad guy, you can always just wave from a distance offering friendly chat and see what he does.\n\nThis game is so unassuming, but it is solildly on my top 5 for 2014, and for the value for the price, it is easily #1.  It says \"early access\", but as far as I can tell, this is a full game.  This game is an absolute gem.  The worst thing about this game is that there are so many things that might scare people off from what is an awesome experience; perm death, ugly graphics, early access, a slightly obscure interface (until you get the hang of it), and a strange theme.  Don't let any of these things scare you off.  This game is amazing!  I can't even imagine what it will be once it is out of early access.

The map is huge, consisting of hexagons which may or may not have item already on the ground, indicated by a box. The looking glass indicated scavenging. The tent indicates your camp sites, and finally the red feet indicate whether someone or you have been there recently.\n\nThis game is not for the faint of heart. In the beginning, you die frequently and most often by things you wouldn't normally expect. There are NPC who are homicidal and roaming the wilds looking to 'scavenge' off your newly dead body. At first I could only last a few hours, and then I quickly learned the skills necessary to survive longer. My average now is 3 to 5 days. The skill/flaw system can be a little frustrating, and there aren't many of either. It could definitely use more of both to allow a better customization of the characters skills and flaws.\n\nOn top of that, there is not a way to customize the characters name, gender, or gender-based clothing, at least none that I have discovered. This is truly a survive or die game. Weather, injuries, cold, hunger, thirst, disease, poison, and combat can all kill you. There are also random hex's that have NPC run stores in which you can trade things for money or for other items. The only city I have found as of yet is Detroit.\n\nThe one resounding issue I have with this game is once you are dead... you are dead. There is no way to save unless you want to dink around in your computers files to rig up some kind save system. While the character is still alive, you can save and come back to your one save, but after death it disappears and you have to start over. I don't see a point in that system, but then again.. I didn't make the game. \n\nI think this game has some real potential. It can be frustrating, and seem difficult but failing has helped me learn how to survive longer and pick the skills necessary to survive. There are little things that I think could be corrected like in-game items, or the way in which skills are used. \n\nMy favorite skills to use would be Trapping, Botany, Medic, Hiding, Tracking, Electrician, Mechanic, and a few others. I'd like to see a sewing skill and possibly the ability to take/train an animal companion. I know if I were trying to survive, I would try to find a dog to help protect my stuff, and me while sleeping.\n\nI am concerned though that the developers are making the game significantly harder, so I think the option to choose a skill level from safe - ultimate survivor could be used to allow many different people with varied experiences with games like this could play casually or have a challenge. I like being able to play through a game and then go back through it collecting all of the little dodads and whatnot. \n\nIn conclusion, I love the basis of this game. I think a few things that need to be changed are the save games, a few additional items in game, a few additional skills and a few changes to how the skills work, a better skill/flaw menu, addition of companions, as well as a difficulty setting.\n\nA bug that I think I have found would be while wearing different shoes, or a single shoe still gives the negative effects of being barefoot. However if the two shoes are the same, the effect goes away.\n\nGreat game, my fiance and I are addicted to it.

I like it a lot, because it's gritty, fairly in-depth and more realistic than almost every other survival game.\n\nNEO Scavenger first asks you to choose your perks/flaws: Botanist, Strong, Myopia, etc. There are no XP and levels, so, mostly, what you see is what you get. After selecting your starting skills, you are thrown into the game barefoot and with only a hospital gown.\n\nYour first order of business is finding the basics of survival: shoes (one left and one right!), warm clothes, a lighter, a crowbar for scavenging, a sleeping bag, tools to obtain clean food and water and something to carry all this stuff around. In fact, the very first treasures you'll scavenge are probably disposable plastic grocery bags. They're very fragile, but they're tiny, weigh nothing and will serve as your first backpack. Those bad boys are little life savers, you have to love them! We should probably produce and dump more plastic bags all over the place for fututre survivors, right now. What do you think of that, environmentalists?\n\nFrom then on, you'll also need to find all the other things you need to survive: clean rags for wounds, alcohol for disinfection, antibiotics, painkillers, a firearm with ammo, gloves, a gasmask for polluted areas, crafting tools, binoculars, noisemakers to warn you of intruders during the night, etc. One of the game's main qualities is that the list of things needed to survive effectively is very, very long, but you can also make do with just the essentials.\n\nContemporary technology is surprisingly useless. A found computer might have no battery, then a found battery might have no charge in it, then a charged battery will reveal the computer is password-locked, then you'll hack it (if you picked that skill)... only to discover the computer only contains pictures of cats. On the other hand, a cheap plastic bottle filled with safe drinking water is always a useful commodity. Is that social commentary or what?\n\nWeapons are also imporant, but not nearly as much as in most survival games. It's possible to completely avoid all combat with a peace-loving build.\n\nSpeaking of which, combat is a strange numberless affair, where you choose broad actions (run forward/back, take cover, trip enemy, threaten). The only numeric value is range, which is enormously important depending on your fighting style. What you do get are surprisingly graphic descriptions of your situation: \"You have passed out from unbearable pain\" or \"You have died from acute bleeding to the lungs\". Ouch. As in real life, he who strikes first usually wins. It's also possible to win a fight and die from your injuries not long afterwards. All in all, fights are terrying (as they should be), the results are sometimes unpredictable and fighting fair is always a stupid idea. Did I mention you can be killed in your sleep (and vice-versa)?\n\nThere's also crafting, there's always crafting. Except here it's realistic. You're not going to craft an assault rifle with rocks in NEO Scavenger. In fact, a good ol'fire is probably the number one recipe. Sorry, no fire by friction if you haven't chosen the Trapper skill at character creation. Making fire without an external source is really not that easy without training. Another essential crafting recipe is: Fire + Water + Receptacle = Boiled (sterile) Water. Don't tell me it's boring until, weakened by diarrhea from drinking dodgy water, you are punched to death by a hobo. By the way, the game doesn't tell you what makes you sick: you only know you messed up somewhere when symptoms start showing up.\n\nThe game leaves the player with three general survival strategies: use nature's gifts to provide for your needs, scavenge cities for pre-apocalypse technology or... murder every survivor in sight for the contents of their shopping bags, RAWR!\n\nThe game has a main storyline, but as of right now it's pretty short. And did I tell you THIS GAME HAS NO ZOMBIES? Yay!\n\nThe game has two main flaws. First, the game could do a better job helping you find points of interest. The map is very large and it's not obvious where the important areas are. The second is almost a praise: I want more of it! I want more items, more weapons, more unique areas, more special encounters, more animals. MOAR! The possibilites of common household items having ingenious survival uses is almost endless. Variety in this game is good, but not great, but things are still being added to the game (and there are mods).\n\nI wrote the initial review while the game was still in Early Access. While I still recommend NEO Scavenger, it turns out the final amount of areas in the game is quite small. I highly recommend some of the more popular mods, which increase the amount of improvised items without changing the dynamic of the game and add some new events/areas.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll quote Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Graham Smith which sums up the game's worth pretty well:\n\"NEO Scavenger is the only survival game that feels like it has anything to do with survival.\"", "timestamp_created": 1417118707, "timestamp_updated": 1511396918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811294", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13110101": {"recommendationid": "13110101", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998721254", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418858049}, "language": "english", "review": "old school, hard ass quality gaming - I freaking love it!", "timestamp_created": 1417116149, "timestamp_updated": 1417116149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13082372": {"recommendationid": "13082372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083696283", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498258089}, "language": "english", "review": "bruh", "timestamp_created": 1416949948, "timestamp_updated": 1416949948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13081675": {"recommendationid": "13081675", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980238865", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 1972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450036990}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is *almost* good, but like many roguelikes I've seen come around, the devs ultimately seemed more concerned with making the game hard than making the game fun.

I'd be a bit more forgiving if this game HAD A PROPER SAVE SYSTEM, but since it doesn't, I can't forgive it for destroying several playthroughs simply because I rolled a bad number.", "timestamp_created": 1416945937, "timestamp_updated": 1425159099, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636399", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13070956": {"recommendationid": "13070956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116182322", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 3627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521729501}, "language": "finnish", "review": "neekeri", "timestamp_created": 1416859038, "timestamp_updated": 1465494768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13061365": {"recommendationid": "13061365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054192031", "num_games_owned": 1289, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461964418}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a bit of a hard sell at first. The user interface is not exactly intuitive, and the graphics are nice but a bit retro.\n\nIf you overcome these initial scepticisms though, what you'll find is a game that is a mixture of \"A dark room\" (minus the initial set-up phase), \"Minecraft\" (minus the blocky 3d graphics) and any Rougelike (so expect to die frequently).\n\nThe basic setup is always the same: you wake up in some kind of cryo-lab, and the world outside has turned into a post-apocalyptic dystopia similar to \"The Walking Dead\" or \"28 Days Later\".\n\nYou have to find out about your own past and uncover the secret of what happened to the world.\n\nYou walk around the landscape on hex-grids, scavenging the woods or the remains of long-gone cities for clothes, food, water and weapons, while avoiding (at least initially) other NPCs or animals, most of which want to see you dead. You can craft things together with recipes you find scattered around randomly, and from time to time you find pieces of newspapers which tell you a bit about what has happened.\n\nThe environment is highly dynamic, you have different weather patterns which impact your sight (when you find a scope or binoculars, you can even increase your visible range), and many other scavengers are roaming the area on their own (one nice example: I once found a corpse, looted it and moved his stuff into my hideout, just to find him chopped to bits of meat when I came back the next day... and of course the killer was not far off and killed me a few minutes later...)\n\nThe story unfolds bit by bit (you have to survive the first night to even get an idea on where you should be moving), and even though I not yet come very far in the story yet (did I mention it is very easy to die in this game?) it is a game I will keep on coming back for \"just one more try...\"\n\nThe only downside (IMHO) is that there is no way of saving the game (except for the \"save&quit\" function), so every death is permanent. And since it's written in Flash there's no easy way of getting the save data out for bakup purposes.

To do this you must survive going through the world and scavenging stuff that you need.  To do this, you enter locations and you must decide if its worth it to scavenge there or not.  You may find nothing or the mother load!...or a trap and a jackass waiting to cave your skull in with a crowbar.\n\nI like how my first OMG YES!! moment was when I found a backpack so I could carry more stuff.  I guess thats the best part of it.  The thrill of finding those essential bits and pieces that you need and surviving those moments where you are attacked.\n\nThe combat requires you to be thoughtful and tactical, until someone gives in or dies.

Sneak around scavenging for clothing, weapons... craft those bits of junk into something useable. Then go out again - you'll still get killed, but perhaps less often. This is a game of learning and trial & error. You will learn as you die. And you will learn as you survive. Its something of a slow burner. You WILL come back to it after a period of frustration. It'll sit there somewhere in your mind, suggesting you have another go - maybe this time...\n\nPermadeath has to be in the game or would essentially ruin the story, and essentially this is the driving force - this game can be replayed with different information based on your skillset - perhaps some things that would be hidden would be revealed.\n\nI feel some things that need improving - crafting for example is good, but would be best if it remembered every combination you'd come up with from previous games (rather like the old son of in the old rogue type games. This has some previous recipes but not many, and trying to remember them all yourself is absurd.\n\nAlso something that (I think) needs changing to a degree is the way loot is calculated - many times you can obtain a hoard from scavenging with almost no chance to gain anything, but then you can repeatedly find nothing when you have a good chance. Certain skills improve or reduce this, but I think too much in some cases.\n\nBasically here is a potentially good game, which needs many more refinements before it can really be considered complete.\n\nI enjoy this sort of game, but I really wonder if I'm actually anything better than totally rubbish at them. The fact is that despite any faults - any time you have what you deem to be a completely unfair death or when you were just starting to do well for once then along comes... a big nasty monster... at least you have the knowledge of what doesnt work next time, or a different skill to pick - maybe you'll endure the early multitude of deaths and finish the game - perhaps I really am rubbish at it, maybe it (the game) needs balancing, or maybe it always will be just a tad too hard.\n\nIn conclusion:\nI'd play it more if I didnt die as often, if I got to see slightly more of the story.\n\nAll too often you go through the initial stages then die in a low level battle.

This is the first and possibly only review I have ever been compelled to write on steam and its something to be said for the quality of this game that I want to save this game for me and not put it in my discard pile. \n\nI hesitated about giving this a yes review for the reason that there is no save function.  I get what you are trying to do with death being death however after spending over one hundred hours and near twenty or thirty attempts just to get as far as the gate of detroit (once)... in the last three cases doing nothing but hunting and hiding in a forest making leather armour (mod?) for nigh on twenty hours of play time only to be slaughtered by two dog men half an hour after setting out for the city then doing the same thing in another game, spending this time ten hours (of real life time)  in a forest making leather armour only to be slaughtered by three men as soon as I left the forest not even being able to run away and then doing the same thing, ten hours in a forest hunting and making armour,  only to be slaughtered while I slept without even waking up even though I had multiple noise traps in place.  Then I tried cheating using a mod to add every skill but it had lost its charm because of this becoming too easy.  I dont want a walkthough,  want a hard playthrough but please not a hundred of them, I dont have the time. \n\nI have stopped playing this game because I dont have this sort of time to spend to get no where in a game.  I choose not to play again to try and get somewhere in the plot only then to later get slaughtered having spent a hundred hours progressing the plot and have to start all over again.  I want to play it through and I commend you for having this idea to have this \"when your dead your dead\" idea but I actually have a real life to survive in and I simply dont have time to spend too much of it locked into this game.  \n\nYes, have an Iron man mode for the realism of the survival aspect of the game, but until there is a save function I will not be returning to this game.  I recommend this game to anyone who has a hundred hours to spend just to get out of the starting blocks.\n\nEDIT... I have changed this from NO to YES to NO to YES... Its too good not to reccomend.  And... then... I started another game... Dan... I hate you... I love you... I hate you... I love you... please add an iron man function your driving me insane.", "timestamp_created": 1415793853, "timestamp_updated": 1415795429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12907053": {"recommendationid": "12907053", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992499674", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471961171}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game.

I still would suggest it to people who like rogue-like(lite) games, and enjoy the survival because the survival is incredibly well done. I\u2019m akso sure I will play more hours of this as time goes. With that said, my main issue is, unlike a lot of other permadeath games, this one has a story to tell, which might take you a long time to figure out when first playing, and it seems really interesting. \n\nThe problem is, very few will ever get to experience that story as no matter how you gear up or character build, your character has the staying power of a lit candle in a hurricane. Little to nothing can stop a low or average enemy from getting in a lucky shot that will knock you out or kill you in one blow, costing you hours of game time. You will lose anything and everything you were working on. Having to re-create a character and starting again with the repetitive cryo facility wake-up scene. I understand this is the concept of this genre, but to have nothing left after working so hard to build up a character and losing 3-5 hours, for me, is frustrating. There are some who may love that, though. Once again, it\u2019s not the permadeath for me, as much as it is the lucky cheap-shot.\n\nThere are several mods for it already, though most just give more items and such. There are no saving mods as of yet, and the only way that truly seems to provide a means to see the story is some kind of invulnerability mod. Though removing the challenge entirely isn\u2019t any fun at all. There is also a great mod out there that gives limited repair features that help shift the gameplay.\n\nWith that said, the scavenging and survival system is absolutely incredible. Sometimes it can be a little over-complicated when you first play, but as a general rule most recipes make logical sense. Found a shard of glass? Use it as a cutting tool, wrap it with a piece of paper for a makeshift shiv, or use it as a weapon in dire need at the risk of cutting yourself. Found a glass bottle? Smash it and use it to threaten off an enemy. Use clean water or whiskey to sterilize your wounds before using those rags you sterilized in boiled water to stem the bleeding.\n\nThe survival is the strongest aspect of this game and it shines over everything. From having to keep warm, to managing your health. Accidentally drank some bad water? Got sepsis from that wound you forgot to clean? You better find a place to hunker down and heal up with that bottle of anti-biotics you found in the locked shed with your makeshift lockpicks. Forage some wood and keep that fire going to stay warm and keep your immune system up, but make sure you set up some noise traps because people and\u2026things can see it burning.\n\nThe in-depth survival system makes this an amazing game to enjoy overcoming what I have said above, which is why I still suggest it. To see an indie dev put together a system that a AAA company could never have the creativity to pull off is a breath of fresh air.

After a friendly interaction with a lovely creature known as a \"Dogman\", you step outside to  experience the outside world of Michigan... and dang, it's cold. Like, \"Oh my God I can't feel my feet and I'm feeling really sleepy\" cold. After a few deaths and several hours of learning the basics (don't eat random berries or mushrooms you find unless  you know they aren't poisonous, that guy with the broken bottle really wants to eat your leg, and yes, it's cold, put some pants on) you really get into this game. \n\nAs others have said, however, an ungodly amount of time can be spent on this game, and it can never be taken back. In a sense, it's like [i]DayZ[/i]. You spend 3 hours finding a weapon, finding your friends wherever they are on the map, and end up faffing around until some gruesome death by either a glitching zombie or a player that only speaks Russian. [b]This, I believe, is another selling point of NEO Scavenger.[/b] In the beginning, you get used to dying. After a while, however, you end up living longer and longer, until one life lasts you hours of real life time. Everything is peachy until that one night you decide to sleep in a forest and forget to set up a noise trap or hide, and you're stabbed to death by some plague-ridden nutcase in your sleep. After a day or two of angry avoidance of the game, you decide to give it a second chance, innocently, you pour more hours into it, only to die in a similar manner.

I would always play Zork in a huddle with friends, but I was always the only one to beat it.  This led me to be fully engrossed in text based games for years to come.  NEO Scavenger takes text heavy elements that remind me of Zork.  These come into play during the small, but quite enjoyable narrative that the player builds into their game.  The exploration and post-apocalyptic atmosphere also brought back memories of Fallout, but much more serious.  This is by no means a bad thing though because players want a very realistic experience, full of imagery, when playing a text heavy game.  This realism is also extremely prevalent during combat with so many options to choose from depending on skills, gear, etc.  However skills and gear can also heavily limit combat.  This helps the player get a feeling for their character better when role-playing a smart, but incredibly weak character.  This game gets a 9/10 from me because even though it's in my list of personal favorites, it has some faults that limit the game.  These are noticeable if too many mistakes are made on a run, lack of devotion causing boredom, or the always prevalent difficulty curve of rogue-likes.

This may be the ongoing question asked of the player by it's developers yet, I guaruntee you will be asking youself this each time you load Neo Scavenger regardless of your experience with it's unforgiving world. Even in it's early access state Neo Scavenger accomplishes what many other developers desperately attempt to attain yet fail to accompllish, an incredibly solid title built in a believable and atmospheric world, all the while laughing in it's large budget competitiors faces because there is yet more to come.\n\n[b]Overview:[/b] Neo Scavenger is a post apocolypic turn based survival strategy game that honors such classics as Fallout and Wasteland while retaining an identity all it's own. Set in an incredibly atmospheric world, the protagonist has recently emerged from a cryo chamber without a memory as to how he got there, who he is or what state the world is in. Within seconds he recieves the answer to the latter in a very unwelcoming way. \n\nYou soon realize that you will desperately need to scavenge this unhospitable world if you intend on your survival and will have to leave your moral bindings behind if you're to be successful. While traveling you will be encountered by an assortment of undesirables that intend on their own as well and will achieve this at any cost, whether it be thievery, murder or deception. To assure your own instead, you will need to do the same.\n\nDuring your journey, you'll be presented with decisions that must be made and many times without prior knowledge of what may occurr based on your actions. You will pre-emptively strike what you deem to be\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] As stated above Neo Scavenger is a turn based survival strategy game with a wide range of varying elements that will affect each new journey you begin. You will be presented with an attribute screen where you must carefully select each according to your playstyle. Each will directly affect what skills you have available in given situations that will come about so, one must choose wiseley. \n\nOnce your travels begin you will need to manage multiple aspects in regards to your health such as hydration, hunger, restfulness, health/illness, injuries, environment temperatures, weather and more. The decisions you make will directly affect the protagonist accordingly so, one must manage these elements with confidence or otherwise you'll be swiftly presented with a message that you will assuredly see quite often, the death screen. This will come often and without warning aside from your available character management system. With that being said make sure you obsess about the details because, it's all that stands in the way of you and the grim reaper.\n\nAside from illness, fatigue, hunger and the like, you will of coarse encounter a variety of enemies along your journey that also as stated above intend on your demise. Combat is performed via a turn based system which, issues you an incredible assortment of options depending on your original skill/attribute selection which, I must reaffirm must be choen wisely! The options presented during combat range from hide, melee, , kick downed opponent, headbutt, sneak, ranged, retreat, offer/demand surrender, offer/accept cease fire, attempt to talk and countless other available options that are once again available depending on you attribute selection.\n\n[b]Do I need to remind you to choose them wisely once again? I do? O.k check it out, this one's gonna hit home a bit more....Unless you carefully choose your attributes, you may within seconds contract any one of the following unpleasant status illnesses or diseases: \n\nBlindness, Blisters, Blue Rot, Cholera, Coughing Blood, Crippled Limb, Defoliant Exposure, Diarrhea, Gastroenteritis, Heat Stroke, Hypothermia, Hypovolemic Shock, Poisoned, Sepsis, Shock, Vomiting\n\nSound fun? No? Then choose wisely my friends, trust me.[/b]\n\nYou will without a doubt die and die often, yet during each playthrough you will obtain more knowledge in regards to how to survive and future strategies that come of it. \n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] The graphics of Neo Scavenger serve their purpose. They are in no way revolutionary and aren't intended to be, nor needed to be whatsoever. Yet if there were one weakness of Neo Scavanger this would be it. As mentioned above the graphics serve their purpose but, that in no way means that the options available should be so barron. The options available are as basic as it gets and are as folows: \n\n[b]Full screen, windowed, 16:9, 4:3, frame rate limiter, filter and stretch.[/b] \n\nPretty uneventful to say the least and due to the graphics engine's limitations they do not scale. So expect the presentation to be a bit lackluster. Yet, once again they serve their purpose and it will not ruin your experience whatsoever. So take this section with a grain of salt because, if you're in the market for a game in this genre, graphics are the least of your worries.\n\n[b]Sound:[/b] The music and sound effects although they may not present themselves often are perfectly crafted to create a tense and fitting atmosphere. Given the situation, the music will accompany and heighten your feeling of desperation within this incredibly depressing world. With each fade in the music will most definitely add an element that most other games cannot match. Considering so, the developers deserve an award for knowing when less is more and Neo Scavenger is a perfect example of that. The echoing sounds of the barron wilderness accompany the simplistic soundtrack design and add to a believable experience. \n\n[b]Story:[/b] The story although seemingly simplistic and unoriginal at first is where Neo Scavenger will surprise you at every turn and leave you wanting to know more about our most unlucky protagonist. Although at first sight it may seem minimalistic, you will be proven wrong as you progress further into this world of chaos he so sadly awoke to. The story contained in Neo Scavenger will most assuredly be a driving force behind your desire to continue multiple play sessions to discover more about what happened to this once populated land. As you can see by my vagueness, I am doing my best to protect any insight as to specific story elements which, should serve as a hint that it's most definitely there and is most definitely worthwhile. Trust me when I say, there will be many more than one occasion that will leave you in awe and in horror.   \n\n[b]Replay Value:[/b] [u]The replay value found in Neo Scavanger is second to none[/u] and I am by no means stretching my imagination out of bounds to come to that conclusion. The very fundamentals of Neo Scavanger are built to lure the player back into it's world of dessolation, no matter how many times they've played before. With each play through, you will gain knowledge as to how your next session could possibly last longer and you will most definitely feel an urge to apply it for a \"better\" outcome. What will give you an even more increasing desire to launch it again is that, even after you believe you have mastered it's many facets of gameplay.....[b]you will die and die you will, often and mercilessly. Yet regardless, you will most assuredly return once again to the world of Neo Scavenger and enjoy every gut wrenching second.[/b] \n\n[b]Final (Early Access BETA) Review Score: [u]8.3/10[/u][/b]\nAlthough still in Early Access form, I in no way feel it to be a hinderance to come to a determination that Neo Scavenger should find a place in the library of any gamer looking for a title that will surpass their expectations and leave them in shock that they haven't played it before. The developers at Blue Bottle Games have poured an incredible amount of love and attention into their world of solitude and despair which, I guaruntee will leave you feeling the same.

Le mec habitu\u00e9 \u00e0 la brousse, \u00e0 la campagne, aux vals bois\u00e9s et aux plaines verdoyantes ou brun\u00e2tres quoi.\n\nEn fait... Peut-\u00eatre que c'\u00e9tait \u00e7a le probl\u00e8me.\n\n\u00c0 peine sorti de ma capsule cryog\u00e9nique je me suis dit que le mieux, quand on est \u00e0 poil ou pas loin, amn\u00e9sique, qu'on se r\u00e9veille en plein milieu d'apr\u00e8s-midi, que le ciel se couvre et que l'hiver approche, c'est de se trouver des nippes vite fait. Je veux dire, on a beau \u00eatre s\u00e9v\u00e8rement burn\u00e9, la chemise d'h\u00f4pital c'est limite quand on a pas envie que les parties en question deviennent les parties les plus imposantes de la partie alentour.\n\nPuis il me faudrait bien vite un truc \u00e0 bouffer. Genre une poign\u00e9e de baies. Ou deux \u00e9cureuils. Alors quand j'ai rep\u00e9r\u00e9 une colline pas loin, je me suis dit que c'\u00e9tait le bon plan. D'ici elle me g\u00e2chait la vue, mais de l\u00e0-haut...\n\nAlors j'ai fait ni une ni deux, je me suis mis en route. Vingt minutes plus tard - \u00e7a vous \u00e9pate, hein - je pouvais enfin voir plus loin que le bout de mon nez. Soufflant comme un phoque en rut, j'ai avis\u00e9 le bled paum\u00e9 - ou plut\u00f4t ce qu'il en restait - qui se pointait pas loin en me narguant.\n\nAlors je me suis d'autant plus boug\u00e9 les fesses - que j'esp\u00e9rais pas trop voyantes \u00e0 travers la sape bleut\u00e9e qui faisait semblant de les recouvrir.\n\nJ'ai fonc\u00e9, en esp\u00e9rant trouver un truc ou l'autre qui pourrait m'\u00eatre utile : des chiffons sales, un po\u00eblon, un vieux sac en plastique trou\u00e9, n'importe quoi.\n\nMouais. En fait tout ce qui m'attendait, c'\u00e9tait des carcasses d'immeubles \u00e0 peine capables de se souvenir de la fin du monde qui les avait renvoy\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de pierre y'a des si\u00e8cles de \u00e7a... Tout juste une ou deux bicoques minables qui tenaient encore debout.\n\nEn d\u00e9sespoir de cause, je suis entr\u00e9 dans la premi\u00e8re.\n\nC'est l\u00e0 que j'ai vu le graal. Une armoire en \u00e9tat presque correct. Et qui dit armoire dit foutoir - c'est beau la po\u00e9sie. Et comme chacun sait, les d\u00e9chets d'un type sont pour un autre type les d\u00e9chets qu'on utilise pour taper sur la gueule du lascar qui veut te piquer la godasse gauche que t'as enfin trouv\u00e9 apr\u00e8s deux semaines \u00e0 passer tes soir\u00e9es \u00e0 enlever les \u00e9chardes. \n\nAlors je me suis approch\u00e9. Elle a pas boug\u00e9. Je l'ai empoign\u00e9e. Elle a pas bronch\u00e9. Je l'ai secou\u00e9e. Elle a g\u00e9mi. J'y ai \u00e9t\u00e9 plus fort. Elle a failli me tomber sur la gueule.\n\nFaute d'avoir Martell dans le ventre, je me suis mis martel en t\u00eate. J'ai pouss\u00e9, tir\u00e9, grond\u00e9, hurl\u00e9... Et elle a c\u00e9d\u00e9 en r\u00e9pandant un \u00e9norme nuage de poussi\u00e8re qui sentait dr\u00f4le. J'ai \u00e9ternu\u00e9. Je me suis dit que c'\u00e9tait le meilleur moyen de r\u00e9veiller une allergie que j'ignorais, ce genre de coup foireux.\n\nEt je suis reparti.\n\nFort heureusement, je n'ai mis qu'un petit quart d'heure \u00e0 crever d'une h\u00e9morragie pulmonaire aigu\u00eb.\n\n...\n\nVois-tu, lecteur, c'est \u00e7a tout l'attrait de NEO Scavenger. C'est violent. C'est vicieux. C'est abracadabrantesquement d\u00e9gueulasse. Et c'est purement textuel.\n\nIl ne faut pas s'y tromper : pour une fois ce sont les images qui servent de support au texte, et l'imagination qui fait le reste. Des escapades en terrain douteux aux combats marathoniens mais \u00f4 combien vivants, chaque aventure de NEO Scavenger est une historiette, une nouvelle, un roman - selon la vitesse qu'on met \u00e0 se faire avoir par un monde qui d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment n'est plus fait pour les humains.\n\nEt c'est purement jouissif.\n\nDu moins si on aime \u00e7a.

While I wish there was more plot to explore, it is early access and more of that is probably coming.

But put them all together, and almost everything you do is a meaningful choice that will continue to affect you throughout the game.\n\nAlso, my favourite contemporary novel is The Road, by Cormac Mccarthy, and this is as close as you are going to get to experiencing that chill when someone asks:  \"What are you eating?\"\n", "timestamp_created": 1412986570, "timestamp_updated": 1412986570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595812", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12438131": {"recommendationid": "12438131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069810996", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426431182}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is what you get when you combine deadly dieseases with fallout  and brutally written fighting text 11/10 GOTY", "timestamp_created": 1412965297, "timestamp_updated": 1412965297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491890", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12429104": {"recommendationid": "12429104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060160824", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481572415}, "language": "english", "review": "Loving this game at the moment, a refreshing change from the usual RPG / survival / strategy games that are around at the moment.

There's a lot of depth and possibilities.\n\nThe decision of drinking water or not might kill you a day later in the game as you die of an infection. Some enemies have guns but no ammution, so picking up a fight might either be deadly or immensively rewarding. Dogmen can hunt you down in the night while you're getting some well deserved rest and kill you in a few moves. Othertimes you desperately search for a dogman to rescue you from starvation (They drop a lot of tasty meat). Resorting to cannibalism at one point in the game might result in an impossible to satisfy desire for human flesh later on.\n\nAll the choices have consequences, many not immediately clear. This feels a bit arbritrary at first, but once you get to know the machanics you can use this to your advantage (there's a wiki that serves as a decent entry point, explaining most mechanics and providing a few tips, just make sure not to spoiler yourself). You can shoot enemys and then run away to loot their corpses later when they died of bloodloss. Or you can sneak up to sleeping enemies and hit them unconscious with a monkey wrench before they know what's going on.\n\nThere's no leveling up, no new skills to get (there's actually a way to get a few additional skills, but you don't get them regularily). Your chances of winning a fight mostly depend on your equipment, sometimes you find a loaded gun on your first day and othertimes you're desperately searching for a way to cook your water.\n\nThe art of being succesfull in NEO Scavanger lies in making the right decisions. If you have tough luck and don't get the gear you need or you're bleeding all over the place, you stay away from fights for a while. There's definitively a considerable learning curve, if you enjoy games with depth then this one is worth a look.\n\nThe interface is not always intuitive and needs some getting used to, but then again that might very well change until the game leaves beta.\n\nI expected this to just be another casual game I spend a few hours on, but it really stands out and is loads of fun.

There are many, many ways in which you can approach the simple task you are given - survive, and all of them are satysfying yet challenging.

What's more, the game is suprisingly fair for a rougelike - i've been killed without any chance at defending or escaping only once, while sleeping in some town ruins (which is obviously not a smart idea as these are heavily contested by looters and scavengers and i should have expected something like that to happen). The combat system is very entertaining and has some neat depth to it, at least when you are fighting on even ground. If you assault a random, starving unarmed guy with a spear there won't be any challenge, but with the same spear you can try to take on mutants, soldiers, and hunting-rifle wielding manhunters if you have the right traits and choose your moves wisely. Or you can lure those guys into some other guys, have them fight, and then move in to scavenge their stuff. Or just run and try to avoid them.

There is just so much they could do here.  Combat feels granular and staisfying, while at the same time being crazy-lethal if you're not careful.  The loot you find feels like you're struggling to survive, and the crafting system is elegant.  Character creation is simple, but offers meaningful choices.  It's got a LOT of good stuff in it.\n\nBut the main game also wants to have a story.  And that main quest line feels kinda shitty when it's next to what would make a fantastic open-world survival game.  Since death is frequent, and often from kinda unfair places, having to redo the same quests over and over is unsatisfying, to say the least.  And I'm not a hundred percent sure if the game has magic in it or not, because it sure seems like it sometimes, and that clashes with the flavor of a sci-fi wrecked earth.\n\nOh, the deaths.  Man.  I have died a dozen times at least from starting a game, and freezing to death before I can find shoes.  I have died because I can't find clean water, or anything to boil water in to sterilize it.  I have died from a single lucky gunshot.  I like how lethal the game can be, but I do not enjoy at all how arbitrary it feels at times.\n\nAlso, the demo thing.  The demo shows off a scavenging system where each city tile has multiple things to search.  Do you check the storage shed, which may have nothing but is pretty safe, or do you go for the high rise, where you might get jumped, but could have a lot more left over?  The main game has one thing to search per tile.  Choice : eliminated.  Just right out the window.

If anything. ANYTHING comes within melee range and you're carrying a branch, they can kill their ass goodbye.\nGot a rifle? Nevermind the bullets, just use the gun's butt and turn them into a greasy paste.\n\n- If you get a disease, that's pretty much the end of the game. I was in an extremely profitable run, but caught dysenteria, then bloated, then the symptoms subsided. It came back not long after, then I reached \"the lights\" and I traded almost everything for a medikit, which couldn't do anything to save my life.\n\n- There's an enemy that will call for reinforcements in the middle of a fight. While this is an interesting and welcome mechanic, IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE CALLING MONSTERS FROM NEARBY HEXES. THEY ARE GENERATING MORE OF THEM. I got into a fight with one of them, I was hiding and using a slingshot and by the time I managed to kill the first, 4 more had shown up. By the time I killed the next, 3 more had appeared. I kept picking them off, but more kept being summoned.\nHad it not been for the lack of ammo, I wonder if they would've kept spawning infinitely?\n\n- It's turn based, but sometimes my actions are limited. Sometimes I get 5 actions per turn, sometimes, I just get 1, and I get no explanation as to why.\n\n\nLike any good roguelike, it relies in random chance.\n\nIt has a very interesting crafting system that uses the skills you picked and an array of \"substitute materials\" in which it specifies what *kind* of item you need to craft.\n\"Waterproof, fireproof container\" may refer to a pan or a glass bottle, \"sharp edge\" may be a piece of glass, a shiv, or a knife...\n\nIt's a very interesting game, which is a bit frustrating at times. If you get out of a bad fight alive, you're likely to die anyway.\n\nCombat is turn-based with options for actions, which will vary depending on what you picked for skills. For example, picking [Tough] will allow you to headbutt an oponent sometimes, and the [Trapping] skill will let you lure an enemy into a makeshift trap.\n\nCrafting is relatively easy. Drop the right items and skills into a grid, click the \"craft\" button, presto. You got yourself a new bow.\n\nIn the end, yes, it's still early access, but it's still fun, complex and interesting. I had a smile on my face when I fought a big, furry monster barehanded, took no damage, and got a \"video recording of you beating the crap out of a wolf-man barehanded\".\nI like a game with a sense of humor.", "timestamp_created": 1411847567, "timestamp_updated": 1411847567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12254497": {"recommendationid": "12254497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055112134", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470120655}, "language": "english", "review": "Tip- Always charge to the enemy 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1411788716, "timestamp_updated": 1411788716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12246482": {"recommendationid": "12246482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072367635", "num_games_owned": 381, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511037960}, "language": "english", "review": "To the developers I love this game I have about 15+ hours of offline play as well as my online time and it is just great I love the permadeath, random encounters and traits features. But I would like to see more traits a new start instead of just starting in the room with the dogman all the time it just gets annoying. There should also be an in game guide for beginners to get them started instead of just forcing them to learn basic features. \n\nThe good thing about this game is that it makes you think ahead like should I or should I attack this enemy to get his gear Considering his weapon do I have enough medical items if I do get injured. Another one of the cool things is how suddenly a battle can change one minute you can be shooting the S**t out of the guy then the next minute he caves your head in with his crowbar.  Considering your opponent is a big thing for example I was trying to kill a melon head then he starts calling for others so I started to fight them but then my guy got tired so I had to retreat. When I got out of the combat screen I saw that all 4 hexes in front of me were filled with melon heads which would have made me pass out if I kept fighting and could have killed me.  \n\nThe things that aren\u2019t that good about this game are not very major just things like the lack of types of enemies, traits, the same starting room all the time, no beginners tutorial, some overpowered enemies, how you can only put one weapon with a strap over your shoulder, sometimes there is a lack of enemies around and there could be more items like more bags, guns, melee weapons and clothing.\n\nBut overall this is one of my favorite games that I own and not just on steam out of all my games.

Great updates from the developer.\n\nNow, although my review is much more positive and this is probably one of my top indie games, I still retain my old complaints from before:\n\nYou are referred to as \"Player\" which kindof kills the immersion. No way toname your character, no \"Phillip Kindred\" or \"Phillip\". Just \"Player\".\n\nThe forced permadeath (as opposed to optional) and flaws of RNG (instances where a NPC will appear with a gun 4 feet away at Round 1, and shoot you instantly killing you, or stepping out of the Cryo Center beginning and encountering a dogman.) are also a bit stupid at times.\n\nWhen will developers learn that permadeath should always be optional? This is yet another developer who forces their playerbase to play the game the way the developer himself wants- not the way that is most fun. In this way, the bad design and RNG can instantly kill you, forcing you to lose hours of work!\n\nSo for the fundamentalist \"force your playstyle down their throats\" mentality so many roguelike devs have, I do not recommend this game. If you don't mind this playstyle, even when it is not fun, then I definitely recommend.\n\nAlso, the game is a bit easy once you learn the way to do things or read a guide. Once you learn that Spear + always 3 feet away = Easy Win in all Combat (unless they have a gun, in which you die instantly), some of the fun is taken away.

The game is really difficult yet it manages to make the experience fun. And when I say difficult I mean difficult, it's not a question of if you will die, it's more of a question WHEN will you die.\n\n You start in a cryo facility completely nude, save for a hospital gown. This is a problem because un-like other survival games the temperature is a very important part of the game. If you're not wearing multiple layers of shirts as well as pants and shoes you will freeze to death minutes after you start.\n\n The health system is really neat. It requires you to bandage each individual cut you receive. There are also injuries like broken bones that are severely crippling because of how little room you are given to carry things. The inventory system gives you a couple options: Carry it in your hands or if you have a backpack you can put it in there. Aside from that you can put things in your pants. However not even the largest backpack gives you a ton of room so every limb needs to be functioning for you to survive. There is also a range of illness that you can catch. They can be related to the cold, an infection from a cut, drinking/eating tainted water and food (respectively), and a whole host of other diseases that I've yet to experience.\n\nTL;DR The health system is pretty intricate and requires dilligantly repairing yourself if you're going to live as well as being sanitary.\n\nThere are bandits and other monsters that prevent you from getting to comfortable. The combat in Neo Scavenger is also pretty realistic. If you fall over or get stunned it could be it for you. Or maybe not. Not everyone in this game is a blackbelt and the majority of people, including you will often stumble in combat or miss their attacks. In-fact even just charging at your enemy is a risky move becuse you could trip and open yourself up to being stomped. Guns in this game are well done and you won't become invincible if you can get one. They are decently common, however, ammo is not. You may be lucky to find maybe 6 rounds that fit into your gun. But guns are not completely uselss, though. A single bullet can end a fight. Being shot in the torso is enough to make you fall over and possibly passout, destined to either be looted and wake up naked and bleeding with your guts strewn about or to get stomped once your opponent has reached you. Bullets will also cripple/break bones so being shot in the leg or arm might not be directly fatal but the resulting infection/unability to carry things could be.\n\nTL;DR Combat is also really realistic and fair (except for when the Bad Muthas are ganging up on you).\n\nCrafting is also, unsurprisingly decently realistic. There isn't tons of stuff you can craft but what you can craft is realistic. For instance if you want to butcher the bandit you just killed, cook him up, and finally eat him there are several ways to do so. Unlike some games where you must have a certain tool this game allows you to use all sorts of simmilar tools to do the same thing. When you're butchering the dead bandit you can use nearly every sharp object in the game to complete this task. Crafting also will occasionally require that you have specific traits that are set up at the beggining of the game. There are a few vehicles that can be made/found and can be used to pull some of the crap you're carrying at a penalty to speed.\n\nTL;DR There isn't much to say. Crafting is realistic but there isn't tons to make.\n\nThere is no story right now, so there's not much to say about that.\n\n\nBad stuff:\n\nThe user-interface is a bit messy.\n\nThere isn't much NPC-Player interaction other than killing eachother or NPCs acting indignant when you ask them stuff about the world.\n\nShould you buy this game?\n\nYes! Even though it isn't completed and there is no story it's a fun game. The devs seem interested in completing this game so it's a safe bet that they won't abandon the project if they make bank on EA. I'm honestly surprised that more people haven't bought this game. Fans of Fallout and survival games will enjoy this game thoroughly. However, if you are not interested in games being realistic and you hate non-3D, mostly text-based, and not FPS games then don't buy this.\n\nRating: 9/10 Buy it.\n\nTL;DR  It's a good game.

God help you should you get attacked before findin a weapon.\n\n\nI really liked this game (& the developer) but I can;t in good faith reccomend it.\n\n\nAlso the combat is like doing the Math portion of the SATs whilst \u023fhit-faced; an ardous ordeal whereupon your efforts to apply skill or reasoning only inhibit the actual deciding factor: random chance.", "timestamp_created": 1410359163, "timestamp_updated": 1424135001, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.408130", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12036196": {"recommendationid": "12036196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034149148", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510413143}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games.

That's why there will be a long, LONG review on it. To Start, in even a short time of five hours, this game has left a great impression on me, from death to art style to dialogues... It's brilliant to begin with.\n\nGameplay: You wake up in the middle of Michigan in some sort of year, in which humanity is back to the dark ages. Heal yourself, fight, scavenge, explore, talk, DAMN. And more. Every choice is better then Mass Effect's Endings and choices. DAAAAMN. 10/10\nStory/Quests: Survive in the apocalypse, find out who you are, DUN DUN DUN! Kinda cliche, but I will give the quests and random encounters credit. 7/10\nDialogues: Pretty long, and most of the lore is delivered through it, which was somewhat of a let-down. However, the dialogue was good. I'll shame it for it's lack of a Dialogue Tree thus far. 7/10\nAI: The AI was great. Enemies were either cowards or knew how to fight, and their AI reflected that. With the combat system, it sets up a difficulty of COMPLEXITY, and that's either really good or bad game design. Here, it's done great. 8/10\nWorld Design: Semi-Dynamic, beautifully designed, randomly generated. It's luck, but damn good luck. 9/10\nGraphics: The game is set up in a 32-bit art style (I believe?), and the graphics look promising. Some shots of the world are detailed, even with 32 pixels.

What do you do? Hide? Lock the door? Dump another cyrotube so that someother poor sod gets eaten?\n\nWhen you survive that (and it's impossible not to) you are thrown into the big, bad world of post apocalyptic Michigan. I've battled canabalistic mobsters over a bottle of whiskey, I've died of Cholera because I failed to purify my water, I've done a whole lotta things, but won't go into much detail due to the spoilers that would arise.\n\nPros:\nGreat gameplay\nGraphics fit well\nRegular updates (Thanks Dan!)\nIt just went into the finished game (Early Acess person)\nLots of tools, bags, boxes, weapons and general stuff\nSteam trading cards (If that's something you judge by)\nBrilliant crafting system (the sun can be used for example)\nTetris-like inventory that matches weight with space (Yes, I'm looking at you Skyrim/Fallout)\nWell-done combat system\nFull range of medical conditions, and more are being added. (Blisters, cuts, lacerations, bruises, punctures, abrasions, burns, etc)\nThoughtful (albiet incredibly frustrating) storyline\n\nCons:\n\nThere are only two things I dislike:\nThe first is the random encounters. Now that they are much more frequent, they play a bigger role in the game, however attempting to do the morally dubious option, nearly always gets you injured (not killed, but injuries very quickly can become fatal.) \n\nTwo cases: You enter an arcade where there has been a slaughter by the fanatically religious Blue Frogs. A man croakes to you to help him. Helping him, gives you small items, but useful, bottles of water, lighter etc. Rifling through his pockets results in anything from a bruise to a cut due to him fighting back. Next example: A pimp comes up to show off a prositute, you can walk off, but because I wanted to see what happens, I asked if I could hire her.

This is a true survival game unlike any other.\n\nThe mechanics are very balanced, and you have to do many things to survive.

In the Kentucky Derby of the rather numerous games (a few of which have or are solid enough to merit at least some serious note) in this generally broad set of the Post-Apocalyptic/Survival genre of the current/modern PC scene, [b]NEO Scavenger[/b] is a Thoroughbred Champion of the most uncomplicated sort.  \n\nThe thundering hooves of the race set the pace out of the gate, nearly beating a tattoo on your ribs from within the moment you find yourself thawed and unceremoniously deposited into a world that appears to not only have been blasted and scarred by the now typical arsenal of Post-Apocalyptica, but also one haunted by Werewolf-like monsters -among a number of others-  that are both imminently fatal, but also understated in a way that for my own part recalls the same sort of creeping, crawling, truly psychological horror upon my initial encounters with some of Lovecraft's more authentically gripping horrors.  \n\nWith a pedigree of the caliber that [b]NEO Scavenger[/b] boasts for itself in my ever so discerning gaming tastes, the more atypical or \"monstrous and supernatural\" of the associations piercing my own memory and stretching all the way back to 1931 and the horror that rose from Y'ha-nthlei to consume and squat over Innsmouth as the Dagon's Deep Ones.  The second major thread is likely more easily expected and certainly open to being related to by a (vastly) wider audience in the sense of the overall and yet still growing popularity of the genre, this association springs forward over (the next two and three) centuries, bathed in the near incandescence of the white washed mediocrity of the just shy of unending faux 1950s Apple Pie-Americana and all consuming oceans of nuclear fire and equally inescapable Fallout.  \n\nIn contrast to the almost stark bleakness that Lovecraft instilled in me at times - without being overtly apocalyptic; whereas Fallout inspired and from time to time continues to inspire the notion that humanity might well resist and rise again on the dark side of whatever Great Catastrophe it happens to be this time.  And it is certainly a blend of these personal, half-imagined (and again, doubly personalized) inspirations and senses of direction for my gaming imagination that are invoked upon finding my way out into [b]NEO Scavenger's[/b] wide-open Michigan, a great American state that it would seem will take a little more than a single puny Apocalypse to wipe off the map altogether.\n\nI imagine that aside from being a logical decision for a one-man marching band, along with/and cost-effective from the angle of overhead and production costs, the old-school vibe and streamlined [i]everything[/i] go a great ways in the direction of encouraging the individual player to engage the game in a way that other, more modern examples do not and cannot allow for.  Specifically, there aren't so many details, so many aspects of the experience predetermined by hard-coded and visualized default automatically and inescapably included in the Scavenging experience from the mouse click on.\n\nThe Crafting System is a standout aspect of the Gameplay Mechanics for [b]NEO Scavenger[/b], which speaks to a bit of that aforementioned logic - it being pretty pointless to spend an entire game scavenging for junk that doesn't, or can't be combined with something to do or become anything useful.  The type and variety of that junk you'll be so happily scavenging is at a fair balance at the moment - though more melee and/or ranged (re: improvised DMRs/battle rifles) weapons of any stripe and variety, as well as pretty much any new items at all will always make me happy.  The combat system is similarly uncomplicated and crisp, though perhaps taking a game session or two for many of the more fast-paced FPS-twitchy gamers of the here and now.\n\nIt's these invitations to the individual imagination that - along with the perfectly applied Game Mechanics- are the most easy and obvious examples of the true genius you can find here.  Or, to restate it again in final summary, there's so much about [b]NEO Scavenger[/b] that will allow the gamer to become as immersed in and rewarded by their experience as the breadth, depth and staying power of their imagination will allow.", "timestamp_created": 1402940191, "timestamp_updated": 1402940244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "10493163": {"recommendationid": "10493163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025910931", "num_games_owned": 1068, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404877474}, "language": "english", "review": "I think the fact that I spent 12 hours straight playing this yesterday should be enough of a thumbs up.

As a parent of two children, it's rare when I spend 24 hours (at the time of writing this review) on a single game.\n\nAlthough I am still working my way through the narrative, I am finding it very interesting and it reminds me of my early days of computing where the story is told using text with minimal pictures, allowing you to form your own image of what's going on.  I didn't realize I had missed that until I played this game.  It's great.\n\nIn other games (Elder Scrolls, Terraria) I have not been a huge fan of crafting, but I'm finding that in this game I really enjoy it.  I've found most of the basic recipes, but I have a feeling some more will appear as I progress through the narrative.  This game has changed my opinion of crafting in games and got me looking into others (Project Zomboid, for example).\n\nAs this game is still in beta, I think some user interface improvements would be helpful going forward.  Some examples include the ability to easily combine stacks of items such as pills, without removing them from the pill bottles, and the ability to consume stacks of items such as berries (rather than eating one at a time).  Recipes could be streamlined as well if there were a way to chain them together.  For example, harvest meat, create fire, cook/cure meat.  Or create fire, sterilize water.  These are minor annoyances and don't detract from the enjoyment of the game, but could greatly streamline things.\n\nOverall, I really like this game.  As someone who didn't care for rogue likes or crafting games in the past, this game has really opened my eyes.  I don't know how to explain other than I play the game just for the fun of the game.  Rather than playing to progress the story as in a traditional RPG.  Many times, I don't even pursue the story; I just scavenge and try to get the best equipment and camping gear possible.  Lastly, I'm also excited to see what the recently implemented modding ability will bring.\n", "timestamp_created": 1401032890, "timestamp_updated": 1401032890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "10224721": {"recommendationid": "10224721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014313854", "num_games_owned": 695, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482164320}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is actualyl surprisingly good!

And i really like the simplicity of the design and the general way the game throws stuff randomly at you. It's not Disneyland and at least you do not need to worry about the occasional troll like in DayZ or else. \nBUT.\nHere goes:\n   - The GUI is sometimes cumbersome to control. For example you need to switch from the crafting screen to the movement screen to end your turn with a click of the mouse. Or you need to get send to the movement screen after waking up. need to go to the sleeping screen to sleep again. I see that the pattern of view fields on the left and action fields on the right is partially implemented. but could use some rework to make it more smooth. \nAnd the inventory moves stuff around, when consumed, that just confuses.\n   - You do not really see how many moves you got left and how much moves something takes. As a person, you normally have a good feeling how long you take for what task and plan accordingly.\n   - The important part, realism: \n   - Infections do not kill you within hours \n(i had no fights, no injuries and i get killed by an infection of a wound recieved in a fight, just a few turns back.. That got treated with sterile cloths and antibiotica... yeah no). \n  - Cured meat lasts far longer than two days tops. Iregularly smoke fish without salt and fish is far more prone to go bad than regular meat, and it lasts longer.\n  - The water consumption is way over the top, for the climate displayed. Heck you can't even sleep a night through without waking up by thirst in the middle of darkness!\n\nI'd like to see the points above as an encouragement to the dev to make a good game great.\nAs i said, i got no problems with the randomness of the opponents or that you can get killed by a lucky blow of your opponent. Shit happens ! \nRandom loot, fine by that. \nSelling Prices at the Junkyard. Maybe Tannine Tea is a bit much, but thats a small thing. \nCorn-A-Cola too much effect? Nope! I've seen people collapse after they fell into a sugar and caffein low with red bull. \n\nI am unsure about the watermechanic of the game . Normally water from flee flowing runnels and streams is generally safe to consume to an extend (i mean the setting is clearly not in the tropics). Best but slowest is water gathered after rain or from dew, then again we do not know how much the rain is polluted in the game. \n\nAll over all a good game, considering the pricetag and that it is early access.

It's very reminiscient of the original point and click games such as Fallout and Baldur's Gate with even similar typed \"cells\" you interact with. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. In this case it works great for the way the game wants you to play. Finding resources and survival are obviously key to this type of game and they don't fail on that note.\n\nHowever, the combat seems way too strange. Albiet, if you have a weapon (melee or ranged) the fights are much easier to succeed; my encounters with fights early game with no weapons lead in instant failure. I don't know many people in an apocalyptic setting that can take getting punched, tackled, kicked, and mercilessly harrassed for very long. Yet the survivors you fight, have exceptional durability. You can kick a person 10+ times on the ground and they still somehow manage to stand up, punch you and break your shoulderblade. After a 12 minute fight with the first random stranger outside ends, I freeze to death and all of that was a waste of nothing. \n\nI understand this game is not to be taken lightly and stroll through it, but I haven't made it far past the first main objective. I have frozen to death at least eight or so times because of how the world is roughly randomized. Sometimes you're lucky and fight resources to keep you alive and buildings to sleep in so you can make it there, but other times, you will freeze to death before you can find a shack. \n\nNo matter how unsettling this sounds, I truly have been enjoying myself everytime I play.

The writing is beautiful and manages to capture most any scenario that you're put into. Generally, it prides itself on being a survival, inventory-managing (think Deus Ex) roguelike that is incredibly unforgiving. Maybe a little too unforgiving.\n\nGenerally, when I lose a roguelike or a game in general, it'd be nice to have some idea of what I was doing /wrong/. I don't have that sense while playing Neo Scavenger. Most every playthrough, I think I am playing at the top of my game, as best as possible. Enemies can randomly hit you in the head with their fist and instantly kill you, even if you're geared up to the max. Unless you get ridiculously lucky, the cold of the environment WILL kill you. Eating the wrong things WILL kill you. If you got unlucky and didn't find a town, the cold or wolves or zombies or bandits WILL kill you.\n\nIt has stopped being fun to play. The UI is there. The mechanics are all there. The combat is thrilling. The art is there, the writing is there, and dammit I want this game to be so much more than it actually is. If you really want a hyper-realistic survival game, especially one as complicated as this one, then I can recommend it wholeheartedly. But if you're looking for an enjoyable, frantic gaming experience (as so many other survival games hope to achieve), Neo Scavenger unfortunately is far, far too luck-based to give any sense of accomplishment.\n\nIn addition, over the 5 months I stopped playing, the \"skill ceiling\" or \"endgame\" has gotten no higher or larger as far as I can tell. A legendary melee weapon (the crowbar) is handed out basically for free, the warmest clothing can be found in nearly every building, and one corpse's food can sustain you forever, as can the numerous woods, rivers etc. If you don't start out with certain skills (botany comes to mind) then you'll be stuck relying on finding towns to survive. and you CAN'T get new skills aside from the implants that I've never seen.\n\nOverall, I think that with a bit of patching Neo Scavenger could be a great, renowned game. It's not that it needs polish; it needs content, and it needs a difficulty that scales directly with how skilled you are, and skill should /matter/ more than it does.", "timestamp_created": 1398803694, "timestamp_updated": 1398803694, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594221", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "9971295": {"recommendationid": "9971295", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970787529", "num_games_owned": 503, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486647001}, "language": "english", "review": "Best post-apocalyptic hobo simulator by far!

Unlike most other survival games, this one is more strategic, and isn't first/third/ResidentEvil camera. It's like a hex-turn-based board game. \n\nWhen you begin a new game in NEO Scavenger, you're greeted with a page. Basically, you can pick traits to help you in your adventure (Botany lets you see if a certain mushroom is safe to eat, Lockpicking lets you break into locked buildings, etc.). There's also Flaws. Things like Insomniac will make sleeping more difficulty, and Metabolism will require you to eat more. Of course, some Flaws have positives. Metabolism, for instance, slightly increases healing. \n\nIt's possible to encounter friendly NPC's, or ones that want to punch you until you recieve a concussion and die. Of course, there's a way to protect yourself from hostile NPC's (or you just want to kill friendly NPC's). There's a variety of weapons. It could be a Butcher Knife, a Shotgun, a bunch of pebbles (for the daring), and a Crowbar. There's obviously more, but those are a few.\nSpeaking of NPC's, there's strange critters roaming around the world of NEO Scavenger. Ever wanted to encounter a DogMan? Or this creepy humanoid-like thing that wants eyes? It's in this game, and the latter is pretty creepy.\n\nNEO Scavenger has random encounters. You can encounter things like: a broken-down car with a sleeping bed inside, a tank with people inside, a dog, or some other stuff (that can be a little screwed up). There's also some set locations in the game. The game is randomized, but there are a few areas that are always there. For example, a large city, and a strange house. There's a few more, but you can look for those (or just Google them).\n\nNEO Scavenger has a looting feature. You can scavenge abandoned houses, buildings, and more. You might find worthless junk (like the almighty pebbles), or you might find a backpack, or even a gun! There's also left/right shoes. \n\nThe quest for shoes begins begins as soon as you begin.

It can be intense (provided you have the imagination), it can be (actually it WILL be) evil and it can be forgiving (for a brief second before you run into a pack of dogmen who rip you apart).\n\nNEO is also ridiculously cheap for it's value. Of course, I'm not trying to encourage a higher price, I'm just thanking Daniel for his reasonable pricing. (Take that Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes)\n\nI can't recommend this enough. After getting the game I sunk a ridiculous amount of time into it in a single weekend. I recommend starting off completely blind. No wikis. No gameplay videos. Just jump in. After dying horribly a few times, you can begin checking a few things out from the wiki. OH and I URGE you to read all the messages at the bottom of the screen during combat (you can click the box to expand). Then just let your imagination fly and get all the horribly violent moments carved deep into your brains. If your imagination is anything like mine, you're gonna find this game to be one of the most ruthlessly violent games you've played and it doesn't even graphically show you any of the scenes.\n\nNow, I understand this is not a game for everyone.

Pants? You start the game with no pants at all!\"\nOh dear...\n\nThe game offers a good demo - http://bluebottlegames.com/main/node/21 so there's no cost to trying it out. The UI is bad, but the lure of trying again, and trying to learn and make progress is there, and it is strong. You will almost certainly not be impressed the first time you play it, but give it a second or third chance. It plays differently and presents a very interesting and realistic, though grim and unfair world to explore.\n\nI have enjoyed a lot of games that focus on sneaking and hiding but few made simple hiding as desperate or exciting as NEO Scavenger. You try desperatly to cover your tracks and hide before you end your turn. But that slows your progress... Hunger, thirst and the bitter cold force you to take risks. Plus you need stuff to survive, but unfortunatly for you, so do other drifters and vagabonds.\n\nCombat is unbelivably intense. UI clunkiness robs us of the full experience at least the first few times, then it becomes less about the menus and more about your, so far well going game, about to be ruined by a stranger. Even a weaker oponent can cause harm, wounds, and can alert other threats and lead them to you. There is no time pressure of any kind during combat, yet it allways feels dangerous or even desperate. You have to have some degree of faith that your choices will play out in your favor. They usually lead to your death until you learn more about the game. It's very much about survival, staying safe, luring other threats into traps or each other... and scavenging. Remains, food, parts. You're allways scavenging and the overall aim is to set yourself up for survival.\n\nFirst impressions count for a lot, and this game is Early Access which hurts it somewhat, esp. the lack of variety in a game where you die and start over so much. NEO Scavenger attempts to offer a niche gameplay experience, a bit like FTL or Papers, Please, where gameplay and style are different enough to make it something unique. Unfortunatly, it's current Early Access status makes it clumsier and less satisfying to play, and promises such as \"This isn't even my final form!\" usually end up dissapointing. However, this could be a very good game and trying the demo wont cost you a thing.\n\nRecommended for fans of turn based combat, realism, crafting, survival, adventures, Fallout, and games where graphics take a back seat to gameplay, strategy and athmosphere.", "timestamp_created": 1397027066, "timestamp_updated": 1397027066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603309", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "9767457": {"recommendationid": "9767457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099865771", "num_games_owned": 561, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1521354747}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite possibly one of the best games I have played in the recent months. I got it with a bundle, but NEO Scavenger is honestly worth more than its asking price. It may only be flash, but don't let that deter you. It has one of the most realistic systems I have encountered. The developer is an active member of his own community, and that is very difficult to find these days with titles of this magnitude.\n\nI'm not very picky with what I play, but I am picky with what I play often. Since I got it, I have been playing this game every day, dieing every day, and starting anew every day. You die, a lot. But for some reason I always come back to start again, most times directly after the fact. This isn't like Dark Souls difficult, where if you die, you can just load up a save from right before it. No. When you die, you die. You have to start all over again.\n\nEach time you start, it is somehow an entirely new experience every time. The maps are randomized, NPC loadouts are randomized, loot and scavenging opportunities are randomized. The only things that don't change are the story, fixed encounters, and your inevitable death in these unforgiving wastes. You can spend hours building up the best loot and getting the best weapons and armor, just to get kicked in the head in your sleep, and have to start all over again. For some reason I have come to enjoy this.\n\nThe crafting system is remarkable, to say the least. Much more involved than that of Minecraft or Terraria. You are able to use the skills you chose at the start of the game to create new and different items than you could without. Being able to craft items that can possibly save you from a fight with a Dogman or a Blue Frog, keep you fed for a day, or drink clean water, can give you some sense of security. Until you fall asleep and get kicked in the head.\n\nThis game is not for those that want an easy game, that they can win every opportunity they get. You can be fully armored and have a shotgun in one hand and a crowbar in the other and pulverize the person you're fighting, just to have them throw a rock at you and die of internal bleeding a couple turns later. This game is unforgiving, and even when you're the biggest badass of the wastes... you can still die by eating some berries.\n\nI love this game.

And last thing, the food/water mechanism isn't really logic, as you'll starve almost as fast as you'll get dehydrated, eating 50kg of berries will feed you for barely a few hours and they're pretty hard to find when you need them.\n\nHere's a few thing I'd love to see implemented/improved, hopefully devs would read it (who knows ^^) and find some indeas interesting, also maybe some things i suggest here are allready in the game/planed and I haven't found out yet, sorry if it happen:\n\n-Ability to cancel last action, as sometime i click on the wrong square or make mistakes while crafting.\n\n-Fixing the strarvation system: human body can last over 40 days without food, it doesn't make sense to die from starvation after barely 2 days. Maybe splitting \"well fed\" with \"hungry\" and \"bulk\", where \"hungry\" would affect your action points, fight capability, scavenging ability etc. While \"bulk\" would be your global \"well fed\" status, going from overweight (which inflict handicap), to anorexic which make \"hunger\" constantly low and starvation deadly. Also the meat spoils really fast, i'm not sure if it's unrealistic but why not some ways to make it last longer, like an hermetic bag, lunch boxes, thermal backpack or something.\n\n-The combat interface is pretty hard to understand, sometime i just get attacked out of nowhere while sleeping (which is pretty cool), but the guy turns out to be badly stuffed and wreck me out in couple hits, leaving me no other option than crie while watching my character die in horrible pain. Maybe something signaling the global risk of the oponent and/or chances of successfull attacks, dodges, escapes etc. Just so we know if we can try a fight or just drop all our shits out and run the hell away.\n\n-How can't a medic + botanic find some antidotes in forests? I keep dying from poisoning without having any chance of reaching the clinic. Also, items in general lacks a description of their effects as well as statuses leave you wondering how to fix them i'd like to have a hint of what everything does or need to be fixed (for ex: antibiotics: can heal X, or dissentry: can be healed with X).\n\n-When crafting, have a picture of each craftable item in the recipes list, this would ease a lot the recipe's browsing.\n\n-Pliz, just pliz, more ammunitions, I gave up using any weapon as i take hours to find only 3 bullets, and allways for the one weapon you don't have, i love to shoot things, but in a week of playing I had the chance to do so about 3 times only.\n\n-I would LOVE to be able to fix items, for example taking parts of one gun to fix another gun, it makes a lot of sense and have been seen in many crafting/rogue-like games (such as fallout or 7days to die), I really love that feature as you don't waste good finds (like guns, backpacks, carts etc...) just because you allready have one that's in a barely better condition.\n\n-More shopz! there is only one shop, and it's near town which mean if you want to farm cash, buy ammunitions, buy food etc. You'll have to go all the way there, across that lifeless desert of empty buildings and rude people that won't let you kill and eat them, I died a LOT starving just trying to reach it, why not itinerant sellers or random shops in some ruins?\n\n-Ability to settle. I mean it's a surviving game, greatly done, but you can't make you home anywhere, why not the ability to choose a place to fortify, stock food, make confortable shelter, medical supplies, and (why not) working benches that allows you to fix things, craft more, that require tools to enable some special crafts etc. \n\n-Definitly more scavenging places, and more specifics ones, like pharmacies, gunshops, supermarkets, factories... We all love those.\n\n-Reinforce the \"friendly encounters\" potential, right now it's mostly neutral/ennemy, maybe we could meet some people that help us, offer trades, indicate to locations etc.\n\n-The ability to loot money from innocent victi... people i killed in legitimate defense, I mean there is money in the game, how come no one carry any? \n\n-More weapons and more craftability in weapons, like the ability to upgrade a rifle (kind of like in stalker, i really loved that feature) to make it more deadly. Also the ability to craft bullets would be nice.\n\n-Skill learning, I don't get why there is so much slots available while you can't chose more than 5 to about 8 skills, i get it for the start, but then i'd like to have a way to learn new skills ingame after a while.\n\n-Even biger map. I know this one is huge allready, but in the end there's nothing but one city and the start facility (plus the ruins of course) I'd love to see more special places, more terrains, more climates... more surprises!\n\n-More hunting potential, I managed to kill a dear once, but with no ammunitions and no way to come near them and oneshot them, it's really hard to get any, so the moral choice of rather eating or not human flesh become a rethorical question: you just can't survive without your daily bad mutha's barbecue, I'd like to play it \"nice guy\" sometime and eat only berries and animal meat, but it need more dears and squirels, and even bunnies, rats, birds etc.. Traps also are underated, we should be able to put one in the forest and come back later to see if it caught something.\n\n-Maps markers, like if i have to drop my loot for some reason, I can mark the place to come back later, this could combine with the previous traps comment to know where you had put a trap, and make you come back to check them before your catch get stolen (by a thief or another animal) or spoils.\n\n-More detailed medicinal interraction: risks of local wound infection (that can turn to septisemia of not cured), specific intervention required (tools needed to pull out an arrow, suturation, hemoragy, broken bones etc.)\n\n-Difficulty choice/save game, as it's pretty frustrating to start all over everytime you die, i'd personnally like to be able to save my games at some points, maybe make it hard like having to find a saving location in the map etc.  An alternative would be to propose 2 game modes: hardcore (permadeath) and softcore (respaw with penalties).\n\n-Zombies, lol joke, the game is allready great, it doesn't even need zombies (i'm not sure some zombie-like creatures would ruin it tho).\n\nThat's about all I can think of right now, but anyway the game rocks! I really hope you guys will push it to the best of it's potential, and for the players still hesitating: go for it!

The player roams a post-apocalyptic Michigan, simply trying to survive. The game is tile-based, with a complex combat system that is entirely described through text.  [/b]\n\n\nThe combat system is one that sticks out. It's somewhat reminiscent of the original Wasteland, but instead of a hit point system, damage is actually done to the combantants.The commands are a little more complex than a lot of systems, if you're knocked down, for instance, you can either get up, roll away, or grab the enemy by the ankles and pull 'em down. Most combat is completely optional too, you can sneak away, talk your way out of it, or simply avoid it in general.\n\nPlenty of skills and flaws are selectable from the start, and more skills are able to be obtained later in the game. This encourages trial and error, which is more acceptable in this, considering the survival mechanics, as opposed to a more traditional RPG with cutscenes and dungeons you have to go through in the beginning. Speaking of survival mechanics, they're fantastic; this game is the survival game I've been waiting for. Food and water can be obtained in a myriad of ways. The crafting system is really general, so materials can usually be substituted for others, as opposed to needing very specific things.\n\nThe quite clear flaw to all this (at least to some people) is almost unavoidable, and it's that it's not a casual-friendly experience. It's not extremely hard to get into, but a lack of experience and foresight is bound to get you killed on occasion. The randomness of your start also might decide your fate more-so than your skill, depending on the direction you go, but this was either pretty easy to bounce back from, or simply rare.\n\n[list]\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[*]Survival mechanics are pretty lifelike and full of depth.\n[*]Combat is complex, and completely option if you decide you don't want to.\n[*]Easy to pick up and play, but still a pretty deep and lengthy game if you aren't as bad as I am.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[*]Not casual-friendly, although if you put a little time, thought, and elbow grease in it, you shouldn't have too many problems.\n[*]Random map can screw you over early game on occasion. [/list]\n\n[u][b]Final Thoughts[/b]:[/u]\nIf you like survival games, or late-eighties CRPGs like Wasteland, than you'll find a pretty polished combination that's certain to pull quite a few hours out of you.\n[b]Rating:[/b] 9/10\n\n[quote]This review was written for and is published on the [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/24515397] Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

VERY addictive, so if you don't have much time to play games this may not be for you. Even in early access this game is very polished and I have yet to encounter a single bug. The choices you make during character creation significantly impact the way you play, and the threat of death from a variety of sources is omnipresent. Although the game is fairly complex, it's also pretty easy to get into because everything works as one would expect it to. For instance, I didn't need a guide or anything to figure out how to craft a campfire on my first attempt. That's not to say this game is easy, far from it: you are pretty much guaranteed to die a few times pretty quickly until you get the hang of things, but deaths in this game don't feel cheap or frustrating and I've never had a death that I didn't learn something from.

A turned based rogue-like where you start off in the most startling position of weakness I could possibly imagine. \u201cScavenger\u201d is the name of the game but this key aspect and function serves as a means to an end, and that end is survival. \n\nYou wake up in a cryogenic facility with nothing of use but a hospital gown, medical bracelet. You're soon attacked by a supernatural creature, setting the tone for the brutal reality of survival, which seems to be the biggest note of the game. Notice I didn\u2019t mention any shoes or memories. You\u2019re barefoot and it\u2019s autumn. No way to go through life in my humble opinion. I guess there\u2019s a story about finding your identity or finding out what happened to the world.\n\nSounds interesting, right? Like \u201c28 Days Later\u201d meets \u201cDayZ\u201d. I couldn\u2019t tell you, because basically I\u2019ve spent my hours just trying to survive against... get ready for it... \n\n[b]Starvation[/b]. Food is scarce. I once savored a small packet of crackers for sustenance. I recently died trying to hunt a dangerous creature in what felt like a very realistic and thought out exchange in combat.\n\n[b]Hydration[/b]. Water is not as scarce, but takes up storage space and the effects of dehydration can onset quickly leaving you weaker to take on the rigors of survival and ultimately lead to death.\n\n[b]Hypothermia[/b]. It always seems cold and rainy. One play-through I traveled west for 12 hours and died of hypothermia desperately trying to find some degree of shelter or warmth.\n\n[b]Brain damage and severe blood loss[/b]. Some people seem to be opportunists in this new and horrifying setting, attacking you on sight. You can try to reason with them or beat them to death or submission. Either way combat has to be dealt with or avoided one way or another. There are also inhumane beasts, such as the dogman who(that?) recently severed an artery in my leg, taking a fluke victory in what was described to me as brutal combat. \n\nThe turned based combat plays out very interestingly, giving you often unique choices based on your surroundings, tools and skill set. In addition to normal attacks with your weaponry you often have different tactical options in a fight, like a trip or a head-butt. Leaving your opponent stunned and vulnerable is a key to winning conflicts and staying healthy. \n\nWounds need attention and in a very animalistic way you need to learn that just because you can best a being in mortal combat it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he can be your prey.  The spoils of war are all well and good but damn well better be worth the cost of an open wound or wounded limb.\nLuckily there seems to be a wide array of technology, pharmaceuticals and med-kits to be found in your mysterious surroundings, everything seems to have something more to it. There's a vast world of crafting, trapping and other skills I've only touched the surface of. Hacking with a laptop can be far more effective than hacking with a cleaver.  \n\nStorage plays as big of a roll as anything I have mentioned thus far. I really enjoy the vast inventory options and the various challenges that arrive. The tools available to you in moving your life supporting cargo are just as varied. Plastic bags can be used as a light and spacious backpack but they quickly deteriorate under such use, a true backpack can handle much more rigors. Sleds can be used to drag your sleeping bag and other supplies but is outclassed by a modified shopping cart as a vehicle.\n\nLight sources can play a big part in safe scavenging, night time or not. Lighters run out of butane though, and flashlights need batteries. You often consume some of your items durability upon use as you scavenge for that rare useful weapon and equally sparse ammunition. \n\nThere are some hiccups in this surprisingly immersive experience, like a lack of a local leaderboard and tracking or rating of your statistics and progress. The game doesn\u2019t seem to integrate with windows well on start-up, but this is easily fixable in the settings. The aural potential of this game seems unrealized and the atmospheric tune that plays throughout doesn\u2019t do enough for me. The lack of sound just about the only thing holding me back from having a more immersed experience.\n\nThe slightly crude graphics and the fact that it is a Java game may be off putting to some, but those willing to look past the amateur feel will be rewarded with a view into this game\u2019s deep, brutal, intelligent soul. The sense and reality of a true, terrifying post-apocalyptic survival setting seems fully represented. Made by Blue Bottle Games, which from what I can tell is just one dude, this frisky indie title feels like a true labor of love towards the bleak reality of our impending doom. \n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1396084024, "timestamp_updated": 1396115087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "9660837": {"recommendationid": "9660837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023258368", "num_games_owned": 945, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437127459}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0451\u0448\u044c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0443\u043c\u0440\u0451\u0448\u044c, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0437\u043d\u0443\u0432.\n\u0417\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043c, \u0432 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437, \u0442\u044b \u0443\u043c\u0440\u0451\u0448\u044c \u043e\u0442 \u0436\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b.\n\u0412 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 -

There are several indie gems out there but I have to admit that this one is the best I've played. Why? Probably because it reminds me so much of the original Wasteland and does well to hold me over till the I get the money for the second. You play as a man with no real memory of who he is and wakes up in a post apocalyptic world, except it doesn't use the cliched desert wasteland or zombie infested urban feista. No, it sets itself apart by creating its own twisted world. In the game you move along a hex map and scavange for supplies. These supplies range from balls of twine and floss to civilian grade weapons and military grade technology. You are able to craft a varity of things out of seemingly usless items. My favorite being the sled (plastic sled + medium length twine, rope, floss, etc.) which allows me to carry more things BUT i am unable to run making combat difficult. Combat takes a bit getting use to but not for very long. It's turn based where you select what you do and you do it then your opponent takes their turn. Simple and when combined with your imagination, downright enjoyable. Even in early acess this game is so well polished I would believe it to be complete, though I'm glade it isn't because I would love to see more and more items and craftable objects.

Similarly, it's the rare title that does anything very well at all for less than $10 these days. NEO Scavenger fits both bills and still has more to come (I guess... I haven't noticed many bugs and I think I've progressed a fair distance). You'll probably need the wiki to help you get started, if only because you have to get the hang of some of the craftable items. I played the demo for about forty-five minutes before grabbing the full version and only had two or three things I'd count as bugs:\n\n1) My save data was inexplicably lost once, but I didn't mind starting over\n\n2) It seems to me that there's really only one way to start with any decent chance but that's not necessarily going to stay true in the final version (and I could be wrong - there's a decent amount of randomness with each play)\n\n3) Sometimes you setup a camp site and it disappears later, sometimes re-appearing on a later visit to that hex\n\nNone of these, for me, are game-breakers because I'm not playing NEO Scavenger to win - I'm playing to -survive-. This means battling cold weather, raiders and dogmen, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and the dangers of exploring/scavenging ruined buildings that might collapse on you at any moment. I simply include most of the bugs along with the other dangers and keep on truckin' (or start a new game). I highly recommend that anyone looking to play a game that focuses on those things as NEO Scavenger really does it well.

First however, I would like to try and define what NEO Scavenger is, though that may be difficult. \n\n     NEO Scav is a survival game in its simplest form but the title of \"Survival\" doesn't do it justice. I would like to define it as a \"Turn based RPG\", but that too doesn't quite fit the bill. \"Sandbox\"? no, not that either . Now I'm not saying that all of these traits and aspects are not included in NEO Scav, but each one does not define it well alone. The only thing I can think to do is paste all of them together (using medium string and a sharp edge) making it a Sandbox Survival Turn Based Role Playing Game (a SSTBRPG), now all we have to do is throw a H in front of that acronym for \"Hardcore\" and its shaping up to be a decent genre description, a bit of a mouthful though. \n\n     Not that (H)SSTBRPG's really exist (that I know of aside from a few indie titles scattered about the web) as a gaming norm, just kind of an acronym I made up on the spot, but the idea isn't a norm. Why is that? The only answer I could think of was that it is too much of a risk for large companies to make a game like that, one that would truly test a person's ability to survive in the wilderness  and deal with day to day threats like hunger, thirst, sleep, and warmth. I don't know if that's true or not, and looking at the amount of people who play games like NEO Scav, I can't see how that theory could hold together. \n\nI'm getting off track. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     NEO Scavenger is created (to my knowledge) by one person, Daniel Fedor. That alone when looking at the game is an amazing feat, especially considering how in depth NEO Scav truly is. Whether its crafting or just scavenging there is plenty of things for you to make or find. \n\n     The first day is the hardest, you wake up in an odd place with something scratching at the door (I won't go into detail as, well... Spoilers) , but you immediately have to escape. Using skills to selected at the start, a set of four with the ability to add more at the cost of negative traits, you venture out into the world. \n\n     You walk out into the sunlight of the world, its dawn,  its cold, and you don't have much in the way of clothing save a hospital gown. Immediately you're struck with a problem, find clothing or die of hypothermia. This is what kills most new survivors, and it took me a while (and a few protagonist deaths) to find my rhythm. This first day is brutal, but once it's over, a whole new day begins. \n \n     Now you're warm-ish, but the previous days exertions have caused you to grow quite thirsty. You see that there's a water source nearby, a river, but you don't know if the water is safe to drink. You have no method of checking if its \"infected\" or if its \"sterile\" but  you don't have the luxury of waiting. This is something that kills off a lot of the players that make it past day one. Let's say you were lucky, and now you're no longer thirsty, and you didn't manage to acquire some form of disease or infection, now what. \n\n     By this time you're starting to feel a little hungry, while scavenging you manage to find a couple of mushrooms and some berries, but without the proper skill (which you can choose at the start of the game, it's called \"Botany\") you can't tell if these are poisonous or not.  You pick them up all the same, if it comes to it, you might have to take the chance. \n\n     But whats that on the horizon, it looks like another scavenger is none too pleased with you stealing his supplies (or for any myriad of other reasons), and now he wants you dead. You can't escape, you have to fight. You pick up a large nearby stick and prepare to defend yourself. \n\n     The fight is frantic, messy, and results in both parties getting pretty bruised up, but eventually the other scavenger retreats from battle, leaving you to treat your wounds...\n\n     The point is that NEO Scavenger is relentless in its urge to kill you, but it's not like you can't combat this. You can cover you're tracks so that enemies have a harder time following you, you can hide in urban areas and ambush scavengers to steal their stuff, you can apply bandages to your wounds and take pain pills to deal with blood loss and manage the amount of pain your character is in. All the while traveling for some far off goal. \n\nAnd there is SO much more, and even more to be added I'm sure. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     In short try the demo, it's a pretty accurate but  slimmed down version of how the game plays out, if you like it, buy it... you can't go wrong.

Aber schon nach ein paar Minuten Spielzeit wird klar, wie der Hase l\u00e4uft und dann kann das Spiel richtig s\u00fcchtig machen. Es befindet sich zwar noch in der Entwicklung, was man vor allem an der bisher recht rar ges\u00e4ten Story, bzw den vielen fehlenden Quests sieht, aber die Atmosph\u00e4re und die Spielmechanik begeistern trotzdem. Besonders das umfassende Gesundheitssystem ist hier hervorzuheben, denn selten stirbt man bei Spielen auf so vielf\u00e4ltige Arten. Dank PermaDeath-System lernt man recht schnell aus seinen Fehlern, denn wer einmal an einer Sepsis gestorben ist, weil er vergessen hat, seine Wunden zu verbinden, oder wer an einer Vergiftung durch verseuchtes Wasser dahingeschieden ist, schenkt der Gesundheit seines Charakters in der n\u00e4chsten Runde doppelt soviel Aufmerksamkeit. Selten hab ich so ein \"realistisches\" Survival-Game gespielt, bei dem es eben nicht nur darum geht eine gute Waffe und ab und zu was zu Futtern zu finden. Zahlreiche Lebensparameter wollen stabil gehalten werden und eine Vielzahl von Krankheiten oder m\u00f6glichen Verletzungen sorgen daf\u00fcr, dass es nie langweilig wird.\n\nEin dickes Minus gibt es aber: Das ganze ist ein Flash-Spiel und auch wenn es nur Perma-Death gibt, k\u00f6nnte man rein theoretisch seinen Spielstand speichern, wenn man das Spiel vorzeitig beendet. Allerdings vernichten z.B. Tools wie der CCleaner oder ein Browser, der beim Schlie\u00dfen automatisch die Cookies entfernt diese Spielst\u00e4nde gnadenlos!\nAber, hey: So oft kommt man eh nicht zu speichern, denn wie es schon in einem anderen Review zu dem Spiel hie\u00df: \"Be prepared to die...a LOT!\"\nWer sich unverbindlich ein genaueres Bild vom Spiel machen m\u00f6chte, kann auf der Seite des Entwicklers die Demo sowohl komplett im Browser spielen, als auch downloaden.

Whether you want to find more information about your life and what has happened to the world is up to you. Personally, I just like to see how long I can survive in this messed up wasteland.\n\nThis game does have a steep learning curve, but once you figure things out, you'll be set to survive for weeks. And while some say the graphics are too unbearable to live with, I don't mind them. I think they are part of the charm that sucked me into the game in the first place.\n\nTo be sure that this game is for you, check out the demo before you spend your fifteen bucks.

on Desura and the Website, and I wanted a third save and to give an additional amount of money to the devs. (Why can't I just give you money?!) Anyhow, this is Neo Scavenger in a nutshell:\n    \n     Cold. How long has it been since I've been warm. A day? Ten? I don't know any more, time seems so eternal out here, and I've lost track of it. I don't know anything but pain, fear, and cold these days... and hunger. I tried building a campfire a while back, and that damned Bandit left me bleeding and scarred. I went looking for some medical equipment later that night, an an apartment collapsed on me. I'm weak and tired, but I'm too afraid to sleep... But I can afford to close my eyes a bit, right?...\n     \"Give up all your f***ing gear if you want to live!\" Before I'm even fully aware, I'm staring into the muzzle of a revolver. I panic and begin to scream, and he whacks me across the face with the revolver's butt.\n     \"What? You f***ing deaf? Hand it all over!\" I'm not deaf, but I'm not stupid either. If I hand over all this gear, I might live a while longer, but I'd still die. Slower and even more painfully than if he shot me. Besides, he might even be bluffing? Before he knows what's happening, I slam a heavy punch into his chest, knocking the wind out of his lungs and freezing him for a moment. Not one to waste, I use that moment. I grab a heavy-looking stone on the ground and begin to pummel him. In the dark, I see nothing but a vague grey shape. I slam the stone into his stomach, and he screams in pain. I pummel him even further, and further... Long after he dies, I'm still hitting him with the stone. My arms are aching and my head is pulsing, but I keep hitting the battered corpse. Finally, I relent. More out of exhaustion and pain rather than any sense of logic.\n     Then, I sleep. Fitfully and weakly at first, but soon enough, my fatigue catches up to me, and I rest. When I wake up, the full realization of what I'd done caught up to me. The \"bandit\" was a starving emaciated skeletal husk, and his revolver was a rusted abomination that was more likely to explode rather than fire. I begin to suck in a hitching, weak breath as I sob. That could have been me, and it probably would be before long...\n     It's been a while since I killed that man, but the heavy black weight of it hangs heavily on my shoulders. I hate my own existence, and have long considered suicide... If this isn't hell, then what is it? Just as I begin to slip the bottle of sedatives out of my pocket, I see a man approaching me. I haven't seen another sould in so long... and I feel genuine joy and excitement at the prospect of talking to someone... Maybe even make a friend? I begin to rush towards him, hands in the air to signify my friendliness. Before I know what happens, I am knocked aside the head, and looted.\n     This is Neo Scavenger, and though your adventure may not last as long, or be as miserly, you will experience the highs and lows of survival. You will wonder: \"Why? Why did it have to end this way?\" And you will face many hard choices.\n     Do both your practical intellect and your inner masochist a favour, and buy this game.

About two hours passed and I purchased the actual game, to spend another two or three hours playing the balls off of it.\n\nAt first a first look I was unsure about the action events (fights, encounters etc.) seeing as it was primarily text and seemed like it would be a little dull. I was very wrong, while yes the action events are just text along with some other info (character portraits, conditions and so on), it doesn't detract from the intensity at all. If anything imagining what is happening as it's described to you makes the whole fight even more tense.\n\nI think the most appealing thing about this game is how realistic it is. You can (and will) die in so many different ways, it's fantastic! You can be beaten to death, bleed out, get poisoned, mauled, shot, etc. But what I love is how indirect it is. You can go into a forest and eat some berries, a few turns later you get some pop up text informing you that your character is vomiting. What caused that? Was it the berries? The dirty bandage giving you an infection? The water from the lake? Along with hunger, thrist, sleep deprivation, temperature and the horde of melonheads closing in the game becomes very stressful. But in the best possible way.\n\nBesides the many ways to die, the scavenging is top notch. Far better than say Fallout for the sake of argument, where you gather stuff for a while and then you're good till end game. In NEO Scavenger you need to keep scavenging to survive and you will not find guns in every house, or food in every cabin. Chances are you'll die before ever using a gun, but when you have one with the right ammo, you feel worried about using it in case it's wasted. This combined with the crafting and character skills to open up new options, makes each playthrough very different.  \n\nThe best part is the game isn't even done yet, so new features are being added to make this experience even better. So if you're reading this right now and you're still unsure I really reccommend you at least try the demo. I think this game is fantastic and would really sing it's praises to anyone who's looking for a challenging and realistic survival game.  \n\nI'd give it a solid 8/10 so far, would be swarmed by melonheads again.", "timestamp_created": 1392973745, "timestamp_updated": 1392973745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "9201561": {"recommendationid": "9201561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034401638", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476311799}, "language": "czech", "review": "Tato hra je velmy realistick\u00e1.

Of course, electrician mechanic and hacking skills can lead you to some pretty sweet gadgets, but good luck getting the supplies needed to construct them. Neo Scavenger is a game that requires careful decision making, good foresight, and a cool head. This game, even in early access, promises heaps of discovery opportunities, and discovering something new is pretty common, even after 10 hours of gameplay, and each time adds a new sense of excitement and motivation to branch out an try a different method of survival.\n\n Props to Blue Bottle Games for all of the planning of where this game is going and showing it to the community, it's a great comfort to have a good idea of where this title is going. If you are on the edge of buying this game, or just can't decide, the demo might change your mind. The demo is free (duh!) and since the game is 2D, it takes very little time to download.

The AI is unforgiving at times but it still leaves open the chance to run at a price at times or if luck is on your side scott free which is really cool in my opinion. Although i suppose if i had to make i con its that there arent many enemys to battle (or avoid) and there isnt too many things you can use to carry your gear but sense its early access it has a pass i just hope they add that soon its a much needed addition. But besides that this game is a testiment of what gamming is and that there will always be dev's who are creative and will do different things such as making this a text based game which was brilliant in my opinion, I look forward to play this game more as more patches arise time was well spent playing this game.\n\nThis is my current opinion\nI've spent a pretty significant number of hours playing this game, and as I've stated 3 years ago it is a fantastic premises for a game and the difficulty and creatity of survial in a post apocalyptic setting is really awesome and cool.\nWhich is what baffles me when I say this game is the worst thing of anything ever, because it has become abandonware of the WORST kind. Its been years sense a real update has occured on this game and still theres nothing, no real story besides a few mini \"side quest\" if you can call it that and it gets boring really fast because after awhile theres nothing that can challenge you, you're not build up a base or working towards a goal, theres no allies, no moral dilemma its a big ole bag of NOTHING. Im so disapointed in this game because I had so much hope for this game, but the moment I saw they were making a mobile version of this game I knew immediately that it was all over and the devs offically stopped caring.\n\nTL;DR\nDevs betrayed my trust and the trust of anyone who bought it with expectations it would one day become a full game.

The game style is somewhat of a niche, so it may not be for you. After that... well if you're still reading, perhaps a review is in order.\n\nPerhaps the best way to explain why NEO is worth a shot is the fact that I've introduced three players to it, with each having exactly the same responses (almost stages of grief style). First is the inevitable freezing to death (\"What? What did I do wrong? This game is stupid!\"). Next is figuring out how to survive that part (\"Ah, I can use that sleeping bag until I find clothes, or possibly light a fire\"), normally followed by having your head bashed in by someone (\"What? What did I do wrong? This game is stupid!\").\n\nNext run through you figure out how to make weapons (\"Now I can go take on those damn bandits!\"). And, after killing a couple, you WILL get cocky and drown on your own blood (\"What? What did I do wrong? This game is stupid!\"). \n\nBy about the fourth serious run (normally with a half-dozen freezing to deaths in there) you're surviving, and doing it well. You start analysing the risks of combat (he has a machete, I have a bow... how close do I let him get?). From there your deaths are almost always due to errors on your part - surviving can be time consuming but is generally not hard, unless you want to deliberately handicap yourself by not taking the easy way (no trapping skills, no botany skills) for a difficulty boost - and all three players were hooked. At each stage you could see them figuring out what to do next, how to avoid the mistake they made last time.\n\nDespite what some reviews have said you do not need to find the recipe papers to make anything - they tell you how to, but if you put the ingredients in the crafting screen it will let you know what you can make. Generally it's pretty intuitive too - large stick plus knife equals sharpened stick, for example, but you soon learn the crucial recipes by heart.\n\nYes, it's unpolished. Yes, it's flash.

Em muitos aspectos ele \u00e9 bem parecido com Wasteland e Fallout, mas apresenta uma boa dose de originalidade em suas mec\u00e2nicas. \u00c9 uma mistura de RPG antigo, TBS estilo Civilization e jogo de tabuleiro com uso constante de textos para passar ao jogador cada detalhe do mundo desolado a ser explorado. Sobre a hist\u00f3ria, o melhor \u00e9 experimentar e n\u00e3o falar muito para evitar spoilers. \n\nBasicamente voc\u00ea assume o papel do sobrevivente de um holocausto sem saber quase nada sobre o passado ou o que fazer em seguida. Logo no come\u00e7o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel escolher as habilidades do seu personagem e com isso mudar radicalmente o tipo de experi\u00eancia ao longo do jogo. Por exemplo, pode criar um sobrevivente especializado em combate que mata e pilha outros sobreviventes. Um hacker com conhecimentos de mec\u00e2nica e eletr\u00f4nica que pode fazer um bom uso dos aparelhos eletr\u00f4nicos ainda existentes no mundo desolado. Pode ainda criar um personagem do tipo ca\u00e7ador furtivo que evita contato com outros NPCs e faz uso dos recursos naturais para sobreviver, entre outros. \n\nO jogo n\u00e3o segura a sua m\u00e3o com tutoriais nem tampouco faz por voc\u00ea o que voc\u00ea deve descobrir experimentando. E esse processo de aprendizagem \u00e9 bem brutal, pois envolve incont\u00e1veis mortes por hipotermia, fome, sede, exaust\u00e3o, ferimentos, etc. No entanto, a partir do momento que voc\u00ea come\u00e7a a dominar as estrat\u00e9gias de sobreviv\u00eancia, o jogo se torna extremamente recompensante e viciante, pois cada hex\u00e1gono a ser explorado pode trazer um grande perigo ou descoberta que faz voc\u00ea ficar naquela apreens\u00e3o e vontade de experimentar s\u00f3 mais um turno, semelhante ao que s\u00f3 a s\u00e9rie Civilization sabe como fazer. Sem falar na sensa\u00e7\u00e3o muito boa de estar vencendo o jogo simplesmente por estar vivo lutando contra bandidos, mutantes, doen\u00e7as, fome, frio e sede, esses quatro \u00faltimos sendo os principais advers\u00e1rios de NEO Scavenger.\n\nOs gr\u00e1ficos s\u00e3o bem simples, no estilo FTL de simplicidade, o que em momento algum impede voc\u00ea de ficar envolvido com os eventos do jogo. O combate \u00e9 todo por turnos bem parecido com os Fallouts 1 e 2. Voc\u00ea escolhe qual arma usar e vai clicando em a\u00e7\u00f5es baseadas no que voc\u00ea espera do seu advers\u00e1rio. Na tela voc\u00ea v\u00ea informa\u00e7\u00f5es que descrevem o tipo de inimigo, arma utlizada, estado de sa\u00fade atual etc. O combate pode ser rude e simples, mas \u00e9 incr\u00edvel como voc\u00ea fica tenso aguardando o desfecho dele. E n\u00e3o h\u00e1 sensa\u00e7\u00e3o mais legal do que ler que aquele golpe com um p\u00e9 de cabra acertou em cheio a cabe\u00e7a do bandido e agora ele est\u00e1 jogado no ch\u00e3o inconsciente e aguardando que voc\u00ea d\u00ea o golpe final ou apenas pilhe o corpo agonizante e caia fora dali antes que outros bandidos ou animais aparece\u00e7am.\n\nMesmo estando em beta, NEO Scavenger est\u00e1 quase pronto e com muito conte\u00fado a ser explorado e zero de bugs at\u00e9 onde pude jogar. (quase dez horas de jogo).\n\u00c9 mais um indie que entrega uma experi\u00eancia \u00fanica e inovadora e um dos melhores RPGs por turno que j\u00e1 joguei.

I engaged my first human unfriendly (not to give too much away, beginning or no,) with a multi-tool knife thinking that my \"weapon\" easily beat his \"basic attack\" only to be surprised by tackles, ground fighting, and a desperate struggle that left me frantically kicking him to death rather than celebrating with some level-up mechanic. I realized that even though I thought myself armed, in reality a multitool is a terrible damn weapon. The realistic aspect here is simple and effective, and more than just the number crunching.\n\nAt present build it seems like a few things could use tweaking or adding on to, but that's to be expected at this point and gives me hope that player input will keep this easily-overlooked gem on track.

I also now sometimes fondly call it a Procedural Death Michigan. It's mean, immersive, annoyingly addictive and seems to strongly dislike players wearing right boots (left boots are fine).\n\nBasically, you scavenge around (and die after the building crumbles on you), fight other people scavenging around (and die valiantly with monkey wrench in hand) or try to talk to them (and die a turn later by drinking a celebratory made-it-through-the-turn sip of poisoned water), try to kill creatures that would like to eat you almost as much as you'd like to eat them (and die hungry), craft items to help you survive (and die warm because your fire alerted every deadly thing around), keep track of your hunger, thirst, diseases and injuries (and die very informed) or try to get to the seemingly last big hub of civilization (and die trying to get there; or trying to get in; or after you get in; or on your way back out).\n\nIn short this is a game where you try to make it through the day while figuring out what has happened to your hero and the world - and die trying. I really don't want to spoil this too much for you, but rest assured, whether you prefer dying by traumatic brain injury, blood loss, cholera, dehydration or an angry mob, there are enough options there to suit everyone's tastes. And if that doesn't sound fun to you, go away, I don't like you.\n\n\n-----\n[h1]And here's some actual analysis[/h1]\n\nNEO Scavenger is the chess of survival games, if chess came without an instruction manual and forced you to scramble to understand its rules. It's all about making tactically sound moves, about the constant weighing of risk-reward decisions, but without ever feeling certain you made the right choice. Very much like real life in that way. The gameplay mechanics, while seemingly unforgiving, are actually there to remind you that you are not a badass superhero, just an average person thrown into a huge mess. Combined with the deliberate obfuscation of the player stats, this feeling of vulnerability makes the game surprisingly immersive. It's an exercise in role playing and player driven choices based on gut feeling rather than number crunching.\n\nQuite realistically for an average Joe, going in situations guns-a-blazing will rarely be rewarded, running away and hiding your tracks from a bunch of stray dogs may. The combat is a constant dirty struggle of trying to get the upper hand while dancing around your opponent, surprisingly complex and rewarding for something delivered with a few buttons and a bit of text. But even with great equipment and a character with decent combat skills, every fight you survive will leave you weakened, hurt, tired and more vulnerable to the next threat that comes along. In that way, the combat, as well as the deeply simulated survival and sickness mechanics, enhance the constant feeling of being exposed and alone, afraid and uncertain in the middle of a hostile world. You are never allowed to feel safe. You are never allowed to hunker down, build a huge base, put fences around it and kill everything that dares come through. Throughout the game, the mechanics drive you to keep moving on, keep surviving day to day, keep doing mundane inventory management, and keep trying not to die. And almost always failing.\n\nBut dying here isn't always a bad thing. Since you can't really improve your skills, (though you can add to them in a limited way) you need to die to improve, to learn, to realize how to make better choices next time. You even need to die to learn more of the world, simply because you can never uncover everything in one playthrough. Which brings us to the story.\n\nBehind the immersive atmosphere and the fun, unforgiving gameplay mechanics, hides an interesting, complex, well-written story and huge amounts of lore and flavour text delivered both in long screens and in tiny bites literally everywhere you look. The story will never beat you over the head with what you should do next (and it's fair to say you should remain doubtful when it seems to do that), so it is perfectly ignorable if you just enjoy the sandbox game. But it's worth getting into, and it's also worth remembering that every time you think you know all the possible answers to a question, there's likely more there to discover, if only you do things slightly differently next time (by having a different build, carrying different items, making different choices, going down a different path, uncovering different information). The mystery of the story is a sprawling, complicated puzzle, one you will not solve easily, even by finishing the game the first few times.\n\nIf it looks as if I'm ignoring the game's flaws, it's because to be honest I enjoy the game too much to notice them most of the time. That said, the UI could be friendlier to newcomers (which is a polite way to say it's pretty unintuitive); thankfully it's perfectly serviceable once you get used to it. Also, while obfuscating stats is an interesting and perfectly valid design choice, obfuscating some of the less intuitive game mechanics is simply an annoying hurdle to climb over when you first start out. In more technical matters, the cookie-based save system (one of the few elements there to constantly remind you that this is still a flash game) can be a real pain, the game doesn't play well with many commonly used modern resolutions and the process of adding mods is a bit too archaic and involved for most players these days. Even more importantly, there is a very valid argument to be made about how well a perma-death roguelike game with unforgiving mechanics can still make for a deep story-based experience that is more enjoyable than frustrating.\n\nBut even with all its problems, as you may have gathered I think this is a great game: the perfect flawed little gem, and in my head already a cult classic.", "timestamp_created": 1391552683, "timestamp_updated": 1487420624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 100, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867279", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8977665": {"recommendationid": "8977665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056847594", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504234467}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game theres noting like it.", "timestamp_created": 1391550978, "timestamp_updated": 1391550978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8976136": {"recommendationid": "8976136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010391913", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391532908}, "language": "polish", "review": "\u015awietny pomys\u0142, tragiczne wykonanie.

Lack of sex is a big disappointing here though, it would give the game a perfect touch.\n\nNEO Scavenger's mechanic is purely brilliant, but the main hardcorish problem to me is that story line is rather linear (though it gives you options to complete quests depending on your perks from time to time), once you've made \"a wrong\" decision you'll be punished with no option to progress at all, making you literally start the game over from the very beginning. It forces you to constantly peak into forums and wiki, leaving you with no free will options at all.\n\nI strongly recommend to buy this game to support its developer.", "timestamp_created": 1391342667, "timestamp_updated": 1391342667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8943315": {"recommendationid": "8943315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112834867", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517964986}, "language": "english", "review": "Immediatly fell in love with this game after playing the demo.

Even more than that, it is a game that wants to kill you. Brutally and rapidly if possible, but slowly will work just as well. From hypothermia to bandit attacks to starving to death, it pulls no punches in the \u201cyou\u2019re going to die\u201d department. It is an unforgiving game and makes no apologies about it. Quite frankly, that\u2019s one of the reasons it succeeds so well. Before you go running off without reading further, allow me a moment to elaborate. A single paragraph is all I\u2019m asking.\n\nYou see, NEO Scavenger also wants you to succeed. It does supply you with the tools and skills you need in order to survive. It simply doesn\u2019t hold your hand or coddle you along the way. You begin simply enough. You start the game by picking your few basic skills and you wake up on the floor of a cryogenic freezing lab with something mean heading your way. Your journey has just begun in earnest. You may use your chosen skills to assist with the incoming creature, via feeding it another survivor or simply locking the door. The skills you have chosen to outfit yourself often change the game in this way, leading to all kinds of different outcomes to little problems like this. It\u2019s undeniably gratifying to halt an enemy attack by using your hacking skill to drop a cryogenic tank and feeding the creature a reality television star. Let\u2019s be honest; who hasn\u2019t wanted to do that at one point or another?\n\nAre you still with me? I thought that might get your attention. The aim of the game is fairly simple; find out who you are and what happened to the world. Things take place in a post-apocalyptic environment, and you have no memory of any of it. It\u2019s fairly standard, but it plays out relatively well nonetheless. Hints are revealed through old newspapers you find scattered about and obvious visual cues. Your hand is never held at any point, there is no tutorial, and there are no retries. When you die, it is game over and you start again from the beginning. NEO Scavenger is a harsh, unforgiving piece of work. But you also get a little better each time, get a little further, and learn a little more. It\u2019s tough, often seems unfair, and is always exciting.\n\nTechnically, it is a pretty solid game. It\u2019s still in development, so it does have its share of bugs and incomplete features, but what is currently present does work well and you shouldn\u2019t be deterred from giving it a shot if you find yourself at all interested. Over the course of the next few months it will be fleshed out and cleaned up, and it\u2019s looking like it will become a great little game. I would recommend it easily enough, especially considering the $10 price tag attached to it. If you think you might be interested, and don\u2019t mind a rough edge or two, give it a shot. If you think you can take the abuse, that is. \n", "timestamp_created": 1391059668, "timestamp_updated": 1391059668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8895713": {"recommendationid": "8895713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067461191", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 72, "last_played": 1521301467}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game, which is really fun and I reccomend it to rpg fans and people who like text based games.", "timestamp_created": 1390964262, "timestamp_updated": 1390964262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8889595": {"recommendationid": "8889595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024680817", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 9654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515862978}, "language": "english", "review": "A very immersive post-apocalyptic game that comes with well-written stories, encounters and decisions.

I wish I could re-live my first expierence with this game, it started with me waking up in the Cryochamber pouring over every line of text. I read that an entity was coming for me and I had to think fast, so first thing I did was jump out of the window, wouldn't anyone want to get away as fast as possible? Well that wasn't exactly a great idea, as I jumped out in my reckless haste I had mangled myself up real bad on the broken glass, not good. Not only am I now bleed profusely from everywhere, I have a hospital gown on, a weird necklace, a hospital band saying \"Philip Kindred,\" and a hulking werewolf following me. I took my first steps out into the world, only to die later that night from hypothermia and blood loss.\n\nNEO-Scavenger puts you in a post-apocalpytic Michigan with a slew of crazy characters and horrifiyng monsters. It's brutal and unforgiving when you start out, and your first (and many) deaths will come from hypothermia. The scavenging and loot system for this game is completly random but not unfair and makes finding that one piece of equipment feel so good. Finding a gun is a hell of a lot harder then finding a jacket or some food. You're more likely to find clothing in an apartment than a storage shed. It's satisfying seeing your character grow and aquire new gear and become a true badass of the Michigan area, that is until a random thug comes up to you hits you in the head once with a rock and kills you instantly. Then he's the new badass Michigan. Did I mention this game is hard? Well at least the first few hours are. This game kicks your ass when you first start out, once you get your berrings and figure out what works best (Strong+Melee+Trapping+Broad Spear = OP) then the game really does get a lot easier and a lot of the challenge goes away. As other review's have stated once you hit end-game and beat it you really have seen and done everything there is to see and do. \"Quests\" are not random, story events are not random, and the ending is not random. What happens happens, but, getting there is where all the fun is at. Looting everything you can while staving off hunger, thirst, and keeping your own wellbeing while fending off Bad Motha's, Blue Frog's, and Dogmen are what truely make this game entertaining. I've seen this game grow up and it is still as fun when I first started playing it. Open the Wiki and just go at it, every death is a learning expierence!\n\nIf you are looking for a unique game that kicks your ass in the beginning and makes you feel like a badass later, with a killer story and fun gameplay then look no further than NEO-Scavenger!", "timestamp_created": 1390538601, "timestamp_updated": 1493884178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8824629": {"recommendationid": "8824629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007031805", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442161669}, "language": "english", "review": "veeerrrryyyyy good but veeeerrrrryyyyyy hard :D", "timestamp_created": 1390524581, "timestamp_updated": 1390524581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.991681", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8818465": {"recommendationid": "8818465", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981331682", "num_games_owned": 469, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405910151}, "language": "english", "review": "This is THEY survival title.

The game offers an interesting spin on the survival genre, by almost singlemindedly focusing on resource gathering. Every mechanic of the game is geared toward that. You'll spend most of the time looking at a grid-based inventory screen, playing Tetris with items. This is no Diablo, though, and what you bring with you might make the difference between life and death.\nFood-clocks are a pretty common mechanic in traditional Roguelikes and many offshoots (Think of the advancing rebel army in FTL). Time and resource based constraints are a good way to keep the player on its toes, forcing him to push forward instead of farming lower level content to gain advantage. \nNEO Scavenger doesn't joke with time constraints. Get some clothing fast or it's unlikely you'll make past the first night. \nThere are some balancing issue though, mostly due to the random world generation. Sometimes jeans are harder to find than sleds for some reason. Sometime, there are miles between your initial spawning location and any useful city hex tile.\nWhile dying like this might be realistic in a post-apocalyptic setting, it's kinda frustrating to experience more than a couple times.\nAlso, there's a story going on; and by that, I mean a real story, not an emergent one - with quests, characters and dialogues. Not something you see everyday in these type of games. I'm not particularly bothered by it, but I wish I could opt out of it altogether and strike out on my own, handling my own business. The main issue I have with it is that, due to the nature of the game, you're going to see the same text-adventure inserts and lore pieces again and again. \n\nWith all its quirks and unfinished or unpolished mechanics - combat is especially dull and clunky at the moment - it's shaping to be an interesting and unique game.", "timestamp_created": 1390395257, "timestamp_updated": 1390395257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.955446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8802511": {"recommendationid": "8802511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119445109", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490411661}, "language": "english", "review": "(This review has changed for the third time on 6/31/17)\n\nBeing the first game I ever bought on Steam all those years ago, I feel like I should recommend this game. I already had written two seperate reviews in favor of it. So why do I feel like flipping that  big thumb upside down? Well, I've realized that this just isn't a good game. My issues with it just pile up when you actually look at it objectively. (Skip to the list now if you just want a brief overview without too much reading.)\n\nFor starters, the RNG is ridiculous sometimes. I've had some playthroughs were I magically managed to kill one of the most powerful things in the game with nothing more than a hoodie and a stick. Other times, I take about three steps away from the start and a thing called a Mega Wraith comes by and slaughters me. Both of these things have happened at least twice.\n\nOK, lets say that RNGeezus is on your side and you managed to become an absolute tank. Now what? To be honest, I'm still not sure. I've got to the lengths of cheating the game and there's nothing else to it. You can go and do the story for a bit. A really small bit. I mean, [b] you don't do anything in the story! [/b] No really, I've tried every dialogue choice and item combination allowed in the first \"encounter\" of the story. They all end with you being given a task -- a fetch-quest to get the \"Vase of McGuffin\" or something equally ridiculous -- that will either kill you if you're not a tank and bore you to tears if you can survive. Oh, did I forget to mention that it never tells you were the dang thing even is?! This is where my playthroughs tend to end.\n\nLast thing before I let the bulletpoints take over. Did I forget to mention this is as polished as a rusty machete? It's running in godforsaken, [b]2005 Newgrounds,[/b] Adobe Flash for crying out loud! It also barely understands what a 1080p screen even is. I never noticed this for a long time but I used to play this exclusively on my laptop from... huh... it was from 2005 as well.\n\n[h1]PROS...[/h1]\n- More in-depth than any other post-apocalyptic survival games I have ever played.\n- Kinda funny predicaments like getting your head LITTERALLY CRUSHED by something called a \"Mega Wraith\"\n- Story is not necessary. Really, you can just jump in, not read anything and still have a good time. Great for when you don't have a lot of time to spend\n- Addicting. Beacuse you die so much, you constantly have that Flappy-Bird-ish, \"Just one more turn\" mentality (see CONS)\n\n[h1]CONS...[/h1]\n- More expensive than I would like. Maybe thats just me but it just doesn't feel all that polished. In fact, it's still running in Adobe Flash!\n- Really hard. Since it's randomly generated, it takes a whole lot of luck to not die before you can even have a fighting chance.\n- Too much cussing in the main story. This might be my personal taste but some of the cursing in the game feels forced and unnecessary.\n- Ultimately pathetic story. If you do choose to play the main story, you'll eventually feel either A) disappointed with how it's handled or B) be completely and hopelessly lost. After the first meaningful encounter with the story, they pretty much give you the boot out of anything you might find helpful and pretty much tell you to do a fetch quest. A quest, mind you, that never once tells you how to complete it.\n\n\nI'm disappointed to have to turn my back on this game but I feel like it's just not good enough to recommend. Play the demo and leave it there. You've already played all the fun bits.\n\n30phil1 wrote a review\n30phil1 posted the review\n30phil1 played NEO Scavenger\n30phil1's head was crushed by Mega Wraith's grasp\n30phil1 died of trumatic brain injury\n*End Turn*", "timestamp_created": 1390351708, "timestamp_updated": 1501553786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.978780", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8801528": {"recommendationid": "8801528", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989875299", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448827876}, "language": "english", "review": "Verry interesting way of an apocalypse game its a bit like a board game, but not. at first i didnt like all the reading, but it actually gets pretty good later in :)      verry nice fighting style!", "timestamp_created": 1390344167, "timestamp_updated": 1390344167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8798347": {"recommendationid": "8798347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070022693", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513105423}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.

I have been playing \"hardcore\" games for years, now. This game brings on a new definition for the word. This game is immerciful, harsh, and unforgiving. One wrong move and you could have your entire life come crashing down. You should never expect to live longer than past the night when playing this game. At first, you'll likely only live about a few hours, if not a day or two. After a while, you'll start discovering recipes, finding equipment, and even special places that do/don't have much to do with the story, such as Zom Zom's. Along the paths you take, you will have opportunities to help people, scavenge for resources, and even get in a fight or two. The entire game is ectremely difficult and is not something to be played leisurely. I do have one problem with the game, though, and that's the constant dying by \"Acute bleeding in the lungs.\" It's almost become the new \"Arrow in the knee\", which can also happen, making your experience feel somewhat ironic at times. But, back to the \"Acute bleeding in the lungs\", I find that it happens much too often, making the game feel somewhat less serious. Sure, it only happens after getting whacked in the chest and stomach repeatedly, but you could imagine how annoying it would be to see that it's the only reason you die, half of the time. I would reccomend this game to any person interested in a new type of survival game.

I haven't even gotten very far so far, just under 5 days of survival I believe. Much like FTL (Faster Than Light) you will find this game gives the player a number of significant choices in a world that is generated differently each time with events equally varied and random. The game has it's flaws, to be sure. And without using much of a guide thus far I still occasionally get confused or am unsure as to how some mechanic works. It has occurred once that I was in a fight I believed I was winning when all of a sudden my equipment had disappeared and I was out of battle finding myself thinking to the game \"I'm sure you're right, but why?\". \n\nAll in all, the game has many possibilities to make it immersive, there are a few things to be improved on, a few minor bugs and a learning curve if you want to make your way far. But all in all, I would say this is great for a player looking for a good survival game. Much like FTL, this game isn't made for you to be the hero, or in your favor like other games where you are central to the plot. You exist on it's terms, you can't run around being all-mighty.\n\nI would also like to add that this game has static graphics to accommodate the text/UI based game so don't expect anything aesthetically amazing. The graphics accomplish what they need to accomplish, they will make the world feel complete, but not 'beautiful', and to be frank that's fine. It suits what the game is. With that said, I would also like to add that the text portions are very well written in my opinion and the events I have encountered thus far have been incredibly interesting.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone. If you aren't interested in survival games I wouldn't recommend it, nor if you are looking for a beautiful game.

How realistic this game is will just blow you away. The combat is great, unforgiving, ruthless, but realistic all the same. With hundreds of diseases to watch for, and injuries to avoid. In this game, it actually matters were you get hit, punched, cut, or shot. If you were to get punched in the arm, you simply recieve a bruise, minor pain, and a small inpack to what you can carry with it. However, if you got punched in the throat, you will be seriously injured. It will become hard to breathe, drinking water or eating food becomes unbearable, and if the hit was hard and precise, you will probably die or choke on your own blood. Anykind of injury, sickness, including physical or mental, that you can think of, is present in this game. \n\nIn this game, you will die, die, and die again. It takes a little while to get used to the game play and how to fight, but once you do, you will play for hours and hours.

Pricing is a highly debatable topic, so I don't think you're necessarily wrong or right. Each person has to make their own determination about value, and I hope the demo helped in your decision!\n\nRegarding some of your points:\n-You mention that the randomization is basic/simplistic. What are some of the things you were hoping to see to make it more complex? I feel there's actually quite a complex system at work, with a large amount of data, but perhaps the game is doing a poor job of showing this?\n-Regarding the lack of ways to prosper beyond basic survival, it's true that there isn't much beyond surviving, exploring, and following clues. The game is largely focused on nomadic play style, since adding more permanent lifestyles is a layer I'm unprepared to tackle. (E.g. farming, fortification, followers, etc.) I do hope to have some satisfying encounters to find and clues to uncover while exploring, though!\n-The cart/sled issue you mention is actually addressed in an upcoming build. There is now a dedicated move to \"emergency ditch\" one's cart/sled without needing to access the inventory screen, granting a dodge bonus for that turn.\n-As for crafting, the recipes tend to be fairly rigorous, so even small ingredients matter. As BoxCatGamer points out, there are a few ways to make a fire, but you'll need certain skills (like Trapping) if you don't have the right tools (e.g. lighter, torch, or other flame source).\n  \nThanks for your feedback, and hopefully you'll give NEO Scavenger another shot in the future!\n  \nBest,\nDan"}, "8526844": {"recommendationid": "8526844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004288083", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446409902}, "language": "english", "review": "Coolest and most punctual developer ever, highly recommended if you enjoy strategy or survival and don't mind turn based-play.", "timestamp_created": 1388714989, "timestamp_updated": 1388714989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8524533": {"recommendationid": "8524533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058414181", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519427034}, "language": "english", "review": "What a game!\n\nThis gameplay over graphics revival of late is absolutely spiffing.

I have to say I played the demo and was like.... meh.... then I bought it anyway because of the sandbox nature. The biggest issue is the lack of any explaination of the controls. I had to learn that the hard way. (IE how to flip items to fit in your bags, use crafting, find water from streams, etc) Now that I know how to use it I'm having so much more fun. (PRO TIP \"x\" is for crafting, and you have to \"craft\" the lakes to get water, or woods to get sticks. If you use melee skill, large branch, shard of glass and a shirt or cloth you'll get a broad spear that smacks guys around!)\n\nAnyway the only thing I wish this had was weapon skills, so I can get more deadly and have a better chance to kill with a bow or gun. I understand that will NOT be part of the final build and although I want it I am fine with not having it. Items degrade pretty quickly, and there arent many stores to buy stuff so you have to make due with what you find. \n\nAnother thing thats awesome is cooking.

I recommend it to anyone who wants a turn-based hex RPG. Set in a post-apocolyptic Lovecraftian Michigan, your character emerges from a crygenic vat to step into a race against time. You can die from dehydration, starvation, disease  and hypothermia, in addition to wounds inflicted by the various denizens surrounding the Motor City's wastelands. \n\nThis hard setting is further amplified by the decision not to include a leveling system. Each time you play, you learn more about the game mechanics and possibilities. You can augment your character with four of a dozen advantages, as well as about six disadvantages. Thes combination of these influence your play style, as some opportunities only present themselves to those with a given trait. \n\nFor those who love to play first-person shooter \"RPG\" as murder hobos, this is not the game for you. It is more reminiscent of games from the late 1980s and early 1990s in that it tells its story in a piecemeal fashion with only one Rouge-like save option.

Now, don't assume that this is put forth as a criticism because that is the appeal to this survival game.  After succumbing to the countless manners of death you begin to appreciate the fragility of humanity in this post-apocalyptic world.  Every decision begins to weigh on the player as you try to balance all the needs of survival.  I suppose there IS a way to \"win\" the game, though I've never seen it.  For me the appeal is simply the test to see how long you can stay alive while dodging the raiders, bandits, the elements, wild beasts, disease, dehydration, famine - I'm sure you get the point.  Go ahead and eat that rancid hunk of meat you found because the immediate fear of famine out-weighs the ramifications of food poisoning you will have to deal with tomorrow.  \n\nThis is an early access game so there will be problems.

There are lots of interesting traits to choose when beginning the game, but honestly \"toughness,\" \"melee,\" and \"strength\" are the main ones you have to have or you will not survive the first night to even begin to utilize the other abilities.

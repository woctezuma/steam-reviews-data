The last chapter puts a bit of a twist on this premise.\nThe commentary itself is legitimately funny, if sometimes in a sort of eyeroll-inducing manner - which is likely intended - so that alone makes this worth playing.\n\nThere are three playable characters which unlock as you progress in the game, all of them fairly early on. They all share a set of special abilities and each one of them has one ability that is specific to them. You collect a variety of weapons to choose from, although some are objectively better than others. If upgraded, you will still get by with whatever suits you best.\nUpgrades are done with collectibles, gears you can find all over the place, some in your direct path and as enemy drops, some a little more hidden, which makes exploration an interesting part of the game.\nCompleting certain challenges (like shooting targets or jumping through hoops) and progressing also lets you assign character points. For each \"level\" you can choose between three upgrades, for example more health, health regen, more ranged damage etc.\n\nGameplay consists of combat - melee or ranged - and platforming.\n\nThe combat is alright, there are many different types of enemies, but only some actually require something other than \"Shoot/smack it until it's dead\" (like having to shoot them in the back or [spoiler]cutting their strings in the last chapter[/spoiler]). Their design is more interesting than actually fighting them, and getting swarmed/stunlocked by hordes of weaker enemies while stronger ones eat away at your health bar can be frustrating, though it doesn't happen too often. It's also not always clear how to defeat an enemy that can't just be whacked in the face until it falls over.\nWhat's interesting is that there's a dodge mechanic which can be used to parry attacks if timed right, and it also lets you parry projectiles.\nThe platforming has some issues. You can't control the camera; the game rotates it in ways that it [i]thinks[/i] will help you, but sometimes it doesn't. You vision can occasionally be obstructed by terrain and enemies can and will attack from off-screen. What's more frustrating is when you're trying to jump somewhere and the camera rotates mid-jump, or was positioned so that you couldn't gauge distance or height in the first place.\n\nIt may sound like I have a lot of issues with the game, but some are non-issues, and overall it was still fun and enjoyable (plus not long enough to make any of these issues tedious).\n\n(Note: I didn't have any performance issues. Sometimes it looked like it, but that was due to the weird thematically appropriate stop-motion movement of some enemies in the game, which threw me off a bit in the beginning.)", "timestamp_created": 1520979379, "timestamp_updated": 1520979379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40743637": {"recommendationid": "40743637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308910414", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519576032}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u592a\u6709\u610f\u601d\u4e86\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u6211\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u56de\u6765\u8865\u4e2a\u8bc4\u6d4b", "timestamp_created": 1520780885, "timestamp_updated": 1520780885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40705487": {"recommendationid": "40705487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032604204", "num_games_owned": 1235, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 97, "last_played": 1520670212}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Los juegos del estudio chileno ACE Team se caracterizan por su marcada originalidad, por tener siempre dise\u00f1os estramb\u00f3ticos, como tambi\u00e9n por saber dar muy acertadamente una vuelta de rosca a todo tipo de g\u00e9neros (desde el beat\u2019em up, pasando por la defensa de torres, estrategia o, en el caso que nos ocupa, un juego de acci\u00f3n disfrazado de plataformas).

(Although, there were a couple parts that genuinely got a good chuckle out of me.)\n\nTo put it simply:\nThis game feels like it was really close to being something of a hidden gem, but it just falls short on so many aspects that I don't think I would recommend it to most people.

However the addition of an unnecessary plot-twist, poor keyboard-and-mouse controls and generally paint-by-numbers game-play mean that, while the game starts out well, the fun quickly leaches out of the game.\n\nOn the positive side, the game looks good - in a suitably bad sort of way - and it doesn't feel as though it has a lot of filler (despite the afore-mentioned poor plot choices). The dangers of playing on a tall tower with few railings is mitigated with a button that will teleport you back to where you fell off and a jetpack that lets you land softly. There is also a teleport mechanism to move between check-points, but it is rarely necessary (and unfortunately easy to forget when you do need it).\n\nOn the bad side the poor controls come face-to-face with some platforming sections where the 3D relationship of the platforms you are on is not obvious. The boss fights are generally low-challenge affairs with little creativity (although the giant octopus was at least fun). In game-play terms you will have seen it all before, the monsters follow all the usual patterns. The power-ups don't feel like they give much of an advantage and you have to complete challenges or find objects to gain them.\n\nThe merely mediocre is the character changing mechanism, they all play differently, but there is little reason to change characters for 95% of the game until you reach the points that require a certain characters skills. Similarly the weapons don't give you much of a reason to swap around once you have found a favourite (there are exceptions: dinosaurs vs. rocket launcher being one of them).\n\nOverall it is a game with a good concept that starts off feeling good, but slowly stops being fun as you realise there is little other creativity involved.", "timestamp_created": 1512165579, "timestamp_updated": 1512165579, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37982574": {"recommendationid": "37982574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022031925", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488579196}, "language": "french", "review": "Franchement, j'ai rigol\u00e9 au d\u00e9but pour le concept, mais au bout de quelques temps \u00e7a devient m\u00e9ga lassant.\nPas un jeu indispensable.", "timestamp_created": 1512151879, "timestamp_updated": 1512151879, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37942270": {"recommendationid": "37942270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113082912", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517702393}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Divertido!", "timestamp_created": 1512006025, "timestamp_updated": 1512006025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37915068": {"recommendationid": "37915068", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965768250", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495847210}, "language": "english", "review": "Even with a rash of good games out, The Deadly Tower of Monsters stood out as an extremely memorable and unique experience.

The title probably gives away enough about what happens in the \"movie\".\n\nThe game is viewed from an isometric angle most of the time, but there are some sections where you're flying or shooting downwards that have a different viewpoint. Basic movement of running around and beating or shooting stuff with your main and sub weapons feels fluent enough. Although there's a main objective to go for the game gives you a bit of freedom in exploring the accessible areas where you can find materials for upgrading your weapons.\n\nThere are three playable characters and you can switch between them at-will at certain points in the game. They do have some movement and ability differences and you're required to use some of them in order to progress through some sections. The best part though is that the characters are voice acted and at least for the hero it's done in a hammy, William Shatner-esque way.\n\nThe visuals also keep with the theme and have some nice touches to them like emulating the good old movie goof of being able to see the strings that move the enemies around. Speaking of utilizing the setting, most of the enemy animations also look choppy in a stop-motion -kind of way and there's even an option in the game settings for applying a VHS-type grain on the picture.\n\nThere aren't too many negative things I can bring up. My biggest complaint is that it could've used more music on the soundtrack as you tend to hear the same themes a lot after playing for a while.

The visuals are solid with all the enemies looking like guys in monkey suits or plastic alien masks and it's all very well put together. You get a multitude of different weapons, each with upgrades, and three unlockable characters to play with. They even take good advantage of the tower climbing mechanic in that sometimes you need to change your viewpoint to look down to lower levels of the tower and murders flying aliens as they approach which makes for a nice change. Sounds good right? Yeah, no so much. On paper everything's there but the execution really isn't great across the board. The in-game currency required to upgrade weapons is really hard to come by so you're not going to see much change there; which doesn't really matter because the clunky repetitive combat renders all the weapons pretty similar in use (especially the melee weapons which are almost completely interchangeable). Talking of repetitive, aside from a couple of missions set off the tower which give more room to manoeuvre, climbing the tower itself become a bit of a chore after a while. The visual design does change things up admirably and you'll very often get new enemies to fight, but nothing actually changes as you spiral your way up the tower so it doesn't help much. Boss fights are rare and boring; the 'shoot down the tower' stuff is unwieldy and annoying; the platforming sections are an arse-ache due to some quirk of the pseudo-isometric viewpoint rendering vertical distances pure guesswork; the three characters are exactly the same to play with except having unique specials which are almost never used (except in random rare cases where you need to switch to a different person for five seconds to get past an obstacle); etc. It's actually more fun to play than I'm making it sound there but there's just so much of it that's completely half-baked. Less weapons (or more upgrade currency), proper twin-stick shooter combat and a little bit more variety and it could've been something really special but I can't really recommend it as it stands.", "timestamp_created": 1511529817, "timestamp_updated": 1511529817, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499343", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37264158": {"recommendationid": "37264158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340224961", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509537550}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7b80\u76f4\u6709\u6bd2\uff0c\u753b\u5916\u97f3\u5f88\u641e\u7b11\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u98ce\u683c\u8ba9\u4eba\u559c\u6b22\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u597d\u8bc4\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1511498693, "timestamp_updated": 1511498693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37260517": {"recommendationid": "37260517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182518086", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489129497}, "language": "english", "review": "As it was described to me, I shall now pass it on to you.\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if every old sci-fi B-movie got packed into one game.

Jh. Aus dem Off h\u00f6rt man die Kommentare des Regisseurs bei diesem Re-Release dieses Klassikers dieser Filmepoche.\n\nL\u00e4ssig erf\u00e4hrt man so, welche billigen Tricks angewandt wurden, um bei dem niedrigen Budget noch einen halbwegs spannenden Film zu produzieren. Die gro\u00dfen, King-Kong-\u00e4hnlichen Monster werden in Stop-Motion animiert. Zur Not werden auch handels\u00fcbliche Staubsauger zu Monster umfunktioniert. Viele blinkende Lichter, fliegende Untertassen und Dinos d\u00fcrfen nicht fehlen.

Meist ist es aber egal, wen wir nehmen. Neben den K\u00e4mpfen ist Jump 'n' Run und das Einsammeln von Objekten unsere Aufgabe, auch um unsere Waffen und F\u00e4higkeiten zu verbessern.\n\nDer Weg ist zwar im wesentlichen linear, aber es gibt auch auf Abwegen viel zu finden. Ein (tragbarer?) Teleporter kann uns jederzeit zu bestimmten Stellen des Weges bringen. Dies ist auch sinnig, weil gewisse Dinge erst mit sp\u00e4teren Methoden gemacht werden k\u00f6nnen.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1202591837\n\nDie Pfade f\u00fchren uns oft in luftige H\u00f6he.

Sterben wird doch mal, meist im Kampf, wird der Film am letzten Kontrollpunkt wieder aufgenommen.\n\nMan kann bis zu drei verschiedene Spiele anfangen, man hat aber nur je einen Speicherstand.

Die Darstellung ist (vermutlich absichtlich) manchmal merklich verschwommen, das h\u00e4tte man sich sparen sollen.\n\nDie Sprecher sind sehr gut. Die Musik und die Ger\u00e4usche sind passend zu der Epoche der Filmgeschichte.\n\nDie Steuerung ist sowohl mit Controller als auch mit Tastatur/Maus m\u00f6glich.

rare occasions, a game is found which seems not only close to flawless but proves an absolute joy to play. A game like this stands up in a crowd and says, \"Hey! You remember fun? Try this, maybe!\" The Deadly Tower of Monsters is such a title. In perfect honesty the author nearly feels an aversion to publishing any opinion on The Deadly Tower of Monsters, as it feels like it would fall short of doing the game justice.\n\nTo summarize, The Deadly Tower of Monsters is effectively a platforming video game incarnation of Mars Attacks: a perfectly satirical nod to the greatness that was the pre-3rd millennium sci-fi B movie. Looking at it, one gets a vague notion that the developer ACE Team may have originally intended a slightly different product, and partway through the life cycle decided, \"You see these stitches? That faulty lighting? Yeah, we do too!\" and ran with it in a new direction like it was out of style. Every cliche and trope of 19xx's science fiction makes an appearance while the indomitable protagonists Dick, Scarlet, and... Robot, in the interest of saving the downtrodden population of an oppressed planet of ape-people, try to overthrow a maniacally space-evil space tyrant in space.\n\nWhere The Deadly Tower of Monsters shines is its decision to not simply center on a sci-fi tale released to DVD, but the story behind FILMING the kitschy goodness of the same.\n\nTo expound, the game's every aesthetic choice leans toward showing the strings holding up miniatures, throwing way too many antennae on absolutely everything, overlaying the player's actions with metanarration by an offscreen hilariously delusional production team, and universally displaying film grain over the camera's vignette. From the game's start screen, an over-the-top director Dan Smith is offering commentary on the making of the ersatz film and the history behind the characters, plot, actors, props, and completely irrelevant trivia about the filming process. The running commentary is a solid part of what makes the game amazing; from hilarious one-liners about the stars experiencing mid-life crises behind the scenes to Bastion-esque dynamic descriptions of the player's actions on a moment-to-moment basis. Voice work for the whole \"cast\" is actually the weakest part of the game in places (trying just... a little too hard for a cheesy effect and overplaying its hand), and it's still perfectly suited to the whole experience. The Wilhelm scream makes a mandatory appearance in numerous places, and other stock sound effects are mixed into an original library just enough to show self-awareness while keeping accusations of being lazy or uncreative all the way in the next town over. Meanwhile, the score could be thrown over any Godzilla feature ever created without anyone the wiser - an odd but compatible choice for action-platforming adventure.\n\nVisually the game manages to pull off a neat trick by adopting a Duck-tape-and-prayers asset style, and lavishing an inordinate amount of effort on the quality of both the Duck tape and the prayers. Disparate sci-fi movies from decades past are united in a weird, compelling blend. Within minutes of starting the player encounters soldiers with needlessly decorative armor. They run into stop-motion dinosaurs. They may get eaten by a giant fish thing right at home in The Creature from the Black Lagoon. They swat little flying bat things that have actual wires holding them up. They will almost certainly stop and gander at the trees throughout the environment, as most of them are shiny enough to give away a faux nature (which is doubly clear when rampaging foes sometimes just topple them over). There are dozens of smaller touches one notices over time, like how the cursor actually faintly lights up the environment in dark spots, interspersed title cards straight from a silent movie, and fingerprints smudged all over a perfectly good lens flare. Eventually the player will be forced at length to admire the modeling of Christmas light covered dogs stuck in vacuum cleaners, people stuck in too-small squid costumes and squirting ink everywhere, and a gigantic sawblade wielding mechanical space chameleon. It is distinctive, it is ludicrously self-aware, and it knows exactly what look it wants to achieve... and it nails it flawlessly.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, The Deadly Tower of Monsters divides itself into two very well defined zones delineated by most action platformers: action and platforming. In the former camp lies interesting, slightly awkward combat with close-range and long-range elements, and occasional set-piece scenes involving climbing parts of the Tower just ahead of rising danger. Said awkwardness in combat is one of the few things about which complaints exist; not that it plays badly, but that it looks... profoundly unnatural at times. Regardless, foes are ludicrously varied, and might do things like repulse grainy blaster fire, or highly encourage use of specific characters' special skills. Dodge based parrying is perhaps unnecessary for most of the fighting one does, but the supplication to \"get gud\" should be heeded by the midpoint at the latest. Branching and linear upgrades allow one to really carve out a niche style, and establish particular rhythms with favored weapon/skill combinations, in spite of the \"merely human\" method of ungainly swings of maces and antennae swords and the like. Switching one's tools becomes a necessity at times, though, and although the combat controls are generally extremely simple it remains fresh for a really long time. In a very neat touch, the game has a vertical shooting gallery element; get close to an edge, and the protagonist of choice leans over with a special ray cannon, able to demolish targets far below, or prevent enemies from ascending to their altitude and reinforcing an already vicious group of adversaries.\n\nIn stark contrast to the fighty stuff, the titular Tower must be climbed so as to unseat the overlord ruling it with an iron fist. This involves going up and down between teleport checkpoints at times, as well as more conventional running around to explore the many hidden and less hidden locales. Perhaps the single most iconic aspect of the game, though, is the free-fall. Head to a high spot, leap off, and plummet at a rate where dodging and weaving out of the way of oncoming projectiles is possible, but foes can also be dueled with blaster fire on the way back to earth (Sorry, Gravoria) just before triggering a recall function that returns one to the original jumping spot. In a word, awesome. It manages to combine the tension of aversarial scenarios with a really profound sense of just how big the scale of the Tower actually is. One of the better organic moments in the game was one point during an encounter fight where a stronger foe managed to land a heavy hit with a space flail, knocked poor Dick Starspeed off his precarious ledge about forty or fifty stories up, and initiated a completely unnecessary but exhilirating descent through several layers of fire breathing pterodactyls and UFO attackers, ending with a just-in-time jetpack touchdown on terra firma. It was that altercation in particular that really hammered home just how much care went into this title when ACE Team embarked on its quest for producing more amazing games.\n\nThe Deadly Tower of Monsters is truly excellent and deserves recognition for the spectacular efforts in making it look and sound a notch above the rest. It shows that, when a team decides to undertake a project, cut out anything like an attempt to take themselves seriously, and polishes the thing so much the previous paint job begins to come out, the result is not simply space-great, but space-magnificent.", "timestamp_created": 1508644366, "timestamp_updated": 1508644366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35836739": {"recommendationid": "35836739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207898023", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514977114}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic attempt at a sci-fi b-movie video game.

A sort of sci-fi B-film of the 1960's. Complete with director commentary! This is intentional, not an extra feature of some special edition or what not. The director commentary actually consists of how the 'movie' was made. Not the game.\n\nThe gameplay is quite simple, consisting of a very generous auto aim for the various weapons. A melee attack and a roll. As well as some abilities for use with mostly getting past obstacles to climb the tower. Though, they can also be used in combat to a lesser extent. \n\nThe animation is interesting. Some of the creatures having extremely low frame rates as they were filmed in 'stop-motion'. \n\nThe game starts a little slow in my opinion but gets more interesting as you go along. With some twists to be had approaching the end. The soundtrack is also very good though it seems a little of of place at times. It almost becomes genuinely epic and space faring while the rest of the game continues on it's quite comical path. \n\n[i][b]THE GIST \nIt's a quaint game.

The gameplay was solid; The jetpack platforming, weapon variety, the combat, how the enemies drop pickups and not to mention the collectables... It reminded me of 3D platforming games from the good old days, with a top-down/isometricish twist. Needless to say this game gets you pretty high, and free falling once you are is fuckin majestic!\n\nThe story was interesting to say the least... I'd elaborate on that some more but it'd just be spoilers. However, I will say I liked how this game played on all the major cliches of B-movies. Even for someone like me, who doesn't frequently watch b-movies, I still understood the humor. The commentary did actually make me laugh a few times, and I went in thinking it'd be cheesey/cringe-city. It was, but not as much as I thought it would be. It was the misogynistic humor that got me the most.\n\nRight when you start the game, before even getting to the main menu, the games either gonna make you smile or annoy you with its commentary gimmick.

The combat and progression aren't anything special, but where this game shines is the enemy variety and theme.

The premise is simple:  You are watching a VHS of an old low budget 50s pulp sci-fi B movie while the director records the commentary for the DVD release.  \n\nYou control the characters (leading man, space woman who has never seen a man, robot) through a sort of 3D action-shooter-platformer, complete with VHS video artifacts, cheesy sci-fi soundtrack, and the director commenting on the actors, the filming, and the oddities that don't make any sense (like how player deaths were just footage accidentally left in, or how much the prop guy hated having to re-build all of the crates that got smashed.)  The gameplay was fun, challenging at times, but not really tough on normal difficulty.  There were optional collectibles, weapon upgrades, basics skills, and special abilities.  The story has you climbing a massive, massive tower that goes from ground level to orbit, and at any point you can look down and see the entire thing, or even jump off and fall all the way down to any point you'd been at previously, landing with your trusty jetpack at the last second (and you could always teleport back.)\n\nThey pull off the B movie schtick brilliantly.   The VHS effects really work, and the look is spot-on.  The 'monsters' you fight are obviously guys stuck in a rubber suit, and if anything flies you can clearly see the wires.  When larger monsters appear, they're animated in such a way that they look like the were filmed using stop-motion photography.  You carried two melee and two ranged weapons from a large selection, all typical fun sci-fi nonsense (including one blaster that was obviously an electric razor, and one gun that was a small vacuum.)\n\nMy only real complaints were that the last chapter's narrative kind of went off the tracks, and that some of the special abilities were never really communicated to the player (I still don't know exactly what the big bubble thing that everyone had actually did.)  It was a little too easy at times, but again, I played on normal.  It was still tough enough that boss fights required some effort, but never to the point of being dull or frustrating.  It was the perfect length for that, too, being maybe 4-5 hours.  Any longer and it would have gotten tedious, but it was fine for that length of time.\n\nNot a perfect game, but a ton of fun and a great setting.  Maybe a 7.5/10.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499106343, "timestamp_updated": 1499106343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572864", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33190416": {"recommendationid": "33190416", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976612595", "num_games_owned": 1172, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499322727}, "language": "english", "review": "Stupid hammy fun.", "timestamp_created": 1499098251, "timestamp_updated": 1499098251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33160020": {"recommendationid": "33160020", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992481334", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499101310}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny Game (If you like old b-movie tropes and self-referential humor) with an amzingly spot on art style and quite good game play.

This certainly did pay out in my case, as I've often found myself enjoying the movie references, the jabs at b-cinema and just the game's overall art direction, which is consistently on point and never truly runs out of ideas, moreso than I did enjoy the actual action. Not to be misunderstood, I had some legitimate fun blasting \"stop motion\" dinosaurs, underpaid extras in monkey costumes and space alligators, especially with that colorful arsenal of ludicrous sci-fi weaponry, but there's still no denying that \"Deadly Tower\" is not an excellent action game by any means. The twin stick shooting is a bit bland, the platforming can be utterly atrocious (luckily, there are only three or four rather brief mandatory jumping sections in the game) and the camera can be a nuisance at times.

Of course, most of the movies played came from the 50s 60s and 70s, which is how I came to love Godzilla, the Forbidden Planet, and a host of other B movies.\n\nI saw this game advertised, and thought it looked a little silly.  As I watched the videos, though, I decided it looked awesome; the right blend of self-deprecating humor, action and nostalgia.  I made the purchase - and I'm glad I did.  The running commentary (as you play the game) between the director and the sound engineer recording it is inspired.  The developers/designers put some serious thought into entertaining the gamer, and they ended up making a game I never would have thought I'd enjoy as much as this.\n\nYou can play one of three characters, and can switch them back and forth throughout the play-time.  One thing to be aware of is that unlike the weap[ons you pickup throughout the game (which can be used by all characters), the special abilities apply only to the character who discovered them.  It's a tiny inconvenience at worst, but it does give each character more flavor than the differences between the voice actors and some graphics.\n\nThere's some overlap between missions/quests and game achievments, which I thought was a bit odd/lazy - but this game is hardly the only one to do that.  While there's action, the game is more of a puzzler than an action/shooter.  I've found that playing on hardmode makes it a good challenge.

How you will feel will depend on how forgiving you are to a game in which you can kill a claymation Apatosaurus with a lightsaber while the director says he didn't believe the scientists who said they were carnivores.  To me, a few missteps in gameplay and interface are forgivable if the concept is unique, the dialogue is well-written, and it all looks and sounds great.

Oltre a seguire i commenti fasulli e cinici del vecchio regista, chiamato per aggiungere degli extra audio al prodotto, dovremo impersonare durante il riepilogo delle riprese del tempo, i tre protagonisti del film; un esploratore dal nome vincente, una principessa scorbutica e un robot dalla camminata rumorosa. Durante il percorso parleremo con qualche evoluto schiavo scimmia e raccoglieremo armi da mischia e da fuoco che potranno essere potenziate raccogliendo e spendendo  ingranaggi. Tali ingranaggi si dividono prevalentemente in 3 specie, quelle blu per lo pi\u00f9 perse da alcuni nemici sconfitti e da alcuni vasi/casse distruttibili, quelle argentate posizionate in punti di medio-facile accesso e quelle dorate, utili per massimizzare l'equipaggiamento e poste in punti meno notabili e pi\u00f9 difficoltosi, a cui per accedere dovremo spesso ritornare sui nostri passi dopo aver ottenuto un potere sbloccabile con l'esperienza accumulata. Tutto ci\u00f2 che di spendibile guadagneremo nel gioco necessiter\u00e0 delle apposite stazioni per essere utilizzato. L'apparecchiatura  gialla e verde serviranno per potenziamenti e cambiamento delle armi, quella blu, che simboleggia una camera criogenica permetter\u00e0 di cambiare personaggio, mentre quella rossa, un p\u00f2 meno presente rispetto alle altre, di spendere i punti guadagnati dalla lotta, in aumento vita - energia - danno. \n\nOltre alle armi, varie pi\u00f9 d'aspetto che d'efficacia, lasciata tra l'altro alla scoperta del giocatore viste le descrizioni buffe e la mancanza di parametri veri e propri, saremo dotati di alcuni poteri che andranno ad espandersi durante l'avventura. Questi poteri sono fondamentalmente l'unica cosa, eccetto qualche dialogo pilotato a prescindere dal personaggio in uso, a distinguere realmente la scelta tra i tre personaggi giocabili. Ad esempio il robot potr\u00e0 dare una scarica elettrica per aprire alcune porte, la donna potr\u00e0 accelerare per andare contro corrente coi pavimenti mobili e l'uomo potr\u00e0 piazzare mine per distruggere alcune barriere.  Questi descritti sono i tre poteri pi\u00f9 rilevanti, ma non gli unici, vi sono anche possibilit\u00e0 di rallentare il tempo intorno al personaggio o di creare una barriera difensiva, ma vista la resistenza e la facilit\u00e0 generale non li useremo granch\u00e9.\n\nIl gameplay ci offir\u00e0 poi, oltre all'action-platform di base, anche delle micro sfide con attraversamento di anelli in caduta libera e raccoglimento di pellicole collezionabili.\n\nL'esplorazione della torre e dei suoi dintorni ci richieder\u00e0 di tornare spesso sui nostri passi, ma ci\u00f2 verr\u00e0 agevolato oltre che da una struttura verticale semplice, anche dal teletrasporto, disponibile fin da subito premendo il tasto Select.

Sans cela, le jeu perd 80% de son int\u00e9r\u00eat tant les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont voulu faire du jeu un v\u00e9ritable hommage au genre.\nEn effet, TDTM raconte l'histoire du tournage d'un film de s\u00e9rie B ou Z sf de cette p\u00e9riode. Tout l'univers se base sur ce concept avec des personnages clich\u00e9s \u00e0 souhait et ultra kistch. Les monstres sont anim\u00e9s comme \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque ou sont design\u00e9s comme des acteurs portant un costume. L'effet VHS (d\u00e9sactivable) renforce cet aspect. De ce point de vue, les graphismes sont de bonne qualit\u00e9.\nLes d\u00e9veloppeurs ont pouss\u00e9 le d\u00e9lire tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s loin avec le r\u00e9alisateur du film qui fait un commentaire audio durant tout le jeu. C'est souvent dr\u00f4le m\u00eame si parasit\u00e9 par les phases de gampelay. Et oui, cela reste un jeu d'action typ\u00e9 beat them all. Quand il faut castagner du vilain, c'est un peu difficile de suivre ce que le r\u00e9alisateur peut dire sur le tournage fictif.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 gameplay, il fait le minimum syndical \u00e0 savoir que \u00e7a ne casse pas trois pattes \u00e0 un canard. Ultra classique malgr\u00e9 l'enrobage assez d\u00e9lirant avec des armes toutes plus d\u00e9biles les unes que les autres. Il existe aussi la possibilit\u00e9 d'am\u00e9liorer lesdites armes (corps \u00e0 corps et distance), ainsi que les personnages jouables. Ils sont au nombre de trois et seuls des pouvoirs sp\u00e9cifiques \u00e0 chacun obligeront le joueur \u00e0 en changer pour avancer. Dommage.\n\nLe d\u00e9roulement du jeu tire parti du fait que le joueur doit escalader une tour. La verticalit\u00e9 est utilis\u00e9e pour pouvoir tirer vers le bas et m\u00eame chercher des petits bonus ou collectibles. Le souci vient plus du fait que le jeu est compos\u00e9 d'ar\u00eanes et la progression se limite trop souvent \u00e0 une porte ferm\u00e9e qui se d\u00e9bloquera quand tous les ennemis de la zone seront \u00e9limin\u00e9s. Il y a quelques bonnes id\u00e9es comme des t\u00e9l\u00e9porteurs, le jetpack et la possibilit\u00e9 de se t\u00e9l\u00e9porter quand une chute arrive malencontreusement.\nLe bestiaire est assez fourni m\u00eame si les armes sont tellement p\u00e9t\u00e9es qu'ils offrent peu de r\u00e9sistance. Les boss sont un peu plus coriaces. Leur look r\u00e9ussi ne parvient \u00e0 cacher le manque d'int\u00e9r\u00eat de les combattre.\n\nLes musiques collent parfaitement \u00e0 l'ambiance du jeu et la dur\u00e9e de vie d'environ 5H sans trop se presser. La dur\u00e9e de vie est un peu rallong\u00e9e artificiellement \u00e0 cause de checkpoints pas toujours bien plac\u00e9s qui obligent \u00e0 refaire certains passages lourdingues et se coltiner de nouveau les phases de dialogues m\u00eame s'il y a la possibilit\u00e9 de les acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer.\n\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont pouss\u00e9 le d\u00e9lire tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s loin (La fin est un mod\u00e8le du genre) et c'est ce qui sauve le jeu parce que le gameplay est vraiment trop basique.

En s\u00ed es bastante f\u00e1cil y no te castiga por perder, as\u00ed que si buscas un gran desaf\u00edo, puede que te decepciones; mas si buscas pasar un buen rato, sigue leyendo.\n\nLa idea es que estamos jugando una pel\u00edcula de ciencia ficci\u00f3n de clase B, mientras el director realiza los comentarios para el DVD. As\u00ed que tendr\u00e1s las voces arriba bastante seguido, si la idea no es de tu agrado, chequea videos primero para ver qu\u00e9 tanto te pueda o no molestar. En lo personal, lo he disfrutado mucho, m\u00e1s si eres amante del cine de g\u00e9nero y notas las referencias que hacen. Ver\u00e1s cl\u00e1ramente a Flash Gordon como base, King Kong, El Planeta de los Simios, La m\u00e1quina del tiempo, Star Trek (serie y pelis de J.J. Abrams), Star Wars, entre otros. Adem\u00e1s, si has hecho algo de cine independiente, te identificar\u00e1s con alguna que otra cosa.\n\nYa s\u00e9 que dije que el juego es corto, pero puede que eso le juegue a favor (vamos, que en la Nes, Sega o SNES nos pas\u00e1bamos los juegos en un par de horitas y no nos quej\u00e1bamos). A lo largo de todas sus horas, el juego arroja suficiente variedad como para sentirse fresco. Los distintos actos tienen est\u00e9ticas muy diferentes y los enemigos son originales y contin\u00faan introduciendo nuevos hasta el final, literalmente. Si bien mec\u00e1nicamente no se distinguen demasiado unos de otros, es entretenido y agradable ver con qu\u00e9 se salen; tenemos desde los cl\u00e1sicos insectos gigantes hasta hombres reptil a lo Star Trek, perros aspiradora y mucho m\u00e1s.\n\nDijimos que acci\u00f3n es parte del baile, as\u00ed que bien, \u00bfqu\u00e9 hay de las armas? \u00bfC\u00f3mo es mi arsenal para enfrentar esta torre de monstruos? Te estar\u00e1s perguntando. Pues contamos con dos tipos de armas: mel\u00e9 y de rango. Lamentablemente las armas de mel\u00e9 se sienets muy parecidas entre s\u00ed. Con todas damos un par de golpes o cargamos un ataque m\u00e1s fuerte que podemos soltar en tierra o en el aire. No hay grandes combos ni nada parecido, tampoco propiedades que requieran usar una u otra dependiendo de la situaci\u00f3n. No obstante, es en las pistolas donde encontramos las cosas interesantes, ah\u00ed s\u00ed cada una trae algo diferente; y aunque bien puedes usar una sola durante toda la aventura, no est\u00e1 de m\u00e1s probarlas todas y divertirte con ellas. Ver\u00e1s desde una rasuradora hasta una rana escupe moscas, u otras cosas no aptas para menores que no mencionaremos aqu\u00ed.\n\nEl sistema de niveles con el que mejoras a los personajes (s\u00ed, tenemos tres, pero todos comparten los mismos niveles y s\u00f3lo se diferencian en el dise\u00f1o y dos poderes especiales) es bastante interesante; en lugar de ir con la cl\u00e1sica experiencia que tantos juegos implementan, The Deadly Tower of Monster ha atado el progreso de los personajes a sus achievements, as\u00ed que te ver\u00e1s sac\u00e1ndolos para subir esos nivelcillos. Por cada achievement conseguido, recibir\u00e1s un punto de habilidad (skill point) que podr\u00e1s usar para elegir un entre 3 mejoras en cada nivel, para un total de 24.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, una vez que termines el juego (o antes, si quieres), puedes taclear el modo survival que promete sacar unas horitas m\u00e1s de entretenimiento. Este modo apenas y lo he provado, pero parece ser desafiante. Te arrojas a una arena y tienes que superar la ola de enemigos de turno. Entre ola y ola, regresas a una base en la que puedes comprar las armas y poderes que consigues durante el juego para hacer frente a las siguientes y m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles tandas.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, puede que te lleves una peque\u00f1a sorpresa con la historia, al menos yo definitivamente no esperaba lo que era.\n\n\nEntonces...\n\nPROS:\n\n- Una est\u00e9tica y dise\u00f1o geniales\n\n- Tramos de plataforma entretenidos\n\n- Comedia\n\n- Caceria de \u00edtems y cosas por toda la torre, buscando ingeniosamente\n\n- Chistosa variedad de enemigos\n\n- Modo survival\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n- Corto\n\n- F\u00e1cil\n\n- Local coop (misma computadora)\n\n- M\u00fasica poco destacable\n\nCONTRAS:\n\n- Combate algo repetitivo\n\n- Las armas mel\u00e9 se sienten iguales\n\n- Jefes mec\u00e1nicamente simplotes y nada desafiantes\n\n\nEspera a encontrarlo en oferta.

I believe I played for ten hours, and I didn't play a single other game until I finished this one. Moreover, I will most definitely be revisiting it soon.\n\nUsually, when game journalists say a game has a unique story, they're just compensating for crappy gameplay and trying to elevate games to the \"true artform\" they wish it to be (even though every game is already clearly art). This game has it all: a story that is unheard of in the gaming universe, humor to please you endlessly, fantastic gameplay that ramps up in difficulty when you're ready, 24 different and upgradeable weapons, and a look that you just won't find anywhere else.\n\nBasically, you are playing through a 1950's B-level sci-fi movie (with absolutely hilarious and true-to-life \"commentary\" from the \"driector\" nd his \"interviewer\" throughout every scene and even the menus, as if the game is actually a DVD of the \"movie\" through which you're playing), and the sheer creativity in what they have done with the concept is astounding.  Some of your powers are ever based on the fact that it is, in fact, a B-level sci-fi movie. You also have three unique characters you can play as at any time. You have multiple special powers, some unique to their characters and required to solve puzzles to get pieces for upgrading your equipment.\n\nThe game also has extremely enjoyable and organic-to-the-setting side-missions that you can complete for the chance to upgrade your skills and abilities. It forces you to try new tactics to defeat enemies and search every nook and cranny of the eminently treversible terrain to find all the game's secrets.\n\nUltimately, I give this game my highest recommendation. I've prbably bought over 400 games in my life, and I've only ever finished maybe less than a dozen of them. Not only did I finish this one, but I did it without playing any other game until I completed it!\n\nYou simply must get this game. It has everything: combat, puzzles, exploration, and everything else you expect from a triple-A game, but with the most unique aesthetic and story I have ever seen. Try it now, and reward the developers by buying it at full price (I don't know if I've ever said that before....)!", "timestamp_created": 1493950800, "timestamp_updated": 1493978673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759503", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31547029": {"recommendationid": "31547029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051747648", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493926786}, "language": "english", "review": "Good humor, not awesome, but has its moments.

This game never takes itself seriously--in fact the most serious moment of the game is the very beginning and from there the game gets less and less serious until you reach the ending, which I found to be rather dissapointing, but at the same time absolutely genious.

Bare in mind, however, that when I say science fiction, I mean the totally kooky, unbelievable sci-fi of yesteryear. The story, set pieces, characters, enemies, all of it will put a smile on your face as you shoot, zap, whip, bash, or whatever else you want to do through the game and up the tower. \n\n-Gameplay-\n The Deadly Tower of Monsters is a solid piece. It is your standard 2.5D shooter, but this game is really polished. One of my favorite parts of this game is you can tell how much the team cared when they were making it. There is a large variety of both projectile and melee weapons to become aquianted with, all of them suited to one's own playstyle. The variety is SO different that I guarantee you can find something that suits your taste. I kept getting new weapons but there was a certain foursome of weapons that I would keep going back to throughout the game because of the balance I found between them. The three-character system also works suprisingly well, and I enjoyed each of the characters. The biggest (and pretty much only) complaint I have is the bloody awful checkpoint system. Its a unique system in that it serves both as checkpoints and as teleport locations if you want to go back down and explore the tower a bit. However, either the checkpoints need to happen a bit more often or there needs to be an independent checkpoint system for boss battles. MULTIPLE times I found myself dying pretty far after I had beaten the boss on a platform and being reset at a checkpoint where I had not beaten them yet, which is INCREDIBLY frustrating after it happens a few times.\n\n-Story-\nThe story in this game is really quite good. Don't get into this game expecting a narrative and a coherent plot. This game is much more about breaking the fourth wall as much as possible and poking merciless fun at every trope it can find from low budget science fiction to video games. The characters are all solid, but I would highly recommend the robot - as he is by far my favorite. My least favorite would have to be Dick Starspeed. I'm not sure why that is, I just never really got into playing as that character unless I had to.\n\n-Music-\nThe music in this game is absolutely superb. All of the instruments sound clear, but the traditional science fiction soundtrack absolutely kills it. The iconic wail and warble is all there, and often times it sounds like you're watching an old episode of Star Trek. The developers absolutely NAILED the soundtrack.\n\n-Art Direction-\nAbsolutely fabulous looking game. I can't really rave enough about how unique and interesting this game looks. The classic sci-fi theme is held up throughout - ranging from crocodile-headed flying men (held up by strings no less) to stop motion dinosaurs to a subtle but nice VHS effect on the screen throughout the game. \n\n\n-Overall Quality-\nThis game is lovingly put together. All of the pieces work in a way that makes this game a really solid experience to play through. The campaign is not very long at all, but the replayability factor is there. I played through the main game in about 6 hours. However, I have by no means seen and collected everything in the game, and I would recommend you do that if you want the full and complete experience.\n\n\n-Summary-\nIn summary, I would highly recommend this game to both someone who is a huge fan of science fiction as well as the average gamer who is looking for a solid all-around 2.5D platformer to play with for a few hours. The campaign does not take very long, but the extra length in the game comes from searching around for collectibles and grabbing achievements. I would recommend this game at full price but I would absolutely INSIST you buy it if it was on sale. Too good to pass up.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nVisuals: 10/10\nAudio: 10/10\nOverall: 9/10\n\n\nSHAMELESS PLUG: Check out other reviews of movies, video games, and a whole bunch of other stuff on my website.", "timestamp_created": 1487034349, "timestamp_updated": 1487549626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29909950": {"recommendationid": "29909950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008585469", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486843935}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gra to typowy RPG , Ktora przenosi nas do lat 60 gdzie w kinie kiczowate akcje potworow na sznurkach i przebranych ludzi kiedys straszylo ^^ Twoim zadaniem jest wspiac sie jak najwyzej, rozwalic kazdego co ci stanie na drodze i stac sie Super Hero !

Il tutto tra fondali di cartone, ufo fatti con piatti da torta, scenari coi fili e cos\u00ec via. Il bello di [i]Deadly Tower[/i] per\u00f2 \u00e8 proprio che sono questi i nemici, i fondali, le astronavi e il nostro eroe, Pipino Starspeed, \u00e8 il classico eroe monolitico bidimensionale. Ad accompagnarlo nella sua avventura (costellata da innumerevoli buchi di trama - assolutamente [i]voluti[/i]) troviamo la bella Scarlet Nova, altrettanto bidimensionale quanto Pipino, e il robot... Robot! - una scopiazzatura del ben pi\u00f9 famoso Robbie de [i]Il Pianeta Proibito[/i]. Obiettivo dei nostri eroi, sconfiggere il malvagio imperatore e il suo scienziato pazzo, che hanno invaso il pacifico pianeta di Gravoria per rubarvi le sue ricchezze. Tutto raccontato dalla viva voce del \"regista\" di questo capolavoro del cinema, Dan Smith, che impegnato a realizzare il commento audio del DVD del suo film in compagnia dello scazzatissimo tecnico audio Patrick, racconta aneddoti divertenti e freddure per nascondere i difetti del suo \"film\" e la sua cialtroneria.\n\nCome si pu\u00f2 vedere, il plot riflette esattamente i clich\u00e9 del cinema di fantascienza ai suoi albori, e proprio in tutti questi piccoli omaggi pi\u00f9 o meno velati a questo cinema che viene progressivamente rivalutato sta la vera forza di questa operazione: appassionati pi\u00f9 o meno esperti si divertiranno a trovare quella tale citazione o quel particolare omaggio, il tutto corredato da una giocabilit\u00e0 molto divertente e mai stancante. Ognuno dei nostri tre eroi ha dei poteri speciali che diventano particolarmente utili nel superare determinate sezioni di gioco - tuttavia proprio questa parte risulta meno sviluppata, limitando l'utilizzo di questi poteri a poche, piccole sezioni - oltre che un vasto campionario di armi pi\u00f9 o meno improbabili (un rasoio elettrico stile shotgun laser, una spada laser aggiornabile al \"lato oscuro\" e cos\u00ec via) molto divertenti da usare. I nemici sono rielaborazioni tristanzuole dei pi\u00f9 scontati classici dell'arrangiarsi: tizi in costumi da scimmia, lumaconi e dinosauri in stop-motion, insetti che volano su fili trasparenti e tizi con maschere da mosca di cartapesta.\n\nIl gioco forse sfugge ad una difficolt\u00e0 particolarmente elevata, e non \u00e8 molto lungo (completarlo con tutti gli achievement non prende pi\u00f9 di 5 o 6 ore), perci\u00f2 forse il prezzo pieno di 15\u20ac \u00e8 un po' eccessivo, ma scontato a meno di 10\u20ac \u00e8 un acquisto quasi obbligato per un piccolo gioellino indipendente veramente scoppiettante e coloratissimo.

Het spel doet zijn best om je de illusie te geven dat je naar de DVD uitgave van een oude B-film uit de jaren 50 zit te kijken, inclusief commentaar van de regisseur en een jonge assistent. Monsters zien eruit als acteurs in een kostuum, je ziet sommige monsters aan touwtjes hangen en sommige monsters bewegen alsof ze met stop motion tot leven zijn gebracht.\nTDToM probeert een hoop elementen te combineren en dat werkt slechts gedeeltelijk. Het is allemaal net goed genoeg om vermakelijk te zijn, maar het is ook duidelijk dat er veel meer uit gehaald had kunnen worden. Je hebt gedurende het spel de keuze uit drie personages. Deze spelen echter voor het overgrote deel exact hetzelfde, alleen heeft ieder personage een aantal vaardigheden die nodig zijn om specifieke puzzels op te lossen. Zo kan Dick rotsblokken opblazen, Robot kan de tijd vertragen en Scarlet kan hard rennen. Maar verder gebruiken ze dezelfde acht schietwapens en acht slagwapens. Je kunt van beide soorten slechts twee wapens bij je hebben en sommige wapens zijn effectief tegen bepaalde tegenstanders en ineffectief tegen andere, dus je moet opletten dat je een goede mix van wapens meeneemt. Jammer genoeg zijn veel wapens onderling inwisselbaar en het spel geeft alleen een vage omschrijving, dus je moet zelf uitzoeken welke wapens wanneer nuttig zijn. Om van personage te wisselen, moet je in een slaapcabine stappen, wat soms betekent dat je een stuk moet omlopen enkel en alleen om langs een bepaalde puzzel of obstakel te komen. Opwaarderen van wapens gebeurt bij een terminal en het wisselen van wapens bij een andere terminal. Dit is wat omslachtig, maar gelukkig zijn er veel terminals en slaapcabines verspreid door het spel.\nVerder ontsluit je gedurende het spel teleportatieplatformen en je kunt met een druk op de knop naar ontgrendelde platformen reizen. Hierdoor kun je gelukkig snel terug naar een eerder gedeelte van het spel als je een nieuwe vaardigheid wil gebruiken om verzamelvoorwerpen te pakken die eerder onbereikbaar waren.\nZoals de naam van het spel al aangeeft, beklim je een hoge toren en je moet regelmatig omlaag mikken om tegenstanders neer te schieten. Er is ook een vaardighedenboom die je kunt ontsluiten door achievements te behalen, bijvoorbeeld door bepaalde voorwerpen te verzamelen, een bepaalde tegenstander met een bepaald wapen verslaan, bovenop 10 vijanden springen enzovoorts. In deze vaardighedenboom kun je de personages sterker maken door uit verschillende opwaarderingen te kiezen (bijv. 5% sterkere schietwapens, 5% meer gezondheid enzovoorts). Je vindt ook gekleurde tandwielen die je kunt gebruiken om de wapens op te waarderen. Sommige tandwielen zijn goed verstopt of vereisen een specifieke vaardigheid van een van de drie personages.\nAl met al is het spel tot nu toe leuker dan ik had verwacht na het lezen van een aantal kritische reviews. Vergeleken met andere spellen uit dit genre (bijvoorbeeld Headlander) blinkt TDToM nergens echt in uit. Maar het weet voldoende afwisseling te bieden om niet te gaan vervelen.", "timestamp_created": 1486594848, "timestamp_updated": 1486594848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29789633": {"recommendationid": "29789633", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993472075", "num_games_owned": 789, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486935224}, "language": "german", "review": "englisch sollte man verstehen. ansonsten seeehr witzig mit vielen bez\u00fcgen auf alte filme/filmtechniken.\n\nkann ich nur empfehlen!", "timestamp_created": 1486588343, "timestamp_updated": 1511379939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485589", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29787383": {"recommendationid": "29787383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093734697", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486627667}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u4e00\u822c\uff0cbug\u592a\u591a\u4e86\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u5361\u5899\u89d2\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u8fdb\u5165\u6e38\u620f\u7adf\u7136\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528wasd\u54c8\u54c8\u3002\u64cd\u4ed6\u5988\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5546", "timestamp_created": 1486580388, "timestamp_updated": 1486626901, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492558", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29786216": {"recommendationid": "29786216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017271295", "num_games_owned": 841, "num_reviews": 304, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486574579}, "language": "french", "review": "(Sur)jouant \u00e0 fond la carte du jeu-nanar, des bouts de ficelles, du kitsh et de la parodie, The Deadly Tower of Monsters mise tout sur son concept, objectivement original et r\u00e9jouissant, en oubliant qu'au-del\u00e0 de la blague, il y a un jeu vid\u00e9o.\n\nIl faut dire que le parti pris humoristique peine \u00e0 masquer la pauvret\u00e9 un peu trop flagrante du gameplay et de l'\u00e9criture.

Although checking the developer, I saw that they had made a couple of other games I really enjoyed, Zeno Clash 1 and 2 which are fantastic. \n\nTDToM has got a lot of polish and everything looks and feels great. There's a lot of variety in the gameplay and combat and the level design is very innovative. Since you are climbing a giant tower, at any time you can just jump over the side and plummet through the air in freefall, picking up secrets and diving through rings as you fall. Then when you hit the bottom, just teleport back up to where you jumped from. Sometimes you'll want to backtrack to access previously locked areas with a new tool or weapon - no problem, just leap over the side and hurtle towards the general direction of where you want to end up. \n\nThe humor is pretty clever and will make you smile as you hear references to old and modern movies.

watched the trailer. Basically it's a parody of the old sci fi/monster flicks of the 50's and 60's, with their camp stories and dodgy special effects. In fact, the game actually recreates the stop motion style animation from those old films. The effect is actually pretty good and like a lot of other stuff, really sells the premise. I normally hate effects like film grain in my games, but with this title, it's just such a part of the atmospere they are aiming for that for once I kept it on. Another amusing feature is that the whole game is themed as a commentary by the director being recorded in a studio for the upcoming release of the movie on DVD. It's pretty funny stuff and the director himself is an over the top caricature of the cliche egomaniacal self deluded Hollywood mogul. It's all pretty corny but it fits the vibe and made me smile.\n\nI just wish the game behind everything was as good as the premise. Its pretty much standard action adventure fare. You'll collect different weapons, collect different coloured cogs with which to upgrade those weapons. You'll solved side missions that will get you skill points that you can use to upgrade basic character stats like energy and health regeneration. You'll do some basic platforming and beat the crap out of a whole ton of monsters. There are some basic puzzles, some of which can only be solved by one of the three playable characters/ None of it is actually bad, its just not anything you haven't done in  other games before. I think it just feels like more of a shame because the premise begs for a more solid gameplay experience. It never really rises above okay. Probably the best and most unique part of it is climbing the tower itself. The tower really goes way way up, and you can jump off and pretty much fall all the way off back to the ground levels where you started without seeing a single loading screen (And to get some secrets, you will have to). This really adds to the tower's sense of scale and is definitely a highlight.\n\nI do recommend this game if you dig the theme.

I did laugh when he called a suropod a stegosaur. Some of the level design can be tedious and there is not much for the game outside of combat and the story.

It's a bit too over-the-top at times (the director can get a little annoying with his commentary) but overall this is quite an enjoyable action game.  The B-grade sci-fi movie trope is a lot of fun, and while the jokes are juvenile at times, it wasn't enough to make me dislike the game; But do expect to groan loudly at the purile humor.\n\nI very much enjoyed the ability to upgrade weapons and character traits, and while most of the powers were underutilized (most of the time being used as plot-drivers, ie: Need ability X to cross here), they were varied enough to give you some relief from using the same tactics over and over.  It was possible to mix it up and that's fun.\n\nThe vertical component to this game coupled with the open-world-like map feels great and helps the game from wearing out its welcome too soon.  Back tracking is necessary if you want to unlock everything, but a liberal spread of teleporters and the ability to teleport back to a ledge you fell off of makes this fairly painless.\n\nThe downside?  The camera.  You have no control over it and at times it feels like the camera is out to get you.   The first problem is that it can pick strange angles to view the action, but mostly what got to me is how slow it transients when you are falling.  For example, some of the jumps required strict timing, and when you leap into the air and the camera sort of pauses before adjusting -- and does so at a leisurely pace -- it would mean I'd miss something or crash into a pipe or ledge I had no idea was there.  This becomes particularly frustrating when you're looking for secrets;  I spent most of my time just trying to trick the camera into showing me something so I could learn if it held a secret or not.\n\nThe game also feels a little too easy, but the developers have a Hard Mode (I recommend enabling if it you're a vet of twin-stick action games like this) and a Survival Mode to offset that.\n\nA very solid game worth about 10 hours of play, with an enjoyable tongue-and-cheek subject matter and enough hidden secrets to make you want to take your time and really get to know the world.

It's an absolute delight!\n\nThe Deadly Tower of Monsters is a third-person action game based on the styles of early b-movie sci-fi. The gameplay is in fact meant to be a tape of one of those early films that is now being narrated over by the Director for an audiotrack on some 'upcoming DVD release'. This means there are regular gags, motifs, and dialogue based on the assumption that your gameplay is all part of some 1950's movie set. It's humorous and engaging.\n\nThe campaign focuses mostly on climbing the Deadly Tower of Monsters! which is an insanely tall tower reaching from sea-level up into space. Each section of the tower is themed after a different sub-genre of b-grade sci-fi, and one of the things I appreciated most was how thorough the game was with its art direction. The game touches on a lot of instantly recognizable genres with instantly recognizable costumes, weapons, and creatures/enemies.\n\nThe game is on the fence for me as to whether it holds much replay value in the campaign. The gameplay is short, but it's an appropriate length for the simple combat mechanics. There is an accompanying survival mode and a set of non-trivial but easily attainable achievements which will likely keep your attention for a short while after the campaign.\n\nAs a minor criticism, the weapon system, while just as beautiful and humorous as the rest of the game, is mostly superficial. There are some different effects of using different weapons, but for the most part there are only two weapon types and the late game weapons are only moderately more deadly than the early game versions. This becomes most obvious in survival mode. The weapon system however does incentivize you to explore the map for upgrade parts, and in that regard is a wise design decision as it introduces the player to more of the map, but it does little to make combat more interesting.\n\nMany of the negative reviews are critical of the 'Director Commentary'. I personally found it an entertaining and welcome edition to the game. I felt that it added a lot of flavor to the milieu. The humor is very tongue-in-cheek though, which I appreciate is not everyone's cup of tea.\n\nDo I recommend The Tower of Deadly Monsters?

Dunque ci troveremo catapultati in un mondo fittizio fatto di alberi di plastica e di creature riprese in stop motion nel quale ci muoveremo cercando di venire a capo della situazione. Come il regista stesso dice, la forza del titolo sta soprattutto nell'azione, infatti la storia del gioco \u00e8 sostanzialmente un sottofondo, non la fa mai da padrona (tranne forse nell'ultima parte), tuttavia non se ne sente n\u00e9 la mancanza n\u00e9 una vera necessit\u00e0.\nFondamentalmente il gioco lo si potrebbe definire una sorta di hack 'n' slash atipico con elementi platform e da top-down shooter, dove la frenesia viene in larga parte attenuata per lasciare un respirio pi\u00f9 ampio all'espolorazione degli ambienti, la quale, come il nome stesso lascia presagire, avviene soprattutto verticalmente.\nL'esperienza di gioco \u00e8 sostanzialmente un grosso omaggio al cinema fantascientifico dei decenni passati, senza disdegnare anche citazioni e riferimenti ai B-movie pi\u00f9 famosi divenuti cult nel corso degli anni, il tutto condito dal simpatico umorismo del regista che ci accompagner\u00e0 lungo tutta l'opera.\n\nIl titolo non \u00e8 affatto pesante, il gioco scorre liscio e l'avventura procede fluida e senza intoppi di sorta. In s\u00e9, il tutto \u00e8 semplice sia nel gameplay che nella difficolt\u00e0, infatti nemmeno la modalit\u00e0 Hard \u00e8 poi davvero cos\u00ec difficile, inoltre l'esperienza di gioco, nonostante la gi\u00e0 citata semplicit\u00e0, risulta piacevolmente variata.\nProbabilmente la giocabilit\u00e0 del titolo si adatta meglio ad un gamepad piuttosto che alla combinazione di mouse e tastiera che ho usato per cimentarmi con l'avventura, tuttavia, devo comunque ammettere che non ho avuto particolari problemi una volta fatta l'abitudine al sistema di movimento e ai vari tasti.\n\nIl gioco \u00e8, appunto, molto bello e lo consiglierei senza troppi indugi, tuttavia non \u00e8 esente da difetti, il titolo infatti presenta due pecche in particolare, la prima, e pi\u00f9 grave, \u00e8 la telecamera di gioco che \u00e8 perlopi\u00f9 dinamicamente controllata dal sistema (il giocatore pu\u00f2 a malapena aggiustarne un po' l'angolazione) e in diverse situazioni non \u00e8 ben gestita e fa storcere il naso spostando l'inquadratura in modo poco amichevole nei confronti del giocatore, talvolta volutamente, e ci sta, talaltra proprio casualmente e l\u00ec, pur trattandosi di una realt\u00e0 che si fa pi\u00f9 frequente in alcuni punti dell'avventura rispetto ad altri (grossomodo tre quarti del gioco, per esempio, \u00e8 pi\u00f9 evidente) da abbastanza fastidio.\nLa seconda pecca, sicuramente meno grave della prima, ma comuque fastidiosa, consiste proprio nei commenti del regista o, meglio, nei sottotitoli dei commenti del regista, perch\u00e9 purtroppo il gioco non dispone di un doppiaggio in italiano e l'espediente principe su cui si basa il titolo fa leva proprio sul fatto che il regista del film commenti quanto accade a schermo mentre noi giochiamo, pertanto, o si ha una conoscenza tale dell'inglese da poterlo ascoltare, capire e contestualizzare mentre si \u00e8 concentrati sull'azione di gioco, oppure si sar\u00e0 costretti o a prendere un po' di botte (in genere non grave, per carit\u00e0) per leggere i sottotitli o a glissare sugli stessi perdensodi cos\u00ec i divertenti retroscena del film, il che sarebbe un peccato visto che la pecualirit\u00e0 del gioco \u00e8 proprio quella.\nParlando di traduzioni, per quanto sia una bella citazione sia tardo altomedievale che tolkieniana, tradurre il nome del protagonista, in questo caso da Dick * a Pipino, non \u00e8 stata necessariamente una genialata, anche se, in fin dei conti, l'effetto, visto il disuso del nome proprio in questione, \u00e8 coerente con lo spirito umoristico del titolo, e in questo contesto pu\u00f2 ancora andar bene, ma, ad esempio, tradurre Dick * Tracy in Pipino Tracy sarebbe, in altri termini, quantomeno ridicolo :D\n\nInoltre, il gioco, per quanto dichiaratamente non pensato per essa, dispone anche di una modali\u00e0 co-op locale fino a 4 giocatori, nella quale il giocatore 1 \u00e8 il protagonista e viene seguito dalla telecamera, che fornisce una divertente alternativa alla modalit\u00e0 di gioco single player, in pi\u00f9 \u00e8 disponibile una modalit\u00e0 Survival, nella quale il giocatore deve affrontare ondate di nemici vieppi\u00f9 numerose e difficili all'interno di un'arena, guadagnando oro per acquistare, nell'hub tra un match e l'altro, le armi e abilit\u00e0 del gioco per poter sopravvivere meglio e proseguire con le ondate.\n\n* Edit del 16.10.2017: Ho notato soltanto ora che Steam ha infelicemente censurato l'equivoco nome proprio del nostro eroe e del grintoso poliziotto con l'impermeabile giallo degli anni '30.", "timestamp_created": 1482969606, "timestamp_updated": 1508163227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28684935": {"recommendationid": "28684935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325723431", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483374393}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7cbe\u5f69\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1482782842, "timestamp_updated": 1482871451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28632241": {"recommendationid": "28632241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066061894", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482672345}, "language": "english", "review": "Some games are bad, some games are good, some are so good you just feel that you have to tell everyone around about them. Especially about such games like DToM which are unfairly unknown to the wide audience.\n\nThe Deadly Tower of Monsters is one of my best purchases in Steam in all times.\n\nIt's hard to describe its genre: it's a platformer + hack'n'slash + metroidvania. Set in a sci-fi B-movies setting with odd but amusing plot. But the most brilliant thing in this game is its concept:\n\nthere is a high, INSANELY HIGH tower, and you have to reach the top of it. It has different sections with unique enemies, challenges and platforms, but at the same time the whole tower is a single solid level. You can always go back without any loadings. At any time you can just jump off the tower and reach any section of it you've already passed (to unlock items and gain collectibles with the help of new characters and their skills) and then just teleport back and make your way to the top! It's just absolutely mind-blowing to watch how you start from the ground and end up in space among planets and stars. And you can always jump down, fly for couple of minutes and safely land with your jet pack. Absolutely genius idea!\n\nMusic is great, voice acting is awesome, retro movie style is provided with the help of different effects like film grain, claymation style animated monsters... everything to make you feel you are in a 60's sci-fi B-movie.\n\nDo you know that feel of being bored in the last part of most games? When you just can't wait for the game to end? Playing DToM I didn't even notice how the time passed and suddenly the credits began. Finishing the game took me 7 hours and I really felt like I need more. Completing all achievements with the one from Survival Mode took me 2 hours more. By the way, achievem\u0435nts are rather easy to unlock and some of them are pretty fun.\n\nI would recommend this game to everyone. If you seek some fresh entertaining experience this is definitely your choice. You can even buy this game at full price to support the devs. I heard that this game was free in PSN and it's really sad that corporations like EA or Activision get tons of money for their generic AAA crap while really talented studios get nothing for their work. \n\nBravo, ACE Team!

So the entire artwork for the game uses the most modern technology to duplicate sub Harryhausen stop motion animation.  This is great fun and during the course the game there is barely a cliche from the genre that doesn't get thrown at you.  I can't over state how much the overall look and feel of the game adds to it.\n\n   Gameplay is good.  For most of the game it's not the most challenging so you rarely get stuck for very long anywhere in the game.  There's one of the later monsters that becomes tough because it is only vulnerable from the rear and nearly at the end there's a tricky platforming session where even the guy on the Let's Play video has to have three goes at it.  The layout is incredibly linear for the most part taking place on a narrow staircase leading up the tower but there is the odd location where I've had to backtrack to complete another section of the game to maintain onward progress.  Pay attention to instructions where given and if you find yourself at a rocket you can't activate retreat backwards to the large platform below you and go through another exit to find one of the best series of scenes in the game.  You have the choice from part way through the game of playing as the rather wooden All American hero, the blonde bombshell Emeror's daughter, or the man in a suit style robot.  They have unique special abilities and sometimes you'll need to use one rather than the others to progress.\n\n   The inventory and upgrade screens don't have the visual imagination of the main game.\n\n   This game is as far from shovel ware as it's possible to get.  A clear labour of love the developers love for the genre they are parodying comes across in every scene and the director's commentary keeps the game fresh even when gameplay doesn't vary that much.  Definitely worth buying when it goes on sale.\n\nS.x.", "timestamp_created": 1480412673, "timestamp_updated": 1480412673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.384720", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28011958": {"recommendationid": "28011958", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973801195", "num_games_owned": 1088, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479927250}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Captains Log, 23.11.2016[/h1]\nSetting sail for uncharted waters!

And you should go for co-op if you can. Way more fun \u2013 like in every brawler out there.\n[/list]\n\nThe game is plainly and straightforward completely over the top silly and not to be taken seriously in any way. That does more good than bad. But it can hurt after too much time spent in-game. Be advised: Short sessions only! \n\n[h1]Look and feel and sound:  [/h1]\nThe Deadly Tower of Monsters has a nice clich\u00e9 soundtrack, [spoiler]wonky[/spoiler] space sound effects and [spoiler]alien[/spoiler] squish sounds. But most of all [spoiler]hilarious[/spoiler] voice acting. That is the bread and butter of this game. And of course, the seamless connection of thousands of [spoiler]trash[/spoiler] sci-fi movie jokes. The controls are ok. Jumping is a little off. Luckily the automatic camera adjustment works quite well. That could have ruined the game.\n\n[h1]Captain\u00b4s Orders: [/h1]\nIf you enjoy the humor of this game, you get a real treat for your ears and eyes. A lot of nodding into the direction of a multitude of movies from an era past takes place in The Deadly Tower of Monsters. If you don\u00b4t like aliens, flat jokes and trash sci-fi you really need to be a diehard beat\u00b4em up fan to enjoy this game. But if the above is answered with: Oh yes! Well\u2026.enjoy!  \n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\nCargo! Because I can enjoy the humor once in a while. The gameplay is repeating itself in a fashion that does not motivate me enough to really crave the next session though. Just a very entertaining time spent every so often \u2013 if that special mood hits me.\n\n[h1]For more Reviews visit  [url=https://captainnemoweb.wordpress.com/]CaptNemo's Log[/url][/h1]\n[h1]For Gameplay Videos and live streaming visit [url=https://www.twitch.tv/captn3mo]CaptN3mo's twitch channel[/url][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1480383257, "timestamp_updated": 1480384595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489362", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27991005": {"recommendationid": "27991005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094787570", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507144649}, "language": "german", "review": "Kurzweiliges Game , das mich durch sein fantastisches Retro-Design angesprochen hat!\nEs nimmt sich selbst und das ganze Genre ein wenig auf die Schippe, ist aber dabei sehr humorvoll, besonders der \"Regisseur\", der das Spiel aus dem Off gnadenlos witzig kommentiert!\nGrafik und Sound sind sind dem Thema angepasst, wer alte Science-Fiction Filme aus den 50ern und 60ern mag, ist hier genau richtig.\nDas einzige, \u00fcber das ich mich gefreut h\u00e4tte, w\u00e4re die M\u00f6glichkeit zum Hineinzoomen gewesen, um die Umgebung n\u00e4her zu betrachten.\nAber trotzdem gebe ich 10 von 10 Daumen, Sternen etc.pp f\u00fcr den Spass, den ich bei diesem Spiel habe !", "timestamp_created": 1480365418, "timestamp_updated": 1480365418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27981079": {"recommendationid": "27981079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127432421", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480128545}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440. \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0432\u0441\u044e", "timestamp_created": 1480359348, "timestamp_updated": 1480359348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27975074": {"recommendationid": "27975074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121475764", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466217841}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un muy buen juego, tiene una comedia muy acertada y realmente SI da la impresion de ser una pelicula antigua de clase B", "timestamp_created": 1480355681, "timestamp_updated": 1480355681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27942593": {"recommendationid": "27942593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302985955", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480335621}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u6709\u770b\u8001\u7247\u7684\u611f\u89c9", "timestamp_created": 1480335701, "timestamp_updated": 1480335701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27868992": {"recommendationid": "27868992", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977189354", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480272112}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent action gameplay with upgradeable weapons but the best part is the level design and humor.", "timestamp_created": 1480272448, "timestamp_updated": 1480272448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27867735": {"recommendationid": "27867735", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970736784", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462927116}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game nobody's playing.

Imagine Fred Willard being... Fred Willard. You know that role he plays in every movie? It sounds just like him and he acts just like him. That's basically the director commenting throughout the whole game. Some other reveiwers got tired of him, but I personally loved it, so your mileage may vary.\n\n3) The soundtrack is perfect. It sounds like it belongs in a Rick and Morty game.\n\n4) While reminiscent of retro movies (and brilliantly so), I also got a very strong retro platformer vibe from it. The game frequently reminded me of Banjo Kazooie. It pushed a LOT of nostalgia buttons for me.\n\n5) The style is beautiful and captures old low-production sci-fi thrillers to a T. It's extremely well done. Some monsters even move in claymation style, which I thought was a fine touch.\n\n6) Supports 1920x1080\n\nCons:\n\n1) The camera is a bit stiff. I wish you could pan it just a bit to see a little farther off the tower, since in this game you often have to jump off the tower you're climbing to get collectibles, so not being able to fully see where you're going gets to be a little tiresome. On the plus side, you can respawn up on the ledge you jumped from with a simple button press. And eventually you'll be able to see everything if you just go high enough in the tower, so it's not like the camera is barring you from getting that. \n\n2) This game is a lot of fun with a gamepad, but unfortunately they didn't see the need to make the buttons rebindable (keyboard users can rebind at will, don't worry). For some reason they didn't bind anything to the left trigger, which would be perfect for cycling through your specials. I'm not sure why they dropped the ball on that one. Otherwise the stock controls are pretty good, though of course rebinding buttons would be ideal.\n\n3) Can't change the mouse sensitivity. I have no idea why they didn't include this.\n\n4) The rings weren't programmed very well. It's hardly an issue, but it can take you out of the fun when you pass through a ring and it doesn't register.

This game gives you the opportunity.\n\nAltus/Ace have perfectly captured the environment and overall vibe of low budget science fiction movies in the middle of the last century's American Cinema.\n\nThe game is built using the Unreal Engine, so all the capability of it's graphical system is present.  However the presentation is different from typical unreal game, instead of a first-person or third-person view point, TDTOM is played from a third-person isometric perspective that can shift when needed.  (During jump/freefall sequences in particular)  \nI feel that's one of the game's strongest points..  it feels stunning visual sense, as you continue to play you really get a sense of the height of the Tower.  At any given moment the players jump off the ledge and free fall all the way to the surface.  There's a wonderful sense of vertical space to the game, I feel that the level design is imaginative and quirky.  Incorporates physical puzzles, a bit of platforming, and character specific obstacles.  The setting never left me bored.\nIn addition to an interesting overall design scheme, the game has two choices for post-processing of the overall visual aesthetic.  \"DVD or VHS\", I played the game using both.  In \"DVD\" the visuals are pristine and crisp, giving the player the feeling that they are looking down at a live diorama starring yester-years fantasy of the future.  In \"VHS\" It Coats the experience in a veneer of nostalgia, Conjuring the atmosphere of an old CRT monitor.\n\nThe dialogue and cutscenes in the game are somewhat minimal, but what is there absolutely nails the feeling of classic Sci-fi Cinema.   it brought to mind many late nights in my youth spent watching old movies about robots and aliens on my black-and-white television.\n\nThe opinions on the next subject mixed in different reviews, but I'm going to give you my take..  throughout the game there is a running \"director's commentary\".  I found it to be smart funny and well written, hitting the bullseye, sounding like a has been movie director from several decades ago.\nEven with a couple dozen deaths I didn't find it to be too repetitive or find myself wishing to turn it off.\n\nThe combat is fun and works well with a controller, not the highlight of the game, but enjoyable.  \n\nThere is a weapon and character upgrade system to help in your survivability toward the end of the game, along with unlockable special abilities, some of which are required to pass certain points in the progression.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that strays off the beaten path, and takes a detour to places strange and distant.

Ich war noch nie von einem Spiel so begeistert. Es ist sch\u00f6n gestaltet, das Gameplay wird nie langweilig und es bleibt auch f\u00fcr Errungenschaftsj\u00e4ger interessant. Es wurde nach einem ganz bestimmten Stil erschaffen. Dies betrifft auch den Soundtrack im Spiel. Zuerst einmal m\u00f6chte ich sagen, dass alle Sci-Fi-Fans hier genau richtig sind und sich auf eine nostalgisch gefilmte Atmosph\u00e4re freuen k\u00f6nnen. Auch R\u00fcckblenden und unterhaltsame Kommentare zu vielen verschiedenen Stellen sind vorhanden. In der Geschichte geht es darum, auf einem fernen Planeten im Weltall einen wahnsinnig hohen Turm zu erklimmen, w\u00e4hrend man der Geschichte eines damals gedrehten Films folgt. Dieser Turm wird nat\u00fcrlich in vielen verscheidenen Abschnitten unterteilt. Aber auch auf der Oberfl\u00e4che des Planeten gibt es einiges zu tun. Viele  verschiedene Gegner, Fallen und Jump \u00b4n Run - Hindernisse sind zu \u00fcberwinden, bis man zu den jeweiligen Endbossen gelangt, die es sich auf dieser Welt gem\u00fctlich gemacht haben. Das Spiel besitzt Humor und eine relativ gro\u00dfe Spielwelt, in der man sich jederzeit an viele verschiedene Punkte teleportieren kann. Die Grafik ist zudem sehr angenehm. Man kann als Astronaut, als Roboter und als eine Astronautin spielen, die viele verschiedene F\u00e4higkeiten und Waffen besitzen, die man je nach gesammelter Erfahrung immer wieder upgraden kann. Es w\u00e4re gut, sich erst mal ein Video zum Spiel anzuschauen, um ein ungef\u00e4hres Gef\u00fchl f\u00fcr das Spiel zu bekommen. F\u00fcr einen Preis von 14,99 Euro ist das ein sehr fairer Preis, da man neben der Geschichte auch \u00dcbungsmissionen auf verschiedenen Stufen \u00fcben kann. Ich kann das Spiel nur weiterempfehlen, wem es jetzt schon gef\u00e4llt.

The scenery looks cobbled together from cheap rubber and styrofoam. Enemies are either obviously stuntmen in suits or stop-motion effects. Many times, you can see the strings holding them up or the boom mic appearing in cutscenes. The plot is authentically nonsensical. Every facet of the aged Hollywood magic that made those films what they were is present, correct and jammed full of obscure references and Easter eggs; rarely has a game shown so much devotion and love to its subject matter\n\nNot quite as endearing, however, is the commentary track that runs throughout the playtime. The Deadly Tower of Monsters is presented as a DVD re-release with the director and his production assistant firing out quips every thirty seconds or so and while it's been exhaustively written and is fairly humorous on occasion, there is just far too much of it. A lot of times, the two voices will be jabbering on, fully subtitled, while you're trying to hack your way through a major battle or set-piece so you wind up missing what they're saying by way of trying to concentrate on not getting crushed by a plasticine brontosaur\n\nThere's a metric arseload of weapons to grab as you go, some far more useful than others, which can be upgraded with cogs that you find as you progress. Annoyingly, your loadout only allows for two ranged and two melee weapons at a time which wouldn't be a huge deal if the game didn't force you to find a terminal every time you wanted to change them. The worst part about this setup is that every time you pick up a new weapon, one of your current ones gets elbowed out of your inventory. Having fun with your ultra-powerful Tesla cannon? Not any more! Have this crappy flamethrower instead! Even better, have it while you're being literally SWARMED by waves of killer ants! \n\nThe character stat upgrade system is more pleasing and innovative. You're not rewarded with skill points by way of XP; rather, the game has you complete various objectives, many of which are completely optional. While you'll usually get one for killing a boss, taking down a giant dinosaur with a knife is all on you. It adds depth to a game that is, at times, lumbered with mechanics that sorely need it\n\nStill, The Deadly Tower of Monsters has more than enough style and bare bones playability to be worth a try, especially for fans of the genre it inhabits. It's a forgivingly easy game; you can make it through without a good deal of the upgrades available but as a love letter to those creaky, weird and wonderful pictures that entranced me as a kid, you'll find none better!\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1476048013, "timestamp_updated": 1476048013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25953981": {"recommendationid": "25953981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012311915", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476015664}, "language": "english", "review": "If you grab it for 5$ or less- it will be worth it.

Get this during a discount perhaps.\n\nSo, the game's goal is to climb the deadly tower of monsters. In order to do so you will have to fight, fight, fight and jump occasionally, but mostly fighting...and walking. The problem with the fighting is that it's awful...god awful. It's not a real brawler, it's not an ARPG, it's \"something\". You basically control your character from a weird elevated camera position that is 95% fixed (you can wiggle a bit, but that's it). The camera will screw you over multiple times I guarantee you. Apart from that you have a basic melee and ranged attack, as well as a dodge roll (block if you time it right) and a few special abilities, which are mostly pointless in combat. Doesn't sound THAT bad until you actually get to fighting stuff...let's just say the combat is not fleshed out at all. Hitboxes, attack animations, tells, etc. all of those need more work, especially the interaction with your character. It just feels jarred and as a consequence you'll take more damage than necessary. That in itself wouldn't even be the worst part, but some (most) attacks knock you flat on your ass and your character takes about 5 seconds to get back up...this happens quite frequently. I know you can dodge or block the attacks, but when it feels like that it's easier to do that in Dark Souls, which is pretty unforgiving in that regard, something went wrong.\n\nNot to mention that some checkpoints are pretty far away and if you die, everything respawns. Also, some enemies can also be (very slowly) defeated by special abilities. At least I didn't find a weapon that would make a dent in them. Extremely time consuming and annoying. Oh, also, fuck the targeting in this game...seriously.\n\nApart from the combat you will collect different coloured cogs, complete \"missions\" (aka achievements) and gather gold. Gold is left behind by enemies or in breakable objects...you will have way too much of that. I think I had 40,000 at the end and couldn't upgrade anything anymore, because...to do so you need said cogs, which you can find throughout the game. Not sure how many are in there, but I only got enough to upgrade about 4 weapons to maximum. Nowhere near enough to make use of the 12 or so weapons you actually get access to...especially later in the game. You also need gold to upgrade your character, but wait, you can ONLY do that once you get an achievement. That's right folks, you need to complete achievements to get more damage or more life or whatever. I got to level 11 of 30 or so. It's basically busy work if you want to get stronger. Maybe an interesting idea, but I don't like it.\n\nThe main reason you will be playing this game, however, is the story and writing. While the story is that of a C class sci fi movie you're actually replaying the movie with the director's commentary (and that of the audio technician), which can be pretty hilarious (do not turn VHS audio mode on or everything is completely garbled and sounds horrible). It does drag on at the end though, so even this isn't 100% great...\n\nGraphics are ok (activate VHS mode here for the real deal). And that's pretty much it.

Hace demasiado tiempo que no me divert\u00eda tanto con un juego, es muy gracioso gracias a que tiene un estilo muy particular que parodia pel\u00edculas de ciencia ficci\u00f3n antiguas c\u00f3mo \"El Planeta Prohibido\", que tuve la suerte de ver antes de jugar este juego. \nLa jugabilidad no es lo mejor del mundo, pero le queda bastante bien al juego, teniendo la posibilidad de correr, saltar, volar (aunque muy poco), disparar armas, golpear con armas cuerpo a cuerpo, rodar, bloquear ataques y usar algunas habilidades o armas especiales, incluso puedes s\u00f3lo saltar sobre los enemigos \"c\u00f3mo en los videojuegos\".\nSi bien el que el juego consista en escalar una torre parece una idea aburrida en un principio, el que se pueda f\u00e1cilmente teletransportar entre puntos, o simplemente lanzarte de la torre para llegar a zonas anteriores hace que el juego no se torne tedioso. Adem\u00e1s existen muchas zonas por explorar, algunas ocultas ya sea en la torre o fuera de ella, a las que no es f\u00e1cil acceder y tendr\u00e1s que lanzarte de alguna zona superior para llegar.\nMe sorprendi\u00f3 bastante la cantidad de armas, hay para todos los gustos y estas pueden irse mejorando. Adem\u00e1s existe un sistema de misiones secundarias con las que se puede subir de nivel al personaje y subirle vitalidad, da\u00f1o, entre otras opciones.\nCreo que es un juego excelente que, aunque corto, tiene mucho por explorar y adem\u00e1s un modo supervivencia que puede extender algo m\u00e1s la vida del juego.

Brief stints of black and white and stating that they couldn't afford color for that scene was hilarious.  The stop motion dinosaurs and the jittery stop motion of the King Kong-esque was beautiful.\n\nGame play was clearly geared for the console or game controller users and left us PC users having to jump to the key assignment option to see what the onscreen commands were refering to.

It seems fairly well polished, has a neat theme, a funny out of touch narrator, and a great sense of scale through its use of the vertical space since you are making your way up a gargantuan tower. TDToM does come with a handful of issues though that can be mitigated somewhat.\n\nThe combat is a mostly pleasurable experience. You have basic attacks, a strong attack (charged basic), a jumping attack, a roll/parry button, powers, and ranged attacks. One of the more satisfying things is how enemies will often harm each other. You can use it to your advantage with smart footwork and the ragdoll physics only make it better. It can feel simple at times, but nailing down the parry allows for some satisfying counters because it\u2019ll group parry. If 3 close projectiles come at me, I can reflect them all back and that works on multiple melee enemies too if they\u2019re close enough. Understanding the enemy\u2019s timing is the only hard part since there are plenty of enemy types.\n\nProgression occurs as a good pace. As you play, you\u2019ll discover a variety of weapons. They all have different properties from each other and are introduced in a way with the most powerful ones being acquired last. You can upgrade your favorites to make them even stronger and change them visually. Upgrades are acquired by spending cogs that you can find hidden around everywhere. These weapons are shared across the three different characters that you\u2019ll control one at a time. Each character also comes with a different power that they can use to overcome the occasional obstacle or overwhelm your opponents. Powers are unlocked over time and can be a chain lightning attack, a dash, a mine, an AoE push, and more.\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of the theme of this game and how it presents everything. The narrator is there speaking as if he were providing audio commentary on a DVD. Many of the enemies are presented as an old, cheesy sci-fi movie type of deal with guys in various monster suits, bats on strings, and really big bosses. You\u2019ll see some stop-motion animation going on with some of them too. The level design really lets you know how high you are the further you go into the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=775966953\n\nThe ending was uh\u2026 weird. Not sure how I feel about it. I guess it was okay.\n\nThe game does have some negatives that made me sigh a couple times. You need to touch a checkpoint in order to save progress which makes accidentally falling to your death taste real bad after finishing a big battle or completing a large platforming section. You can teleport to any previous checkpoints at will, so use that to your advantage and don\u2019t forget to touch one before doing something risky such as skydiving a long way down with little health. There are a few easily killable enemy types that can completely stunlock you into death if you\u2019re cornered by two of them. Stay in the open and away from the walls when you run into them and don\u2019t forget about your powers. Finally, there was one section that involved plenty of stairs that went by real slow. Thankfully, that was the only portion of the game that had me bored and it isn\u2019t too long.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for a good 5 hours or so of some quirky fun that was fairly consistent throughout, The Deadly Tower of Monsters would be a fine choice.

While that sounds rather easier than it is, you'll face all kinds of obstacles such as traps, mazes, bosses, puzzles, etc. A bit of everything which keeps the game moving along.\n\nIt's on sale right now so check it out!", "timestamp_created": 1475605463, "timestamp_updated": 1475605463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.385949", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25857926": {"recommendationid": "25857926", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970697203", "num_games_owned": 640, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458597122}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun with the hilarious film set narration. easily worth the price even when it's not on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1475604152, "timestamp_updated": 1475604152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453420", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25759489": {"recommendationid": "25759489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126975019", "num_games_owned": 893, "num_reviews": 236, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475115493}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a nice game, I really like the graphics and the setting, it's supposed to be some type of parody of horror movies from back in 50's, the entire game it's supposed to be the film, you have three characters to choose from all with different power ups that matter just in very specific situations, frankly i've just been using the robot because I like how he looks, the characters don't trascend into the custscenes, in them a specific character will be used, that being said, the cutscenes are ok, they're clearly are trying to be funny, mimic certain aspects of the \"b-movies\" from back then, all of this is perpetually narrated by the director of the supposed film that you're playing, I think this game it's enjoyable mostly if you know what the game it's referencing and making fun of, or rather, paying homage in it's entirety.\n\nAltho the other thing that keeps me playing it's it's simplistic gameplay mechanics, you can carry two regular melee weapons, and two ranged weapons, but there are tons of different weapons that you'll get by just progressing through the game, frankly the thing that kills me it's that there's an upgrade system for this weapons that's extremely difficult to use, mainly because the upgrades are only obtained through playing the game naturally, but mostly, through exploring and finding secrets, etc... The game it's so massive and convoluted tho, that finding this secrets proves to be a rather jarring chore, be that as it may tho the upgrades are incredible changing not only the damage outpout of your weapons but also changing how your weapons visually look, it's great.\n\nThe weapons are also pretty varied, you may have at one point a simitar, or a flamethrower, my favorite so far it's the whip, which it's great for staying on the outside while still hitting hordes of enemies.\n\nThe enemies are pretty varied, each and every single one of them satirizing some movie, or monster from the horror films from the 1950's, it's great, at one point you might be fighting some monkeys like in Planet of the Apes, or in another moment you might be fighting a fly with doctor's clothes similar to the original fly movie, the game even makes a reference to it by having the director saying it's paying an homage.\n\nIt's really a nice game, I do however recommend playing it with \"hard mode\" set to on, it made my experience immensley more enjoyable than when I started playing the game just without it. Plus it's not impossible, it's actually pretty balanced and engaging, I really like it.\n\nOverall I really think it's a very nice game, it's just a very fun game to play casually and the commentary from the director it's hilarious for the most part, it can get repetitive after a while, but overall it's been great, I really feel as if we need more games like this one that take risks while satirizing films in a decade in which films ironically enough took risks, not so much because of taking them as much as because the filmmakers were always experimenting with them.", "timestamp_created": 1475116474, "timestamp_updated": 1475116474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25584675": {"recommendationid": "25584675", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972941429", "num_games_owned": 621, "num_reviews": 167, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474276180}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm normally a fan of Ace Team's games, but this one felt a little uninspired to me.

[/b]\n\nThe Deadly Tower of Monsters is a wonderful subversion of pulp sci fi movies of yore.\n\n\nThe game is narrated by the (fictional) director of the (fictional) movie, The Deadly Tower of Monsters. Without a doubt, the strwength of this game, and the main reason to play it, is the tremendous ambiance and tone. The devs clearly have a strong affinity for cheesy, B-movie sci fi and boy does it show. From the VCR film grain to the not so subtle strings attached over pterodactyls, this game nails it\u2019s aesthetic and hits it out of the park. It has cheesy one liners, an evil doctor, and a main hero named Dick Starspeed. What more could you want?!\n\n\nAs far as the game itself plays, it\u2019s perfectly serviceable, if nothing special. It\u2019s your standard fare third person action game where you get two melee weapons and two guns.  Your arsenal is varied enough that it keeps the game fresh but there are clearly ones that you should use (the flamethrower). In addition, there is a sizeable amount of enemies that you encounter each with increasing difficulty as you ascend the deadly tower. My main gripe would have to be the checkpoint system, it\u2019s not great. Many times I was set back two or three confrontations earlier that led to somewhat tedious moments. Thankfully, this didn\u2019t happen enough that it severely hampered my experience but it was definitely annoying.\n\n\n\nThe Deadly Tower of Monsters is a blast to play if you have any affinity towards The Twighlight Zone or old sci fi movies. This alone carries the game through its 5 hour runtime. If you have no connection to that setting, then the game may be a bit dull for you, however.

The movie's director keeps interjecting his own stream of hilarious banter, too.\n\nWeapons are aplenty; you can have two melee and two projectile weapons on you at all times.

The style and presentation doesn't lack at any point, the design is wonderful and charming if you enjoy old Sci-Fi movies.  Fight everything from dinosaurs to human-fly clones to robotic chimps.  You wield a melee and ranged weapons, along with special powers, some of which are shared and some are unique to the 3 characters you can swap out to at swap stations. Sometimes you need these special powers to continue climbing the tower or to get collectibles, but it isn't overplayed. \n\nThe game isn't short, but it isn't long and dragging out. Speaking of climbing the tower, when I bought it and when you begin, you start climbing and it's like ok cool we're climbing this tower. But at a certain point you're just like damn, I'm climbing so far! And eventually you fall, or you get curious and jump off, and you just keep falling! That was a perfect moment for me when I first skydived down the tower all the way to my death(because I forgot to save my jetpack fuel to slow the fall).  It never got old skydiving and enjoying the scale of the game.  It really pulls off the verticality well, the fighting isn't hard but it isn't an easy tedious task, the different weapons bring a little bit of variety to combat, the presentation is great, the music is so fun and on-point, the whole climb feels tense and interesting. I'm a fan of this studio's games, but I was still blown-away by how much I enjoyed  The Deadly Tower of Monsters.

While you have some parry mechanics, the enemies do so little damage that you don't even bother to parry unless it is for the achievement, and at the same time, you do so much damage that you really can't see much difference from one weapon to other at all as most of them one hit kill mobs. \n\nI think the most fun comes from the exploration part, finding hidden areas of the tower and the skydiving hoops/targets, as combat gets boring fast.\n\nIn the end you will stay for the funny dialogues and novel retro visuals.

En fait, le jeu se pr\u00e9sente comme le commentaire audio de la VHS d'un film de s\u00e9rie Z. Tout le long de l'aventure, le r\u00e9alisateur commentera l'action et nous donnera des d\u00e9tails sur l'\u00e9criture du film, les difficult\u00e9s du tournage ou la pauvret\u00e9 des effets sp\u00e9ciaux. Les seuls dupes de l'histoire sont les personnages qui vivent leur aventure sans savoir que c'est un script, un peu comme le Jack Slater du film Last Action Hero.\n \nOn a \u00e0 notre disposition trois personnages : un homme, une femme et un robot. Pour passer de l'un \u00e0 l'autre, on doit utiliser une cabine et choisir son personnage. Dans 90% des cas, le choix n'a pas de r\u00e9elle importance : les personnages partagent les m\u00eames upgrades et conservent leur choix d'armes. Personnellement, j'ai surtout jou\u00e9 avec le robot, vu que j'aime bien les robots. Ils ont cependant quelques aptitudes particuli\u00e8res qui, dans de rares cas, obligeront \u00e0 choisir l'homme, le robot ou la femme pour franchir telle barri\u00e8re, tel obstacle. Le trio peut \u00e9galement am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences en gagnant des niveaux.\n \nOn a le droit de porter quatre armes simultan\u00e9ment : deux armes \u00e0 distance (laser, lance-flammes, lance-roquettes...) et deux armes de m\u00eal\u00e9e (masse, fouet, \u00e9p\u00e9e Jedi...). Les armes \u00e0 \u00e9nergie n'utilisent pas de munitions mais un compteur qui se recharge assez rapidement. Il y a un bon petit arsenal \u00e0 ramasser au fur et \u00e0 mesure de l'aventure. Chaque arme peut \u00eatre upgrad\u00e9e via des machines en d\u00e9pensant diff\u00e9rentes pi\u00e8ces d'engrenages \u00e0 collecter tout au long de l'ascension de la tour.\n \nEt elle est tr\u00e8s haute la tour. Arriv\u00e9 au sommet, s'il vous prend l'envie de vous jeter dans le vide, vous mettrez un bon moment avant de toucher le sol.\n \nLe jeu n'est vraiment pas difficile : les phases de plate-forme et les combats tr\u00e8s (trop ?) simples ne demandent pas de talent particulier. Les gens qui recherchent du challenge ou un syst\u00e8me de combat motivant peuvent passer leur chemin.\nNon, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du jeu repose davantage sur son univers tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able \u00e0 parcourir pour qui aime un peu la SF de l'\u00e2ge d'or. Les personnages surjouent \u00e0 mort des dialogues ridicules, on a droit \u00e0 des animations en stop-motion et certains ennemis sont suspendus par des fils de nylon.\nLes monstres sont nombreux et tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9s : \u00e7a va du singe mutant, \u00e0 la pieuvre g\u00e9ante en scaphandre en passant par les hommes-mouches, les fourmis radioactives ou les dinosaures en p\u00e2te \u00e0 modeler. M\u00eame si les combats ne sont pas tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressants, l'ascension de la tour reste motivante tant elle r\u00e9serve son lot de surprises et de bizarreries.\nTechniquement, on n'est carr\u00e9ment pas \u00e0 la pointe mais la direction artistique tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ussie fait qu'on s'en fout. Et puis, on peut se dire que \u00e7a colle \u00e0 l'histoire et \u00e0 l'univers.\n \nC'est un jeu l\u00e9ger, sympathique et tr\u00e8s d\u00e9paysant.

The game is enjoyable and worth the play through. I love the mix of beat em up/hack and slash with a mix of platforming.

Anyway, the whole game takes place on a island, which is a planet and you'll start at the base of the island/planet working your way up to the top of the tower, which reaches the planets atmosphere. \n\nso far i enjoyed the game and for its price theres virtually nothing i can actually complain about. i played with the steam controller and from what i see, it seems that mouse and keyboard players may get a bigger enjoyment from this game. anyway, game worth buying and i enjoyed it while it lasted. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoy platforming and beat em ups. The game has a sense of nostalgia to it, from en era where game developers experimented with new forms of gameplay or even original IPS. \n\nI forget to mention that this game spoofs 1960's and as a scifi fan film dude ranging from the 60's to the 90s, this is a instant love. The game even samples the stop motion claymation animation that was known by ray harryhausen. some of the enemies will have that stop motion jerky effect. its funny and enjoyable to see personally.  \n\nGame is worth owning and playing.

On y incarne des acteurs jouant leur r\u00f4le dans un film au sc\u00e9nar bidon dont le pitch principal est l'ascension d'une tour infernale pour d\u00e9jouer les plans d'un empereur mal\u00e9fique. Tout \u00e7a est comment\u00e9 par le r\u00e9alisateur himself, pour l'occasion de la sortie DVD du film.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679601118\n\nNiveau gameplay, on se situe dans un m\u00e9lange de jeu de plateforme et de beat them all :\n- L'aspect BTA est vraiment simpliste cependant. Les ennemis meurent en deux-trois coups g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement et il n'y a pas de combos \u00e0 proprement parler. Nos h\u00e9ros ont un vaste choix d'armes (m\u00eal\u00e9e et distance) mais leur pr\u00e9sence sera plus remarqu\u00e9e pour les clins d'oeil que pour la diversit\u00e9 de gameplay qu'elles apportent. \n- C\u00f4t\u00e9 plateforme le jeu est bien foutu et axe pas mal ses m\u00e9caniques sur la recherche d'objets : \u00e0 tout moment, lors de votre ascension, vous pourrez vous jeter de la plateforme o\u00f9 vous vous trouvez pour essayer de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer un objet bonus ou atteindre une zone en contrebas, vous aurez alors la possibilit\u00e9 de vous r\u00e9orienter ou g\u00e9rer votre atterrissage gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 votre jetpack. Si vous n'\u00eates pas satisfait de votre saut dans le vide, une simple pression sur un bouton vous permettra de revenir instantan\u00e9ment \u00e0 votre position d'origine. C'est super bien pens\u00e9 et \u00e7a donne vraiment envie d'explorer tous les recoins, surtout qu'on est souvent r\u00e9compens\u00e9 soit par des items, soit par des easter eggs.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679600891\n\nArtistiquement, pour un jeu ind\u00e9, c'est quand m\u00eame la grande classe. Les musiques sont au moins \u00e0 la hauteur de ce qu'avait propos\u00e9 la ACE Team dans leurs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes productions, ce qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 un gros point positif. Les commentaires audios du r\u00e9alisateur du film sont excellents : c'est un loser misogyne et ringard qui n'a aucun go\u00fbt et respect pour rien mais qui est s\u00fbr de lui et de son talent (son caract\u00e8re et sa fa\u00e7on de parler me rappellent beaucoup Zapp Brannigan de la s\u00e9rie Futurama). Ca donne lieu \u00e0 des commentaires sarcastiques souvent \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la plaque et c'est assez marrant. \n\nGraphiquement, si la mod\u00e9lisation des diff\u00e9rents personnages aurait gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre un poil plus pouss\u00e9e, la direction artistique rattrape le tout. Le jeu est un v\u00e9ritable hommage aux s\u00e9ries B de Science Fiction et l'incomp\u00e9tence du r\u00e9alisateur, qui n'a aucune limite dans ce qu'il veut mettre dans son film, est un heureux pr\u00e9texte pour l'avalanche d'ennemis que les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont pr\u00e9par\u00e9 : des extraterrestres, des ninjas, des hommes singes, des hommes l\u00e9zards, des slimes, des dinosaures anim\u00e9s en stop motion, etc. Tous les clich\u00e9s y sont. Un autre truc qui m'a impressionn\u00e9 c'est le travail qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sur les textures : le plastic, le vynil, le lycra, les couleurs criardes... C'est kitsch et plus vrai que nature.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679601580\n\nEn conclusion, j'ai vraiment appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 mon court s\u00e9jour dans cette tour \"infernale\". Court, parce que sa dur\u00e9e de vie ne d\u00e9passe pas 6h (en rajouter 2 de plus pour la chasse aux succ\u00e8s)... Du coup, pas vraiment le temps de s'en lasser, d'autant que le jeu fourmille d'ennemis et de d\u00e9cors divers et vari\u00e9s (malgr\u00e9 le th\u00e8me de la tour que l'on escalade), d'objets \u00e0 trouver, d'easter eggs et autres. Ce sont 6h bien remplies donc, bien que, il faut le reconna\u00eetre, l'on soit d'avantage port\u00e9 par l'envie d'en d\u00e9couvrir plus que par l'excitation que procure gameplay. \n\nPerso, je le recommande m\u00eame pour 15 euros. Le jeu est pas bien long mais il prend le risque de faire dans l'originalit\u00e9 (comme d'hab avec la ACE Team cela dit) et je pense qu'il faut encourager ce genre d'initiatives, surtout quand une r\u00e9alisation de qualit\u00e9 est au rendez-vous.", "timestamp_created": 1462559387, "timestamp_updated": 1462619304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22732719": {"recommendationid": "22732719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155425201", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455496756}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredible production for a small game.

Firstly one of the game\u2019s biggest flaws is the camera angle; it is in a set position on each frame, which means it can be very hard to look where you really want to especially when it comes to some of the puzzles. There are two sides to the gameplay mechanics; the platforming side, and the action side. The action parts of the game are your standard hack and slash style; with different weapons available throughout the game for you to use and upgrade using the game\u2019s currency system.  There isn\u2019t really anything standoutish about the combat system, other than it just works and does as it intends to do, as well as being easy to control and grasp. The platforming side of the game is one which I wasn\u2019t keen on. It surely can\u2019t just be me who is sick to death of jumping puzzle style. The camera angle of the game doesn\u2019t help on the platforming at all. With the awkward camera angle makes any sort of jump you need to make, more of a guessing game.  Thankfully the platforming is few and far between, still a small gripe though! \n\nThe art style on show in Deadly Tower of Monsters is done in a cartoon, retro look. The camera filters which are also used throughout the game are to add to the effect that you are watching an old film, and it does it very well. It wasn\u2019t my favourite aesthetic in the world; but I can appreciate the look and feel they were going for. The soundtrack and voice acting are all really spot on too. With the voice over and narration being a key feature for the game, adding plenty of comedic value and fourth and fifth wall breaking too. \n\nThis game is by no means easy; there aren\u2019t any difficulty settings, so what you get is the same experience throughout. A lot of the game can be overpowered by simply grinding on monsters for more gold and \u201ccogs\u201d which are the games currency system for upgrading your skills, but a lot of the game will come down to how good the player is, rather than how powerful the character is. The end boss fights are a real challenge, and will require you to try and try and try before finally successfully conquering them.  Even some of the more regular monsters in between boss fights will cause concern amongst some. \n\nI finished the game in a little under six hours. There is a handful of side missions you can take part in, but none of them add anything to the story, nor reward you extra skills; purely just extra content. Some of them you run into whilst playing through the main story, whilst others you have to go out of your way for. For me I was quite happy completing the ones I found naturally, I had no real urge to go seeking them.  There isn\u2019t any replay ability factor in Tower of Deadly Monsters; it\u2019s a completely linear story line. The co-op mode may make a second run through viable with a friend, but you may as well just make your first run through co-op and save yourself the time.  There is a hard mode added, but that will be for a small group of people who\u2019ll take that upon themselves to play. \n\nTechnically, I had no problems at all. The game runs very well even on 4K.  The frame rate did not drop below 60 at any points. I would recommend people playing this game use a controller, simply because it is easier to handle and you get the most out of the game play with a controller over a keyboard and mouse.\n\nTo sum up, The Deadly Tower of Monsters is your run of the mill OK game. The most redeeming factor about the title has got to be the narration and comedic value it brings. There are much better third person action shooting games out there, and there are much better platforming games available. What this game does bring to the table is an interesting, funny, and different storyline compared to most.  The game is priced at \u00a310, 99 \u2013 a price I would be happy to pay again for this release. You are looking at a 6-10 hours\u2019 worth of well-produced content. \n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n[b][u]4) Recommended[/u][/b]\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

That game was a tower defense game, though, with goofy villains and flying saucers. The Deadly Tower of Monsters (TDTM from here on out because golly that\u2019s a long title) pulls it off in spades. The setup is a director coming back to record some audio commentary for the DVD release of the movie he made a while ago. He talks rather passive about things like people dying on the set to the cost of certain features and complaints by stars: it\u2019s all very entertaining.\n\nThe whole game is run in a 60\u2019s style of aesthetics with creatures that look like they are stop-motioned captured (love that T-Rex and the squid people). Keep in mind though, that this is the director doing the narrating while you play. If you die, he criticizes the one playing the video footage for getting bad footage since the scene never happened that way in the original film. It was mocking you and still explained it off (if you were worried about continuity and how they would talk about it). I died so much at one point that the one helping with the footage asked the director why they kept all of these reels when they weren\u2019t  shot correctly. They really put a lot of thought into the narration and I love how they comment about almost everything.\n\nThe combat works fairly well, I did favor the melee over the range attack. It always feels like you do more damage than using the lasers and such. (I\u2019m looking at you Tesla Gun.) Smaller melee weapons are faster and quicker guns are weaker, yadda yadda yadda, I wield the biggest stick and tank with my face! That\u2019s not to say that things will always be that way throughout the course of the entire game. There are cogs of different colors and worth littered throughout the game and you will use these cogs to upgrade your weapons. Obviously there are more difficult ones to get and some that I just don\u2019t understand how to get at this point in the game, but with exploring you\u2019ll find enough of them to fix the weapons up to play the way you want to\u2026 or at least start in the direction you\u2019ll want to go in. There is a good variety of different weapons that will get handed to you as you progress, upgrading them will be dependent on your determination to explore and gather the various types of cogs.\n\nYou\u2019re given three adventurers to play around with in TDTM, and I used to feel that this was one of the few negatives I had with the game. They all felt like the same character to me. Whether it\u2019s with the combat in general or jumping, there didn\u2019t feel like there was any major difference in how they operated/controlled. If I had to ask myself if that\u2019s a bad thing, I would say not completely. In the fact that they all felt the same, that means I could switch it up between Dick Starspeed, Scarlet Nova and Robot. While I love Robot\u2019s name, for some reason I loved to play with\u2026 Mr. Starspeed.\n\nIt was about the time that I was getting fed up with some golden cogs that I couldn\u2019t figure out how to get that I realized that specific characters had different talents. The first one to really set itself apart was Robot. He had the ability to slow time down and that opened my eyes to being able to progress further and get some cogs that were impossible before hand. Now, with the other characters starting to show me their moves, it\u2019s starting to feel like the characters are a bit more fleshed out than I had originally thought. Granted, as you obtain new abilities, you slowly remember places that gave you pause and caused your brain to hurt an hour or so back and realize that this game will have some back tracking. I was almost bothered by this until I discovered that all of the characters could fast travel up and down the tower (a power I had originally thought to be given to Scarlet only). This is what I get for assuming.\n\nScore: Gewd.\n\nWith the characters getting more fleshed out and more weapons getting unlocked, the world seemed to open up even more. The narrator doesn\u2019t stop from shining with the humorous comments and the game continues to be visually fun throughout. Something stops TDTM from being super compelling to play without a desire to stop. I find it rather easy to play, but other games continue to easily pull me away. That is not to say that it\u2019s not worth picking up, but I think one should be in a specific mood to play this type of game. TDTM is a action-platformer, RPG and while fun, there is something that stops it from being great. I wish I could articulate my point better, but sometimes you just don\u2019t know what you just don\u2019t know.", "timestamp_created": 1460346506, "timestamp_updated": 1460346506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22285774": {"recommendationid": "22285774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167669415", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460041889}, "language": "english", "review": "nice but short, pls make co-op cam better, we need more co-op games )\ngreat atmosphere, with coments and all\n", "timestamp_created": 1460042005, "timestamp_updated": 1460042005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22273384": {"recommendationid": "22273384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193102287", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465847932}, "language": "french", "review": "Excellent jeu !", "timestamp_created": 1459968016, "timestamp_updated": 1459968016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22259947": {"recommendationid": "22259947", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993216595", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459892855}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoy this game thoroughly.

revealed to be a moral monster and terrific idiot.  I cant overstate how the music is beyond fantastic for this game.  I get a huge kick out of all the old school sci-fi cliche's and nonsense as well ass this old timey hollywood stuff.  The gameplay isnt anything spectacular but works for the game and theres something extremely titilating playing as a woman in tight crimson spandex weilding thors hammer or a 1960's robot weilding a glowing knife against evil apes.  The level desgin is dense and well utilized hiding with many hidden secrets ala metroidvania.  Lastly its super super fun to jump off the tower and free fall for days then you can teleport back to where you lept off.  I'm tempted to lable this game as style over substance but its not exactly lacking substance in any area, overall good title definately worth the sticker price.\n\nJust finished the game and I would

excellent review of this game.  When I first saw this title on the sales list I thought this game could be fun. Man did I ever make a great choice. This game is a freakin blast. The graphics are in the style of an old time movie so it has that grainy feel but it doesnt effects the textures, water effects or colors. The water effects are ecspecially good. The music is nice, I wasn't blown away with it but it does give it an old action movie theme. Speaking of listening the commentary is awesome, just the things he says about the production of the movie is priceless. The director commentating this game is an excellent choice. Gameplay is arguable what makes or breaks a game and the gameplay for this game doesnt break it but it isnt mind blowing either. I did have some diffuclty at some points in the game (mostly the gorilla fight) but I think that was more the camera angle then anything. Do not get me wrong its nice and fluid but it hard to master at first, I was halfway through the game before I got the hang of the crontrols.  The enemy variety is nice too, from ape with blunt clubs all the way to alligator wizards with pitchforks hanging by strings and with everything in between. I could make a list on the different enemies but I won't you will just have to see them for yourself, but I will say this, some enemies have this clay motion visual style to thier movements and it works out so well that I wish more games took advantage of it.  The story itself is a linear one as to be expected, three heroes climb a tower and to take down the villian to save the innocent populious below. At the end of the day would I recomend this game, yes, yes I would. Even if its not on sale you should buy it, you will not be dissapointed and you wil get you money worth. The game is short, it took me six hours to 100% the game but trust me its worth it.

Some of them can be still fun for the few minutes, but most of the time you are left with a feeling of paying for a silly meme and not for a game.\n\nThis is not the case with The Deadly Tower of Monsters, which is a class A-funny level comedy game, which is also very well made. You can see that a lot of love and effort was spent on the game. The game is FULL of small little touches that make you chuckle or even ROFL constantly.  \n\nGraphics and animations are great and build up the B-atmosphere without being B-quality themselves, but portraiting the B-quality of the \"movie\" in-game nicely. Music is full of very nice retro-movie melodies, catchy ones with some nice B-epic parts in them. Voice acting is top-notch, way better than I expected from a $10 game, and there is a lot of that too. \"Dick Missile penetrating deep into a black hole and then going to Uranus\"  might sound childish and gross when written like this, but when you are shooting missiles ingame and they start to talk about that casually all of sudden gets your keyboard covered with whatever you were drinking.\n\nIts a semi-metroidvania openworld game, full of small secrets, plenty of different weapons and enemies.

You have 20+ weapons in the game, but the enemies are such cannon fodder that you can kill every one of them with the first gun you get in the game...

If you grew up, as I did, loving the old Sci-Fi movies on Saturday afternoon television, then you'll probably really enjoy this game.  It's somewhat hard to explain the overall feel of the game, it's a limited world platformer with none of the annoying multiplayer garbage most modern games have.  During your gameplay the Director's Commentary can be a bit annoying in my opinion, but the overall feel comes off a little like MST3K.  It's a fun game, not terribly expensive, beautifully rendered.  The action is fluid, but very true to the style.  I have a bad habit of getting up and walking away while playing this in between checkpoints so I am only a short ways into Act 2.

Even though I was sold on the premise alone, the amazing thing is that the game actually delivers even more than I could have hoped. Old sci-fi B-movies aren't just the gimmicky premise of this game, everything about the game ties into that premise. The enemies are either stop-motion dinosaurs or actors in rubber suits or puppets being dangled by wires. There is a blurry video effect that makes the game look like it's actually an old VHS tape. To skip a cut scene you hold the A button and the scene fast forwards like a videotape, complete with scan lines and sped-up audio. The \"narrator\" of the game is actually the director of the movie that you are supposedly watching, who is doing a commentary track for the DVD release of his crappy old movie. And suffice it to say that this game isn't just a one-trick pony, it continues to deliver on its premise throughout the 8 or so hours, with an excellent payoff in the last act. \n\nIn terms of gameplay, this is a decent action platformer. There are plenty of ranged and melee weapons that can be upgraded with collectible gears that you find throughout the world. I found the lack of information about the weapons (like damage and speed) annoying at first, but eventually I realized that it really doesn't matter that much, just choose the weapons that suit your playstyle and upgrade them. The combat can be moderately challenging from time to time, but nothing unfair or frustrating. There are a few boss fights that are clever enough and have a reasonable level of difficulty. \n\nAll in all, this is a great package. Some games based on a gimmick end up being more clever than they are fun. You might stick with them because the art direction is great or the writing is good, but the gameplay really doesn't stack up. The Deadly Tower of Monsters isn't that kind of game. The gameplay is fun and deep enough to keep you engaged, and the gimmick is so thoroughly and smartly explored that it's always a pleasure.", "timestamp_created": 1456096153, "timestamp_updated": 1456096153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557462", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21366025": {"recommendationid": "21366025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045382189", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457289223}, "language": "english", "review": "The controls are really smooth, the aesthetic is amazing (it's like I'm really in a B-movie), and the narrator and the cheesy dialogue reallys makes this whole game come together.

Unreal Engine 4 physics-based shaders and lightning really make everything look amazing. \nThe enemy animations are not something you usually see in other games, they imitate stop-motion animations from the old monster movies. They're done really great and it's always fun to watch them every time. \nThe game is meant to be played with the VHS filter on and I highly recommend to do so. After all, it's just like the game says - the clean DVD mode is for robots.\n\n[b]Music / Sound[/b]\n\nThe game is packed with really memorable and atmospheric tunes. Some of them sound like a 50s b-movie of some sort, some of the cheery tracks reminded me of 90s JRPGs. I'd really like to have a soundtrack to listen separately from the game, too bad it's not available.\nThe voice actors completely succeeded in what they needed to do, with robot voice being my favourite one, too bad he has just a few lines. The director is the main voice you hear in the game and he takes the cake, making you believe it's all just a DVD commentary.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nIt breaks the 4th wall right from the beginning. You play as an actor in a typical 50/60s b-movie (and later as a group of three actors, but always controlling one of them) and your mission is to defeat super-mega-evil Emperor and his super-genius evil genius sidekick. Every enemy is not really an enemy but an actor in a suit, most of which work for mere cents.\nWhile most lines were not really funny for me, they have their own charm and just pleasant to listen. It's more like The Stanley Parable - it has the story told in a quirky way, not necessarily a slapstick comedy or something like that.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nTechnically, it's a modern beat'em'up / action game. It has a lock-on system (if you're playing with the controller), which chooses the closest enemy automatically. It not always works the way you want (causing some frustration at times), but you'll get used to it. The camera is fixed and you can move it only slightly. You start with a weak gun and a stick, but you're getting more and more weapons on your way up, which you can also upgrade (by finding cogs and picking up gold after fallen enemies / broken objects).\n\nJust like the title of the game suggests, you're climbing up the tower. And it's a one huuuuge tower, so huge that it goes up into space. You unlock checkpoints on your way up and you can teleport between these checkpoints anytime (except when you fight someone). It's 100% seamless and whole location makes it feel like an open world game.\n\nYou can jump from the tower whenever you want, to either land on some particular part of it or to get back to the surface or just dive through the special rings (needed to get a couple of skill points). Jumping down from the tower looks and sounds astonishing, it even has its own beautiful dreamy soundtrack and you also can shoot while diving. It feels much like the opening of MDK (1998), but here it's not scripted. You can jump whenever you want and if you want to reach the surface, you can do so, without teleporting and in a most effective and beautiful way.\nYou can choose between three main characters (once you unlock them all), but the changes are mostly cosmetic. They have their own unique abilities though, but you won't need them most of the time.\n\n[b]Technical[/b]\n\nI had experienced a couple of bugs during my walkthrough. One time I stuck in the object and couldn't do anything while fighting the enemies (cost me about 75% of health bar or so), another time the game didn't unlock the exit and just froze on the infinite animation loop when I opened the teleport menu, which forced me to close the game through Process Manager.\nBut it surely is really well optimized and framerate was always high and stable no matter what happened on the screen.\n\nOverall, it's a must-have game for anyone remotely interested in b-movies or unusual games overall. Even if you're not, it's still a very enjoyable beat'em'up game.\n\n[i]Review copy provided by publisher[/i]\n\nSasha Darko for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GameObscura]Game Obscura[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1455875133, "timestamp_updated": 1520960611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673349", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21311016": {"recommendationid": "21311016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041872701", "num_games_owned": 533, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455855500}, "language": "english", "review": "Goofy, campy, shooty fun.\n", "timestamp_created": 1455856246, "timestamp_updated": 1455856246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21306317": {"recommendationid": "21306317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120390333", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458171348}, "language": "english", "review": "Final final B, my kind of final :D", "timestamp_created": 1455834251, "timestamp_updated": 1455834251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21304923": {"recommendationid": "21304923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054439858", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453648276}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo confuso.", "timestamp_created": 1455829561, "timestamp_updated": 1455829561, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21292356": {"recommendationid": "21292356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079965121", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477843798}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a love letter to old B sci fi movies.

Hilarity ensued and I felt the need for Hollywood to go back to these and make something similar. I actually want a modern-day, low budget(visually at least), scifi movie like this now.\n\nThough, if you are expecting something with a little more depth like their previous game Abyss Odyssey then you will be a little disappointed. I try to stretch game length by taking my time, but I finished this in 4hrs and it was no challenge at all. Weapons were given to you seemingly out of order.

The graphics are top notch, but more subtly, the colors, especially in the ape village, remind me of the B-movies, afternoon movies, and toys I watched and played with as a youngin' back in the halcyon days of the 70's.

I also love the way the cutscenes bounce in and out of the action - remarkably well done, and the switch between preset animations and the gameplay really highlight the incredible graphics.\nI am very much an atmospheric gamer - I love to immerse myself in a world, and ideally one that puts neat imagery in my head, and this game is doing a phenomenal job.  \nThe action and gameplay in this are also great fun, with a different mix and match of tasks to keep it interesting.

Well this is just the start, as our hero and space explorer, Dick Starspeed, and his faithful robot co-pilot will find out upon crash landing their spacecraft on its surface.\n\nThe Deadly Towers of Monsters is an adventure / isometric action shooter which takes place on a planet called Gravoria. As you start the game, you will be playing Dick Starspped but as go along, you will meet the gorgeous Scarlet Nova, your tin can co-pilot, and be able to swap between characters when you reach some of the checkpoints. Each of the characters has its own special abilities and they will sometimes determine your progression to the next scene of the movie. \n\nThe plot is fairly simple; Scarlet will need your help to overthrown her evil father, the Emperor of Gravoria.  You will have to climb this very odd tower and fight against fun enemies: monkeys, dinosaurs (at the bottom of the tower), invisible men (apparently these actors are very cheap to hire), squids, brain flying sauces, aliens and more. Along the way, you will pick up weapons and will be able to upgrade them too. I have to be honest with you, Ladies and Gents, this game took me by surprise and I tremendously enjoyed the commentary of Dan Smith\u2026 He made me laugh several times during the gameplay and I consequently died on every one of these occasions. I really like his style, just brilliant! I can see people saying they may not like this type of in-game commentary but for me it really make the game so much fun.\n\nGraphically the game looks great, the game runs very well and the controls are easy to master. I really like the B movie atmosphere and the soundtrack.  \n \nPositives:\n~~~~~~~  \n\n-\tGreat graphics\n-\tGreat story-line\n-\tPlenty of enemies\n-\tPlenty of laughs\n-\tAchievements and trading cards\n\nNegative:\n~~~~~~~ \n-\tNone\n\nYou would be mad not to have The Deadly Towers of Monsters in your game library!\n\n10/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

and text format:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHOJHRTFQ6I\n\nWhat I liked:\nVoice Acting (Both from the narrator and the in-game characters have well-written dialogue that can come off as very charming and funny)\nVisuals (Animation quality is stylized with stop-motion effects to compliment the Sci-fi b-movie setting)\nLevel Design (Levels compliment the platforming as you can drop down at anytime to lower levels of the tower allowing you to find secrets or get to other crucial areas of the game)\nEnemy Variety (plenty of enemies with different attacks help prolong the enjoyment of the game)\nBoss fights (They are usually well-done and they utilize the mechanics you have learned throughout the game0\n\nWhat i found passable:\nCombat (while fun at times, it's a bit repetitive but the level design and enemy variety do help out a bit)\nSoundtrack (The few there are good, but there aren't that many tracks leadning to often repeated music)\nPerformance (The game has some optimization issues but it's still entirely playable even on lower end hardware but high end like mine shouldn't be suffering as much as it does in certain areas albeit still playable)\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n62 FPS lock (Why?)\n\nOverall impressions so far is that it's a good ride for the cheap price.", "timestamp_created": 1454382761, "timestamp_updated": 1454567493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2,

mich echt \u00fcberrascht. Nachdem ich mir ein paar Trailer und Reviews angesehen habe war auch total hei\u00df auf dieses Spiel. Man f\u00fchlt sich richtig in die Zeit der guten Filme ala Flash Gordon, Indiana Jones, Quartermain und anderen sachen aus den 80er jahren zur\u00fcck versetzt.\nIm Spiel selber geht es darum Turm (der name sagt es ja schon^^) der \"t\u00f6dlichen Monster\" zu erklimmen. Dabei gibt es einiges zu entdecken, etlich verschiedene Gegner und Areale an denen man sich kaum sattsehen kann. Als sehr nettes feature kann man sich vom Turm herunter st\u00fcrzen um versteckte Areale zu entdecken. Meist findet man dort dann Zahnr\u00e4der (Gold, Silber & Blau gibt es) mit denen man seine Waffen besser ausr\u00fcsten kann.\nEs gibt je 8 Nah- und Fernkampfwaffen, jede kann bis zu 3 (?) mal upgraded werden.\n\nGrafisch sieht das Spiel eher ok aus. Erinnert etwas an Xbox 360 Zeiten, was f\u00fcr mich aber ok ist denn trotzdem sieht man hier viele Details und man merkt das die Entwickler mit Liebe dabei waren.\n\nDer Sound geht auf jedenfall auch klar. Musikalisch gibts hier typische Abenteurermusik die aber ganz gut zum Spiel passt. Die Sprecher machen ihren Job sehr Gut, besonders der \"Audiokommentar des Regisseurs ist sehr witzig auch wenn manche sachen im Eifer des gefechts etwas untergehen.\n\nInsgesamt w\u00fcrde ich dem Spiel 8/10 Punkte geben. Leider ist es etwas kurz aber f\u00fcr knappe 10\u20ac hat sich f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich jeder Cent gelohnt da ich \u00fcber die gesammte Spielzeit Super unterhalten wurde :)", "timestamp_created": 1454241946, "timestamp_updated": 1454241946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674650", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20869910": {"recommendationid": "20869910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053973533", "num_games_owned": 812, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476623414}, "language": "english", "review": "ACE Team's games are always top notch, but this is the creme de la creme.\n\nDoubtless, the crew spent endless hours watching old VHS copies of even older 1950's and 1960's creature features to get the feel for this game. The dialog is very good and the humor is very topical while being self-aware. The visuals (and this is where ACE Team truly shines) are beyond amazing. I have never seen so much effort go into anything to make it look authentically cheap.\n\nThere's a tiny segment of black and white that is more or less blink and it's gone. I really liked that bit, and the dialog establishes that parts of the \u201cfilm\u201d were shot in black and white. Sadly, that was the only time it's seen.  As such, it feels less like part of a the game and more like an abandoned idea that the devs forgot to fully remove. Perhaps it can return as a video filter option much like \u201cVHS\u201d is?\n\nAlso, what you are expected to do at the end isn't really clear. I figured it out, but believed what I did was the wrong thing to have tried. I spent time trying to figure out a mistake that wasn't. You just have to do the thing until it works, which will not on the first couple of tries.\n\nThe worst thing I can actually say is that controls are often sloppy. For a game with tons of platforming, this can be horrifying. Yes, there is mid-air teleportation, but that doesn't stop some sequences from being white knuckle and frustrating, especially towards the end.\n\nI hate to say, but I've totally completed this game. I reached the end somewhere around the 5 hour mark. I spent the remaining time hunting for all of the achievements and extras (and sometimes just free falling for the hell of it). I now have 100% achievements and I'm waiting for any hint of DLC.\n\nBuy the game already.", "timestamp_created": 1454239863, "timestamp_updated": 1454239863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20864017": {"recommendationid": "20864017", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971108266", "num_games_owned": 512, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454245256}, "language": "english", "review": "Goofy fun..", "timestamp_created": 1454214652, "timestamp_updated": 1454214652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20860101": {"recommendationid": "20860101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013108820", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503122543}, "language": "english", "review": "This game brought me back to a simpler time. When I'd spend my saturday nights sitting in front of a tube TV playing on my PS1 with an assortment of unhealthy snacks sitting nearby. The Tower of Deadly Monsters is a witty, entertaining, funny, hell of a good time type of game. Once I started playing it was like reading a good book, where you always convince yourself that you might as well read another chapter until you eventually find yourself at the end of the book. I found myself searching every part of the game, looking for hoops or gears or anything I could possibly have missed.\n\nThe only issue I had with the game was how short it was. My heart sank when I saw the credits start rolling, as I secretly hoped it was another hijinx by the director and that the game would continue on.\n\nI would still recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers and old school sci-fi movies.

If you're a fan of both, this is the game for you.  Otherwise, read the review.\n\nThe Deadly Tower Of Monsters core idea is this - you're playing an action platformer set in a b-movie.  The game however is presented as if you're watching a comentary track (complete with outtakes) on a DVD release of this nonexistent film.  So you don't just play out the story and the action - as you do so, the director and the recording assistant make comentary, review the history of the film, and banter.  It's a game of a movie that never was done as a DVD that doesn't exist.\n\nIt's also quite clever and fun.\n\nSo there's three parts to the game.\n\nTHE GAME: The game is a pretty standard action platformer - multiple characters to choose from with different abilities, character upgrades (that affect the whole team), and various upgradable weapons, a few of which are delightfully weird.   As you journey through the environment (a tower, of course), there's hidden items, loot, achievements, and so on.  Nothing you haven't seen before, but about 1/2 to 2/3 the way through the game, it really starts pulling out some truly crazy environments, puzzles, and designs.  The controls at times are a little \"soft\" and wonky, but nothing game-breaking.\n\nTHE THEME: The theme of the game, the b-movie-as-game is realized exceptionally well.  The film references come thick and fast, and even a b-movie fan such as myself may not catch them all (my favorite are the Energy Imps, clear references to the Monster of the Id from Forbidden Planet).  The banter is funny and usually well done, and it's actually interesting to \"play\" one story while you hear about another - the making of this film.  The director, Dan Smith, is an interesting character both human and flawed - he loves films and movies, compliments his actors, is friendly with the recording assistant, but also shows cluelessness, sexism, and a bit of ego.  He's probably a bit too close to reality.\n\nHOW IT COMES TOGETHER: The gameplay and the theme come together very well.  From the monster designs and styles (many look like stop motion), the crazy environments, the unusual bosses, and little effects and asides, it works.  It's sort of the game equivalent of \"The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra,\" a fun parody-and-homage.\n\nIt it perfect?  Well, there's a few flaws.  The action platforming elements have the slightly \"soft\" controls as mentioned, and there's not any real innovation in the gameplay - it's stuff we've seen before.  Theres' a need for a bit more tutorial elements and clarity as abilities and weapons aren't always easy to understand.  Nothing is game-breaking or indeed game-stopping, but a little more polish would have been nice.\n\nOn the other hand, there's plenty here for completists.  There's many achievements and hidden items and things to upgrade.  You can have fun watching for various film references.  You can try out different weapons or play with different abilities to find what works best.\n\nSo should you buy it?\n* First if you like a solid action platformer/adventure and like b-movies, you should buy it.  This is the game for you.  Buy it.\n* If you know someone who'd like this, you just found a great present at a reasonable price.  Buy it.\n* If you like action platformer-adventures, it's a mixed bag.  The theming is great and it's imaginative, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table - the way it works with the theme is a strong selling point.  Consider it or get it on sale.\n* If you know an action platformer-adventure fan . . . it might be a decent fit.  It's a gamble.\n* If you neither like b-movies or action platformer-adventures, really this isn't for you unless you just want to see an interesting envisioning of a genre.\n\nPersonally, I consider this game a little gem and a triumph of gameplay married to theme.  It's clever, witty, heartfelt, and fun.  \n\nAnd c'mon Dan Smith had to have made more films, shouldn't those get, ahem, \"special releases . . .\"\n", "timestamp_created": 1454186662, "timestamp_updated": 1454186662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20846714": {"recommendationid": "20846714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047246483", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518687166}, "language": "french", "review": "Vous aimez les nanards?

You play as three different heroes, all with mildly varying powers, and you can use and upgrade a variety of melee and ranged weapons, most of which are bad. \n\nSo, the presentation is rather nice, with the audio commentary from the \"director\" of the game talking about how he \"filmed\" the \"movie,\" and some random audio engineer that makes comments for whatever reason. The commentary, which extends throughout the game, is entertaining enough, and it makes plenty of references to old and new filmmaking. The visual style of the game adds to the presentation as well with \"stop-motion\" enemies that move at lower frame rates and wacky enemy designs. \n\nSo why don't I recommend this game?\n\nWell, for one, I beat this game first try in 2 hours and 45 minutes approximately. Now, even for a 15 dollar game, that is fairly short. But length isn't all that matters, right? Well, that isn't the only problem I had with it.\n\nThe soundtrack for the game is alright, but I can only remember two main songs that got repetitive after some time. There is the main combat and adventure music, and the jarring music change that plays every single time you enter freefall. And you will hear those songs for the entirety of this short game, except when the music seemingly breaks or perhaps just randomly stops playing for whatever reason, which makes the game really uncomfortably silent. \n\nThe game also randomly crashed near the end for some reason.\n\nGraphically, this game is not bad. It is colorful, varied, and presents itself well even though the texture quality isn't particularly impressive. The animations can leave a bit to be desired at times, but it is alright.\n\nNow, onto the gameplay. One of the primary things this game sells itself on is the freefall mechanic. In short, it is really bad. You can jump off ledges and move around slightly and then instantly teleport back to where you just jumped off like it never even happened. It just feels so disconnected from the rest of the game. The only real advantage to it is to fall through rings for skill points and achievements. Otherwise, it serves little purpose whatsoever. Even in the boss fights, at the very end of some of the bossfights, the boss falls down and you get to shoot the boss a whole bunch, but it doesn't even seem to really do anything at all. I wouldn't be surprised if not shooting the boss had the same outcome as shooting them. I honestly can't say anything more about it because there really isn't anything else to it. Freefalling feels like a slapped on mechanic, and I would have much preferred if the game didn't pretend like it actually matters at all.\n\nAnother \"mechanic\" of the game, if you can even call it that, is that you can shoot down the tower. I don't mean shoot the tower down, but rather you can look over the edge and shoot at enemies that are coming up the tower. The game will alert you when enemies are climbing/flying up the sides, and you can look over the edge and click them a whole bunch. Also, you can shoot targets and if you shoot enough you get a skill point. That is literally all there is to the \"mechanic.\" It feels so disconnected from the rest of the game that I honestly can't see why it is even in the game.\n\nSo now that the whole \"looking down and clicking things a whole bunch\" mechanics have turned out to be boring, repetitive, and disconnected from the rest of the game, you are left with a more basic action adventure platformer game. So, how does that fair? In short, not much better.\n\nTo start off, you have two weapon types, ranged and melee. You can carry four weapons, two of each type, and you can collect and upgrade the different weapons throughout the game. [strike] The different weapons have different advantages and disadvantages that you must learn to utilize in order to fight the varied enemy types.[/strike]\n\n Actually, scratch that last sentence because it is a big fat lie.\n\n So, you can use different cogs you find throughout the game to upgrade your weapons. But some of the weapons are so ridiculously strong that I cannot possibly imagine why you would use any of the other weapons. The mace/hammer weapon allows you to annihilate everything in your path with jump attacks. It can hit enemies twice, and when you land, its shockwave hits multiple enemies at once. Pair that with the fact that it does a ridiculous amount of damage even to single enemies that I am pretty sure it is more versatile than any pair of weapons in the game. The game quickly devolved into jump attack, jump attack, jump attack, win. It even works well against bosses, so every time I picked up a weapon I would switch to my other junk weapon so I wouldn't lose my hammer when the game forcefully changes my weapons. Then I would continue jump attacking to victory for most of the game.\n\nThe ranged weapons are in a similar boat. There is one lightning gun that does so much single target damage that it instantly kills even many medium strength enemies in one shot at range, and at the very least two shots them. There is also an energy mechanic where if you shoot too fast, your energy runs out and you have to wait to use your gun again, but the lightning gun doesn't even use too much energy for the insane amount of damage it does and it upgrades to max very quickly. The worst part is that the weapon can hit multiple densely packed enemies at once so I never felt hard pressed to switch to a faster weapon to kill weaker mobs because I could kill two to three at once anyway. The ranged weapons are less terrible than the melee weapons, with the machinegun, rocket launcher, and a couple others being okay but the lightning gun is just so good I had no reason to ever use my secondaries.\n\n Each character has powers that I can barely even comment on because I never felt the need to use them except when the game forces you to use them to open up a gate or move past an obstacle. The only one of note is at the last chapter of the game and lets you instantly kill any enemy that is being held up by strings, and it recharges very quickly. [i]Surely,[/i] we needed more enemy types to become completely trivialized.\n\n\"What about the enemy designs?\" What about them? Thematically they are varied with apes that throw feces and robot samurai and dinosaurs and so on, but most can be summed up as: Small mob creature that dies instantly, medium strength melee guy, medium strength ranged guy, big slow guy. Oh, and the \"enemy that flies up the tower and you click a whole bunch as it dies helplessly\" enemy type. Again, the \"shooting down the tower\" mechanic is so disconnected that those enemies are hardly worth mentioning. The hammer and lightning gun make short work of all of the main enemy types anyway.\n\nThe platforming is extremely basic. You can jump, and you have a jetpack that allows you to hover for a short period of time while also preventing fall damage. Basically, its not a selling point either.\n\nAnd the bosses, along with the rest of the game, are laughably easy. The last \"boss,\" if you can even call it that, is basically one last middle finger to the player as it is the easiest of them all.\n\nAll in all, unless the presentation just seems [i]that[/i] appealing to you and the game is on sale, I wouldn't recommend it. I even got it for 10 bucks and I [i]still[/i] wouldn't recommend it.\n\nEDIT: I completely forgot there even was a dodge roll mechanic until I looked at the achievements because it was so insignificant.", "timestamp_created": 1454143607, "timestamp_updated": 1454156662, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20837548": {"recommendationid": "20837548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097587199", "num_games_owned": 781, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454115293}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want to play a funny game, this is the one!

Press \u201cLB\u201d and you're right back to solid ground, no penalty incurred. Getting lost? Pull up the map and you can warp to any point in the tower you've previously visited at will. (Protip: go up.) This isn't some hardcore, griefing, reflex litmus test. That wouldn't be funny. You're encouraged to fall, explore, and generally just have a good time in the campy sandbox, and you should take the game up on that offer.\n\n  On the base level the game reminds me of console-centric action/RPGs like Marvel: Ultimate Alliance or Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. From an overhead view you have a standard melee attack which can be charged for a heavy attack, and a ranged weapon. As you progress you gain access to about a dozen different kinds of both types of weapons, and these can be upgraded by collecting components dropped by enemies or scattered around the environments. There are also perks like max HP increases, regenerating health, improved melee/ranged damage, etc. that can be earned by completing missions (main quests or side activities). You can swap between three different characters that have some unique skills needed to access certain areas, so there's also a bit of Metroidvania going on here.  Other options include the ability to parry attacks, extend your jumps with a jetpack, and shoot downward when near a ledge (that one good feature of Dark Void). It all adds up to a surprising amount of depth in a fairly short, decidedly goofy comedy game.\n\n  Even the title screen of The Deadly Tower of Monsters is full of jokes. Upon booting the game, you're immediately greeted by a narrator who is \u201cin studio\u201d to record a commentary track for a truly awful Sci-Fi B-movie he made some years back, and he's going to be cringe-worthingly candid and let it be know just how much of scumbag he is. You're greeted at the start with a fairly typical though beautiful movie poster of the movie, where a 50's Hollywood space man is cradling an attractive, unconscious woman. The director remarks how proud he is of the poster. Boot the game up a second time, and the gender roles are swapped, with the woman rescuing the man. \u201cI didn't approve of this change\u201d, the director protests. His assistant chimes in to inform him that the studio execs shot an alternate take, foreseeing a future demographic where swapping the sexes would appeal to the masses. That's some pretty poignant and fucking funny social commentary. Not content to stop there, an alternate title screen shows a robot holding the man instead... for the future robot demographic.\n\n  I debated whether or not to spoil the above gag, but the riffs are just so nonstop throughout the game that it's a small drop in a large pond of punchlines. You're controlling the \u201cmovie\u201d, the perfectly voiced director is giving behind-the-scenes anecdotes nearly the entire time in rapid fire fashion akin to the densest, snappiest of MST3K episodes. This is more than fitting since the movie in question would feel right at home in a crappy Mystery Science Theater show: dinosaurs are convincingly stop motion animated, bats are held aloft by visible strings, nothing is shown that couldn't be created with practical effects from that era which usually means men in rubber suits. There's even more than a few cameos from (in)famous(ly bad) real movie monsters. Every environment and creature is lovingly crafted from people who are clearly fans of the genre, and the affection for the movies we love and love to make fun of is sincere and hilarious.\n\n  I'm not usually a fan of \u201cmeta\u201d comedy, but The Deadly Tower of Monsters is so out there it absolutely worked for me on every level. The DVD commentary presentation is excellent, and it breaks the fourth (and sometimes fifth) wall with such reckless abandon you just have to laugh. From a pure game perspective it's completely solid with enough fresh ideas to be enjoyable on it's own, but smiling and giggling like an idiot while playing elevates it to a must play game. It's one of the best surprises I've encountered in a long time.", "timestamp_created": 1454083495, "timestamp_updated": 1456691319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0,

Shooters.[/i]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nDick  D-i-c-k (Anmerkung an die Steam-Zensur -> ich kann ja auch nichts daf\u00fcr, dass er so hei\u00dft) Starspeed und sein Sidekick der Roboterpilot stranden mit ihrem Raumschiff auf einem unbekannten Planeten, der seltsamer nicht sein k\u00f6nnte. Das Wasser ist t\u00fcrkisgr\u00fcn und die Erde rot wie der Mars. Gr\u00f6\u00dfere Felsen sind gerne mal aus Pappmaschee und die B\u00e4ume und B\u00fcsche sind allesamt aus Plastik. Mittendrin steht ein gigantischer Turm, der bis ins All hinaufragt. Er sieht ein bi\u00dfchen aus, als h\u00e4tte man ihn aus Science Fiction Spielzeugresten zusammengebaut und ist der ganze Stolz des ans\u00e4ssigen Superschurken \"The Emperor\". \n\nDessen Tochter Scarlett Nova, die mit der Tyrannei ihres Vaters nicht einverstanden ist, verschw\u00f6rt sich mit den beiden Neuank\u00f6mmlingen. Und so beschlie\u00dfen sie gemeinsam, mit Laser-Peitsche und Strahlenkanone bewaffnet, den t\u00f6dlichen Turm der Monster zu erklimmen, um ihrem Vater und seinem verrr\u00fcckten Wissenschaftler Dr Peculiar die Stirn zu bieten. Auf ihrem Weg begegnen sie vielen eigent\u00fcmlichen Kreaturen, wie den Atomameisen und den schwebenden Gehirnen, oder den Staubsaugermonstern. Auch ein Riesengorilla und ein Mutantenoktopus d\u00fcrfen da nat\u00fcrlich nicht fehlen.\n\nDas klingt nach \u00fcblem Trash und das soll es auch sein. The Deadly Tower of Monsters wird dem Spieler als digitalisierte und vom Regisseur kommentierte Neuauflage eines 1975 abgedrehten SciFi B-Movies pr\u00e4sentiert. Das Spiel ist bis zum Rand gef\u00fcllt mit h\u00f6lzernen Dialogen und Anspielungen auf Filme wie Formica, King Kong, die Zeitmaschine, Fliegende Untertassen greifen an, der Unsichtbare, Killers from Space, Flash Gordon, Planet der Affen, die Fliege, oder die Reise zum Mittelpunkt der Erde. Die Spezialeffekte sind teilweise absichtlich f\u00fcrchterlich mies. Manchmal ragt sogar ein Mikrofon ins Bild, oder man sieht einen Fingerabdruck auf der Linse. Viele der Monster sind ebenfalls absichtilich grauenvoll schlecht gemacht. Manche k\u00f6nnen zum Beispiel nur geradeaus laufen und rotieren auf der Stelle, wenn sie die Richtung wechseln wollen, andere sind absolut gro\u00dfartig animiert. \n\n\u00dcber alledem h\u00f6rt man immer wieder die eingespielten Kommentare des selbstgef\u00e4lligen und komplett unf\u00e4higen Regisseurs Dan Smith, der nicht m\u00fcde wird, den fiktiven Zuschauer mit schr\u00e4gen Lebensweisheiten und verr\u00fcckten Anekdoten vom Film-Set und zu unterhalten.\n\n[h1]Umfang[/h1]\nDer \"Film\" besteht aus vier Abschnitten, in denen man zahlreiche Monster und auch immer ein paar Endgegner besiegen muss. Wer z\u00fcgig durchrennt, schafft das Spiel vermutlich auch in 6 Stunden. Wer alle Errungenschaften sammeln will und sich etwas mehr Zeit nimmt, diese bunte Welt der SciFi-Parodie zu bewundern, braucht daf\u00fcr eher 10-15 Stunden.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe Deadly Tower of Monsters ist eine Mischung aus isometrischem Twin Stick Shooter, Action RPG und 3D Plattformer. F\u00fcr mein Empfinden spielt es sich am besten mit einem Gamepad. \n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad ist definitiv \"leicht\". Auch RPG Einsteiger sollten dieses Spiel ohne allzu gro\u00dfen Widerstand durchspielen k\u00f6nnen. \n\nDie Helden k\u00f6nnen auf Basiseigenschaften wie Leben und Schaden ein bi\u00dfchen leveln. Es gibt eine \u00fcberschaubare Auswahl von Waffen, zwischen denen man w\u00e4hlen kann und die man f\u00fcr eingesammeltes Gold und Zahnr\u00e4der ein oder zwei Stufen aufwerten kann.\n\nBesonders ungew\u00f6hnlich ist, dass man aus beliebiger H\u00f6he vom Turm springen kann (oder manchmal auch muss). Kurz vorm Aufprall beamt man sich mit dem tragbaren Teleporter einfach wieder hoch, oder man benutzt ein Jetpack, um eine sanfte Landung zu versuchen. Der freie Fall aus einer so gro\u00dfen H\u00f6he ist ganz sicher ein Alleinstellungsmerkmal dieses Spiels. Man kann auch nur nach unten schauen und schie\u00dfen. Die vertikale Ebene, ist fast eine neue Dimension f\u00fcr ein Spiel dieser Art. Die sich st\u00e4ndig um den Turm und den Spieler drehende Kamera hat dabei alle H\u00e4nde voll zu tun, einen guten Blickwinkel zu bieten, was fast immer \u00fcberzeugend gelingt.\n\n[h1]Grafik & Musik[/h1]\nMan findet Affen mit Armbanduhren, Stop-Motion Monster, eine gl\u00e4nzende Plastikfauna, unendlich viele Arten von verr\u00fcckten Kreaturen und einen riesigen Turm mit unendlich vielen Details und Referenzen. Dialogsequenzen kann man vorspulen und es gibt sogar einen VHS-Filter, der die Altersspuren einer Videokassette simuliert. Die Grafiken und Animationen in diesem Spiel sind mit sehr viel Liebe zum Detail gestaltet worden. Es sieht einfach gro\u00dfartig aus.\n\nDie Musik ist, im Stil der alten B-Movies, mit echten Instrumenten eingespielt worden und erg\u00e4nzt die Parodie durch \u00fcbertrieben theatralische Konzertkl\u00e4nge und schr\u00e4ge Spacefilmt\u00f6ne.\n\n[h1]Kritik[/h1]\nSpieler mit einer Nvidia Karte haben offenbar immer wieder mal Probleme mit der vertikalen Synchronisation. Mir hat geholfen, meine Grafikkarte anzuweisen, dass sie dem Spiel ein nvidia vsync aufzwingen soll. Von da an lief es fl\u00fcssig.\n\nDie Charaktere unterscheiden sich nur durch ein paar Sonderf\u00e4higkeiten und auch die Charakterentwicklung ist f\u00fcr alle drei gleicherma\u00dfen sparsam. F\u00fcr verw\u00f6hnte RPG Spieler ist die Auswahl der Waffen und Sonderf\u00e4higkeiten m\u00f6glicherweise ein bi\u00dfchen d\u00fcrftig. Mir war es ausreichend f\u00fcr ein Spiel dieser Art. Man vermisst aber mehr Verstecke und nur f\u00fcr einen bestimmten Charakter zug\u00e4ngliche Bereiche. Sie w\u00e4ren gut f\u00fcr die Ausdifferenzierung der drei Rollen und auch der Wiederspielwert w\u00fcrde davon profitieren.\n\nDie Kameraperspektive wechselt recht oft, w\u00e4hrend man sich auf dem Turm bewegt, was zun\u00e4chst ein bi\u00dfchen gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig ist. Gelegentlich kommt es auch vor, dass manche Ecken dadurch schwer zu erreichen sind.\n\nEs kommt aufgrund der vielen komplexen Ebenen und der zahlreichen Objekte des Turms gelegentlich (eher selten) vor, dass man in der Szenerie h\u00e4ngen bleibt.\n\nIm vierten Teil sind die spielbegleitenden Kommentare etwas seltener geworden, was ich ein wenig schade fand. Ich h\u00e4tte Dan Smith noch ewig zuh\u00f6ren k\u00f6nnen.\n\nDie deutsche \u00dcbersetzung ist an verschiedenen Stellen leider ziemlich schlecht. Man sollte Englisch verstehen, um das Spiel vollumf\u00e4nglich genie\u00dfen zu k\u00f6nnen, denn man hat oft keine Zeit den Untertitel zu lesen.\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nAugenblicklich sieht es so aus, als h\u00e4tten die Entwickler auch in Zukunft noch vor das Spiel zu begleiten und hier und da an der ein oder anderen Schraube zu drehen. Sie haben ebenfalls ein offenes Ohr f\u00fcr Spieler, wie man im Steam-Forum deutlich erkennen kann. Das sind eindeutig gute Argumente f\u00fcr ein gerade ver\u00f6ffentlichtes Spiel, das bei diesem Umfang selbstverst\u00e4ndlich noch nicht zu hundert Prozent perfekt ist. \n\nWenn du schwindelfrei bist und etwas f\u00fcr Action RPGs und Twinstick Shooter \u00fcbrig hast, wenn du Englisch verstehst, aber vor allem wenn du ein SciFi-Fan bist und schon viele B-Movies gesehen hast, dann ist dieses Spiel garantiert ein Fest f\u00fcr deine Lachmuskeln. Gerne-Fans kann ich es w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen. Der Preis stimmt auch. The Deadly Tower of Monsters hat gute Werbung verdient.

The sky diving which seemed to be this games draw that made it different is buggy ( diving for hoops id know i went through it nothing, not even  close ohh yup i got it ) and just no felt like no control at all. i was most disappointed with this before i was stuck as it looked fun but ends up being a let down.

There was another user in the forums who reported something just like what you're saying. According to him, when he lowered his settings to improve his framerate, it resulted in the Sprint working normally and allowing him to proceed.

The view itself is phenominal once you start jumping from high up.\n\nThe graphics themselves are neat, but the art style itself is of course very different. Often enemies are clearly just people in suits, or are stop-motion animated. I personally find this amusing and interesting, but I know people who dislike it. The music fits the game well enough, and is similar to the music used in their other games, but if I'm being honest I can't really think of any of the tunes off the top of my head, so I can't say it's too memorable, maybe that will change as I play.\n\nLook, all you really want is a recommendation, right?

In short, it's a lot of fun - though I'd recommend cranking up the default difficulty a bit, as it's extremely easy.\n\nYou play either a male or a female 'actor' who is travelling up a tower as part of a B-grade science-fiction movie. The director is giving the DVD commentary while you're doing it, and the creatures are a combination of people in rubber-suits, or clearly stop-motion models.  It's corny, and of course it's supposed to be.  You can even see the strings on the spaceships.\n\nI really quite like it.  \n\nI was playing it on an Xbox controller, but found it a little frustrating. I switched to WASD/Mouse, and to be honest (apart from still needing to get used to some of the keys) it's much nicer. I guess it all comes down to what you prefer.\n\nThe sound is good. The music is typically B-grade scifi. The plot is non-existant, but the game itself is engaging enough.\nNothing's been particularly difficult so far.\n\nIf you're not a fan of the B-grade movie thing, then the attention to detail on this one is probably going to be lost on you Without this theme, it's really nothing amazing to write home about. With it, however, it's a lot of fun.\n\nWhether it'll hold attention for subsequent play-throughs, I don't know.\n\nCurrently on around 35% special. Certainly worth the money so far.\n\nEDIT - Took me five hours to complete on 'regular' mode, and probably will need to sit idle for a while before I can be bothered replaying it, but it was fun while it lasted. Nice twist at the end, though the final boss fight was a bit of a let-down, given some of the more fun boss fights earlier on.\nIf I was to give any advice, I'd say crank this up to HARD before playing.

These developers do. This game is so charming, and so much fun, and so packed full of variety, that for once it just seems churlish to pick apart the bad points. So here we go... Slightly annoying camera, got stuck in a few bits of scenery, film scratches, but no filmic technicolour look or film softening added to the image to nail the era. It's a little rough, basically. And YET, every time you're feeling a little bored, a new fun power-up appears, a new monster makes you laugh, you discover a mini-pilotwings challenge. A new kitsch-y homage, a new idea lies around every corner. The music is FANTASTIC, nailing the old sci-fi sound. This is a game packed with attention to detail, love and craft.\n\nMy one major niggle - the grating Director's commentary. The VO script is a great compliment to the main action, adding backstory, staving off repetition... but the actor?

It's a 3rd person brawler with a 50's sci-fi aesthetic that is out of this world. This is the best looking game I've ever played. All of the environments are richly detailed and interesting to look at. The retro future look is done so well here. It's even better than in the Fallout series. The only problem I had with the look was some of the enemies are supposed to look like choppy stop-motion animation monsters, but they just come across looking poorly animated instead of that classic stop-motion animation look. The soundtrack has some really good songs that further sell the feel of the game world.  The combat is standard, but the sci-fi themed weapons are a lot of fun to use. The goal of the game is essentially to get to the top of a tower to defeat the big baddie.  This game is really more about the journey than the destination, though. The setup of the game is that a director is giving commentary on one of his old films so he's constantly explaining what's going on in the action and supposed back stories for actors that worked on the 'film'. This commentary adds yet another layer to the campy of fun of the game that is a constant blast to play through. The campaign itself took less than 5 hours to finish, but this is such a fun game world to explore that I bothered to get all the achievements. I was completely dazzled and blown away by this game.

This game is probably about the closest that any of us can reasonably expect to come to such an experience...\n\n\nThe game is a basic isometric hack and slash adventure game. Action-wise it is not trying to reinvent the genre. However it is cast in a very inventive way: You are acting out the actions of the protagonists of a classic \"B\" movie being re-released on DVD while the director of the movie gives commentary about the film's production.\n\nThe presentation of the game is outstanding. It looks very much like an old sci-fi/horror flick from the 50's or 60's, complete with cheesy special effects such as visible strings holding flying creatures aloft. \n\n\"The effects guys promised me the strings wouldn't be visible...\"\n\nIn addition to the awesome graphical presentation the director of the film is constantly talking about the production whilst throwing off many off-color stories of his egomaniacal excesses and abuses of power. This commentary is absolutely hilarious at times. Best of all, the narrator reacts to the things that you do, especially when you do things that are off-script or if you take your time in an area. \n\nTo sum it up, the game is a hilarious sendup of the best of the worst of Hollywood and a fun action game at the same time. Highly recommended, especially to anyone old enough to have at least seen these types of movies on late night tv.", "timestamp_created": 1453375477, "timestamp_updated": 1453375631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20656018": {"recommendationid": "20656018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175985637", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458188670}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u96be\u5f97\u7684\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u7684\u6e38\u620f\n\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4fef\u89c6\u4e0a\u5e1d\u89c6\u89d2\u52a8\u4f5c\u95ef\u5173RPG\u6ca1\u6709\u5751\u7239\u7684\u5237\u5237\u7684\u73af\u8282\n\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u5fc5\u62c5\u5fc3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6389\u5751\u5fc5\u6b7b\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u4f60\u6545\u610f\u7684\n\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5f88\u591a\u8bbe\u5b9a\u80fd\u65b9\u4fbf\u7684\u8ba9\u4f60\u63a2\u7d22\u8d85\u5927\u7684\u5730\u56fe\n\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\u8bd9\u8c10\u5e7d\u9ed8\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u4f1a\u88ab\u65c1\u767d\u5bfc\u6f14\u7684\u7280\u5229\u5410\u69fd\u5438\u5f15\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\n\u7279\u4ef7\uff01\uff01\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1453360498, "timestamp_updated": 1453360498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20655342": {"recommendationid": "20655342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059673205", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453401585}, "language": "english", "review": "An excelent game. It is a comedy, but the comedy does not get in the way of the gameplay and actually improves on the experience. Secrets and collectables can improve the gameplay thourgh upgrades, but I found that I did not need to collect them all to finish the game. \n\nThis game encourages exploration but it has a streamlined sense of continual progression. This is what I would say is it's greatest strength. You can fall down the Deadly Tower to get bonuses or reach secret areas without losing any progress. \n\nIn fact... there are two mechanics which I say make this game flow perfectly, without which would have made The Deadly Tower of Monsters a frustrating mess otherwise:\n1) Checkpoints that, once you reach them for the first time, you can teleport to at any moment. This makes exploration breezy and also allows the player to have a sense of progression and sucess. \n2) An ability that allows you to teleport back to a platform you just fell from. This inclusion was pure genious. First, you can fall great hieghts to get items like rings and not have to backtrack. If you miss a landing (which you will do A LOT) you can try again immediately. If an enemy knocks you off a platform... it is no loss, simply teleport back into the fight!\n\nThese two gameplay elements, in my opinion, make this game wonderful.\n\nThere are some other points of note:\nPros:\n-Loading times are great. You can seemlessly fall down to a lower level without a loading screen. Teleporting up to a higher level happens in moments. \n-It runs very well. If you don't like the esthetic (choppy, like an old movie would be)... you can change that. \n-A large variety of enemies. \n-The hilarity of dying (the load *thump* and subsequent ragdolling, combined with the comentary, always gets me).\n-I would call the sound design great. The soundtrack in particular really captures the feel of an old 30's sci-fi b-movie like Flash Gordon.\n\nCons:\n-The upgrade system is a bit... janky... (gold is so abundant it does not factor into anything, for example. I forgot I had it). \n-The camera can be a bit wonky sometimes.\n-Some weapons are utterly useless (bye bye shiv). Others are very OP. (lasergun FTW!)\n-Movement in general can be frustrating at certain moments. Three of note are: Trying to land on a small platform using the jetpack, using sprint on conveyor belts, one or two sections where the camrea angle makes platforming a nightmare.\n\nOverall I enjoyed The Deadly Tower of Monsters very, very much!

I did this game in one sitting and honestly it was great fun, the interactions between the narrator and the characters actions can be quite funny at times. This said however there isnt much to do after completion, sure you can collect the missions which are basically achievements but even that wasnt something to keep me wanting to play more on an finished save. I think maybe some dlc would be fun, like a new area to extend the tower or perhaps go lower. Anyways as far as combat goes it does vary. Different probs such as gun and melee weapons are unlocked as you go but some arent really worth using. For example the first weapon you get in the game i stuck with because it was fast and did damage, i only ever swapped it when i got the lightsaber as it allowed me to do the same thing but with stun every so often and reflecting bullets. Idk maybe a small thing that is wrong with the game and it didnt push me enough to hate the game but i wish the weapons were more balance i guess. So overall the game is great, has and interesting and creative story along with some blast from the past.

Enemies on strings, stop motion enemies, someones nephew in a suit...it's got all the clich\u00e9s.

The camera can be a bit wonky when using a keyboard and mouse, more so if you try and go somewhere the game never meant for you to go. The level desgin is amazing and leads to very solid platforming 99% of the time. The fact that you are almost constently moving up with no loading screens really gives you a sense of hight and then jumping off the tower to go get some hidden item really shows how much thought they put into the game and the titular tower.\n\nWhile the game is solid all around and fun the real place it shines is the love for B-movies. The sense of humor and the presentation are spot on. The VHS effects, the stop motion animation on enemies, the set pieces, all of it just works togeather. This is the video game you wanted as a kid, even if thats back when video games were pong. Yet you don't have to be old and or a fan of B-movies to enjoy the game and its off beat sense of humor. It's early in the year but this has already earned a place on my personal top games of the year list and if people have any sense it will make it on theirs as well.\n", "timestamp_created": 1453257464, "timestamp_updated": 1453257464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 100, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20635171": {"recommendationid": "20635171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141710784", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457064530}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only put a few hours into this game but it is an awesome game!

The director is what is making the game for me, amongst others.\n\nThe monsters: in the time that I have played, I have killed crabs, lizards, yetis, slime blobs, 3 different kind of dinosaurs, ufo's, king kong-type gorilla, and I'm sure I've missed more. But each of these monsters are unique in how they attack. So I love that aspect of it.\n\nThe Combat: It's amazing. Shoot, melee, special skills, and roll. The melee weapons and guns have been rolling in so far. I'm sure I still have much more to find. Only downside, You can only hold two of each at a time. \n\nFinal Summary: I would give them game a chance. But if you're a kid, I don't think you would understand the humor in the game.

I am a massive fan of ACE Team. Their imaginative creations never cease to amaze. Yet again they have produced another winner, with a game that takes on a surrealistic approach to movies with amazing visuals and audio. \n\nFirstly may I say, that this game could be enjoyed simply for the voice acting and audio. The game basically revolves around you watching a director's cut of an old film, except you are obviously playing as the main character of the film, an astronaut who has crash landed on an alien planet. The Director will commentate on your surroundings, the story and pretty much everything else. For instance I started spinning around and he just started going on about how the main actor loved to spin in circles, it was even the reason they chose him during the role casting sessions! Even if you go afk he will start to say things like \"At this point he forgot his lines and didn't know what to do\". So yeah, if you like a laugh, buy this game right now!\n\nThe music and visuals are both equally great. The game should run fine on nearly all systems as it isn't too demanding, and is capped to 60fps. The visuals and audio can have one of two filters, either VHS or DVD. These obviously change the quality of both and add a different feel to the game. I highly suggest using VHS as this is how the devs intended the game to be played. The characters and enemies are all amazingly detailed, kingkong and dinosaurs are stop motion animated, giving them that nostalgic and authentic look and feel. Kingkong's hand when he grabs you is even on a stick! This game stays true to so many movie tropes it's unbelievable and equates to the funniest game I've had the pleasure of playing in a long time.\n\nGameplay itself is very solid, as I'm not a massive fan of top down games, torchlight etc... But this game gets it right. Behind the great visuals, audio, and \"story\" is a solid set of combat mechanics. You find new weapons, can upgrade them, and do powerful special abilities. Throw in the massive variety of enemies and you've got yourself a really fulfilling and satisfying game.\n\nMy only gripe with the game so far is the options menu. I think that some of the labels should be changed when using a keyboard, for instance to apply changes it just says press the \"app\" key. Turns out this is enter, which is pretty much common sense. But I think it should just say \"enter\". As I said, this is just a tiny flaw that if fixed up will make the game a classic.\n\nDo I suggest buying this? Yes! Go buy it now, you won't regret it. If you are a fan of ACE Team there's even more reason to buy it, help support these guys. They make really individual games that I wish other people took inspiration from. If you love movies, then yeah. You may wanna buy this simply for the near infinite references and elbow nudges to famous movies.", "timestamp_created": 1453244683, "timestamp_updated": 1453316906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654130", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20631673": {"recommendationid": "20631673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011687870", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454023009}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich habe selten so ein lustiges Spiel gespielt, es ist wie ein Flash Gordon Trip und l\u00e4uft komplett...keinerlei Abst\u00fcrze oder bugs.

The old throwback SciFi movie plots, the weapons, the Monsters!\n\nI really enjoy the visual appeal and the voice acting, thus-far, has been superb! Corney jokes and witticisms abound but does not detract as they actually progress with your game-play. Dinosaurs? Yes Dinosaurs! But how one particular large specimen was realized is a funny story.. lol..\n\nTime to wrap this up as I'm sure someone more witty and verbose will come in and break down ever aspect but for me I'm just enjoying what it is and not what it's not. It's lighthearted, action packed [BAM!, POW! BooM!] and really tickles my funsies..\n\n~Icky", "timestamp_created": 1453233066, "timestamp_updated": 1453233066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 92, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828675", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20628911": {"recommendationid": "20628911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052566554", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476305955}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Best 70's game", "timestamp_created": 1453231716, "timestamp_updated": 1453231716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20627432": {"recommendationid": "20627432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169311898", "num_games_owned": 2029, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512901088}, "language": "english", "review": "Unless you grew up watching movies like Clash of the Titans, 20 Million Miles to Earth, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, Jason and the Argonauts and any other number of Ray Harryhausen or Harryhausen-esque pictures, you'll really be missing the point of [b]The Deadly Tower of Monsters[/b] which would be a shame; strip away the B-movie aesthetics of the game and you're left with a mostly unremarkable but mindlessly enjoyable top-down beat-em-up that pits you against everything from evil apes to flying saucers to giant ants.\n\nWith that said, I can't overstate how brilliantly that low-budget sci-fi influence is realised. The scenery looks cobbled together from cheap rubber and styrofoam. Enemies are either obviously stuntmen in suits or stop-motion effects. Many times, you can see the strings holding them up or the boom mic appearing in cutscenes. The plot is authentically nonsensical. Every facet of the aged Hollywood magic that made those films what they were is present, correct and jammed full of obscure references and Easter eggs; rarely has a game shown so much devotion and love to its subject matter.\n\nNot quite as endearing, however, is the commentary track that runs throughout the playtime. [b]TDTOM[/b] is presented as a DVD re-release with the director and his production assistant firing out quips every thirty seconds or so and while it's been exhaustively written and is fairly humorous on occasion, there is just far too much of it. A lot of times, the two voices will be jabbering on, fully subtitled, while you're trying to hack your way through a major battle or set-piece so you wind up missing what they're saying by way of trying to concentrate on not getting crushed by a plasticine brontosaur.\n\nThere's a metric arseload of weapons to grab as you go, some far more useful than others, which can be upgraded with cogs that you find as you progress. Annoyingly, your loadout only allows for two ranged and two melee weapons at a time which wouldn't be a huge deal if the game didn't force you to find a terminal every time you wanted to change them. The worst part about this setup is that every time you pick up a new weapon, one of your current ones gets elbowed out of your inventory. Having fun with your ultra-powerful Tesla cannon? Not any more! Have this crappy flamethrower instead! Even better, have it while you're being literally SWARMED by waves of killer ants! \n\nThe character stat upgrade system is more pleasing and innovative. You're not rewarded with skill points by way of XP; rather, the game has you complete various objectives, many of which are completely optional. While you'll usually get one for killing a boss, taking down a giant dinosaur with a knife is all on you. It adds depth to a game that is, at times, lumbered with mechanics that sorely need it.\n\nStill, [b]TDTOM[/b] has more than enough style and bare bones playability to be worth a try, especially for fans of the genre it inhabits. It's a forgivingly easy game; you can make it through without a good deal of the upgrades available but as a love letter to those creaky, weird and wonderful pictures that entranced me as a kid, you'll find none better.\n\nCheck out the first fifteen minutes below: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OX-WFoqZTs", "timestamp_created": 1453226516, "timestamp_updated": 1453226823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 221, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852977", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20627418": {"recommendationid": "20627418", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991342089", "num_games_owned": 670, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453301809}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1][b]The Deadly Tower of Monsters[/b] \u2013 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0437\u044c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439:[/h1]\n\n\u0414\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0442\u044b \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f 2?

Acquisto obbligato per gli amanti del genere, che rimarranno piacevolmente sorpresi dai numerosissimi riferimenti presenti, talvolta espliciti, talvolta ben nascosti. Proprio la suddetta carica umoristica, incentrata sulle debolezze e le precariet\u00e0 delle produzioni a basso budget tipiche del passato, costituisce il punto forte dell'opera di ACE, rendendola spiritosa, coinvolgente e narrativamente originale.\n\nDTOM ha carattere da vendere, nonostante, a livello prettamente ludico, non presenti contenuti particolarmente innovativi o degni di nota.\n\nTrattasi comunque di una piacevole sorpresa, per un titolo che da una parte opta per una tipologia di gioco adatta pressoch\u00e9 alla totalit\u00e0 dei giocatori, dall'altra sceglie un tema, cinematograficamente parlando, per pochi.\n\n\nLeggi la recensione completa su [url=http://www.cyberludus.com/a/the-deadly-tower-of-monsters-il-film-di-fantascienza-recensione/154627]Cyberludus.[/url]\n\n\nDa marzo 2016, su Steam trovi anche la nostra pagina Curatore, con i migliori titoli Indie e alternativi: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/cyberludusitalia/", "timestamp_created": 1453226438, "timestamp_updated": 1459419919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 825, "total_negative": 100, "total_reviews": 925}}

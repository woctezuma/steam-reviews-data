It's got nicer art, and a nicer soundtrack than UBERMOSH as well. You don't have to click any buttons to shoot, you're always shooting, and I think that's part of what makes it easier than UBERMOSH--one less thing to worry about. SWARMRIDERS also has better indication of when you're about to be extracted from the game, instead of having a respawn counter in the upper left corner of the screen, you have a health percentage counter that's surrounding the motorcycle you're on, and changes colour from yellow to red once you've hit 25% (or possibly 20%, 15% or 10%. I'm not sure because the game goes so fast that I'm usually dead very soon after I hit that point).

For now, it's a bit short and plays far more like a proof of concept than an actual game, lasting a total of ~5 minutes for 100% completion if you get the hang of it fairly quickly.\n\nOne major improvement compared to the Ubermosh series is that it plays far more \"fairly.\" Whereas Ubermosh likes to spawn enemies above and below you in a way that's hard to react to, this game warns you far in advance of the challenges you're about to face. The controls are also responsive, but it's easy to get lost in all the explosions and forget exactly where you're firing in some cases, just like in Ubermosh. It may only be a difference of a centimeter, but it's enough to make the difference between clearing the screen and being swarmed.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints is one I have with all of Walter's games here on Steam, and it's that most of the games don't really go anywhere. They don't develop. They're short, somewhat one dimensional arcade experiences that are more or less predictable. If more time was spent creating a deeper game, perhaps with levels or something at least, the quality would improve dramatically as the structure is already mostly solid.", "timestamp_created": 1504410015, "timestamp_updated": 1504410015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34686050": {"recommendationid": "34686050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007220143", "num_games_owned": 1095, "num_reviews": 246, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504361103}, "language": "english", "review": "that was intense :) \n\nbut optimalization. \n\noverall funny for 5 min from time to time", "timestamp_created": 1504361169, "timestamp_updated": 1504361169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477941", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34487436": {"recommendationid": "34487436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069180353", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504907480}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool soundtrack I guess.", "timestamp_created": 1503686746, "timestamp_updated": 1503686746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34471808": {"recommendationid": "34471808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255296374", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518987082}, "language": "english", "review": "it's cool for what it is \n\n5/10\n\nEDIT: in my original review i did not account for how badass the sound track is \n\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1503626381, "timestamp_updated": 1510632335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34418881": {"recommendationid": "34418881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048343952", "num_games_owned": 1304, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503014762}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u5b9f\u7e3e\u3060\u3051\u306f\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u9054\u6210\u3067\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u65e5\u306e\u4f53\u8abf\u3068\u904b\u306b\u5de6\u53f3\u3055\u308c\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u65e5\u3092\u7f6e\u3044\u3066\u601d\u3044\u7acb\u3063\u305f\u3068\u304d\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u7bb1\u30b3\u30f3\u63a8\u5968\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1503417730, "timestamp_updated": 1503417730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34188751": {"recommendationid": "34188751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271318087", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512168479}, "language": "english", "review": "Arcade game that makes fun in it's own way.", "timestamp_created": 1502535569, "timestamp_updated": 1502535569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33986808": {"recommendationid": "33986808", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986214361", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501743220}, "language": "english", "review": "You have to concentrate and stay focused for a couple of minutes if you want to get a high score.

A \"machine gun swarm surfing minigame\" made as a bonus content for the UBERMOSH community...Players can expect a few minutes of elegant gameplay, responsive controls and a heart pumping original soundtrack. [/quote] \n\n[i]\"Players can [u]expect[/u] a few minutes of [u]elegant gameplay[/u], [u]responsive controls[/u] and a heart pumping original soundtrack.\"[/I] \n\nOh, REALLY?! *Turns green* Rips my own hair out & F$#king smash my pc to bits and pound the earth until it cracks into the core and explode from the milky way system.. This ain't another one of my 'brutal honest mode review' but it could've easily been one. \n\n*Bites a mouth piece, with red eyes and continues to write*\n\nWhat is it about?\nAs the product description says, SWARMRIDERS (SR) is an endless runner, a shoot em up arcade type of game. You control a bike with 2 person; 1 rider and a 'gunner'. Your goal is to survive as long as you possible can from the swarm (of aliens?)\n\nThe Controls, Visuals\nVery simple controls. Standard WSAD keyboard and mouse. It supports controller too.\nVisually, the entire theme is set in a dark world kinda-feel. So it's dark. The only colors you'll be seeing is white, red stripes from these aliens? (I don't know what to call these because I don't play UBERMOSH) and purple rays from your gunner. And a tiny yellow wording below the bike to show your bike's life. The rest? BLACK. and, and The game engine seems to be running on DOS engine like meaning to say there's PIXELS! \n\n\nMy personal thoughts\nHow bad can this get right? You just control a bike and shoot off swarm of aliens.\n\nAfter 20 minutes of gameplay. Switches off the speaker. The Heart pumping soundtrack is killing me.\n\nThere is no level progression. There is no weapon/bike/anything to upgrade! There is no story There is nothing! You only control the bike, you shoot off all this freaking aliens swarming on your screen and hope to survive until 1 min 50 sec to obtain 100% achievement and uninstall this product. It's that Simple & Honest. Because there is nothing to keep consumer engage to this product. 2 minute tops product shelf life. \n\nThe way I am playing this game is no way near what the product describes: ELEGANT.\nI am like a mad man moving my mouse like a maniac. To the point my whole PC table is trembling. FPS RTS RPG RACING games HORROR GAMES SIM GAMES - I've never played until my whole PC TABLE IS ROCKING BUT THIS PRODUCT MADE ME DO SO! ELEGANT?! *vomits more blood*\n\nDon't talk to me about responsive control when I am literally moving the mouse like a maniac. \nOk, controls are working beautifully. No bugs. No glitches. For this, I'll give SR the deserving credit. 60 FPS and my mouse is responsive -my screen is filled with purple lasers- \n\nNow for the rant. 2 things puzzles me..and disappointed me greatly.\n[olist]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[*]Aliens attacking you from outside the view?!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[*]Alien explodes on death and releases a FREAKING GIANT PIXELLATE CLOUD?!\n[/olist] \n\nI have to ask. Was this design choice intentional? Was it to give players challenge? Was this the best thing the dev could think of? \n\nFrom the aspect of Design, I am really disappointed. How could you design enemies that attack players outside of the view? That's cheap and unfair - the aliens come in hordes of and they can even outrun your bike. So why is it that you allow them to attack players from top and bottom out-of-the-screen? which is why if you take a look at some of the feedbacks, people are saying this game is more of a luck rather than skill. \n\nOn top of that, the aliens explodes on death and release this crazy epic huge smoke (PIXELS!) FOG of WAR that blocks the user view to be able to see how many more swarm are coming. By the time the fog starts to dissipates, it would be too late to dodge.\n\n\nAs a dev, if this is the best you can think of to provide \"challenge\" to your consumer? You may not realize it but you are shooting yourself in the foot with this 2 design choice. I, for one will remember the horrible experience and I will make sure not to invest in any future product developed by you. I am sorry but take look at steam. There are TONS of indie games. (Some are horrible BUT) There are better product out there with better gameplay, engagement and more fun as compared to SR. What reasons should I support you after experiencing such a negative gameplay experience ?\n\nNow, the next thing I am disappointed is at the steam community who supports this product. While It may be unfair to say so because everyone has different preference but coming from the 2 design issue: it seems the community is open to accepting games that makes enemy attack players outside of the view/fov? This is a dangerous sign. If other developer picks up this idea and start giving us this sort of game..are you really going to support them? Do you really want to see more of this kind of game? \n\nIf you answered yes - okay, fine. At least you are aware about the consequences [u][b]BUT[/b][/u] \nIf you answered NO - then please stop supporting/up voting this sort of games. Stop saying negative/funny description and still upvoting this sort of game. Once the trend picks up, It's hard to hold them back. Look at CS, Dota, king of hills, smite? look at how many variants has appeared?!  \n\nMy Summary\nDo I want to see another similar product on steam? Do I want to go through this sort of gameplay experience? The answer is a simple [b][u]NO[/u][/b]. I don't care if a game is FREE or cost me $200. If it has issues, it has issues. A free game does not give warrant itself \"to have issues\". If that's the sort of mentality people are having - then you should be in \"open beta\"/\"alpha\" games where you can feast on ALLLLL the issues you want.\n\nSo, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for SWARMRIDERS is an [b]EPIC ELEGANT[/b] score worth 4/10.\n\n*Gets down from the bike. Take me aliens. Take me now & End my misery so I can stop rocking my god damn table*", "timestamp_created": 1495186745, "timestamp_updated": 1495191175, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

You ride a bike, shoot the swarm at best you could and delay the inevitable end for as long as possible. Each run will last around 1-3 minutes each, depending on how good or lucky you are. Trying to beat the best score would fill you with pure adrenalin every single time and getting the 4 achievements will make you break out a serious sweat.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the game is perfect though, for one I think the particle effects were too pervasive on the screen, I could hardly see where the swarm is half the time. The bullet spread is a bit of a hit-or-miss thing as well, making a lone bug much more dangerous than the pack where it derived from.\n\nLastly, I wish Steam leader board was implemented; it would have given me a better incentive to keep playing. Monster and weapon variation would have been nice too, but that\u2019s probably out of the game\u2019s original scope.\n\nLooking for a quick game to play?

There's not much to talk about but i do have some issues despite the fantastically fun gameplay and great art style, so let's start by the bad things. The game as simple as it is, it is somewhat difficult as you move on scoring higher times, and you take on swarms of endless hordes in a dark, black and white and badass enviroment. But there's one issue with the visuals that affect the gameplay, which is cool for your bike but really is annoying for the enemies, it is the full on fog by killing the enemies. I get it, to make it more difficult, but it is so much fog it literally is unfair and just not good and would be better if toned down a lot more or if just not there. Not only that but as you take on swarms and swarms of enemies, with a plasma gun and motor-byke, you'd expect to at least LOW DOWN the fog. As i'm writing this review i just can't stop thinking of its fantastic soundtrack which just seems like a remixed version of some of the tunes and music tracks from UBERMOSH as it is in the same universe so it does make sense, but it still is so fantastically badass and it makes the gameplay so much more fun. There isn't much on the game so the problems that there exist affect the gameplay, which is mainly the fog or the principle of moving around while you know it's not gonna work much as just going up and down from the far right of the screen is the way of survival. The fog still is constantly annoying though, as enemies can come from sides you never expect them from making it hard to even dodge enemies without getting damage from enemies you didn't know existed, while in Ubermosh you knew they existed and nearly all the time when you died it was your fault, not the game's fault. This is still though, a very good game, all i wished is that its fog was lowered down and better system for enemy spawning and then more content and this is surely a 10 but so far, it's the rating i'll show you soon enough only for its annoying fog and enemies spawning from bad places.\n\n8.9/10 ~Fantastic game and some annoying design choices.", "timestamp_created": 1466960456, "timestamp_updated": 1482191251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23807802": {"recommendationid": "23807802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074670030", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472240864}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun", "timestamp_created": 1466894917, "timestamp_updated": 1466894917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23794196": {"recommendationid": "23794196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023853521", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472174719}, "language": "english", "review": "It features some very interesting gameplay concepts.

The longer you last, the more patches/achievements you collect. That's it, now you know the game. No power-ups and no do-overs in this twin-stick shooter. I imagine SWARMRIDERS would gobble all the quarters at an arcade, it's addicting, like licking peanut butter off a knife.\n\nA mass of enemies tears ass towards your riders from the left side of the screen, enemies that flank to the top and bottom tend to coral you to the middle right side. It's possible to comfortably stay in that sweet spot early on, but eventually you'll be forced to put your reflexes to the test as you frantically weave around the increasing enemies, sometimes even charging directly into the oncoming horde, gasping for precious seconds of breathing room.\n\nLasting 150 seconds earns you all 4 patches and achievements, and while not impossible, it can definitely feel like it. Aiming with the mouse feels like the aiming reticle is cutting through a layer of molasses, you may need to externally twerk your mouse sensitivity because the game doesn't have any built-in options (other than \"kill\" or \"die horribly\" of course). However, it plays great with a gamepad, the controls are snappy.\n\nLike Machado's previous UBERMOSH games, the music alone is worth giving these games a go. There's post-apoc surfer-metal, groovy cumbia-metal, and even a thrashing of booty-thumping cyber-metal, like something out of a Batman Beyond episode.\n\nThe \"title track\" is my favorite, it plays over the sketchy painting of our two protagonists blasting the gunk out those alien starfish creatures with the maybe buttfaces. It's a melanchololy tune that hints at a dark past and blazing future, which we know almost nothing about because there's very little lore shared by the developer. This game's intro screen gives us one sentence, explaining these events take place hundreds of years before the UBERMOSH games. The lore in those games is more enlightening, but even combined they only give us a few sentences.\n\nI think this is to everyone's benefit though. This way the dev doesn't have to sweat an elaborate backstory, but through pixels and gameplay gives us enough dirt on this series to plant the seeds of our own crazy headcannon (like the slanty-lettered blurb at the top of this review). Walter Machado birthed one of the most fascinating universes in video game history, and he did it with only a handful of sentences! Your imagination will run wild fleshing out this 'verse and its characters, their schemes and motivations, their uncertain future.\n\nThank you, Walter, for this gift.", "timestamp_created": 1466629666, "timestamp_updated": 1466629666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624991", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23711710": {"recommendationid": "23711710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079324645", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466621976}, "language": "english", "review": "it took me 2 tries to get all achievments 10/10 would ride again", "timestamp_created": 1466622026, "timestamp_updated": 1466622026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23698139": {"recommendationid": "23698139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093220384", "num_games_owned": 1368, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466561395}, "language": "english", "review": "A short, free game given as thanks to the UBERMOSH community, SWARMRIDERS is an endless runner type game mixed with a twin stick shooter and backed by a vaguely industrial soundtrack. Use WASD or the left control stick to move a bike around the screen, and right stick or mouse to aim your shots at swarms of flying robo squid thingies chasing after you.\n\nI've yet to play any of the UBERMOSH games, so I've no idea how this ties into them at all since there's no explanation for anything, but then again, everything about the game is intentionally minimalist. There's only one enemy type, no form of upgrades or real progression, a pretty basic art style, and a handful of music tracks. It comes across not too dissimilar to a bonus stage between main levels of a bigger game, or at the very least like a neat little browser title, but I get the sense it really isn't trying to be anything more than that and is content to be a neat little distraction with some slight challenge, hence why it's being offered free.\n\nIt's entirely one-note in almost every way, and while that's not necessarily bad for what it sets out to be, it did end up leaving me wanting more, though not exactly in a good way. If anything, it mostly made me wish for additional features more so than actual content. As best I can tell, unless it was being completely masked by the music, there's no other sound effects in the game. That lack of audio feedback really hurts it and makes it feel devoid of a certain amount of pep and life that I think it would greatly benefit from, especially as I wasn't particularly into the music that it relies upon so heavily and I ended up muting the game after 10 or 15 minutes (sorry to all those that love it). Nor are there any kind of settings or options, so I couldn't do anything to address those issues either. It would have been nice to be able to turn off the cursor whilst playing with a control pad, but maybe that's just me and everyone else would be thankful to have it.\n\nThere are no additional modes to try or leaderboards to work through, or even a score to rack up, nothing to do other than last as long as you can and unlock a few achievements. Depending on their skill levels, some might do that their first try and get no more than a few minute's worth out of this, others might spend an hour or two on it and never get bored in the slightest during that time. I do really wish this was something greater with some substance that I could really sink my teeth into and play for hours, but as it is I mostly found it an adequate time-waster that has its charms but that you feel could go a whole lot further if it had just a little bit more.", "timestamp_created": 1466565679, "timestamp_updated": 1466565679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528655", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23696416": {"recommendationid": "23696416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080208738", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 144, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466805598}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh.

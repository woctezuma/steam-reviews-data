I loved their pixel style and their arcade action that's executed wonderfully with Titan Attacks!, Droid Assault and Revenge of the Titan to name a few.\n\nHowever, I don't feel this way with Ultratron. The style, sound, music and all of the nice traits you'd find in their other games are here. But it might be because there's just too much going on and it would mess with the player's eyes eventually if you play too long.\n\nThis game is, to me, the weakest entry and at the bottom of the ranks with their games. The visuals are too distracting and it's hard to pay attention between the explosions, the rapid movement of your character and the enemies. The distortion effect that is a common trait with all of these games, happens at random. It doesn't necessarily make the game better when it's just another added nuisance with everything else happening.\n\nAll of that just turned me off with this entry.

Man muss einfach Wellen von Gegner \u00fcberleben. Hierbei gibt es nur zwei Regeln, die man wirklich beachten muss: Regel 1: Baller auf alles was sich bewegt. Regel 2: Baller auf alles was sich nicht bewegt. Die Angriffswellen sind in einzelne Level geordnet, mehrere Angriffswellen pro Level, zwischen den Leveln hat man die Gelegenheit seinen Bot aufzuleveln und neue Sachen f\u00fcr ihn zu kaufen, mit dem Geld welches man in den Leveln aufgesammelt hat. Ca. alle 10 Level kommt ein Boss, es gibt vier Bosse im Spiel, hat man alle besiegt kommt ein Endless Mode. \n\n\n\u25ba Community:\n\nViel gibt es \u00fcber die Community nicht zusagen, es ist ja ein Offline Game. Der einzige Ort wo man wirklich was mit der Community zutuen hat ist das Online Highscore Board. Man kann dieses Spiel aber offline zu zweit auf der Couch spielen. Was auch schon ziemlich bockt, da dieses Spiel stellvertretend zu Marioparty, oder Mariokart, Freundschaften zerst\u00f6ren kann. Ich spreche aus Erfahrung.\n\n\u25ba Entwickler:\n\nAn sich gibt es keine Updates. Dieses Spiel braucht aber auch keine Updates, es ist klein und braucht nichts weiteres. Dieses Spiel ist so wie es hier gerade steht fertig.\n\n\u25ba Gameplay:\n\nWie f\u00fcr ein Shoot'm Up typisch, ballern bis sich die Balken biegen und ausweichen bis einem schwindelig ist. Das sch\u00f6ne an diesem Spiel ist es befolgt die sch\u00f6ne Regel Easy to learn, hard to master. W\u00e4rend man noch im Level Modus sch\u00f6n an das Spiel herrangef\u00fchrt wird, verlangt es einem im Endless Modus alles ab. Die Gegner schie\u00dfen und bewegen sich schneller, die Patronen fliegen rassanter, die Gegner halten mehr aus und es werden mehr Gegner auf einen drauf geschmiessen. Zwar gibt es Abwechslung bei den Gegnern und beim eigenen Gameplay z.b. durch die Granaten die man sp\u00e4ter freischalten kann, aber wen man einmal das Muster der unterschiedlichen Gegner durchschaut hat, kann es durchaus auch gerne mal etwas eint\u00f6niger werden, nicht unbedingt langweiliger. Sehr sch\u00f6n ist es \u00fcbrigens auch das man sich sp\u00e4ter auch aussuchen kann, ab welchen Boss man starten m\u00f6chte, wen man ihn besiegt hat, und man nicht immer wieder von Anfang an starten muss, wen man den Endless Modus freigeschaltet hat kann man auch von ihm aus starten. Alles im einem aber ein sch\u00f6nes Gameplay.\n\n\u25ba Grafik:\n\nEine sch\u00f6ne liebevolle Retro Grafik. Die es aber auch Zeitgleich schafft an ein modernes Arcade Spiel zu errinern. Ist aber nicht unbedingt f\u00fcr jeden was, da Ultratron doch ein hang zu extremen Farbspecktackeln hat.  \n\n\u25ba Individualit\u00e4t:\n\nIm Spiel kann man leider eigentlich so gut wie garnichts Personalisieren, bis auf die Level Ups deines Bots, da dass aber im Endeffekt immer das selbe ist macht das auch keinen so gro\u00dfen Unterschied. Das man nicht soviel personalisieren kann ist aber nicht weiter schlimm, da dieses Spiel ja eh eher ein Offline Titel ist. \n\n\u25ba Oberfl\u00e4che:\n\nZwar ist alles so ein bisschen verschwommen, aber das ist wegen dem Design so und bricht der Krone keinen Zacken ab. Alle Men\u00fcs sind klar und verst\u00e4ndlich positioniert. Man kann sofort sehen wo was ist. \n\n\u25ba Musik:\n\nMusik ist geschmacks Sache und meinen Geschmack hat es sowas von perfekt getroffen, man sollte die Musik aber nicht zulaut aufdrehen, es ist halt eine 8-Bit Musik. \n\n\u25ba Story:\n\nIm Spiel wird fast so gut wie nichts auf die Story hingewiesen, wer aber sehr gut aufpasst kann sich was zusammen reimen. [spoiler] Alle Menschen wurden, aufgrund eines Fehlers bei einer Firma namens Omnicorp, augerottet. Nur du konntest \u00fcberleben da dein Gehirn in einen Roboter gesetzt wurde und nun musst du dich gegen alle durchgeknallten Roboter behaupten.[/spoiler] Aber an sich geht es ja eh mehr ums ballern.\n\n\u25ba Performance:\n\nSelbst bei gigantischen mengen an Gegner, kein einziger Ruckler. Dieses Spiel l\u00e4uft alls h\u00e4tte man es eing\u00f6lt, selbst auf schw\u00e4cheren PC's. Ich f\u00fcr meinen Teil konnte Ultratron ohne Probleme auf meinem Laptop spielen und das Teil kommt aus der Steinzeit. Auch im Multiplayer geht alles tip top. Um die Internetverbindung muss sich keine Gedanken gemacht werden, da nur eine f\u00fcrs Download ben\u00f6tigt wird.\n\n\u25ba Fazit:\n\nF\u00fcr Leute die Arcade Games und Shoot'm Ups lieben ist dieses Spiel pflicht, aber auch Leute die nicht soviel damit am Hut haben k\u00f6nnen sich dieses Spiel ruhig mal anschauen. Da dieses Spiel sowohl f\u00fcr Gelegnheits Spieler als auch f\u00fcr Langzeit Gamer was ist, kann man bei diesem Spiel mit 9,99\u20ac wirklich nicht viel Falsch machen. \n\nVon mir bekommt das Spiel ein Ranking von 7/10 Punkten.", "timestamp_created": 1502721232, "timestamp_updated": 1502808636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34134125": {"recommendationid": "34134125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172707293", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502364786}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043f\u0438\u0443 \u043f\u0438\u0443 \u0445\u0443\u043b*", "timestamp_created": 1502316423, "timestamp_updated": 1502316423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33915337": {"recommendationid": "33915337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022716480", "num_games_owned": 754, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501365096}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1]Ultratron - \u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u044d\u043a\u0448\u0435\u043d \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e, \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0439 Pappygames.[/h1]\n\n[b]\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0436\u0435 \u044f, \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0436\u0435, \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443?

If you like games of this type then get it. You wont be disappointed.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWARNING!: Like all video games , the FPS Image flashing can cause epileptic seizures if you are prone to such. \n\nYes it has a high volumn of bright flashing pretty lights.\n\nFor about 3 percent of people with epilepsy, exposure to flashing lights at certain intensities or to certain visual patterns can trigger seizures. This condition is known as photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nSeizures in photosensitive people may be triggered by exposure to some of the following situations:\n\n1: Television screens or computer monitors due to the flicker or rolling images.\n2: Certain video games or TV broadcasts containing rapid flashes or alternating patterns of different colors.\n3: Certain visual patterns, especially stripes of contrasting colors.\n\nNot all televisions, video games, computer monitors, and strobe lights trigger seizures, however. Even in predisposed individuals, many factors must combine to trigger the photosensitive reaction. Examples include:\n\n   1: Frequency of the flash (that is, how quickly the light is flashing)\n   2:  Brightness\n   3:  Contrast with background lighting\n   4:  Distance between the viewer and the light source\n   5: Wavelength of the light\n   6: Whether a person\u2019s eyes are open or closed\n\nThe frequency or speed of flashing light that is most likely to cause seizures varies from person to person. Generally, flashing lights most likely to trigger seizures are between the frequency of 5 to 30 flashes per second (Hertz).\n\n None-the-less, you should get this game.

and published by Puppy Games. It features top-down shooting with a very highly-stylised retro aesthetic. While one can expand on those two points, that's about what there is to it. It's a pretty simple game, and if you're looking for complex gameplay this isn't the place to look for it. What is here, however, is very highly-polished.\n\nThe game progresses through four coarse stages of a few levels each, culminating with a final boss at the end of each stage. The modes are kept varied by throwing in different stages that are essentially different game modes, for example, a \"Dodge stage\" whereby you must dodge away from a bunch of enemies without shooting them. The level variety does some way make up for the lack of enemy variety, but not quite. There's only a handful of true enemy types, although the actual number could be filled out somewhat since there are successive upgrades of others with minor cosmetic changes that mark their more powerful status.\n\nThe look of the game itself is what I would describe as pleasantly retro. It has that 8-bit look, but uses a full colour pallete and a variety of modern visual effects to add some jazz to the aesthetic. It comes together quite well, and with a complimentary retro sound design and chiptune-style music, the production oozes 'retro' from every pore. It's brilliant if that's the kind of thing you're looking for, though there are some that may be put off by the simplistic gameplay. If I had one complaint about the visual style its that sometimes the visual effects make it very hard to tell what's going on in the game sometimes. These distortion effects can be disabled in the options though, so it's not a big detriment to the game. If you have trouble with them as I do, you can just turn them off.\n\nUnfortunately, for all it's polish it's still a very simplistic game. No doubt if you like the genre you'll get your money's worth out of the game, and I know that's how I felt as I played it. At the same time, however, I feel it won't be sticking with me as much as other games such as Thomas Was Alone did. Its claim to fame: a highly-polished retro shooter, is also what kind of makes it wane in interest with time for me, as it's a very saturated genre indeed.\n\nAll in All [u]Ultratron[/u] is a really nice Indie-Action Game! \n\n8/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep [/i]", "timestamp_created": 1477837168, "timestamp_updated": 1477837168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26313887": {"recommendationid": "26313887", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998167405", "num_games_owned": 386, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 4200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492772350}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic Old skool Retro Arcade Shoot 'em Up!Best bang for your bucks right here.Great head nodding \"bassy\"soundtrack too which gives it that more modern feel...i love this to bits!EDIT>>\nMonster Boss's every x10 level's,x2 types of Perfect stages and Tons of space invaders:) Xbox controller works great,sit back and FIRE!..++++up to 4 Robots keep them alive and they level up,turning you into a Beast!Can't reccomend this Indie-ModernRetro Game enough,and it's still cheap enough.", "timestamp_created": 1477829421, "timestamp_updated": 1483400986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26097016": {"recommendationid": "26097016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172925593", "num_games_owned": 6072, "num_reviews": 722, "playtime_forever": 2823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477122820}, "language": "schinese", "review": "biubiubiu~\u723d\u5feb\u7684\u5c04\u51fb\u611f\n\u8981\u8bf4\u7f3a\u70b9\u7684\u8bdd\u5c31\u662f\u592a\u6643\u773c\uff0c\u5206\u4e0d\u6e05\u5b50\u5f39\u3001\u602a\u7269\u548c\u6389\u843d", "timestamp_created": 1476768860, "timestamp_updated": 1476768860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25979626": {"recommendationid": "25979626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004568914", "num_games_owned": 780, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484502019}, "language": "english", "review": "INTRUDER ALERT!

Pretty good.\n\nThis is the direct sequel (at least in spirit) to the famous Robotron 2084 arcade game (which I used to play extensively on my Nintendo 64). Ultratron is harder and more complex than Robotron 2084 in every respect but despite its many differences, such as the presence of weapon and character upgrades, better graphics, more complex arenas and the music (Robotron 2084 had no music at all), Ultratron still somehow manages to feel very nostalgic. Despite its high difficulty and despite its initially clunky looking graphics (reminiscent of early 1980s arcade games), this is a seemingly simple but extremely fun game with absolutely no bugs (other than the intentional warping and flipping of the screen).\n\n++++\n+This game is pretty inexpensive.\n\n+ The controls are highly responsive and generally outstanding.\n\n+ The sound is highly reminiscent of 1980s arcade games. Still, this game's intentionally nostalgic sounds are extremely well done and hearing all the nifty computer sounds this game makes is a lot of fun. Despite how nostalgic the sounds are they will not make your speakers pop. The sounds in this game are high quality. They don't come through as fuzzy, grainy or full of static. Every single sound in this game also tells you something important.\n\n+The graphics, while reminiscent of early 1980s arcade games, are actually quite a bit more complex, including some pretty lighting effects and little spotlight rays which follow your character around. The lighting creates a wonderful techno-menacing ambient feeling which goes far to create this game's atmosphere. The overall atmosphere seems to be halfway between a 1980s arcade, a techno rave dance club and a weird, futuristic computer factory. Indeed, the levels all sort of look like they take place in a 2D dance club of some sort which is at once funny and fitting for this game. The high-contrast graphics also helped me concentrate even better than I otherwise would have. The intentionally strange screen distortion effects helped increase the atmospherics of this game still further without significantly distracting from the gameplay. When playing this game it almost looks as if your own computer monitor wants the machines to win but can't really do much about you.\n\n+The overall game design and object of the game (destroy everything on the screen) is simple but extremely well executed. Levels are divided into 4 sections, each of which has a boss fight at the end. Once a boss has been defeated you can jump to that section at a later time using the extremely easy-to-use game menu. Between each level you can upgrade your character with little monies you earned while you were destroying enemies during each preceding level (or you can save your little monies for better upgrades later. The boss fights are challenging but only the final one is potentially frustrating (I defeated it on my third try but then I currently hold the 5th highest score in the world). After the final boss, you can continue playing even further to get an even high score. The furthest I've gotten is to level 60 but I think I heard somewhere that there are 100 levels in all but I'm not sure. The designs of all of the smaller enemies are also very, very good, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\n+/-+/-+/-+/-\n+/- Asides from the good main theme and the excellent music which plays during boss fights (the same song which plays on the Steam store's Ultratron page), this game's music is largely mediocre and tends towards an overly complicated and chaotic musical style (that oftentimes would sound more at home in a Unreal Tournament game rather than a little arcade-style game like this). The music can, at times be distracting but the music can be easily turned down.\n\n+/-This game gets very difficult very quickly. This is essentially a dual analog game. (I play it with a mouse (to aim and fire with) and keyboard (to move)). If you do not have a background in playing other dual analog games I'd recommend playing some other dual analog games first to get used to the fundamentals of the controls before diving into something as challenging as Ultratron. Playing the original Robotron 2084 (if you can find a good version of it these days) will help you to be better at this game too.\n\n---------\n-It would have been nice if the difficulty ramped up more slowly (so the game would have more stages to play through).\n\n-This game could use some additional gameplay modes of some sort to add variety and increased replayability. (For example, a mode where you must fire as little as possible, a time trial mode, a boss rush mode etc. would have all been nice additions) As it stands, this is a fairly bare-bones arcade style game with just one mode.\n\n-It would be nice to be able to play a cooperative mode with AI's if you don't have any friends who also play this game (like me).\n\n-The game needs more variety to its arenas. It needs more traps and physical barriers etc. Maze-like arenas would have been cool too. There's a whole lot more than could be done with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1461487417, "timestamp_updated": 1461487417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22543266": {"recommendationid": "22543266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084053445", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492494797}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Control de Xbox 360 con cable no funciona en linux.", "timestamp_created": 1461204828, "timestamp_updated": 1461204828, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22389164": {"recommendationid": "22389164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001315957", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489260715}, "language": "english", "review": "PuppyGames does what they do.

You usually die because you made a mistake, not because of some random reason.\n* How you load out your character is fairly important.  Choices you make early on affect how you play later.\n\nFlaws:\n\n* Often it is hard to distinguish enemies from the background.  Easy fix but they never did.\n* Enemies, including bosses, could have been more unique / interesting.\n* Some upgrades just don't seem useful for what they cost.\n* Fruit?  Coins?  They don't belong or fit the theme of the entire rest of the game.  Should've kept with the theme.\n* Character loadouts should have been differentiated and tested more.  I'm not sure some loadouts are even viable.\n* Challenge levels should have awarded coins on a percentage instead of only based on perfection.  As is if you get hit once in a challenge level (or miss once) the entire rest of that level is pointless as far as earning money goes.\n* Kind of short.  I \"beat\" it in about 9 hours of play.\n* Arenas are just recolors.\n* There's too much crap on the screen.  It looks like someone just learned how to use sharders and went wild with filters and lights.\n* Save system is bogus.  If you miss a boss you have to play a ton of levels over.\n* Upgrade system doesn't reward exploration.  Choose a dud upgrade and you're screwed 10 levels later.\n* Story?  What story?  Why am I shooting things?  A story is hinted at but never told.\n* $10 is high for what you get.  $5 is worth it.

Entre tanto tendremos la posibilidad de jugar alg\u00fan nivel de bonus consistente en no dejar que nos toquen en un ataque sin la posibilidad de disparar o aniquilar todos los enemigos de tal nivel; todo para conseguir un extra de dinero que gastaremos despu\u00e9s.\n\nEl control puede cambiarse, pero el cl\u00e1sico uso de dos sticks es lo m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo para Ultratron: con un stick movemos al personaje y con el otro disparamos en la direcci\u00f3n que m\u00e1s convenga. Por tanto es recomendable jugarlo con un mando USB antes que con el teclado; por eso dije que en PSVita este juego triunfar\u00eda.\n\nEl dinero que vamos recogiendo nos sirve para comprar mejoras en la tienda, accesible entre nivel y nivel y con un abanico de posibilidades muy amplio que puede cambiar la manera de jugar si nos dedicamos, por ejemplo, en una partida a mejorar solamente el disparo principal o si queremos tener un androide equilibrado o si queremos tener potenciado al m\u00e1ximo un miniandroide ayudante\u2026 adem\u00e1s de los ejemplos podemos comprar bombas, bombas inteligentes (se activan cuando nos van a tocar), torretas que podemos \u201cplantar\u201d y recoger seg\u00fan la necesidad, mejorar los escudos (que es la vida)\u2026 mucho en que gastar.\n\nIgual que en el original, todos los niveles transcurren en un espacio delimitado en el que, en el caso del juego que tratamos, va cambiando un poco la ambientaci\u00f3n; pues visualmente tiene un aspecto muy cibern\u00e9tico con unos neones muy de la peli Tron, que junto a la m\u00fasica pastillera da una sensaci\u00f3n de juego r\u00e1pido y \u00e1gil. Todo es 2D con dise\u00f1os elaborados pero no tit\u00e1nicos, encaja todo bien.\n\nAparte de la mejora constante de tu personaje, que te invita a seguir jugando y jugando, tenemos una buena colecci\u00f3n de logros que nos anima a explotar todas las posibilidades del juego empezando partidas una y otra vez. La verdad es que resulta un juego muy adictivo.\n\nIncluye multijugador cooperativo, aunque no he tenido la suerte de probarlo a\u00fan.\n\n\u00bfMerece la pena? S\u00ed, aunque el precio no corresponde al contenido ofrecido, se puede encontrar en oferta cada dos por tres.

It gets pretty frantic early on, but there is a method to its madness.\nI'll tell you right of the bat that YES, it can often occur that you simply have no idea what's going on because the screen is just a mass of flashy neon colors exploding everywhere. It's super-distracting, but you do kind of get used to it after a while. Kind of. The graphics are gorgeous, though, with some really great color work. There are some nice touches like your avatar and pets changing appearance as they get upgraded.\n\nThere's a great balance of risk and reward. If you want to power up as much as possible you're going to need to pick up the money dropped by enemies, but approaching it might put you in harm's way. It's still generally worth it to be greedy as the purchasable upgrades are a lot of fun. You can choose to focus on your own offensive capabilities or on droid helpers, or even on additional special moves, all with multiple tiers. Yes, it is possible to max out all your upgrades, but it probably won't happen on your first game. It's really satisfying, though.\n\nIn fact, once you get over the leaning curve you can snowball your way through the game and make it a marathon. I got well past level 100 and had to play my game in 2 sittings. I don't know if that's a fair complaint, since I had a lot of fun while doing that. Even after the game got repetitive there was more to learn and exploit, such as a tricky manoeuvre where you can dash into fruit to make it explode, or fighting multiple bosses at the same time.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to fans of twin-stick shooters.

Non re-inventa il genere ma lo rappresenta molto bene prendendo il meglio degli storici predecessori (Robotron e Minotron).\n\nGOOD\nIl sistema di comandi \u00e8 perfetto a patto di utilizzare un controller e non mouse + tastiera. Perfetto davvero, anche per chi come me ha una \"memoria muscolare\" pigra (anche per l'et\u00e0). Il co-op locale \u00e8 interessante, l'arsenale disponibile \u00e8 di tutto rispetto. Il livello di difficolt\u00e0 \u00e8 ben calibrato, soprattutto nella progressione da facile a difficile via via che si progredisce nei livelli. Grafica e sonoro sono molto ben curati, in stile po' retr\u00f2 e un po' moderno.\n\nBAD\nUn senso di claustrofobia pervade l'azione di gioco, e per qualcuno il non muoversi mai dall'arena a schermo fisso potrebbe risultare alla lunga ripetitivo. Non ho gradito la presenza di elementi di sfondo \"di disturbo\" che nelle fasi concitate si confondono con i nemici dello stesso colore. Il testo che scorre in un angolo potevano risparmiarselo: non \u00e8 possibile leggerlo perch\u00e8 impegnati nell'azione e a tratti copre un po' il campo di gioco.\n\n\u00c8 possibile salvare la partita in corso in qualsiasi momento semplicemente premendo ESC sulla tastiera. Vi sono 4 check point dopo i 4 boss di fine livello, dopodich\u00e8 non vi sono novit\u00e0 e si gioca ad oltranza fino ad essere inevitabilmente sopraffatti. Non fa la concorrenza a Geometry Wars 3 ma se vi piace il genere \u00e8 un'interessante variazione sul tema.

It will seem easy at first but will soon become alot harder to dodge bullets and stay alive.\n\n[h1]Good Points[/h1]\n\n[*] The grathical style of the game looks amazing. Its very unique and has its own feel to it. Becasue of this it will grab your attention and keep you playing to see what the next level will look like.\n\n[*] There are tons of diffrent upgrades you can buy once you have finished a level such as more health, more powerful guns, pets and grenades. This keeps you playing and keeps the game challenging because you will want to pick the right upgrade.\n\n[*] Replayability in Ultratron is its shining point, there is Leaderboads which will keep you playing the longest but there is also lots of Steam achievements and once you completed the game you will start again but harder and keep your score. So there is no reason not to finish playing.\n\n[*] The music works well and fits in with the game. Because of this it will draw you in more. The music becomes faster the more you play so you feel pressured to not die. This works well in the game.\n\n[*] Controls for Ultratron are simple yet good, they work well and im sure most people will be fine with them. Because they are simple you won't be finding it confusing or hard to play. You can change them in the menu if you feel dont like it.\n\n[*] The difficulty is great! It always keeps you on the edge since you wont want to die. Thoughout the game you will have to be 100% focused in the game because if you are not then you will die quickly.\n\n[*] The enemie types are very diffrent and unipue thoughout the game. Almost every level will have something diffrent for you to kill. Lots of diffrent bosses make things alot better diffrent.\n\n[h1]Bad Points[/h1]\n\n[*] The length of the game is only about 2 hours but becasue its an arcade game it will be a miner complaint. But its still short and you will complete it since its not to hard fist time round.\n\n[*] After a while you will feels a bit bored since there is only 2 modes and that single player and Local Co-op. It gets a bit repetitive after a while.\n\n[*] There is not much to show thats diffrent compared to other new arcade games. There is the grathical style but thats about it. Because of this the game feels abit the same, but only a tiny bit.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nOverall I think That Ultratron is a fun challenge to play if you are bored. Its fun to get high scores and complete but since thats all there is I will rate Ultratron a 7 out of 10. Great fun while it lasts. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes arcade games and highscores.", "timestamp_created": 1424262566, "timestamp_updated": 1424262566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562070", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14509650": {"recommendationid": "14509650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080599829", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518047641}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fun and midly addicting if you don't mind shooters, I give it a thumbs up.", "timestamp_created": 1424147784, "timestamp_updated": 1424147784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14504536": {"recommendationid": "14504536", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990611374", "num_games_owned": 446, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 1837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517018595}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El equilibrio perfecto entre las cl\u00e1sicas recreativas de los 80 y el estilo indie actual.

Fast-paced insanity in a small, compact area at its finest.\nAlso, once you get to more difficult levels, try to stay near the middle as much as possible. Yes, pick up the money, but once the difficulty begins to curve up, enemies can spawn and shoot from off-screen.

I never heard of this game until I saw that the soundtrack was recently released. The story concept and art style was really appealing and I read some good things about this developer, so I decided to pick the game up. I was pleasantly surprised. This game is a really fun throwback to retro arcade games from the 80's. You play as a 'good' robot that must avenge the human race and kill all the 'bad' robots in increasingly difficult levels, with a few boss battles in between. The gameplay is easy to get into, but difficult to master like any good retro-style game. The graphics look great, and successfully blend in some nice modern visuals into its retro style. The powerups are really cool and make you feel powerful. Good play will reward more currency and you can buy upgrades. The user interface is easy to navigate and looks really nice. It's very simple to upgrade your robot, and not confusing at all. The audio fits the game's story very well -- the sound effects and robot voices are perfect and the music is really awesome too. The music ramps up in intensity as you progress through each level, and it really fills you up with a sense of impending doom as you blast wave after wave of evil robots. I bought the soundtrack too. Seriously, thumbs up on the audio design. It really lives up to the art style. This game is all killer, no filler. There is zero fat on this game. It's one of those gems that you are glad to find and have in your collection.

Wo andere gro\u00dfe Kaliber des Genres, wie z.B Waves oder Geometry Wars 1 & 2 (der 2.Teil ist bisher leider nicht bei Steam erh\u00e4ltlich), sich eher anf\u00fchlen wie ein kleiner spielerischer Kwicky, erlebt man Ultratron eher als eine l\u00e4ngere und umfassendere Herausforderung.\nEtwas sehr positives ist hierbei ein festes Zwischenspeicher-System. Wobei alle 10 Level der bis dahin beste Spieldurchlauf gespeichert wird. Startet man von diesen Speicherpunkten erneut in das Abenteuer, wird jedoch der Punktemultiplikator von maximal x5 auf Null gesetzt. Somit lassen sich die gr\u00f6\u00dften Punkte-Rekorde nur in einem zusammenh\u00e4ngenden Durchlauf erspielen.\nDie Kampagne erstreckt sich \u00fcber die ersten 40 Level. Danach geht es jedoch immer weiter, und es wird immer Intensiver!\n\nMein einziger kleiner Kritikpunkt betrifft das fehlen der Skalierbarkeit der Aufl\u00f6sung. Es gibt hier nur die M\u00f6glichkeit zwischen Vollbild und Fenstermodus zu w\u00e4hlen.\n\nIch kann dieses Kleinod von Spiel nur w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen. Wenn man an Twin-Stick-Shootern interesse hat, wird man mit Ultratron ein wunderbares Vergn\u00fcgen erwerben.\n\nAls zus\u00e4tzliches Anschauungsmaterial empfehle ich die folgende Aufnahme eines Rekordversuchs des YouTube-Nutzers 'Kleiner Mega Panda':\nTeil 1 Level 0-20:   www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBbJC4W993I\nTeil 2 Level 21-40:   www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IfgEg8ml2U\nTeil 3 Level 41-80:   www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmD9ONMp4Dg\nTeil 4 Level 81-110:   www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiOBzc3dBVY\nTeil 5 Level 111-140:   www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpxrSOMkrMg\n\n\nUltratron is an excellent twin-stick-shooter.\n\nI have played many twin-stick-shooter, and this clearly stands out everything from the crowd.\n\nIn exchange for earned experience points, you can upgrade the robot and his little helpers with various things between each level. This results in many gorgeous possibilities of strategic approaches in order to survive in this game as long as possible.\n\nThe intensity increases from level to level very pleasant to. Where other large caliber of the genre feel like little sprints, such as Waves or Geometry Wars 1 & 2 (the 2nd part is so far not available on Steam), Ultratron is a longer and wider challenge.\nVery positive is the solid save system. Here, all 10 levels of the previously best game run is stored. If you start from these save points again, the score multiplier up to five is set to zero. Thus, the greatest records can only earn in a contiguous run.\nThe campaign extends across the first 40 levels. Then the game goes on and on, and it gets more intense!\n\nMy only small point of criticism concerns the lack of scalability of the resolution. It can only be switched between full screen and window mode.\n\nI recommend this game to all who are interested in this genre.\n\nAs an additional illustrative material I recommend the following recording of a record attempt of the YouTube-User 'Kleiner Mega Panda':\nPart 1 Level 0-20: www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBbJC4W993I\nPart 2 Level 21-40: www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IfgEg8ml2U\nPart 3 Level 41-80: www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmD9ONMp4Dg\nPart 4 Level 81-110: www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiOBzc3dBVY\nPart 5 Level 111-140: www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpxrSOMkrMg", "timestamp_created": 1408435404, "timestamp_updated": 1447648008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11774420": {"recommendationid": "11774420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088877410", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411209375}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0417\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430! \u041d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0438 \u043a \u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442. \u0410\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0451, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0448\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f! \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0430\u0441 - \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0439, \u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440!", "timestamp_created": 1408414016, "timestamp_updated": 1408414016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11741312": {"recommendationid": "11741312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057581294", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408207536}, "language": "brazilian", "review": " Um jogo com potencial desperdi\u00e7ado. O visual retro misturado com v\u00e1rios efeitos \u00e9 interessante, mas chega a ser exagerado de vez em quando. A jogabilidade arcade e o progresso via upgrades deixam o jogo muito divertido a princ\u00edpio, com um replay muito bom, por\u00e9m alguns detalhes pioram muito este jogo.\n Primeiramente, boa parte do jogo gira em volta de sua pontua\u00e7\u00e3o, o qu\u00ea n\u00e3o \u00e9 algo t\u00e3o relevante no gameplay, e at\u00e9 pode ter um impacto negativo. Por exemplo, em fases b\u00f4nus, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel voc\u00ea morrer e ter de voltar do come\u00e7o do mundo onde estava, sendo bem frustrante \u00e0s vezes. Essas fases apenas servem para pontua\u00e7\u00e3o, a n\u00e3o ser que voc\u00ea as passe perfeitamente, e nesse caso lhe \u00e9 dado algum dinheiro.\n Agora um outro problema: a dificuldade injusta. Al\u00e9m de ser estranho o jogo oferecer uma ajuda em troca de seu email, chega  a ser bizarro a progress\u00e3o do jogo. Nas primeiras fases n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada de muito dif\u00edcil, por\u00e9m pelo end game nota-se um grande defeito de design...os inimigos possuem a mesma cor do cen\u00e1rio. Por exemplo, no \u00faltimo mundo, os inimigos e cen\u00e1rio s\u00e3o da cor verde, voc\u00ea \u00e9 azul, e os proj\u00e9teis inimigos s\u00e3o vermelhos ainda. Assim, os inimigos praticamente tornam-se invis\u00edveis, e j\u00e1 que \u00e9 muito importante se mover a todo momento, voc\u00ea vai sofrer muito dano.\n Em um Bullet Hell do estilo Touhou, por exemplo, h\u00e1 muita coisa na tela ao mesmo tempo, no entanto elas destacam-se por suas cores. Em Ultratron isso n\u00e3o ocorre, sendo uma falha desanimadora.\n Ultratron, mesmo sendo um jogo com certo esmero por parte dos criadores, n\u00e3o vale R$20,00. Caso esteja interessado, abaixo de R$5,00 \u00e9 um pre\u00e7o aceit\u00e1vel.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1408208480, "timestamp_updated": 1408208480, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11713843": {"recommendationid": "11713843", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971298895", "num_games_owned": 490, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408044116}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a blast, this game is slick and fast.

If you're looking for a very highly-polished arcade game experience that both feels retro and benefits from modern conventions and fidelity, Ultratron won't leave you disappointed.\n\nUltratron is a retro arcade shooter developed and published by Puppy Games.  It features top-down shooting with a very highly-stylised retro aesthetic.  While one can expand on those two points, that's about what there is to it.  It's a pretty simple game, and if you're looking for complex gameplay this isn't the place to look for it.  What is here, however, is very highly-polished.\n\nThe game progresses through four coarse stages of a few levels each, culminating with a final boss at the end of each stage.  The modes are kept varied by throwing in different stages that are essentially different game modes, for example, a \"Dodge stage\" whereby you must dodge away from a bunch of enemies without shooting them.  The level variety does some way make up for the lack of enemy variety, but not quite.  There's only a handful of true enemy types, although the actual number could be filled out somewhat since there are successive upgrades of others with minor cosmetic changes that mark their more powerful status.\n\nLongevity is added by having an item shop in between levels, and the \"pet\" small robots you can get along the way are both useful and kind of cute, in a small robot sort of way.  The game has a lot of character to the visual style in that way.\n\nThe look of the game itself is what I would describe as pleasantly retro.  It has that 8-bit look, but uses a full colour pallete and a variety of modern visual effects to add some jazz to the aesthetic.  It comes together quite well, and with a complimentary retro sound design and chiptune-style music, the production oozes 'retro' from every pore.  It's brilliant if that's the kind of thing you're looking for, though there are some that may be put off by the simplistic gameplay.  If I had one complaint about the visual style its that sometimes the visual effects make it very hard to tell what's going on in the game sometimes.  These distortion effects can be disabled in the options though, so it's not a big detriment to the game.  If you have trouble with them as I do, you can just turn them off.\n\nUnfortunately, for all it's polish it's still a very simplistic game.  No doubt if you like the genre you'll get your money's worth out of the game, and I know that's how I felt as I played it.  At the same time, however, I feel it won't be sticking with me as much as other games such as Thomas Was Alone did.  Its claim to fame: a highly-polished retro shooter, is also what kind of makes it wane in interest with time for me, as it's a very saturated genre indeed.\n\nNonetheless, if you are indeed a retro shooter fan, you'll greatly enjoy this game while it lasts, I think.  At a low price point, it's worth picking up.\n\nPublished: http://www.highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/91-review-ultratron", "timestamp_created": 1398521478, "timestamp_updated": 1398521478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9934880": {"recommendationid": "9934880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033802030", "num_games_owned": 1326, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499929814}, "language": "english", "review": "Game: Ultratron\nSummary: Smash TV with way too much $#@! on the screen\nRating (5/10 = failure): 7/10\nMultiplayer: Local\nCompletion: 6 hrs\nCards: Yes\nCloud: Yes\nCost: ~1 USD bundled\n\nSmash TV. You know the game - twin stick shooter, blast anything and everything, and grab cash and power-ups. Add in an upgrade system between levels and do away with the varied maps, and you basically have this game.\n\nUltratron, like other Puppygames, has a title whose name I cannot associate with the correct game because of how generic and similar-sounding they all are, is a very busy, visually overloaded game. \n\nConsidering the other games, this dev definitely seems to have a thing for flashy lights that are distracting as hell. There's a ton of clutter that fills up your screen at every turn. While the strobe effects can thankfully be turned off, there are still way too many effects that interfere with the ability to see what's going on. In particular I *loathe* the spot lights that don't serve any purpose other than to blind and distract the player. If I had a condition to flashing lights, I'm sure this game would trigger it. Difficulty should not be a side-effect of background visual effects that have no business covering up things you need to dodge or distract you every few stages.\n\nSimilar to Titan Attacks, this game becomes freakishly difficult, especially as you approach high levels. Everything starts to move dizzyingly fast. Managing to hit the all-important power-up creature becomes next to impossible. Add to that having to fight 3 bosses at once, and that's game over. While I've seen people with amazing skill who manage some really crazy high levels and do crazy stunts, all I'm asking for is a casual difficulty so I can beat the game and move on with my life. I did eventually beat it, but by that point it was mostly frustration, not fun.\n\nHere's what I would have liked to seen changed. \n Better economics - a lot of the cash and powers you earn hinge on hitting the power-up creature. \n More forgiving life cost - the cost to replenish life is punishing.\n A story - playing a pure arcade game gets old VERY quickly.\n Better upgrade system - add about 2x more options at less cost. I rarely got anything new between fights.\n Online multiplayer - Love to see this with online peeps.\n\nDespite the frustration that comes from this game, a lot of the earlier parts are quite fun.

Ultratron \u00e8 un twin-stick shooter piuttosto semplice nel concetto ma molto, molto interessante per il modo in cui cerca di \"rinverdire\" il genere Arcade.\nIn Ultratron prendiamo il controllo del personaggio all'interno di un quadrilatero di gioco predefinito, dai lati del quale periodicamente subiremo gli attacchi delle armate robotiche nemiche. Il nostro scopo \u00e8, ovviamente, quello di sopravvivere a queste ondate eliminando i nemici con l'arsenale di armi a nostra disposizione; il nostro \"omino\" dispone infatti di un attacco primario comandato dal mouse, ma pu\u00f2 acquistare e potenziare diversi droni di supporto, ognuno con attacchi differenti.\nA questo proposito mi piace sottolineare che Ultratron aggiunge un livello di personalizzazione all'esperienza \"arcade shooter\": oltre ai succitati droni di supporto (che attaccano con laser, razzi etc) vi \u00e8 la possibilit\u00e0 di incrementare scudi, velocit\u00e0 e potenza di fuoco, ma anche di acquistare diversi ulteriori miglioramenti che potranno aiutarci a poverizzare gli avversari. La moneta con cui acquistare i potenziamenti viene droppata dai diversi nemici sotto forma di \"pallini\" di diverse dimensioni: pi\u00f9 il nemico \u00e8 forte, pi\u00f9 il pallino sar\u00e0 grande e maggiore sar\u00e0 la quantit\u00e0 di denaro che guadagneremo.\nHo gi\u00e0 espresso parere positivo per Droid Assault, non posso che confermare la mia fiducia e fare grandissimi complimenti alla PuppetGames, che continua a confermare l'innata capacit\u00e0 di creare divertentissimi giochi arcade per nostalgici.\n\n[i][b]Se questa recensione ti \u00e8 piaciuta clicca \"Segui\" sulla [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/retrogamingcafe/curation]pagina del Curatore[/url] del mio gruppo: sarai sempre aggiornato con i miei personali consigli e le recensioni dei migliori titoli indie/retro/roguelite in circolazione![/b][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1394542395, "timestamp_updated": 1498654040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9417647": {"recommendationid": "9417647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059958219", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417934635}, "language": "english", "review": "Glorious shooting times abound!

It is not the best game out there, but it\u2019s by no means the worst. \n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nUltratron is a pretty simple game; you play a little robot that must defeat the many foes and their leaders ahead: Bellum, Lues, Leiunitas, and Letum. The protagonists\u2019 goal in this epic is to get revenge for the fall of earth by the evil forces of robots. As you fight further through the epic campaign you defeat the evil leader robots that destroyed the great planet you knew to love. \n\n[b]Campaign:[/b]\nThere are forty main levels and with each level the enemies become slightly stronger, although not to the point where it forces you to select specific upgrades. The game isn\u2019t too difficult and you can get through the first 39 levels without too much effort. As you progress through each subsection (10 levels) you must fight one boss and this creates a save, which you can reload and play even after creating the next save ten levels later. You only get one save for each ten levels; this means if you start again you will overwrite your previous character saves. \n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nSimilar to Revenge of the Titans you cannot buy all the upgrades within the forty levels, before fighting the main boss. Your cash is limited and you must choose which upgrades you want and which ones you don\u2019t. In order to take more hits you must purchase shields, which upon being hit you lose. This means some of your money goes back to buying defense mechanisms to make sure you do not die in one hit. [spoiler]Although, after fighting your way through the main 40 levels the campaign unlocks and allows you to keep playing.[/spoiler] One major benefit to this game is that by clicking escape it saves your progress and quits. This means you can be half way between checkpoints and decide you want to take a break without losing a beat. \n\n[b]Results:[/b]\nUltratron is challenging and fun with a lot of variation between rounds because of the upgrade variety. Most of the achievements can be earned by playing the game only a short amount of time. If you ever played geometry wars this is a similar type of game. If you\u2019re fan of arcade games that are in bird\u2019s eye view and are arena shooters then this is the game for you. \n\n[b]Hints:[/b]\n[spoiler]->To beat Letum you need to purchase the speed boost upgrade, preferably with Quantum Shift so you can run through his bullets. [I also beat him when playing with near maxed out bullet upgrade which made it a bit easier]\n->If your find a turret from a spider drop you can pick the turret up and move it by not firing your main gun.\n->By purchasing the droid level-up upgrade this will allow your droids to level up based on their kill count. This upgrade is only useful if you decide to not fire your blaster and let the droids level up. (I played a play-through using only the lowest level droid and even at level five and fully upgraded it still was weaker than my level two blaster).\n->You will make your money back if you buy the dot slurper upgrades, as the benefit of the farther reach is incredibly notable.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Results:[/b]\nI recommend this game. I personally wouldn't purchase it for $9.99, but if you're a fan of the genre then $9.99 is a good price. If you are not a fan of the genre and can get a coupon or it is on sale for about 75% off then this is a great buy. The game is entertaining and rather simple. It doesn\u2019t require too much time to become good at and is fun to compete with against friends.  The checkpoint system makes it rather entertaining and stops you from having to repeat the whole game over again. \n\nPros:\n+Different upgrades which you cannot purchase all in one play through [spoiler]of the main forty levels.[/spoiler]\n+Checkpoint system, so you don\u2019t have to restart at the beginning if you lost by just a hair. \n+Easy controls with simple gameplay logic\n+Simple enemies and fun to battle bosses\n+High replay value\n+Save and quit option allowing you to stop playing at any point without losing progress.\n\nCons: \n-Some upgrades seem rather worthless.\n-The final boss, Letum, is ridiculous in difficulty curve.\n-There doesn't seem to be any tutorial or hints pages between levels.", "timestamp_created": 1393912346, "timestamp_updated": 1396411076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740449", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9330181": {"recommendationid": "9330181", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971199534", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393854017}, "language": "french", "review": "Le concept de shoot'em up arcade est l\u00e0, mais les graphismes, pas extraordinaires, offrent une d\u00e9bauche d'explosion et de vibrations en tous genres qui rend la lecture de ce qui ce passe \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran tr\u00e8s compliqu\u00e9e.

I absolutely adore Puppy Games\u2019s design aesthetic, and the gameplay is simple and fun. You know the drill, one joystick moves your character while the other shoots. Avoid projectiles, destroy all robots, upgrade, repeat. Along with upgrading your robot\u2019s own abilities, you can purchase and enhance several \u201cpets\u201d that will automatically fire at nearby enemies. It takes quite a few upgrades for the pets to feel useful, but I loved the way they were implemented. Each one tags along behind you in a line that acts as a secondary shield. If one of them is hit, it is dropped in place where it will wait patiently for your return. Balancing upgrades can be tricky. I realized a little too late that I had pumped all my money into the wrong upgrades, because the boring-sounding ones ended up being more useful than I anticipated. The game is fairly forgiving, though, and it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll upgrade yourself into a corner.

This applies to certain genres more than others, but it certainly can be used to describe twin stick arcade shooters, where without a story, expansive world, or other conduit typically used to draw you to the experience, it all comes down to getting the core gameplay right. [i]Ultratron[/i] gets it.\n\nMaking no false claims as to what it is, [i]Puppy Games's[/i] twin stick shooter drops you into a level and asks you to kill everything that moves. As you destroy enemies they drop credits which you can use to upgrade your bot, replenish your shields, or adopt an array of gadgets to help you stay alive. It's intentionally uncomplicated and that is what makes it so freaking fun!\n\nGliding around in your little homicidal robot feels like an extension of yourself, and the resistance put up by your endlessly spawning enemies coupled with the ensuing explosion when they bite the dust is absolutely perfect, and never stops being satisfying no matter how many times you repeat it. Enemy patterns are varied just enough to keep the experience fresh, and  over the game's 40 levels various levels are sprinkled challenge events and boss fights that become increasingly challenging the further in you get.\n\nAlthough I've never been known to suffer from epilepsy, I appreciated that the developers didn't go as crazy as they could have with the visuals. There is a lot of graphical flair going on at any one time, but rarely did it become detrimental to the gameplay by obscuring enemies, and is actually used as a clever way to increase difficulty as later levels are darker lit and require a keener eye to pick out enemies (but never to the point of being unfair).\n\nFor pure arcade shooting I've rarely had the pleasure of playing one as fun and well crafted as [i]Ultratron[/i]. While it may lack content up front, it makes up for it by being replayable just for the sake of revisiting the game (with the added benefit of local co-op, which is a literal blast). As a fan of the genre I found it an absolute joy to play, and am sure to be comparing similar games to it from now on.

You sucked me in late at night with your pretty colors, challenging gameplay, and awesome upgrades. I loved you until I loaded what I thought was my save with my high score I was working on to find me back at an earlier level 3000,000 short of what I was. For now I must give you up because I am hurt and sad but will comeback one day to complete my challenge of moving up the leaderboards.\n\nUltratron is a fantastic old school style twin stick shooter from the guys at puppygames. They also made other great titles like Revenge of The Titans and Titan Attacks. Your mission is to avenge the human race by killing the titans. \n\nYou do this as a little robot who you can upgrade by earning money which is dropped when titans die. Upgrades come in the form of the power of your gun, adding little pets who each have a different weapon, and defensive abilities like an EMP shock when you get hit. To keep these upgrades you have to get past a checkpoint which is every ten levels and a boss.\n\nGameplay is best done with a controller in my opinion since one joystick controls movement and the other controls your gun. Each stage is done in a somewhat oval shaped stage where a variety of titans appear to bring a stop to your destruction. Each time a titan is killed money appears and you have to collect it before it disappears.\n\nThe main game plays through 40 levels then after that it's just hitting checkpoints every ten levels to try and fully upgrade everything and get a higher score. You can also save where you\u2019re at and quit the game to come back later to keep going. It's a fantastic game with tons of value that can last you a very long time.\n\nBear Rating 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1385007004, "timestamp_updated": 1385410683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.728659", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7691093": {"recommendationid": "7691093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064459589", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507570645}, "language": "english", "review": "Good fun lil' game.", "timestamp_created": 1384799456, "timestamp_updated": 1384799456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500220", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7621163": {"recommendationid": "7621163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025160943", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1384083279}, "language": "english", "review": "Diam atau bergerak sambil mengarahkan tembakan dan mencari celah menghindari serbuan serangan lawan yang ramai bermunculan serta mengambil beberapa bonus dari hancurnya lawan membuat permainan begitu bersemangat apalagi dengan adanya musik berdetak cepat, wow serasa tidak ada saat santai sedikitpun karena lengah sedikit saja pasti akan berakhir \" Game Over \" :creep:\n\nStationary or moving while directing shots and looking for loopholes to avoid the crowded rush the opponent's attack and take some bonuses emerged from the collapse of the opponent makes the game so excited especially with the fast beat music, wow no one seemed to relax when off guard a little bit because it will surely come to an end \"Game Over \" :creep:", "timestamp_created": 1384090729, "timestamp_updated": 1385405658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495329", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7618640": {"recommendationid": "7618640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011272639", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447480567}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is Great!

I can't really say that it brings anything new to the table, but what it does bring is absolutely top-notch. The gameplay is that of a standard directional-stick arcade shooter and the controls are tight and natural-feeling. The graphics are simple with a retro aesthetic but they come off as fresh nonetheless. It's got a decent techno soundtrack salted with synth sound & voice effects which really serve to ease you into \"the zone\". At no point does the sound become tiresome or overbearing. The action steadily increases in difficulty until it reaches a fever pitch; full-on \"bullet hell\" status. When you're frantically running from 571 on-screen projectiles while simultaneously lining up your shots and reaching for currency and power-ups, you'll find yourself transported back to the arcades of yore, standing in front of a Smash T.V. cabinet (well, if you're old enough, that is). The insanity is mitigated somewhat by the many offensive and defensive power-ups which you can buy at the shop-screen between levels. You can also have up to 3 minions which follow you closely and can be separately upgraded (each minion carries its own distinct weapon too!). Every 10 levels or so, you'll encounter a gigantic boss which is standard in games of this genre. To give you an idea of what they're like, picture a massive screen-filling robot porcupine but with various cannons, lasers, and rocket-launchers instead of quills and you'll have a pretty accurate mental picture. The boss battles force you to change up your overall strategy and they go a long way in terms of mixing things up and staving off monotony.\n\nUltratron is a worthy distraction. Being an indy game, the price is low. Being a *good* indy game, the pay-off is high. You'll definitely want to give this game a shot. An Xbox 360 controller, with its dual analog sticks and native Windows support, is *VERY* highly recommended if you really want to replicate the arcade-type experience.", "timestamp_created": 1366348820, "timestamp_updated": 1366348820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "263597": {"recommendationid": "263597", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967016421", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500246940}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is crazy fun.

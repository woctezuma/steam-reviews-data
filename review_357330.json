An intense and scary single/multiplayer horror/sci-fi FPS, with procedural levels. What people thought the Space Hulk/Colonial Marines games were going to be. Almost impossible singleplayer, but good with a group. Make sure you have at least one friend before buying.\n\n\nTHE LONG VERSION\n\nA deceptively slow-paced and extremely tense game that places you as a space marine in huge, powered armor and puts you on randomly generated ships to download cores for... some reason, or rescue very fragile civilians.\n\nThat may sound standard or identical to other Space Hulk-esque games, but I assure you the execution is unmatched by anything else.\n\nYou see, your suit has limited ammo, vision, and power, but you don't notice that before the game starts cranking the stress-o-meter to 15 out of 10. When your enemies actually bother to show up, it's horribly disorienting (in a good, atmospheric way), and is pretty much guaranteed to make you dookie a shooter straight out through your pants and chair. \n\nNote that \"disorienting\" does not mean \"incomprehensible\". You have a motion sensor, a flashlight, and even a rangefinder counting down the meters before your face eaten off - You'll always know what killed you, it's just a lot faster than you might be used to.\n\nAlso worth noting is that you are very vulnerable in this game. It is not a power fantasy, and a great example of how having weapons and the ability to defend yourself does not necessarily remove the horror element from a horror game. You don't move that fast and have limited room to maneuver. Friendly fire is always on and it doesn't take many rounds to kill a teammate. When guns fire, their muzzle flash can be blinding and disorienting, turning dark hallways into panicked strobe-lit dancefloors of death. In case you weren't stressed out enough, your character's heart rate increases as the enemies close in, represented by the screen pulsating in time with the heart rate. This game is not for epileptics. At all. The menu says it best: \"This game will melt your face off\".\n\nOn top of all that, your enemies - the titular \"Space beasts\" - are very fast and instantly lethal in melee range. They're as deadly as their name is stupid: instant death in melee, able to smash doors, they come out of the goddamned walls, they turn off the power as much as possible, and they do it all at blinding speed. Even with turrets, a full load of ammo, and experienced team members, you are in a race against time to do your job before they overwhelm and kill you.\n\nOn top of THAT, there's an equally stupidly named enemy type called the \"Astro-Creep\". they both scare the shit out of you by face hugging your helmet and obscuring your vision, and also help result in about 3000% more friendly fire incidents by setting off automated turrets, smartguns, and motion sensors that don't realize they're actually very small wall-crawlers. \n\nAll you need to do to get out of this hellhole is accomplish your objectives as quickly as possible and get back to the shuttle. Seemingly impossible at first, but if you use turrets, make good use of locked doors and laser walls, and get a good teammate or two, you have a chance. You also get random upgrades like aim assist or infravision when you accomplish objectives like downloading cores. The upgrades really stack up over time, so doing the job quickly is very helpful. Sentry turrets can be activated to help you out. Naturally, they will shoot and kill you if you stupidly block their line of fire between you and an alien. There are also ammo and repair bays scattered randomly on the map. Tough, but fair.\n\nNote that while you can play by yourself, you will almost certainly fail all but the smallest ships. You really need at least one other person to play with you to have a realistic chance to succeed.

Impressions:\nThis game is an arcade-styled roguelike. That being said, it explains nothing and is completely unapologetic about it. This is not a flaw, it is a deliberate design choice. In your first couple of games, you WILL be a lamb to the slaughter. Don't use this time to critize the game, use it to learn more about it. I can guarantee you will enjoy the game alot more if you approach it with this mindset.\n\nDifficulty:\nWhat you see in the trailers are exactly what you get. This game is hard- Really hard. You die in one hit, and It is Virtually impossible alone- unless, of course, you rig everything in your favor via the map-gen options [spoiler]you schmuk[/spoiler]. You NEED a crew if you want to tackle normal maps and expect to live.\n \nBring Friends!\nFinding other players is pretty hard right now, considering so few are around. The most I have ever seen online in public chat at the same time is 12. \nThis is an even smaller community than Alien Swarm. Expect to see the same people frequently, and try to make good impressions. The last thing you want is to be shunned by someone.\n___________________________________\nCons:\nThere ARE a few problems with the game- Nothings perfect, right? Most players, however, have the common courtesy to never exploit these.\n\nFirst- This one is a biggie- [b]if one player Disconnects from the game, everyone is disconnected.[/b] Again, most players will wait till the round ends to Disconnect, but rarely, somone will use it to troll. How do you deal with this? add the people you trust and reinvite them to a private lobby. the troll will essentially be forced to quit the game or play alone because there are almost always no other lobbies available to join. Being an asshole actually has consequences, imagine that!\n\nSecond- No kick function. this isn't as problematic as you would think in its current state. Maybe its actually a good thing.\n\nThird- No in-game VoIP. Use Discord or Skype or somthing. Executing good teamwork on the fly is a must-have, and just straight up increases the enjoyability of the game.\n\nFourth- Lag. if you happen to be in a server with some really high ping, expect to see some crazy things.\n\nFifth- This is more of a nitpick, but reguardless, it may bug some people. there is often no rhyme or reason with how a map is constructed. No living quarters, No command centers, No bathrooms, No cafeterias, No utility closets, Nothing.

There are like what 3 game modes? Less? Sure it's procedurally generated, but like other games that have that feature it doesn't add anything of substance. You'll still be downloading at consoles or picking up scientists, you just go down different corridors to do it.

I haven't ever seen this game before despite it being a 2015 release. \n\nThe premise of S.B.T.F is one of my favorites. A group of Space Marines in power-armour clearing out a derelic space station filled with unknown horrors. It is like Alien or Warhammer 40k. Be it games or movies, I always look forward to this type of story.\n\nI joined my friends in a four man team and didn't know at all what to expect.\n\n[i]Is this game worth playing? Is the co-op fun?[/i]\n\n[b]-Yes, S.B.T.F does not disappoint-[/b]\n\nThe lack of tutorial leads to a steep learning curve. Our first game ended in the airlock with tons of aliens swarming us in the dark as we friendly fired each other in the backs. The UI was overwhelming and we couldn't make out where we were supposed to go. After visiting the options menu, we found that the Muzzle Flash and FOV Effects Intesity were maxed out by default. When we turned those down, we were able to see what were were shooting at.\n\nAfter an hour, we were finally completing the missions.\n\nOur playstyles changed so much after only one hour. We went from a cautious four man blob to tight two man squads. By hour two we knew when we had to stay close and when we could solo sections of the station. We finally felt like the unstoppable power-armoured  space marines we were supposed to be.\n\nI enjoyed S.B.T.F a whole lot. Co-op was fantastic and much better than trying to play alone. I hope that this continues to grow and eventually get a modding scene.\n\n[b]Play Space Beast Terror Fright where vigilance means survival and power-armour only gives you tools not invulnerability.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1520368391, "timestamp_updated": 1520368391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561587", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40583000": {"recommendationid": "40583000", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992591827", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 678, "last_played": 1521568143}, "language": "french", "review": "Good game!", "timestamp_created": 1520246233, "timestamp_updated": 1520246233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40580629": {"recommendationid": "40580629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044421867", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1521521753}, "language": "english", "review": "I've always wanted to know what it feels like to be a Starcraft Terran Marine onboard that zerg infested science vessel, Amerigo.

They kill you in what feels like one hit, spawn on top of you or in the worst places. They are terrifying and initially feel unfair until you learn how to control breaches properly, and even then there are some 'gotchya' moments. Frustration included.  \n- No classes, weapon options limited to a small range (4.5) \n- Difficulty varies wildly based on how the map is spawned. (Roguelike problems). \n- DO NOT PLAY ALONE; some of the maps with no doors and wider corridors require a 2nd+ person to help manage the spawns and cover flanking positions, its a multiplayer game that can possibly be enjoyed single player. \n- Watching allies for 15+ mins if you die early can be frustrating. \n- No Career mode, if your Marine survives s/he will not be saved on game quit. :(  \n\nOverall great game, went in totally blind, had a blast.

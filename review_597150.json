Makes me feel like a coked up hummingbird of death, especially when I use Super Self.\n\nLarger battles can cause a lot of lag and start dropping frames, which makes the game a lot less fun. It's more demanding on your computer than you might think, given the way it looks.\n\nI managed to unlock all the abilities in about 4 hours. May have some limited replay value, especially with workshop support.\n\nA few tips:\n\n- Don't ignore Flurry. It's absurdly good at taking out enemy knights.\n\n- Seems that losing all of your units will cause you to lose the battle, even if you're still alive. On the other hand, enemy knights have to be killed to win the battle. This can be frustrating, since they respawn. It's worth taking them out early, but can often be better to just save them for last, after all of their units are dead. \n\n- Make sure to recruit all knights from castles, and upgrade everything in each region you conquer. It's also worth transferring troops to border regions yourself to reinforce them against counterattack.\n\n- When you take a new region, don't forget to give your knights new orders. If you don't, the ones that were attacking that region will actually go back to the previous territory and not even defend your new conquest.", "timestamp_created": 1512463333, "timestamp_updated": 1512509491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518931", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37941884": {"recommendationid": "37941884", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989155982", "num_games_owned": 767, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512004243}, "language": "english", "review": "From the little I've played so fat this game is a gem.

Time flew by. I could swear I only fought one battle  and yet when I looked at the clock it was 35 minutes later. No matter what you do there's going to be a lot of button mashing. Its clever that they actually put the XY marks on all the enemies. Odd, clumsy controls for directing troops to new locations. The mouse is so much better at accuracy. The battles are repetetive as is the scenery and the appearance of troops knights. It just isn't important if you have the button layout to kill the unit floating above his head. The repetition does get tedious, but it takes awhile. It took a lot longer in Mount and Blade because you had things like riding a horse and shooting a bow from your horse to distract you. The very quick action means that there isn't much time to place things or think about stuff, but the great thing about Hyper Knights is that it doesn't annoy you by making you watch actors act. It just lets you get right into the action. I'm thinking about something like COD4 single player where you had amazing intros to the action that you couldn't quit like ten assault helicopters riding into battle in the middle east. No doubt it took a lot of work and money to get that beautiful scene, but then they forced me to watch it every time I played that mission which was probably 500 times.

The land is divided into regions. Each regions has different buildings (villages, which produce resources, outposts, which are fortified, and a central castle). You must destroy all before being allowed to take the castle. Each encounter with an enemy unit or building triggers a small battle. You thus go back and forth between the grand strategy map and the skirmishes. \n\nIn skirmishes you control your knight and you are followed by your army. Once all soldiers of your army are dead, you loose the battle. You win the battle once all enemy buildings and units are down. In the grand strategy map, you can recruit knights which can lead additional armies, give instructions to the knights (attack this region or defend this one), which they loosely follow, and build some useless buildings. Overall it's pretty bland and the core of the game are the battles. \n\nFlaws:\n\n- In battles, the enemy leaders (knights) respawn after some time (just as yourself). The problem is, several knights can join the battle. At some point, the knights become extremely tough, so that the time you need to kill them all  (knowing that they are invulnerable to your soldiers arrows, have health regeneration and can heal themselves) is smaller than the respawn time of the others. In short, even if you have max soldiers and you killed all enemy units save the knights, you cannot win. This is all the more unfair since if all your soldiers die, you loose the battle no matter what (last man standing is not an option): this should have been the same for the enemy. \n\n- The game is awfully repetitive. Once you have taken back a region, you have taken back them all. Eve the ultimate last castle is the same as all others. No boss, no specific architecture... You have basically five kinds of maps (simple skirmish, convoy attack, outpost, village, castle). The simple skirmish is a mere rectangle were both armies appear on opposite sides. \n\n- Many elements of the game are completely useless. It is enlightening to see which are the achievements obtained by the fewest people. They involve the use of all super powers (you only need about five of them out of ten), convoys attacks (a complete waste of time since aiming straight for buildings spare you more identical battles) and stunning enemy units (it is faster to kill them). \n\n- You can fight by striking enemies according to a sequence of X and Y appearing above them. However, they can stun you and if you are facing about ten of them at the same time, you die in seconds (even at max level). You need to rely on your combos which are basically super-powers (a blue bar fills up with time and is consumed whenever they are used). Some of them are incredibly powerful (e.g. kill all enemies on a radius bigger than screen) so that fighting is pointless. It would be better to be more powerful as a warrior and have less all-powerful abilities. It could be also a good idea to specialize through relevant leveling up (either you are a \"wizard\" type of knight with a lot of power-ups, a \"rogue\" one with a lot of dashing power, or a \"warrior\" one so that you can sustain more damage). \n\n- Leveling up is lame. I got max level (150) in the third or fourth region over maybe twenty or thirty of them, so that at about a fifth of the game. I could have started with max level, it would not have made any difference. This fast progression was due to a broken battle were enemy reinforcements kept coming every twenty seconds with infinite supply, so I could hold them back, but had to few men to win. \n\n- There can be a lot of lag in the battles especially when many leaders start joining the fight (at the end you are followed by a dozen knights so that you cannot participate to the battle anymore due to intense lag). \n\n- At some point in game, huge enemy armies (greater than anything you can ever gather) pop up in the middle of the grand strategy map to slow you down. You can defeat them, but it considerably hinder your progress. Lame way to increase the lifetime of the game.\n\n- At the end, when you claim the last castle (a battle which is the very opposite of epicness), the game is not over ! Some regions you had re-conquered suddenly turn to the adversary again. Nothing challenging here, since you have many knights by that time. It is only yet another artifical trick to make the game last still longer than it should have. \n\nOverall I wouldn't have played this game more than two or three hours if not for the achievement hunting.", "timestamp_created": 1504551452, "timestamp_updated": 1504555456, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701649", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34719422": {"recommendationid": "34719422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025651149", "num_games_owned": 911, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501335784}, "language": "german", "review": "Dynasty-Warriors All\u00fcren innerhalb eines Echtzeit-Taktik Spiels.

It was quite fun while it lasted, and I seem to have maxed out my character at level 150.\n\nI won't be saying what the other reviewers have, I shall focus primarily on how it can be improved.\n\nFirst, is the AI. My knights keep attacking the neighbouring areas even though I set them to defend,\n\nAnother way to improve it would be to raise the level cap. I hit the level cap at level 150 when I'm only halfway through the map. It really kills the sense of progress. Add more levels, maybe until level 999, and add more skills or raise the max level of the skill cap. For example, I notice that skills can only be improved thrice. Why not make it more than thrice? Maybe 5, or even 10.\n\nIt would be quite nice if passive skills could be added. Maybe crit for example, where there is say, a 10% chance the target would be instant killed. Or maybe stun proof. It gets quite annoying to become stunned by towers. Especially when you are swarmed with enemies, it'll translate into getting killed instantly.\n\nAll in all, I had quite a fun time with this, but without any additional skills, it'll get quite repetitive after the 5 hour mark.\n\nGreat game though. Hopefully it'll become even more polished.", "timestamp_created": 1503936746, "timestamp_updated": 1503936746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34523256": {"recommendationid": "34523256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083580729", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503816945}, "language": "english", "review": "Hyper Knights is a cross between a button-mashing action game and RTS. Think Dynasty Warriors mixed with One-Finger Death Punch, and elements of Galactic Conquest, and you'll have a pretty good idea as to how this game works.\n\nThe goal of the game is to recapture your kingdom from \"the enemy\". They have no name, but they sure do love to be jerks. Start by retaking villages and outposts, then move on to the castles, where you'll be able to reclaim an area of land for you to use in future campaigns. Win battle and kill enemies to gain XP, which will allow you to purchase new upgrades, abilities, and enhancements for your character and army.\n\nThe game's mechanics are, as I said, like a cross between Dynasty Warriors and OFDP, with the overworld having the GalCon mechanic of supplying troops to nodes for protection. Each unit type has a specific button combination you need to hit in order to kill them. Don't feel like hitting all those buttons, though? You could always use your nifty powers to clear out a line of soldiers, inspire your troops to kill the enemy faster, or go \"Super Self\" (the game's version of Super Saiyan, which, in all its button-smashing goodness, is fun as all get out), and decimate the enemy's units before laying the smackdown on that traitorous scum leading them.\n\nJust as each unit has a combo of button to press, so too do the enemy leaders (or knights). In order to deal damage to them, you must circle around them to an open area (basically wherever there isn't a blue cone), hit that combo, and you'll damage them. They're tough, annoying, and they'll use some of their own abilities to either slow down your men, or buff their own. It's important to eliminate them ASAP, otherwise your men will be too distracted by the knights to fight off other units, or destroy buildings and gates during sieges.\n\nThe game's overworld is split into various portions, in which you'll find villages, outposts, and castles. Each can provide gold for your kingdom to use, troops for you to recruit, and allied knights that will follow orders, and even move to assist you in battle. You can also upgrade said buildings, increasing their max garrison level, and increasing production of gold. You can eventually build mines (gold), trebuchets (long-distance harassment, for when you want to weaken an enemy before engaging them, and for when you need a bit of a hand during sieges), and safehouses (extra troop production), which will further improve your economy.\n\nThe game's AI, as hinted at above, will also try to assist you, or hinder you. During a battle, the overworld map continues to exist, meaning troops' movements and other battles play out in real time. If you open your map during a battle (from where you can also order your four squads around), you can actually see what's happening on the overworld, and even see which units are getting close to you (the HUD during battle also displays timers and numbers for incoming friends and foes). It helps in deciding whether or not you need to retreat, or try and rush the battle, before you get overrun. Allied knights can also be told to guard certain parts of the map, or attack them. This makes pushing or holding an area fairly simple. Up to 13 knights (as of my completion of the game) can be hired and commanded, who will then choose to attack enemies, and return to friendly territory to replinish troop numbers.\n\nSpeaking of being overrun, I've yet to even mention the best (and most hilarious) part about this game: You can have 100's and even 1000's of units on the field. It makes for epic moments, especially when you're outgunned, and need to pull off a risky tactic to try and turn the tide of battle in your favor. There's even an achievement for winning a battle when outnumbered 3-to-1! Did I also mention there's a NG+ option? No? Well, you know now.\n\nOf course, this wouldn't be a review without some good 'ol fashioned pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\n+ Simple art style is charming and easy on the eyes\n+ Game mechanics make for some hectic button mashing goodness\n+ Battles are sometimes very intense, with the result depending on your choice of actions\n+ Workshop support means being able to create your own weapons, armor, and knights. GoT anyone?\n+ Controls are very simple, and very easy to get used to.\n+ Random enemy infiltration events keep you on your toes, meaning you always need to think before making a move\n+ Online Co-op and PvP means you can take on your friends\n\nCons\n\n- While stupidly fun, the game can get fairly dull after a few hours. I managed to complete the campaign in just under five hours, and just started up a NG+ to see what elese there is to do, and see how quickly I can finish the map.\n- AI will sometimes not even try to intercept enemy groups, meaning you can very well expect to lose a few nodes (and even territories) because of it.\n- \"Super Self\", while fun to use, is rather broken. If you know how to do it, you can easily clear out, say fifty units in under ten seconds. Of course, SS is meant for trying to turn the tide in your favor, or quickly eliminate enemy knights.\n- The workshop is sort of barren. Not very many interesting items are on there currently, though I could very well be mistaken.\n- The campaign is awfully short. As I said, I managed to complete the game in less than five hours.\n- A \"Challenge\" DLC exists. While I understand devs need to fund development for current and future projects somehow, it doesn't really make much sense to add challenges, which can extend the life of a game, as a seperate DLC.\n\nHonsetly? At $5, this game is pretty fun. It's a great way to kill some time, or play with a friend online. With elements of RTS, hack 'n slash, and grand strategy all rolled into one package, Hyper Knights is certainly worth having a look at.", "timestamp_created": 1503819713, "timestamp_updated": 1503819713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34511004": {"recommendationid": "34511004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210493047", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503927685}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing I would just like extra levels and skills maybe the abbilty to have more secondry wepons and a second land", "timestamp_created": 1503770920, "timestamp_updated": 1503770920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34502877": {"recommendationid": "34502877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174112665", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507122155}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0417\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d Mount&Blade.", "timestamp_created": 1503747970, "timestamp_updated": 1503747970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34457632": {"recommendationid": "34457632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098391559", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511619787}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "real great game", "timestamp_created": 1503573409, "timestamp_updated": 1503573409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34443188": {"recommendationid": "34443188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089161305", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506717855}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm really enjoying the game, whilst it reccomends a controller the keyboard controls work just fine, the game feels great to play, and its fun.\nOverall I give this game Tomato Soup/10", "timestamp_created": 1503509909, "timestamp_updated": 1503509909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34429788": {"recommendationid": "34429788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076046597", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504477698}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of fun, but a pretty quick game.

Para recuperar o que lhe fora roubado ter\u00e1 de juntar o seu pequeno ex\u00e9rcito, derrotar os terr\u00edveis Knights e enfrentar v\u00e1rios desafios.\n\nO desafio principal \u00e9 o de manter as conquistas, uma vez que, os Knights inimigos estar\u00e3o sempre a atacar as sec\u00e7\u00f5es do mapa capturadas. Desta forma \u00e9 poss\u00edvel que o jogador regresse de uma pausa para descobrir que o previamente conquistado fora recapturado. Os Knights s\u00e3o uma esp\u00e9cie de \u201cboss\u201d que se movem de forma independente pelo mapa. Eles defendem e atacam as \u00e1reas para as quais est\u00e3o destacados, podendo ainda auxiliar nas batalhas de captura das aldeias, outposts e castelos, necess\u00e1rias \u00e0 conquista das sec\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\nO jogador pode adquirir Knights inimigos conforme vai avan\u00e7ando no mapa, colocando-os \u00e0 defesa ou ao ataque. Para al\u00e9m destes, o ex\u00e9rcito pode ser aumentado pela compra de skills e de mercen\u00e1rios. Chegamos ao primeiro e \u00fanico recurso do jogo, o ouro. Ganho pela participa\u00e7\u00e3o em batalhas e pela conquista, ele serve principalmente para adquirir mercen\u00e1rios e fazer upgrade \u00e1s aldeias, outposts e castelos.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1103624254\n\nCuriosamente a independ\u00eancia dos Knights e a forma como os soldados permanecem em movimento (sendo transferidos de local em local para preencher as falhas ap\u00f3s um ataque ou depois de um dos Knights ter recrutado soldados em falta), tornam Hyper Knights numa experi\u00eancia din\u00e2mica e viva. Apesar de ser singleplayer, o t\u00edtulo transmite uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de cooperativismo entre as v\u00e1rias partes do ex\u00e9rcito, como se todos trabalhassem para o mesmo fim. O lorde fica ent\u00e3o encarregue da maioria dos ataques mas tamb\u00e9m de proteger sec\u00e7\u00f5es rec\u00e9m-conquistadas e que ainda n\u00e3o possuem grande n\u00famero de soldados, e de contratar mercen\u00e1rios, entre outras fun\u00e7\u00f5es igualmente importantes.\n\nQuanto ao gameplay, este \u00e9 focado em combina\u00e7\u00f5es de bot\u00f5es/teclas. \u00c9 preciso ter contudo aten\u00e7\u00e3o na recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o do comando para jogar pelo que com o teclado a movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 mais dif\u00edcil, especialmente pela inexist\u00eancia da seta do rato. Regressando aos ataques, cada combina\u00e7\u00e3o corresponde a diferentes ac\u00e7\u00f5es e skills, incluindo recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de HP, ataques aoe e stun, entre outros. Com o avan\u00e7ar no mapa, derrotar Knights e soldados inimigos requer combina\u00e7\u00f5es mais elaboradas.\n\nSendo o \u00fanico com respawn, ataques especiais e elevado HP, o lorde tem de liderar e proteger os seus homens. Nos outposts e nas villages, por exemplo, o jogador tem de escolher quais as \u00e1reas a atacar primeiro, destacando unidades para determinadas partes do mapa. Durante os conflitos \u00e9 importante tamb\u00e9m escolher Knights para auxiliar na batalha e garantir uma vit\u00f3ria j\u00e1 que os Knights inimigos far\u00e3o o mesmo.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1103624639\n\nNo final, o campo de batalha pode chegar a um total de 400/500 soldados (ou mais), tornando Hyper Knights numa experi\u00eancia bem legal, ao som de uma energ\u00e9tica banda sonora. Eu esperava um modo online, ai sim seria muito bacana e_e\n\n[b]Cr\u00e9ditos[/b] [url=http://www.magazine-hd.com/apps/wp/hyper-knights-analise-critica/]MagazineHD[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1502132289, "timestamp_updated": 1502917006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581396", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34086627": {"recommendationid": "34086627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156245192", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502128523}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8f7b\u677e\u6109\u5feb\u7684\u7ecf\u8425+\u65e0\u53cc\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5f88\u7545\u5feb\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u7528\u52a8\u8111\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4ec0\u4e48\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u753b\u9762\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d41\u7545\u8212\u670d\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5728\u65e0\u6240\u4e8b\u4e8b\u7684\u5468\u672b\u653e\u677e\u8eab\u5fc3\u3002\n\n\u524d\u671f\u5f88\u6109\u5feb\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4e3b\u89d2\u75af\u72c2\u64cd\u4f5c\u6765\u8fbe\u5230\u5f00\u6302\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7136\u800c\u5728\u4e2d\u76d8\u4e3b\u89d2\u8fc7\u5feb\u5730\u5347\u5230\u4e86\u6ee1\u7ea7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u540e\u9762\u51e0\u4e4e\u5c31\u662f\u6309\u7740F\u5feb\u8fdb\u5076\u5c14\u65e0\u804a\u5e2e\u5e2e\u5fd9\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u5355\u8c03\u4e4f\u5473\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u7ecf\u8425\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u8c13\u6beb\u65e0\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5347\u7ea7\u548c\u5efa\u9020\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4e5f\u5f88\u5c11\uff0c\u8fd9\u8ba9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u540e\u671f\u975e\u5e38\u4e4f\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u864e\u5934\u86c7\u5c3e\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1502129023, "timestamp_updated": 1502129023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34041775": {"recommendationid": "34041775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060083406", "num_games_owned": 2337, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502396204}, "language": "french", "review": "Jeu tres bon, on s'amuse bien dessus.

And this is very fun but the enemies can get stuck in rocks and you have to use a attack that you need to use on the ones that are hitting you but you have to kill them for the base attack to end so that sucks. \n\nSomething that really F*****G P***ED me off were hen in huge battles lords would spawn in and you have to kill every single one spending so much time then they get more troops and I have spent 30 MINUTES to finally kill off 9 lords with my troops helping me!!The only way that this can be fixed is if the Devs make it so when you kill one then it re-spawns with less health or make it so it can only have like 3 lives. Anyway after beating the game I have good things to say about it.\n\nOne of the things I LOVE is the big overall map because I have played mount and blade. So there the same almost. And when you get into big battles the killing of the grunts,shields,and archers is amazing. So much fun to do! But beware because the blood can cause lag. (Yeah forgot to add in the cans Devs can you make a way to turn blood off so my game does not crash :[ ) The leveling up your troops is just great\n\n                                                Anyway Devs you did a amazing job and I have a new troop idea A AXE KILLER \n\n\nSo all he does is have a giant axe he does lots of damage and takes XCXCC to kill. Hopefully think about what I said. \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                              -Pirate Shanty", "timestamp_created": 1501464073, "timestamp_updated": 1501464073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530162", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1501482857, "developer_response": "Howdy,\n\nThe Knights respawn timer does increase significantly every time they die so even if you're fighting a large number of knights as long as you keep killing them they will eventually take longer to respawn than it takes you to kill them.\nWere you using Flurry to take them down?\n\nThe blood isn't the cause of the performance, that is due to the high number of units on map at once. When you get to battles where 1000 units are fighting it's really tough to make that run well.\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed the game, Mount & Blade is definitely one of my inspirations. \n\nI'm currently working on expanding the core gameplay with some challenges and in the future I'll be looking into making some new unit types so stay tuned!\n\nCheers!"}, "33904778": {"recommendationid": "33904778", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995958112", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502822915}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr gut", "timestamp_created": 1501421091, "timestamp_updated": 1501421091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472222", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33901167": {"recommendationid": "33901167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296810246", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512145558}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u6211\u89ba\u5f97\u90a3\u4e9bNPC\u90fd\u56de\u8840\u592a\u5feb\n\n\u53ea\u6709\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c \u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u6771\u897f\u90fd\u4e0d\u932f \u5e0c\u671b\u6c34\u5e73\u80fd\u66f4\u597d", "timestamp_created": 1501408883, "timestamp_updated": 1501408883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33894184": {"recommendationid": "33894184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077362688", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501376867}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me gusto pero al rato de cae un poco de diversi\u00f3n,podr\u00edan agregar un sistema de misiones o algo parecido,mas equipos , naciones aliadas , mas trama en la historia que al principio no la entend\u00ed muy bien.\nEso muy buen juego ,si siguen sacando updates van por un buen camino", "timestamp_created": 1501377714, "timestamp_updated": 1501377714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33890240": {"recommendationid": "33890240", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966203934", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501518845}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn\u00b4t died even once to the way to lv150 not even second chance, that feels good to archive something with the rigth strategy.

price ou com desconto de 10%.\n\nPontos altos do jogo:\n\n1:  G\u00eanero: O jogo \u00e9 baseado na estrat\u00e9gia com elementos de Hack & Slash em 2D.\n\n2: Longevidade do jogo: O jogo dura cerca de 10 horas + se voc\u00ea for do tipo que conquista tudo no jogo e acaba construindo e recrutando todos Knights para se juntar a sua luta. As conquistas s\u00e3o faceis de se obter o que \u00e9 bastante legal para os que n\u00e3o tem paci\u00eancia para pegar todas ou at\u00e9 mesmo para os platinadores de plant\u00e3o. Depois de terminado o jogo j\u00e1 n\u00e3o vamos ter tanta vontade de jogar o modo New Game + j\u00e1 que \u00e9 mais do mesmo s\u00f3 que agora com seu personagem no n\u00edvel m\u00e1ximo e com tempo, mesmo mapa, mesmas coisas. A longetividade do jogo \u00e9 na sua campanha principal que \u00e9 muito bem constru\u00edda e intu\u00edtiva. Os elementos de RPG e estrat\u00e9gia s\u00e3o simples e f\u00e1ceis de aprender. \u00c9 claro, faltou profundidade nos elementos de estrat\u00e9gia como dominar os castelos inimigos, as torres inimigas e as aldeias inimigas que foram tomadas de voc\u00ea. A inteligente artifical do jogo \u00e9 muito boa tamb\u00e9m. Por\u00e9m, voc\u00ea sabendo administrar bem os lugares j\u00e1 tomados por voc\u00ea e recrutar Knights para se juntar a sua causa de trazer de volta sua terra tudo se torna bastante mais f\u00e1cil e n\u00e3o oferecendo tanta dificuldade assim. \n\nNarrativa: Somos um Knight onde temos que recrutar soldados e outros guerreiros (Knights) para se juntar a nossa causa e tomar de volta o que \u00e9 nosso, nossas terras e castelos. O enredo \u00e9 basicamente este e para a proposta do jogo est\u00e1 perfeito, j\u00e1 que vamos direto ao ponto e o importante \u00e9 tomar as terras que foram tomadas pelos inimigos e concluir o jogo. \n\nInterface: Simples, limpa e bonita. \n\n\nGr\u00e1ficos, ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o: Ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o muito boa e gr\u00e1ficos em 2D muito bonitos, com a capacidade de personalizar o seu personagem atr\u00e1ves do jogo, podendo escolher seu nome, armaduras e armas (tamb\u00e9m do workshop da steam) os gr\u00e1ficos combinam extremamente bem com o jogo e s\u00e3o muito bem feitos, nada coloridos e nem o mapa \u00e9 t\u00e3o colorido e com vida, tudo \u00e9 muito simples mas extremamente eficaz e feito com carinho pelo desenvolvedor. Acabamos por ver Knights inimigos bem diferentes e com habilidades diferentes e podemos at\u00e9 mesmo personalizar eles, tamb\u00e9m temos cen\u00e1rios diferentes: As aldeias s\u00e3o diferentes dos castelos, temos comboios, fortalezas e vilas para tomar de volta para n\u00f3s, tudo isso bem ambientado e gr\u00e1ficamente no ponto. Sem maiores problemas aqui.\n\nM\u00fasica: Combinando perfeitamente com o jogo, de fato pode ser um pouco repetitiva j\u00e1 que vamos escutar mais barulho de espadas e inimigos do que qualquer outra coisa, mas n\u00e3o tira o fato de que foi bem constru\u00edda dentro da proposta do jogo e n\u00e3o chega a enjoar.\n\n\nPontos negativos/fracos:\n\n1. Jogabilidade: A jogabilidade no teclado \u00e9 demasiada complicada para fazer os poderes especiais do seu Knight, usando basicamente as teclas: Z,X,C e para controlar o personagem as teclas WSAD. Com o tempo voc\u00ea acaba por acostumar mas mesmo assim deveria ser melhor trabalhada pois alem de cansar ficar esmagando os bot\u00f5es do teclado durante as batalhas, na hora dos combos a coisa fica realmente complicada. Outro ponto negativo \u00e9 que depois que desbloqueamos todas as skills do personagem e tamb\u00e9m as outras coisas para adicionar pontos o jogo fica relativamente facil at\u00e9 mesmo no teclado. Tira a divers\u00e3o? n\u00e3o, justamente porque o jogo \u00e9 curto e definitivamente no ponto de n\u00e3o tornar enjoativo. Mas \u00e9 \u00f3bvio que foi feito para se jogar no teclado do qual \u00e9 bem melhor e o desenvolvedor do jogo j\u00e1 avisa logo no come\u00e7o do jogo: Controle recomendado. Mesmo assim tive uma experi\u00eancia boa no teclado ap\u00f3s aprender, afinal depois de aprendemos um dos combos mais especiais do jogo com os pontos que gastamos para implementar tudo no jogo, o jogo se torna demasiado facil mas ainda sim divertido, boa variedade de combos e todas bem implementadas, os Knights inimigos tamb\u00e9m tem suas skills e alguns bem complicadinhos de derrotar. Mais sobre a jogabilidade: Quando conquistamos qualquer coisa, ela vai continuar crescendo e podemos aumentar sua eficiencia e at\u00e9 mesmo botar artilharias com dinheiro do jogo, assim nos dando mais knights e aumentando nossas defesas. Tamb\u00e9m contratamos Knights em cada castelo, assim se aliando a sua luta e tamb\u00e9m podendo acompanhar o jogador o que as vezes dependendo da habilidade deles podemos juntar at\u00e9 mais de 1000 soldados em campo de batalha.\n\nLevel Design e balanceamento: Muito bem feito, as batalhas ocorrendo com milhares de inimigos e seus knights \u00e9 divertido de ver, muito sangue na tela voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 ver e muitos combos legais. J\u00e1 o balanceamento do jogo depois que voc\u00ea pega a maneira de jogar, basta usar apenas um combo e tudo se torna demasiado f\u00e1cil para voc\u00ea pois voc\u00ea jogador basicamente destroi todas unidades inimigas (ou quase todas, j\u00e1 que temos batalhas de 500x500 as vezes ou at\u00e9 mais, o que deixa o jogo um pouco mais complicado) mas no geral, usando apenas um combo derrotamos milhares de soldados inimigos e tomamos a aldeia, castelo, comboio, torre ou da maneira que voc\u00ea deseja falar.\n\nIA: Boa inteligencia artifical dos inimigos e do seus companheiros, falhas as vezes e depois de pegar a maneira de jogar fica f\u00e1cil, mas no come\u00e7o tu sente que a IA dos inimigos \u00e9 bem desenvolvida.\n\nBugs, polimento: O jogo \u00e9 muito bem polido e o desenvolvedor \u00e9 bem ativo com a comunidade. Por\u00e9m, existe um BUG grav\u00edssimo do qual quando temos mais de 500 unidades nossas ou podendo chegar at\u00e9 2000 mil unidades o jogo cai de maneira dr\u00e1stica a frame rate, batendo os 5FPS, praticamente imposs\u00edvel de jogar e olha que eu ainda consegui ganhar batalhas enormes assim. Por\u00e9m, foi extremamente irritante e o desenvolvedor j\u00e1 me respondeu dizendo que \u00e9 algo imposs\u00edvel de corrigir devido a engine (acredito eu) ent\u00e3o evite andar com muito Knights ao seu lado e tamb\u00e9m recrutas que voc\u00ea pega das aldeia, castelos e tudo mais que voc\u00ea dominou. Este \u00e9 um bug grave, mas por isso a recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o, n\u00e3o fa\u00e7a como eu e leve Knights contratados em castelos (que s\u00e3o poderosos) e que podem trazer juntos milh\u00f5es de cavalheiros porque vai passar raiva como eu passei, mas no final das contas \u00e9 at\u00e9 divertido ver aquele sangue todo colorindo um pouco da ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o sem muita cor do jogo.\n\nNotas finais: Hyper Knights \u00e9 um jogo bem polido e com poucas falhas, ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o bonitinha, gr\u00e1ficos em 2D bonitos, controles um pouco mal feitos no teclado mas bem feitos no controle, combates fren\u00e9ticos, um pouco de mistura de estrat\u00e9gia e administra\u00e7\u00e3o das suas unidades e castelos e tudo mais o que o jogo pode oferecer dentro do seu mapa que \u00e9 de tamanho m\u00e9dio para este tipo de jogo. Hyper Knights \u00e9 o t\u00edpico jogo que me divertiu muito e \u00e9 realmente viciante a ponto do jogador n\u00e3o largar o mesmo at\u00e9 tomar suas terras e dominar todo mapa novamente e destruir completamente seus inimigos e vencer o jogo. A campanha dura bem para o pre\u00e7o do jogo e logo ap\u00f3s pegar todas conquistas e vencer o jogo vamos liberar o modo New Game + que acaba por n\u00e3o oferecer nada demais, apenas seu personagem em n\u00edvel m\u00e1ximo, com contagem de tempo e mais do mesmo o que acaba n\u00e3o estimulando o jogador a prosseguir e dominar novamente TODO mapa j\u00e1 que depois da campanha finalizada o jogo sim, vai se tornar extremamente enjoativo jogar tudo novamente. Lembrando: A conquista New game + \u00e9 liberada apenas se clicar em iniciar New game + ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o se preocupe com o fato de ter que re-jogar todo o mesmo mapa para obter uma conquista, o que seria extremamente rid\u00edculo na minha opini\u00e3o j\u00e1 que nada muda.

Ich weiss es ehrlich gesagt nicht mehr, war vermutlich eine Mischung aus Empfehlung+exzellente Bewertungen und reduzierter Preis im Summer Sale.\nWar es das wert? Als Ersteindruck: nein. Das Spiel \u00fcberfordert erstmal Spieler wie mich die kein Gamepad besitzen (wird auf der Shopseite aber darauf hingewiesen, bin nur schwer belehrbar), da irgendwie alle Tasten scheinbar willk\u00fcrlich vertauscht festgelegt sind (z f\u00fcr schlie\u00dfen, r f\u00fcr beenden, Leertaste zum best\u00e4tigen, Esc+Enter tun nichts, ...). Nachdem man alles umbelegt hat stellt man fest, dass die urspr\u00fcngliche Belegung gar nicht so dumm war und versucht sich an den ersten Schlachten. Ohne F\u00e4higkeiten laufen die aber erstmal sehr unspektakul\u00e4r ab und das Spiel landet f\u00fcr 2 Wochen in der Ecke. Danach gewinnt die Neugier und die mangelnde Akzeptanz das investierte Geld abzuschreiben und der Zweite Versuch beginnt: und HOLY MACCARONI macht das s\u00fcchtig...\nDas stumpfe Geschnetzel wird wesentlich spannender sobald man rausfindet, wie man F\u00e4higkeiten benutzt und was die lustigen Balken unter der Lebensanzeige machen. \nEs vergehen ca. 8 Stunden ohne dass ich Notiz davon nehme.\nDas Spielprinzip besteht aus einer Strategiekarte, auf der man seinen Helden bewegt, Streitkr\u00e4fte (3 Arten) f\u00fcr Geld anheuert (in St\u00e4dten und Siedlungen), feindliche St\u00fctzpunkte angreift, hier wechselt das Spiel in den Schlachtmodus und man k\u00e4mpft selbst an forderster Front und kann seiner Armee grob Befehler erteilen. Nach Sieg oder Niederlage geht es auf der Weltkarte weiter und man schl\u00e4gt sich mit seinem Geld durch, sammelt nach jeder Schlacht Erfahrung, investiert diese in bessere F\u00e4higkeiten und passive Skills und irgendwann wird Geld zur \u00dcberflussware und die Gegner auch deutlich st\u00e4rker ohne, dass man seine Hunderttausende irgendwie sinnvoll einsetzen k\u00f6nnte. \nZiel des Spiels ist die Eroberung der ganzen Karte, woran einen die Ggner aber sehr beharrlich hindern, indem sie eroberte Regionen zur\u00fcckerobern und das ganze entwickelt sich zu einem m\u00fchsamen Tauziehen wenn man nich strategisch Regionen vom Nachschub abschneidet. \nGegen Ende wird das ganze etwas z\u00e4h und man ist irgendwie erleichtert, dass es vorbei ist und wundert sich, wieso man das Spiel am Anfang schwer fand als alle gef\u00fchlten Lategame-Schwierigkeiten noch nciht vorhanden waren.\nH\u00e4tte ich gewusst, was hinter dem Spiel steckt, h\u00e4tte ich locker das zehnfache daf\u00fcr ausgegeben.

The game features 11 different unique abilities and many different scenarios to use them which gives a lot of depth to the combat system.\n\nCheers!"}, "33784263": {"recommendationid": "33784263",

you\u2019ve got Hyper Knights. Intrigued? I know I was when I heard about this little gem. Truthfully, Hyper Knights came out of left field but it quickly became a bit of an obsession for me. I started playing and suddenly hours had passed. My fingers hurt but half the map was mine!\n\nThere are obviously key differences between this game and its forefathers. Mount & Blade is far more engrossing, complex, and skill based. Hyper Knights on the other hand is easy to pick up and play, quick, and combat is very simplistic. Sometimes you want that simplicity and fun, other times you may be craving something more.\n\nIf you are craving something deeper then you have a buffet worth of games to enjoy. If you are like me and sometimes want some mindless slaughter and light tactics, pickings can be slim.(Outside the mobile market.) I haven\u2019t found a game that I can enjoy like this since playing Gemfire, an old Sega Genesis game.\n\nOh and if you do have any suggestions there is a comment section. Feel free to share.\n\nHyper Knights has two primary game modes, the map and combat map. Sound familiar?\n\nStory is super light but basically Red guys took all of your Blue lands. Time to raise up an army and lay down a medieval butt kicking. Beyond that, the game is all about territory control and gaining/losing ground. The world map is where you move your personal army about and make territory improvements. Each territory has three kind of nodes, village, castle, and keep, each with three levels of upgrades to make them more efficient/produce/stronger. It\u2019s a simplistic economy that becomes very important as you progress.\n\nVillages make gold that the castle needs to make troops. Gold can\u2019t be transported without troops. While it does need a bit of a jump start, it runs efficiently long as no enemies get in the way. Keeps are there just to serve as strongholds and make conquering a territory difficult. The castle is the last node that can be taken before it switches the territory to the other side, which makes keeps very useful.\n\nKeep in mind that you aren\u2019t doing all of this alone. While you choose what to improve, the game generates \u201cRoamers\u201d who serve as a light defense and help run the economy. You can also recruit Knights who serve as generals and are far better at combat. These Knights can be assigned to defend/attack and level up just like you do. The beauty of these systems is that it took longer to write out then it does take grasp it when playing. It\u2019s super simple and works really well.\n\nThe only gripe I have is that there is currently only one world map to conquer. Hopefully new content is on the way to change things up occasionally. Another slight issue I had was with the enemy itself. They have the entire map filled out at the beginning of the game. At times it feels like you\u2019re only alive because the game is merciful and just doesn\u2019t send everything at you. On the flip side, this gives the game a bit of a manic feeling with one territory capture leading to bigger and bigger fights.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind an option for both armies to start with one territory and build towards each other. Running raids, surprise attacks, etc.\n\nNow all that strategy/territory is nice but the heart of the game is the combat. Hyper Knights is best played with a controller and thankfully does have controller support. Just like M&B depending on what or where you\u2019re attacking is going to alter the combat map. Raiding a castle requires destruction of gates, and eventually the throne. Raiding a village requires burning it down. Same applies for convoys, keeps, etc.\n\nYour character has combos, stuns, basic attacks, and dashes. Basic attacks are going to make your fingers bleed by pressing the X and Y button repeatedly in certain combo combinations to kill enemies. As an example archers require Y-Y-Y and melee attackers X-X-X but as you fight Knights and more advanced enemies these begin to change up rapidly. Requiring more complicated combinations and punishing you with damage for you not getting them correct.\n\nWhile stuns and dashes are self explanatory, combos are equivalent to using special powers. You gain skill points and combo points as you successfully attack your enemy. Skill points enhance passives like health, army size, and troop strength. While combo points unlock Super Slash, an attack that kills everything in sight. At first you only have access to healing and spike which is a basic attack.\n\nNot to worry though as you are given more than enough points to master all skills/combos as you brutally murder your enemies. The combat, just like the world map, is super easy to grasp and it doesn\u2019t take long to get into the action. There are more fine details such as squads, and Knight\u2019s shields, and second breaths but it\u2019s all to enhance that combat. Not to mention the random events that can occur. Sudden surprise attacks from within, all nodes becoming crippled to name a couple.\n\nOverall the combat is a blast and watching the battlefield become red after a Super slash is fantastic. The only problem lies in the late game, it can be a bit of a slog when you start throwing six hundred vs six hundred. You become heavily dependent on those combos and may break your x and y button. Battles for castles become tiring, as more and more enemy reinforcements arrive. The challenge doesn\u2019t really escalate but it feels more annoying than threatening. The AI is incredibly dumb and you can wipe out whole armies by yourself. Just keep your army safe and away and go to town.\n\nHyper Knights goes the extra mile and offers some customization. While not the most extravagant of choices, you can swap out weapons, helmets, and chest armor. The cherry on top comes in the form of Steam workshop support. Suddenly, you could be a medieval knight swinging a lightsabre. Hyper Knights has picked up some good buzz so hopefully more will come from the community itself as well.\n\nHyper KnightsThe graphics are cute and serve exactly the purpose they need to get the point across. I personally liked little touches like enemy Knights getting an introduction and raising their arms up. The only suggestion I would have for the developer would be to add some more absurd humor to the game, as it just kinda fits. Other than that, I have no issues with the graphics at all. They work very well.\n\nThe music and sounds are just about par. I wasn\u2019t terribly impressed but I wasn\u2019t disappointed either. You could play the game just fine with the OST or bring your own tunes. In this particular case it\u2019s going to be personal choice.\n\nLast but certainly not least, Hyper Knights supports Twitch, has Steam cards and achievements. Replay is there but I think once the developer adds more maps it\u2019s going to go through the roof as far as replay-ability. Right now you have one map and that can get repetitive. Each play through can take about two to four hours, but there is a new game+ mode. This mode lets you keep all your levels and combos and serves as a speedrun type of deal.\n\nHyper Knights isn\u2019t going to revolutionize gaming, but I loved it for what it is.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen many games like Hyper Knights and for that alone I obviously highly recommend this title. For me it falls into this weird section of developers innovating what you know and love ever so slightly to make it feel fresh. Which brings me to my final point. This game costs less than a McValue meal.  Coming in at the low price of $4.99/\u00a33.99 there is really no reason not to add this excellent title to your Steam library.", "timestamp_created": 1499647775, "timestamp_updated": 1499647823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590242", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33403383": {"recommendationid": "33403383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067747282", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499603043}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub9d0\ud558\uc790\uba74 2D \ud0d1\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ubb34\uc30d\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\ud655\uc2e4\ud788 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uace0 \ud0c0\uaca9\uac10\ub3c4 \uc88b\uc73c\uba70 \ubb34\uc30d\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc870\uae08 \ub354 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc5ec\uc57c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub2e8\uc810\ub3c4 \uc81c\ubc95 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n1. \uc2a4\ud0ac\uc740 \uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \uac15\ud55c\ub370 \ubcd1\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc740 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc57d\ud55c \ubb34\uc30d \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub9ce\uc774 \uac00\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n2. \uc5ed\uc2dc \ubb34\uc30d\uacfc \uac19\uc774 \uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\ub3c5\uc131\uc740 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uacc4\uc18d \ud558\ub294\ub370 \uadf8\ub7ec\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc9c0\ub8e8\ud558\uae34 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n3. \uc774\uc0c1\ud55c \ubc84\uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \uba87\uac1c \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc73c\ub860 \uc660\uc9c0 \ubc14\ub2e4\ub97c \uac78\uc5b4\uc624\ub294 \uc801\uacfc \uc6b0\ub9ac \uae30\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc774\ub77c\ub358\uac00...\n4, 2\ud68c\ucc28\uac00 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. new game+ \ub77c\uace0 \ud574\uc11c \ud574\ubd24\ub294\ub370 \uc870\uae08\ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\ud574\uc624\ub294\uac70 \ub9d0\uace0\ub294 \ub531\ud788 \ub2e4\ub978\uac78 \ub290\ub07c\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uac9f\ub354\uad70\uc694.\n\n\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc7a5\uc810\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n1. \uc2a4\ud0ac\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2dc\uc6d0\uc2dc\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc885\uc5d0 \uc5f4\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450\uac1c\uc758 \uc2a4\ud0ac\uc740 \uc5f0\ucd9c\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \ub458\ub2e4 \uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \uc88b\ub354\uad70\uc694.\n2. \ubcd1\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc774 \uc57d\ud574\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc778 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc8fd\uae30\ub294 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8\ub807\ub2e4\uace0 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc744 \uc548\uc4f0\uba74 \uc548\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ub2e8 \ubcd1\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e4 \uc8fd\uc73c\uba74(\ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \uc0b4\uc544\uc788\uc5b4\ub3c4) \uac8c\uc784 \uc624\ubc84\uac00 \ub418\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba74 \ud568\uaed8 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc5ec\uc57c \ud558\uace0 \uc2a4\ud0ac \ud558\ub098\ub97c \ube7c\uace0\ub294 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \uac74\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ub370\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc904 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc11c \ubcd1\uc0ac\ub97c \uacc4\uc18d \uc8fc\uc2dc\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc22b\uc790\uac00 \ub9ce\uc73c\uba74 \uc801 \uc7a5\uc218\ub97c \uc21c\uc2dd\uac04\uc5d0 \uc7a1\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\uc8e0. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c \ud22c\uc0ac\uccb4\ub97c \ub9c9\ub294 \uc274\ub4dc\uc640 \ubc84\ud504 \uc2a4\ud0ac\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uae30\ub3c4 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n3. \uc2a4\ud300 \ucc3d\uc791\ub9c8\ub2f9\uc73c\ub85c \ucee4\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c8\uc774\uc9d5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uac01\uae30\ub3d9\ub300SAC\uc758 \ubaa8\uc790\uc774\ud06c\uac00 \uc555\uad8c\n3. \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc27d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.(...)\n\n\uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ubc95 \uad1c\ucc2e\uace0 \uc911\ub3c5\uc131 \uc788\ub294\uac8c\uc784 \uc774\uc5d0\uc694.", "timestamp_created": 1499605012, "timestamp_updated": 1499605012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33379487": {"recommendationid": "33379487", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992180148", "num_games_owned": 868, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503947510}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fast gameplay, easy interface and controls, plenty of upgrades and the feel of a large scale war.

We need to conquer the land by taking it from traitors. There are two parts of game where we can spend time. First one is the world map that is very similar to Mount&Blade one. But the difference is that when we are in battle, the world is alive, it's not set on feeze. The battle is mostly dependent on us. We have our minions that help us (together with knights if we hire them) but they cant do it alone. We fight by pressing specific buttons on the controler or the keyboard. We also have access to skills that help us fight with more problematic amounts of enemies.\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes to feel as a leader and powerfull king. 9 nice hours of fun gameplay and 100% achievements, 8.700 enemies killed. Well done to the producer.\n\nI also have some ideas that would make it even better if the producer would like to update the game in the future. \nFirstly I would give something like battle size limit. At the end I had battles like 1600 vs 1000. When the most of the minions spawned the game started lagging and the minions started to walk in circles, even if i showed direction on the map, they were not doing anything with sense. Another thing is the level of character. 150 is max but it's too easy to reach it. I was able to get it after conquering like 6 areas which is like 20% of the map. I would make it harder to get. Next thing are the skills. In the whole game I used like 3-4 skills. Healing, whirlwind, inspire and Super Slash... The rest was completly useless. The good thing would be boosting the rest or nerfing the rest. And last think I didn't like was the power of the guy that defended castles. It sometimes almost impossible to kill him as when I attacked him, I was dying from nothing. I don't know if he has any reflected damage or something, but it was deadly. And they were much more powerful than any other knight that can move on map. Im also curious if there is gonna be multiplayer where 2 or more players can move on the map and help each other, that would be nice! :)\nKind regards and good luck with other games! \nNexaiter", "timestamp_created": 1499530383, "timestamp_updated": 1499530383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33376648": {"recommendationid": "33376648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373000182", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499594921}, "language": "english", "review": "Very funny game I the balance was perfect.

Doesn't offer PS4 controller support on OSX where it shows up as a generic controller that almost every other game supports with zero hassle or third party software. Gave the develpers plenty of time to reply in the forums.\n\nNothing.\n\nGoing to give them another day and this is going to get a refund.[/strike]\n\n\n\nController issue has been mitigated. The PS4 controller on OSX currently requires a wired connection to work. Note the game GUI is mouse-less and a controller should be mandatory.\n\nAs for the game itself. It\u2019s a very light 4Xish crossed with Mount and Blade with Dynasty Warrior. \n\nYou run around an over map managing your empire, building and renovating, moving your armies protecting and raiding convoys and finding more knights so you can raise more armies. You can\u2019t send messengers so if you want something done on the other side of the map you have to do it yourself. Thankfully mid to late game you have more than enough cash to do what you need in an area in one go.\n\nThe combat forgoes the normal conventions for the most enemies as each one has a common button combination that is required to be pressed to do damage with each button representing a point of health(With exceptions). Counterpart Knights have a health bar but damage is applied all the same one button at a time.\n\nThe game then again breaks this with super powers. Any damaging power (Again with exceptions) is a one hit kill for anything that isn\u2019t a knight. Stronger powers and stats are locked behind a level wall but you can save your points for those big juicy ones you are going to use all the time and gaining experience is easy and the amount of exp required never increase so you level up faster as the armies get bigger resulting in more kills. There is a cap to this as you will run out of powers to spend points on.\n\nSurprisingly enough the combat is fluid and when you get good enough your normal gameplay emulates a late game superpower. However no matter how good you are without your entirely disposable troops you are nothing as extremely large numbers punishes mistakes harshly as you don\u2019t have a safe zone nor distractions to draw fire away. Also you cannot damage buildings making anything outside of field battles impossible to \u201cSolo\u201d.\n\n[b]There is a \u201cRealm Divide\u201d event so if you know what it is and did\u2019t like it you have been warned.[/b]\n\nIt does unfortunately have performance issues in larger battles which is disappointing given far more visually demanding and complex games run better with greater numbers. The AI is fine and I have no complaints with it\u2019s behaviour, it just that there seems to be a bottleneck somewhere even though the game feeds additional numbers in waves. With that said it is only a issue in the largest of battles with multiple armies pouring in \n\nA small solid game and a steal even at normal price. \n\nEndless Loop has come a loooonnng way from the first game they release of which I immediately regretted buying.

It is a game which puts you in the command of an army and yourself as the badass king who leads them. The gameplay loop of Hyper Knights is pretty simplistic, most of the enemies you face can be killed by two button prompts: X or C. Some enemies can be killed by three same button prompts or a mix of the two.\n\n You can also use space for Dashing and F to heal yourself or perform a combo when your combo meter has filled up. The enemies also tend to be only of two types: melee and ranged. \nYou can also command your troops to fight alongside you in the battles to take over enemy fortresses. While the initial premise does not seem that interesting,\n\n Hyper Knights provides enough large scale battles on a small platform to remain fun for sometime without getting overly repetitive. While you are not busy fighting in the real time battles, you can manage your troops and your controlled regions and castles. The castles you control can be given troops to increase their protection or troops can be withdrawn to help you in your various raids. \n\nWhen you attack an enemy castle, it shows you the amount of soldiers present in it which helps you decide in attacking or abandoning the raid. In such a case, you can either kill a few roamers which will help you upgrade as well as decrease the enemy castle\u2019s strength.\n\n The real fun of Hyper Knights starts when you join a friendly knights battle or vice versa. From here you will witness hundreds of mini soldiers clashing against each other while you make your way through the battlefields like this game wants you to be. Since killing enemy soldiers is really easy, it gives you the sense of a king without being too overwhelming.\n\n You can only do this sort of badassery only while you are surrounded by your troops though as going Rambo against a squadron of enemy troops will make you fodder for the archers. When you die, you are given a proper quick time event with which you can resurrect yourself on the battlefield while failing to do so will respawn you way back to the starting point while your soldiers get slaughtered without their leader. \n\nHyper Knights does well to keep things balanced and it keeps turning up the difficulty so that you never get too overpowered but even then, there is very little depth to the game. Take down the scale of the battles and nearly every battle you fight is the same in regards to the gameplay.\n\n The only difference between fighting roamers and castles is that you have to destroy a few buildings while you are raiding an enemy fortress. Let me correct myself there, your soldiers have to destroy a few buildings as you don\u2019t have the ability to destroy the said buildings.\n\nRegardless of the power you use there is no way your sword does damage to a structure where your soldiers take their own slow time to destroy the buildings. These structures also provide no benefit to the enemies as till the time the gates are closed the enemy remains trapped inside. They don\u2019t fire from the top or anything, they just stand there while your soldiers bash away at the gates.\n\n Another point to be noted is that since you require soldiers to destroy buildings and there are a few stages where buildings need to be destroyed to gain a victory, if you do not have a soldier left at the end of such a stage there is no way but to replay it all over again. It becomes quite stale after some time and there is no real incentive to keep playing as the story is very negligible. \n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nPersonally, I did not like the way Hyper Knights present itself. While my first impressions of Hyper Knights were average, it reuses many assets that it quickly becomes tiresome to the eyes. Even though some of the large scale battles manage to stand out, the bland maps and clunky unit movements make visuals a less impressive package than it could have been.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nSimilar to its play style, the soundtrack of Hyper Knights feels like a miniature version of epic sound designs. It is smooth and soothing with light hints of war sound design mixed in subtly. The problem though is the fact that Hyper Knights use the same soundtrack everywhere and like the rest of the game, it also slowly grows boring to hear to.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nHyper Knights is an enjoyable albeit repetitive romp through miniature army clashes. It has the ability to make you sit down and play it for a few short bursts and that should mostly be what you should be expecting at its price of admission but a lack of depth and the fact that every battle feels the same makes it a loose its steam before it should.\n\n[h1]Rating: 60/100[/h1]\n\n\nThis review was brought to you by [url=www.gamephasis.com]GamePhasis[/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1496851331, "timestamp_updated": 1496851331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32225820": {"recommendationid": "32225820", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987966735", "num_games_owned": 511, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496957681}, "language": "polish", "review": "Ca\u0142kiem przyjemna, polecam :)", "timestamp_created": 1496776496, "timestamp_updated": 1496776496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32224483": {"recommendationid": "32224483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065970611", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497044402}, "language": "french", "review": "Se jeu est impressionnant pour juste 5 euro , traduit en 8 langue le seul point n\u00e9gatif est le niveau max a 150 dommage", "timestamp_created": 1496771585, "timestamp_updated": 1496771585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32223836": {"recommendationid": "32223836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280046019", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501806767}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s addictif et sympa.\nJ'ai fini le jeu en 15 heures mais j'aurais pu faire un peu plus vite je pense.", "timestamp_created": 1496769407, "timestamp_updated": 1496769437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32219384": {"recommendationid": "32219384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039389135", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506968176}, "language": "german", "review": "A really awesome game.

The loop is simple, fight the enemy army with your's and win the day!  \n\nMenus:  The menus are pretty cut and dry as the game isn't really graphics intensive.  You have your resolution options that go up to 4k, full screen toggle, vsync, AA, the option to turn off the gaming running when alt tabbed, language options and the friends names, which will be knights you can hire or fight against while playing.  \n\nThere is also Twitch integration which allows your viewers to give you extra gold and experience and name knights after them.\n\nYou have seperate sliders for sound and music, as well as a master slider.\n\nAll the controls are rebindable from the options menu.\n\nThe game supports Steam Workshop integration for armor and weapon sets.\n\nMusic/Sound:  The music fits the game, it has a nice mediviel sound to it and the sound effects, while generic suit the game well.\n\n\n\nGameplay:  This is the meat and potatoes of this game, it's a simple gameplay loop of raise armies, fight other armies, raid villages, siege castles, and face other knights in fast-paced combo combat where each unit type requires different combos to take down.  While you can use special abilities to heal or wreak havok on your opponents.  And this is where the game to me becomes monotous and boring as it's the same loop, but you have more knights and you have more combos and skills.\n\nThe AI does their own thing and you have limited control of your army, using the map to tell where troops to go, but beyond that, no other control.\n\n\nControls:  A controller is strongly reccomended for this game.  And as mentioned above, all the controls are rebindable for your own comfort.\n\n\nTLDR\n\nPros:\nSimple and addictve gameplay.\nRebindable Keys.\n\nNeutral:\nTwitch Integration\nMusic/Sound\n\nCons:\nGameplay becomes repetitve.\nThe game turns in to a grind.\nEverything is a QTE\nEnemy Knights can become a chore as they focus you.\nLimited control over the AI.", "timestamp_created": 1496518430, "timestamp_updated": 1496518430, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32155784": {"recommendationid": "32155784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139815379", "num_games_owned": 2802, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496374071}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a ton of fun.

You are forced to retreat taking total losses since he can't die and needs to be killed to complete objective.  Additionally I found my captains getting stuck on corners when I order then to take or defend territory that's requires more and a strait line.\nKilling Captains becomes a game of using max tier frenzy 2-3 times and late game involves managing respawn timers. Though this Can be fun it gets repetitive after a while with no viable alternative.\n\nOverall:\nThis is an absolute Gem!  For someone who loves M&B along with Chivalry this game is a fun 2d arcade mashup.  I honestly have had more fun with this game than I did with some of the AAA games such as Fallout 4, Witcher 3 etc.  I would highly recommend getting this game especially since it's listed at only $5!!!  The developers obviously know what is fun and I would like to see more content from this group.\n\nDeveloper Request:\nI would love to see more mod support for this great game.

As a person who put in nearly 1000 hours into mount and blade I had fun with this game. Once you got going and hiring lords to back you up it got pretty crazy. Based on my Hours of Record when writing this I beat the game is roughly 7 hours with the last hours being a sort of slong due to some issues. \n\ncons:\n1: Not many things to put your money into late game. \n2: You have to issue orders to each of your knights which in the late game you can easily have 15-20+ which ordering them through takes more time then it needs to. I personally see two ideas to fix this. Let there be a muti select  so you can quickly rush through and pick the knights you want before choosing where you want them to attack or hang around. Another change is to let you tell your knights to \"Roam\" Where they will move to lands that near by and being attacked. If they are not being attacked they will move in to attack and raid lands. This would cut down on micro in the mid to late game. \n3:As of writing this, there is no mouse support when in combat you may not really need it. The Menus and map really needs it.\n4:There is only one mode that I can tell. So if you want the game to be easier or harder you can't tell it such things. \n5:Real issues of slow down in the late game as the AI of every knight and roamer moves around the map when in combat. When you have a few 200s of men on both sides and with the map AI running in the back ground and even joining in mid combat when being awesome. Slows down the game and lead to frame rate issues.\n6:There is no real punishment for the most part of missing a hit and getting it blocked. I feel there should be a gold and xp bonus based on hits made/hits blocked to make smaller battles more useful to the player. \n7: There is no auto battle for cleaning up small roaming squads.\n8: You can't get personal bodyguards aka weaker knights to help you out on harder fights. \n\npros:\n1: It has what I personally like about Mount and blade warband and what I like about one finger death punch. \n2: The early game is vary strong and seems to work well for what the game seems to aim for. \n\nI can't come up with many pros since it's a fast and weirdly addictive game with most fights not lasting to vary long and when you die you don't out right lose the battle. You get to revive after words but I feel the revive times are a little short some times due to Ai heros being able to stall out a match when it is just one hero reviving right after another right before the one before them dies. When you lose your men, match over. There is no fight to the death and this should be for both sides really. \n\nKeeping everything in mind with the annoyinces I rather like it, I just hope they clean up the late game a bit.", "timestamp_created": 1493675339, "timestamp_updated": 1493675339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500056", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1493984395, "developer_response": "Howdy,\n\n1: The next update going live today features Overmap Buildings which cost Gold to build and Upgrade, also some interesting events that will force you to rebuild and re-take some nodes so that should balance out the Gold gain.\n\n2: Also improved the Knight Orders UI significantly, you can now multi-select, view their current orders and set them to follow the player. \n\n3: I have planned to add mouse support, hopefully next week.\n\n4: I plan to add a New Game+ mode before release, sort of like a speedrun mode. If the game is successful I'd love to work on more campaigns or challenge modes. Difficulty is something I'm always tweaking but not sure if I'll add specific Easy, Normal, Hard modes.\n\n5: v0.16 contains many performance improvements so it should run a lot more smoothly especially in late game.\n\n6: I've tried adding a real punishment for hitting the wrong button but it just made the game extremely frustrating, sometimes the target may change right before you press the button so I really want to avoid that. Adding bonus is an interesting idea but I'm afraid if would mess up the whole difficulty design and end up making the game too easy for good players and too hard for bad players.\n\n7: Auto resolve is something I have on my list to try out, I definitely want to avoid having the late game feel like a slog but don't want it to be completely skippable either. I'll have to try out various designs and see if it works.\n\n8: With the new Knight orders if you set a Knight to follow you he will join you in battle every time.\n\n\n----\n\nI adore Mount & Blade so that is definitely the feeling I was going for, I'm glad you enjoy the combat system!\n\nThe goal with respawn is to have a penalty but not an extremely harsh penalty. Sometimes, especially in late game, you can just make a few mistakes and die. If you would lose your army of 200 units as soon as you died that would be extremely frustrating.\nThe Knights respawn timer increases every time they die so the scenario where they are constatly reviving one after another shouldn't happen too often.\n\nMany thanks for the great feedback!\n"}, "31431553": {"recommendationid": "31431553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070916717", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493864095}, "language": "english", "review": "So far so good.

And while I will recommend, I must say that it's not perfect. That's understandable though, because this game is early access. This is good to know because that means the devs can still iron off the rough spots. And since I've noticed that they are reading their game's reviews, I decided that I'd list off a few rough spots that have been getting on my nerves in case they ever read this review.\n\n1st up is a controls issue for the keyboard. Every time I try to dash northwest or southeast, no dashing occurs. I can dash in all other directions, but not in the 2 I previously mentioned.\n\nUp next is an issue with the knights. When I order a knight to defend a region, I expect that knight keep to that region and eradicate any traitors that set foot inside that region's boundaries. But rather than doing that, the knight in question charges headlong into the neighboring traitor territories, calls down a retaliation force too large for him to handle, and comes back broken, battered, and looking for more men to start the cycle all over again. Which brings me to my next problem.\n\nWhen your knight comes back from their aforementioned beating in the traitor territories, they immediately seek out a fresh army. The trouble with that is that when you have many knights, it is very difficult for the castles and villages and other troop producing locations to keep up with the demand even when fully upgraded. This leads to the knights sucking the region dry and leaving it open for the traitors to swoop in and take over again.\n\nAnd there is 1 final problem that really bothers me. And this problem is that while you can strike down foe after foe on the battle field without using a single power, your ordinary attacks do absolutely nothing to buildings. In my opinion that make absolutely no sense what so ever. Seriously, if your minions' normal attacks can do it, then why can't your normal attacks do so to?\n\nIn short: Great game, Endless Loop. But the keyboard controls need a little fixing, the knights need to learn how to follow orders, the troops need to be trained faster, and the player character needs to be able to deal at least a small amount of damage to buildings with their normal attacks.", "timestamp_created": 1492562570, "timestamp_updated": 1492562570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31203015": {"recommendationid": "31203015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091733856", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504216188}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow!

There are some issues, mostly to do with balancing and game length, as well as some bugs.\n\nFirst things first, the positives:\n\n1. Easy to learn (controller is a good idea as someone who prefers keyboard/mouse). All the buttons do simple things and it's really not hard to get into the mechanics. The trick is learning to use your B and your combo metre effectively. \n2. Pretty meaty for EA. 6 hours isn't bad, and I imagine the game will get longer. As it stands, the gameplay remains pretty much the same start to finish, but that's not a bad thing. \n3. For the most part, the game is responsive and if you play well, you will be rewarded.\n4. Finally, the game isn't ugly. Models are repeated but they don't look bat at all. \n\nThere are a few negatives:\n\n1. Very prone to dominant strategy. You never want to expend all your combo meter because there's never a better reason to spend your last combo meter than to heal.  A lot of the combos are redunant because some of them are simply better. There's no real reason to use the YYYY combo because the XXXX combo does the same thing but is easier to judge.\n2. Some instances stunlock you for an unfair amount of time and damage, and very rarely do you feel like you deserved the amount of damage you took as a result of being stunlocked. Thankfully, your AAAA heals you from pretty much the start of the game, so health isn't a huge issue.\n3. The rules aren't equal for you and your opponent. Your opponent can respawn even if he is out of soldiers and can often win just because he could hold out long enough to bring in replacements, but you lose the moment you lose your last soldier, even if you are still fine - you aren't given a chance to hold out for reinforcement.\n4. Often, it's not worth trying to fight the bosses properly, just slamming the XYXY until they're dead is more effective. They just don't take enough damage from you hitting them normally to make it worthwhile. \n5. Last thing, and just a bit of a nitpick, (they added a button to skip these events, but I would've just liked to be able to turn them off) but every time a hero comes into your camera view, you're forced to sit through a little intro ditty. It wouldn't be so bad, but it interrupts play and can often mean you take damage as it interrupts a keystroke that would've seen you dodge a rock or arrow that ends up stunlocking you. \n\nFor an early access, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I had fun and I never really truly felt like the game was being unfun, and I could always come back from sticky situations if I played it right.

In Hyper Knights, you can slash your way through battles, manage your army, and hire other knights to aid you in battle.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics in Hyper Knights are cute-ish and pixel and are, for the most part, pretty decently well done.\nFrom what I can tell so far, a lot of the assets are re-used over and over again, which does get bland rather quickly. Every knight is completely unique with differing looks. The walking animation in Hyper Knights looks really awkward from certain angles, and with hundreds of units (yourself and other knights included) all sharing the same walking animation, it tends to look pretty pretty bad, but all in all the graphics are decent.\n\n[h1]Audio & Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe audio in Hyper Knights is fairly well done but a little bit repetitive. I quite enjoyed listening to the music during the massive fights because it feels like it's straight out of a medieval/fantasy themed movie. The overworld shares the same music with the title screen and it tends to get a little bit annoying if you spend a lot of time in the overworld (which I did). The sound effects in Hyper Knights are decent as well and don't get too annoying, which is always a plus.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay in Hyper Knights is both management and hack-and-slash combat which is an interesting combination. In the overworld you must watch over both your own units and enemy units, protect your villages and convoys, while also taking the fight to the enemies' front lines and claiming their land for your own. You can hire mercenary Knights to fight alongside you which decreases the amount of time you have to spend defending convoys and allowing you to fight enemy Knights head on. When I first started playing Hyper Knights, I had a lot of trouble with the controls, hence why a Controller is recommended. I do not, however, own a controller, so I rebinded the keys to better suit my playstyle. I highly suggest you rebind the keys completely as well, because the default keybindings are god-awful.\n\nI really enjoy the combat in Hyper Knights, especially when you join a multiple Knight battle with hundreds of units on the screen at once. It really feels like a battle because of the sheer magnitude of enemies and allies on screen. You can call for reinforcements when you're in a sticky situation, but your enemies can too. They can also recapture areas of land that you had claimed for yourself, so you have to always stay vigilent and prepared to defend a castle.\n\nI did however encounter a (potentially) gamebreaking bug when trying to load the game. I'm unsure whether it's my own stupidity or a bug in the code, but I cannot load games because the game is essentially frozen and no keys work.\n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1]\nThe story in Hyper Knights is kind of vague and not really explained by the game. I'm about an hour into the game (including having to reset my progress because of the aforementioned load bug) and I'm not entirely sure what the story is. The tutorial shows you that you're castle is under attack, and one can assume that you are a lord/duke/baron/etc with both power and money, fending off rival lords or rebels. I would really appreciate it if the developers were able to flesh out the story a bit better, such as giving a bit of exposition after taking a castle or beating a Knight.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nOverall Hyper Knights is a fairly fun game, and I highly recommend buying the game just to experience the sheer awesomeness of the sometimes huge battles between you and your allies against the enemy. There are a few hiccups down the road but, unless you get the load bug, I still stand by my statement of recommending the game.\n\nRating:\nGraphics: 6.2/10\nAudio: 5.8/10\nGameplay: 7.8/10\nOverall: 6.6/10\n\n[quote]Enjoy the review?

It's a bit spammy with the control, but still a lot of fun to dash around the field of battle and kill people. Also, if you do not own a controller for your computer, don't shy away from this game. While I can see it is certainly much easier to play with a controller, I changed the keyboard controls to a WASD based setup and it works great. There are just a few things that need tidying up to make the game quality of life reach its fun potential.\n\n1. Small bug on the character creation screen where after I changed the gloves color a few times, my character became an opaque black cube. I know the game is in alpha and this is something that is probably already being fixed.\n\n2. Some sort of help screen. I accidentally skipped the instructions on how to move your hired knights around the world map and now have no idea how to do that. After about 2.5 hours in the game, I have hit a wall in taking territories because I can't bring my allies with me to take a village. This is after only taking the second territory in the game, which is practically handed to the player. This is related to my next point.\n\n3. I have not progressed far enough in the game to know if this has already been implemented, but factions would help the game in my opinion. As soon as I took the second territory, I was assaulted by the full power of 4 zones on the map all working together. It felt like I was running in a circle just to defend my territory and made it nearly impossible to push out very far. If all of these zones did not all have to sole purpose of destroying me, but rather had other enemies they had to fight, it could make the transition a bit easier from small corner of the map to a more open one after the first two territories.\n \n4. Some kind of game concepts screen where you could see why certain things are happening. I'm not sure if this is simply a bug, but it seems like the populations of my towns goes slowly down even if the town is not at max capacity. It is only at maybe the rate of one every 2 or so seconds, but it is causing some problems. For example, I have a village that is stuck at only having 20 people in it despite the capacity being 80. Because of this, it is unable to send out caravans with money, and is always at 400 gold, which is it's max. Is this on purpose? If so, it is something the player should know about and have some way to combat. If all small things the tutorial and little advisor don't tell you about were to be easily looked up, it would be a big help.\n\n5. Lastly, very minor thing, one of the base controls when using the keyboard was the Page Down button. My mac does not have a page down button, and it took me a bit to figure out how to get around that. I'd recommend changing the default control to something that every computer has.\n\nAgain, I think the game is amazingly fun despite it's simplicity. It just has a few small, frustrating things that could be changed to make the game smoother.

Depending on how well you play it might take a little less or longer. It works like this, your a knight and start your journey with a small portion of the map alongside with an army. Your goal is to conquer all, by taking 1 subsquare of the map at a time. Each subsquare has three different buildings on it. One to respawn army, one to transfer the armies between nodes, and one where your active armies can refill (the main castle). During the game you will acquire more npc hero's who will command an army for you and actively travel throughout the map automaticly, steered by your command on which part of the map you want them to focus on.\n\nWhen you attack an enemy you will enter the battlefield and slash your way through mobs, army vs army style with you playing the knight (pretty much like the Dynasty Warrior games, but in 2D instead). Meanwhile leveling up your char, getting better stats and unlocking new abilities. When attacking a building (except for the main castle) you have to destroy a few sieges in which you can command your army where to attack, giving another strategic twist to it. Once the main castle is destroyed you take over the space, can upgrade the buildings, and hire new hero npcs to fight for you.\n\nThe combat feels great, fast paced, and is recommended to be played with a controller. There are just a few different battlefield maps, differentiated by what you attack (one of the enemies or buildings). Which, when halfway through the map, can feel a bit repetitive. The music is just one song looping over and the sound effects are fine, nothing special but not bad either.

Also, I recommend using a controller.\n\n[h1]Video in case you'd rather watch:[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NNMpw36NN8\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nHyper Knights is as indie as it can get. The game puts you in the role of a knight, set to reconquer your lands. Hire your own army and participate in large battles. Simple enemy soldiers don\u2019t have hp: instead, you need to press joystick key combinations in order to defeat them successfully. The graphics are not awesome, but the gameplay fully compensates for that. \n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n-\tInteresting game mechanics: the blend between action and strategy game in 2d adds a unique flavor to the game\n-\tIntense gameplay (hope you have a controller!): very dynamic combat system, where you quickly kill one enemy and rapidly jump to the next \n-\tLots of content for that price\n-\tGood price for what the game has to offer\n-\tMost of all, fun to play: the blend of ideas and game mechanics made the game enjoyable\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n-\tGraphics are not very good\n-\tSometimes, after you win the battle, when the next one starts, yours and enemy units are frozen. Happened ~10 times to me within 3 hours. Does not spoil your progress in any way (I think the game autosaves after each victory), but can still be pretty annoying. It will probably get fixed, but at the moment of writing this review (27.02.2017), the problem is there.\n-\tLousy AI: Sometimes, when you attack the castle with lots of soldiers, only some of the archer are actually attacking the gates. Other units are just standing there and doing nothing.\n-\tTo expand on that, you can\u2019t attack buildings. You just have to stand there and wait while your troops are hitting them.\n\nTook me about 3 hours to finish the game and I honestly enjoyed most of it until the gamebreaking bugs started to appear, making me restart the game multiple times. Overall, Hyper Knights seems like a game that entered early access a bit too early. While I honestly recommend the game for its awesome mechanics and I had lots of fun playing it at first, end-game ai issues made it somewhat frustrating.

Der Schaden der Gegner ist relativ hoch, besonders wenn es viele sind kann man schnell sterben.\nDie Einheiten bewegen sind in der Regel automatisch auf den Gegner zu, nur wenn man ein Dorf oder Au\u00dfenposten erobert darf man die Squads auf einer Karte ihrem Ziel zuweisen.\nGeb\u00e4ude k\u00f6nnen ausschlie\u00dflich von Soldaten angegriffen werden.\nDie F\u00e4higkeiten des Ritters sind unterschiedlich stark und variieren von fast nutzlos bishin zu OP.\n\nAuf der Weltkarte wird es f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich interessanter. Wie es abl\u00e4uft ist an sich relativ simpel:\nDas Hideout generiert unbegrenzt Einheiten, diese werden zu je 30 ans Dorf geschickt, im Dorf wird passiv Gold erwirtschaftet und die Einheiten werden als Karawane an die Burg gesendet. Die Soldaten der Karawane bleiben in der Burg und mit dem Gold werden automatisch neue Soldaten generiert, auch hier werden die Einheiten automatisch weiterversendet, zb. zur\u00fcck zum Dorf.\nDas letzte Geb\u00e4ude ist ein Aussenposten, abgesehen davon das es erobert werden muss habe ich keinen weiteren Nutzen feststellen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nAlle Einheiten werden automatisch verschickt, ohne zutun vom Spieler, es k\u00f6nnen nur Ritter befehligt werden die in einer Burg angeheuert werden k\u00f6nnen. Die Befehle beschr\u00e4nken sich auf ein Gebiet, entweder das Gebiet angreifen oder ein Gebiet verteidigen. Die Ritter holen sich in den Burgen neue Soldaten.\n\nLeider gibt es nur eine Karte die relativ klein ist und sobald man gen\u00fcgend Ritter hat und mehr Soldaten als der Gegner produziert wird die eigene KI den Gegner bezwingen, in meinem Fall hatte der Gegner noch 3 eigene Gebiete die direkt \u00fcberrant wurden.\nDie eigenen Ritter k\u00f6nnen nur D\u00f6rfer und Aussenposten zerst\u00f6ren aber keine Burg erobern.\nDie gegnerischen Ritter k\u00f6nnen weder etwas zerst\u00f6ren noch erobern.\n\nFazit:\nEin sehr simples Spiel welches trotzdem Spa\u00df macht, es gab nur 2 Bugs (1. Ein erobertes Dorf hat nichts produziert und war nicht reparierbar. 2. Meine Einheiten sind hinter einem Felsen steckengeblieben und konnten vom Gegner nicht mehr getroffen werden, nachdem es keine Gegner mehr gab kamen die raus).\nSelbstverst\u00e4ndlich erwarte ich beim vollst\u00e4ndigen Release viele Verbesserungen und mehr Inhalt im Spiel.\nDer Preis ist f\u00fcr das Spiel in Ordnung", "timestamp_created": 1488212238, "timestamp_updated": 1488212238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30215206": {"recommendationid": "30215206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269024358", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488178238}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u55ef\uff0c\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u6280\u80fd\u4e0d\u5c11\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e5f\u5f88\u6d41\u7545\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5175\u79cd\u592a\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u81ea\u5df1\u80fd\u5e26\u7684\u5175\u540e\u671f\u611f\u89c9\u6709\u70b9\u5c11\u554a\u8fd8\u6709\u6700\u540e\u7684\u90a3\u4e2a\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u770b\u7740\u5f88\u5e05\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u7528\u591a\u4e86\u4f1a\u611f\u89c9\u5f88\u8d39\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53ea\u662f\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519", "timestamp_created": 1488182705, "timestamp_updated": 1488182705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30214499": {"recommendationid": "30214499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036356550", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508351139}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is missing one thing...

The frenzy of button mashing is addictive and the fast pace keeps you focused. RPG elements and the world map provides a long term goal and general direction thoughout the game.\nPLAY\n\n---=== THE PRICE! ===---\n\nEven without the release discount ($0.30USD saving), at $3USD this is a NO BRAINER. \n\nI've played for 1.6 hrs at writing this and I can say I've thoroughly enjoyed that time. If time is money, Hyper Knights has already paid for itself. It should be said I'm taking my time and trying to experience all there is to offer in a single play through.\n\n---=== This is a controller game! ===---\n\nIf you're not using a controller, that's fine, you'll just find it a little harder but having said that, you'll get used to it.\n\n---=== This is a button mashing game! ===---\n\nIf you like mashing buttons in a sequence, you spend time at the arcade playing DDR or enjoy a game of Magica, this game is worth a go.\nIt's not just \"mashing buttons\" though but that's essentially what you'll be doing for the majority of the time.\n\nTo elaborate, mashing buttons is what makes Hyper Knights  so EASY TO PICK UP. First task, mash buttons!  From there you're steadily guided in what to do to amass your army and even have AI armies wandering the world map killing your enemies for you and providing reinforcements when you attack.\n\n---=== Character development! (RPG) ===---\n\nWhen you kill bands of enemies, take villages, towns, castles and even when you lose you gain experience, unlocking upgrades for your character (typical upgrades include increased health, increased army size, faster run speed and more) and separately for your combos (pressing a sequence of buttons to perform special abilities). Also as you level up you gain more squads for use when laying seige to castls, towns etc.\n\n---=== Strategy! ===---\n\nAs mentioned earlier there is a world map. You need to take all the territories back from the evil red. Yes this is Red vs Blue. It is NOT turn-based. Like SuperHot (only in world map) time only progresses when you move so it gives you the opportunity to stop, look around and generally take your time deciding exactly what you want to do. Troops are constantly being replenished in your towns and castles but so are the enemies. Plan your attacks!\n\nTowns and castles can be upgraded providing more troops to you and your fellow (AI) Knights. Bear in mind that when your Knights lose troops due to combat they'll need to make it back to a controlled town to replenish just like you do, so keep upgrading!\n\nCastles are where you hire the (AI) Knights. They have their own strengths, stats & army sizes.\n\nEnemies also have Knights strolling the world map who act exactly as your Knights do. Watch and see where the action is, maybe while your enemies are distracted you could take a town or even back your Knights up and crush the red barbarians!\n\nSeiges are fun. You get to tell your \"squads\" where to go via waypoints. Keep on top of the waypoints and you'll steam roll the reds in no time! (or die and try again :) Your character cannot attack buildings (destroy all troops and buildings to win the seige) but your troops can so don't forget to send them in.\n\nThat's it for now.\n\n---=== tl;dr ===---\nI paid for this game and it's worth it.

Makes me think of games like Dynasty Warrors or the Kingdom Under Fire series, but in a simpler packaging yet still (or maybe because of that?) as much fun as those other titles.\n\nStrong parts:\n- dynamic combat system - combos, dodges, attack mixing mechanic to kill enemies (those colorful bubbles over troop heads on screenshots), best part of the game and most important at the same time, shows that it was well thought and executed\n- strategy on battlefields - you can tell your troops to hit one place, while you distract another, becomes even better when there are multiple armies in just one battles and said armies can be given their own orders\n- the graphics - giving easy view of what you're up against in any given battle, UI is pretty straight forward and is more functional when using a controler\n- sound is great and that's just that ;)\n- decent tutorial dialogs explaining most of what you need to know\n\nWeaker parts:\n- erratic combat where despite your best efforts at some point things will turn into a dodge fest on your end as archers are op\n- slightly overpowered knights - unless one side is loosing badly with the other sides archers turning the loosing knight into an arrow sponge, battling them is unnecessarilly long in most cases\n- controls - no mouse support in main menu? no mouse support in places it just begs to have it like army waypoint setting during battles? something that needs rethinking although I do get the game was designed with the assumption it's best played with a controler\n- campaign... or the lack of it because what we get is a small intro showing you lost everything because you were betrayed and you have to fight starting from almost nothing - multiple maps with increasing difficulty and a bit more plot behind them would do wonders\n- economy - too simple for my taste, could use 2-3 more resources apart from gold like food and wood/stone? do realize this game doesn't aim to become a grand strategy title, but a bit more wouldn't hurt and coupled with a plot of sorts would enrich almost bare combat we get now\n- army building - didn't find an option to change composition of your army which would be nice, and coupled with some economy requirements would make the game much deeper\n- some bugs here and there, like arrows sometimes flying through obstacles and sometimes not, getting stuck in objects when dashing etc - nothing game breaking, but enough for some to flip ;)\n\nAll in all, a great game with huge potential. Sucked me in for a whole day, and I'm definitely keeping my eye on it to see how things develop. And since the price tag is what it is, just get it to see if it's something that fits you.\n\nEdit: And don't be decieved by the fact that the \"bad\" list is longer and more elaborate than the \"good\" one.

It would also be cool to have customizable map options and possibly more than just you and the enemy? (possibly an alliance/diplomacy system)\n\nMy only problem with this game is that there can be a lot of repitition in the gameplay especially when farming enemies for gold.I have found out you can just sit on the map and do nothing and will overtime gain gold from your castles with no risk of losing lands at all. There also isnt much replay value as in the games current state the map is the exact same in creating a new game.\n\nI would say that the game is worth the cheap price \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZOJUNoAJuQ", "timestamp_created": 1488052554, "timestamp_updated": 1488052554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30174152": {"recommendationid": "30174152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075188482", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488046435}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking for a game to hold you off until the next big release, you found it.

It reminds me of those  Koei Dynasty Warriors type battlefield control games but without the two worst mechanics of those series- 1.  set zones of control and 2.  long travel between zones.

Here are my comments:\n\n- I like to be able to save+quit in one action.  \n- Setting destination for hired knights did not have the expected effect.  I wanted to attack castle so I set hirelings to castle on map and they  sort of engaged in another slightly different direction.  \n- Do enemy reinforcements only come from squads on map?  Sometimes it notifiies you that some number of enemies are arriving mid battle- is that predicted by main map placement or random/time based?\n- I used  controller and did not see any bugs  in early play; did not try keyboard control yet\n- enemy knights have blue wedge indicator with button flags;  not clear how that is supposed to work.  If it says X Y, does that mean alternating those are successful attacks?  sometimes had to resort to using special to clear those guys out\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1488035451, "timestamp_updated":

"review": "TLDR : Super promising game that is a mix of hack n slash and strategic war game. Very early build, don't buy if expecting a finished game. And use a controller\n\n\nHyper Knights is a 2-d wargame with in the same vein as Mount&Blade series\n\nYou are leading a band of minions to fight the Red Nation, and take back your lands.\n\nThe strategic world map is divided into regions, which all have a Castle and control nodes (forts and villages) that must be captured before you can besiege the castle for control of the region\n\nYou can visit (it only brings up a menu) these places to upgrade them, draft or station troops there.\n\nYou can also hire knights from the castle (each castle only has a few knights) and then direct them to which region they should focus on (guarding your own or raid an enemies)\n\nAll of this occurs in real time but only if you are moving or click the 'fast time' button.\n\nCombat occurs from two armies meeting on the map which then transitions to the battle map.\n\nOn the battle map you control your character and engage in hack n slash style combat. Enemy soldiers all have preset chain for killing them (basic soldiers are 3 X, shield YXY, archer YYY) and engage in duels with Enemy heroes. \n\nDueling enemy heroes involves 3 parts, attack cone which is the big red area is where there attacks will land, defence cone is the small blue area is where any strikes made will not damage them, and the button chain which can vary in length from 2 to 4 and randomizes each time you complete it. It's very very cool how tactical it is and reminiscent of For Honor.\n\nCombat has your X and Y attacks (same attack type and animation) your dash stamina for evading and closing, and your combo meter which when filled allows you to heal, buff, or do special attacks.\n\nWinning a battle means killing all of your enemies. Standard open field battles have the two armies meeting, castle sieges have you tearing down gates to attack, defending caravan raids means you and your army are encircled, while attacking caravans means you are encircling. There is a good variety but it is the same maps (again v 0.04 so I imagine it will change)\n\nThe unique thing about battles is the overworld is still running, meaning that reinforcements for either side can come, and as you will find often do. It helps keep you aggressive and defeat the enemy before their forces arrive.\n\nSo the game is pretty fun at the start, many enemies and big battles but you learn you aren't in any danger, AI cannot capture regions (yours or the enemies) instead you have to capture them.

It's a large increase in scale and quality from Endless Loop Studios' previous titles. The developer is working daily to address bugs and issues people have, in addition to improvements to the game itself. Me and others have noted issues in the discussions which would be fixed the next day. The game has noticably improved from V0.01. The gameplay is also great, combining a game of world domination with a great battle system that encourages the balance of killing enemies and saving your own. The player is given the tools to deal with situations through the super moves, ranging from healing, to a shield that deflects arrows, to the Super Slash, which can kill 50+ enemies if used at the right time. However, you're not invincible, so dashing is a useful mechanic for avoiding attacks, since you can be killed in a few hits. On the technical side, I have experienced no crashes and although the game's performance can suffer when hundreds of units are in a battle, the developer has stated that performance optimisation will be addressed in the future. Therefore, if you want to support a hardworking developer and get a cool game for a low price, your \u00a32 would be well spent on Hyper Knights.\n\nIf you want to see some gameplay, I currently have two videos you can watch to determine if the game is for you, but I will post my most recent one as of making this review, as it is more representative of the game's current state:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6lfcFsXM78&feature=youtu.be", "timestamp_created": 1487969752, "timestamp_updated": 1487969752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522122", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30149498": {"recommendationid": "30149498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107538360", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512656136}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich finde Hyper Knights ist ein weiteres grandioses Spiel von Endless Loop Studios.

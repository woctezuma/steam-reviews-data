If you are going to go into a JRPG then this probably would not be my choice.\nAll of the areas are copy pastes of several linear designed areas and dont really offer much for you.\nThe rediculious amount of items is mared only by their irrelevance for 99% of the game and so make for little more than throw away slots, the weapon combos also lack any real thought when all you have to do is look for which ones follow a launch and then which ones do the most damage. 90% of the time all you are looking to do is hit as many targets as you want and then use Fairize and up your dps insanely fast and boom. \nOnce Taira has the option to heal for you then you have little scare of dying and even using the unique idea of \"world shaping\" to give yourself a challenge, this actually ends up amounting to easier grinding and as such looses any idea of difficulty. \nThe fighting is somewhat clunky with overly repeated voicelines and unskippable cutscenes during battle and while the Fairize music does end up being catchy, you cant sweep everything under the rug of an overly catchy tune. \nGrinding elements of the game are overly tedious and the maths behind several of the attacks just comes out as completly wasted as an attack. \nThe animations are all reasonably smooth if lacking a little fluidity when it comes to the run animation but its overall fairly well done and the same goes for the music.\nThe biggest issue I have with the game is that it feels like it sacrificed any depth of its mechanics for lengthy grinding on meaningless stats. It's like having a mile long swimmingpool thats only an inch deep and this also then leads me to want to just put the game down after finishing it.\nGrab the game when its on the cheap and just switch your brain off. \nDont get me wrong, you can enjoy this game then all the more for you but the lack of reward for learning up and trying to dive deeper into mechanics for me left me feeling and wanting more from the game.\n- 4/10", "timestamp_created": 1521323839, "timestamp_updated": 1521323839, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40878342": {"recommendationid": "40878342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080645206", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "last_played": 1521395024}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e47\u0e1e\u0e1a\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e04\u0e34\u0e14 \u0e15\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e23\u0e01\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e0b\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e25\u0e14\u0e23\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e40\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e04\u0e33\u0e27\u0e34\u0e08\u0e32\u0e23\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e01\u0e47\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e43\u0e19\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\u0e0b\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e32 \u0e15\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e23\u0e01\u0e01\u0e47\u0e07\u0e07\u0e46 \u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e1e\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e04\u0e27\u0e23\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e1e\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e46\u0e01\u0e47\u0e42\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e04\u0e14\u0e35 \u0e2a\u0e23\u0e38\u0e1b \u0e40\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e30\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e06\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e35\u0e04\u0e48\u0e30", "timestamp_created": 1521307625, "timestamp_updated": 1521307625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40781222": {"recommendationid": "40781222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322529975", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513459499}, "language": "schinese", "review": "  \u597d\u8bc4\u662f\u7ed9tsunako\u8001\u5e08\u548crumi\u8fd8\u6709kaori\u7684\u3002\n  \u867d\u7136\u5267\u60c5\u5f88\u8001\u5957\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u6218\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u53c8\u90a3\u4e48\u70e6\u4eba\u3002\n\n  [b] \u4f46\u662frumi\u5c31\u662f\u5f88\u53ef\u7231\u554a\u3002[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1520922732, "timestamp_updated": 1520922732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40730334": {"recommendationid": "40730334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391143955", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519530082}, "language": "english", "review": "The story was great, I think.

Al principio parece un poco generico, pero las personalidades de los personajes hacen que sea muy disfrutable, y a mitad de juego te sorprende con un buen giro que hace que el protagonista y casi todos los personajes cambien bastante y se vuelvan aun m\u00e1s iteresantes. Y por budda si no estuve todo tenso y compenetrado en la ultima batalla!!! fue epico, memorable y un climax excelente\nEl sistema de combate si bien es repetitivo es muy agil y dinamico, por lo que no llegas a cansarte del todo nunca y logra mantenerte atento constantemente devido a la administrasion de recursos y espacios, aunque en las siguientes vueltas soles estar tan roto que esa parte de desafio desaparece un poco, aunque entiendo que es para que puedas completar todas las rutas y objetivos secundarios sin perder tanto tiempo. \nEl sistema de levels tambien me parecio muy bueno. Si bien siempre existira una opci\u00f3n m\u00e1s optima que las dem\u00e1s con cada personaje, el juego no tiene problema en dejarte hacer lo que te venga en gana con cada uno, permitiendo que todos adquieran el rol en el combate que tu consideres mejor, y a mi parecer todo juego que te diga \"Pod\u00e9s hacer lo que quieras con tu vida\" se merece unos cuanto puntos extra.\nLa parte grafica va en cada uno. Si te gusta la estetica anime 3D, es hermosa. Si no te gusta y decidis jugar el juego, o te acostumbras o la aprendes a tolerar.\nLa musica es MUY buena, aunque puede llegar a cansar un poco despues de haberla escuchado tantas veces. Eso si, las canciones con letra estan utilizadas de manera fantastica y refuerzan los sentimientos de cada momento de manera sublime. De hecho, varias de ellas las tengo en mi algunas listas de musica personales.\nMi recomendaci\u00f3n es que al menos lo pruebes. Puede que este un poco caro, y que de historia principal no tenga tantas horas, pero tiene mucha rejugabilidad y por lo menos a mi me encanto. Y si sos de los que les gusta presumir completar el 100% del juego y los logros, vas a tener para rato y va a ser todo un desafio. ^,^/", "timestamp_created": 1517163348, "timestamp_updated": 1517163348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39642348": {"recommendationid": "39642348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284125933", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484163079}, "language": "english", "review": "meh, nothing great, reget buying this, but i couldnt get a refund because by the time i started playing this, it was sitting in my library for over 2 weeks", "timestamp_created": 1517015381, "timestamp_updated": 1517015381, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383440", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39624480": {"recommendationid": "39624480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026924185", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516956753}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended !\nIn the description of the game it says: \"Uncommon JRPG\", yup, no doubt.\nIts take turn-base game to a next level of strategy.

game for a few hours now and decided to make a review.\nThis review will be updated while I'm progressing in the the game.\n\n[06. Jan. 2018]\n\nThe game itself is fun, I like the turn based fighting and the animations are pretty cool as well even though it's pretty old + it originaly was a console title.\n\nI can not say much about the story yet, it seems to be ok but nothing too special, but who knows maybe it has some pretty hard plot twiest to it :)\n\nThere is only one HUGE problem that I have with this game, and the problem is, that the DLCs are completely unbalanced!\nAs soon as you put on DLC armor you're pretty much in god mode and you can't be killed anymore.\nWHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA? IT'S LIKE PAY TO WIN! ... IN A SINGLE PLAYER!\n\nMaybe someone has fun playing a game where you can't lose, but I don't really like it...\n\nBut as long as you dont use the DLC stuff you'll be fine, even though some of the Armors look pretty cool :)\n\nSUMARY\n\nPROS:\n - Nice turn based fight system\n - decent story\n - Nice animation\n - english dub isn't to bad :)\n - The is a loli jew in the game called Lola, you'll know what I mean as soon as you meet her\n\nCONS:\n - DLCs are totaly unbalanced!\n - Not all dialogs are voiced (I don't know if it's only in the english version or in all versions)\n\nEDIT 01 (14 Jan. 2018)\n\nI dug further into the story and gameplay, and I gotta say I'm absolutely in love with it!", "timestamp_created": 1515256008, "timestamp_updated": 1515953266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562423", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39122452": {"recommendationid": "39122452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066158303", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515378463}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR: If you like JRPG or the NEP series you will enjoy this one\n\nI recommend getting this game only if its on sale, to be honest this game isn't worth the 30 dollars that it asks for without the dlc. Because if you compare this game to any of the other Idea Factory games this game feels like its one of the first ones they have made when it comes to the game play and graphics. I got this game during the winter sale for 3 dollars without the dlc but with the dlc it ended up being like 5 bucks and those 5 bucks were well spent on this game. \n\nIf you get the dlc the game will be stupid easy. Like there wont be any need for you to try it will be like a casual game where you would play for the story. If you do have trouble with the game then I would recommend getting the dlc which gives you some op armor and op damage. \n\nOne big thing though this game doesn't have as many waifu's as the NEP games does since the NEP games are all females while there are some males in this game although not completely. \n\nOverall its a 9/10 for me for its game play and story.", "timestamp_created": 1515254551, "timestamp_updated": 1515254551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39117912": {"recommendationid": "39117912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273405635", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515244461}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u63d0\u4e9a\u9171~~\nsteam:\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u7684\u8d2d\u4e70\n\u4eba\u8bbe\u597d\u770b\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u5237\u7ea7\u5237\u7684\u7d2f", "timestamp_created": 1515245344, "timestamp_updated": 1515245344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39092490": {"recommendationid": "39092490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141935301", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516962414}, "language": "english", "review": "game cured my depression thru waifu grinding", "timestamp_created": 1515177286, "timestamp_updated": 1515177286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39068486": {"recommendationid": "39068486", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983292462", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491857257}, "language": "english", "review": "I love JRPGS, but get advent dark force now instead.", "timestamp_created": 1515114002, "timestamp_updated": 1515114002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39061724": {"recommendationid": "39061724", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997739936", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 4308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515097616}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443 \u0441\u043c\u044b\u0441\u043b\u0430, \u0438\u0431\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435  PS4 -

The game is a JRPG with multiple endings, node based exploration, visual novel styled conversations, and hidden characters. I enjoyed the game quite a bit but must admit a bias towards the game type; I have all the Neptunia games on both Console and on Steam plus others from Compile Heart enjoy the style that Fairy Fencer F was presented in; a brightly colourful, endearing characters, and wild romp of a game. The game is not entirely happy and cheery, but it would be something I would recommend playing if you want a break from the gritty grim dark edgy genre that is in vogue right now. The game sets out to do the things it is made to do, and it does them well. It does not try to be something it is not, so keep that in mind when purchasing it.\n\nThe Good:\nThe characters are well developed with rational arcs and believable actions and intentions. The story is a heroes journey with some subversions and twists on the trope and is set in a unique post-apocalyptic world. I found it overall an enjoyable one. The graphics are colourful and in the anime style. The main game takes around 20 Hours to complete but there are multiple endings to add on to this, for the price of admission I think this is a fair price. The game has skip functions to speed up battles when grinding and end visual novel sections when replaying, this helps alleviate tedium that other JRPG's fall victim to. Combat is satisfying with abilities and animations are very well done; you can also unlock all kinds of costumes for your characters. The voice acting is delightful and one of the characters has a Canadian accent, which pleased me greatly.\n\nThe Bad:\nThere are some railroad battles where you are meant to fail, even if you manage to defeat the enemy, which I always dislike. Mood whiplash occasionally occurs when the tone shifts rapidly from comical to tragic and back, these moments are few- like the mass graves part. There is excessive grinding to unlock all the powers and reach maximum level, this is not required to beat the game but is required to see all the endings.\n\nThe Ugly:\nPippin, seriously what the hell is he?", "timestamp_created": 1514759415, "timestamp_updated": 1514759641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586540", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38905784": {"recommendationid": "38905784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127400369", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514725942}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished the game once.\n\nAt first it was pretty interesting. Game mechanics feel great and it seems pretty unique to me, the soundtrack were great too. However midway through the storyline, it starts to become plain boring. The soundtrack became very repetitive (which turns into a earsore) and so is the battle. I then realized that most of the game mechanics (upgrades/ function/ skills etc.) wasn't even necessary or important to use them or upgrade them as they make minimal difference in battles. You'll probably just do the same thing for every battle (including bosses) for efficiency and simplicity to get through the map.\n\nThe story weren't that great either and the characeter's conversation is kinda a hit or miss. Sometimes they are funny but most of the time it's just okay or cringy to me. NG+ weren't worth playing to me.\n\nYou probably should be looking at 'Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force\" instead.

This is the sort of game that Valve REALLY needs to have a better rating system for.  Officially I\u2019d give it a neutral or slightly below neutral. Four out of ten so to speak.  But the question is \"Do you recommend this game.\"  The answer is no.  If I had paid full price ($30 at the time) I would have been furious.  Definitely would have been a return.  I paid $3 on a Steam Sale and am satisfied enough to say $3 worked for me.\n\nTruth be told there is a lot of decent stuff in here.  The art work is very good even if the animation is... well the animation is somewhere in between Visual Novel and Harmony Gold if you understand the reference.  Actually, most of the bits in between dungeon crawling (and some during D.C.ing) are very much visual novel style.  The afore mentioned Dungeon Crawling is average.  Similar to the Atelier series.  Combats are good.  Turn based with free movement.  (No grids or anything.)  The leveling system is... I'm on the fence about is.  There seems to be a lot to it but there\u2019s also not a lot of control over it.  Purely leveling gives you stat bonuses that you have no say in.  There is a secondary XP system to raise weapon stats.  You can change out fairies and EQ but there\u2019s mostly stat upgrades in them as far as I have seen.  So that bit COULD be better but could also be way worse.\n\nBuuut then you have to deal with the story and the characters.  Thus far I have seen three main characters that do most of the talking and a half dozen cameos that had not a lot to say.  The acting is... frankly I can't tell if these are amazing actors/actresses doing a stellar job trying to save unsalvageable lines or mediocre actors doing their best with... unsalvageable lines.  So far as the main three characters I have thus far seen...  Frankly, I have never in my life seen a story in any medium go to such great lengths to make me hate every protagonist.    I was truly disappointed to find the lava in the second dungeon was just the edge of the map and not something I could jump into to shut them up.  I THINK this is intended to be comedy.  But it fails on every level.  Then it invents and constructs new levels to fail on.  Then I think they may hire some contractors...\n\nI am, in fact, quitting playing fairly early in the game because I simply cannot face another cut scene.  I think there is a good game in here somewhere.  If only we could change the past and drop every bit of dialog and plot and completely redo the story line.  Okay the actual story isn't that horrific.  It's pretty standard JRPG stuff.  Light and dark deities sealed off after an ancient battle before the dawn of time.  Blah blah.  But, it is conveyed by three people I have no interest in spending any time with\u2026 Okay, I have an active desire to avoid them\u2026 So the story sort of falls flat.\n\nShort version, if you can put up with the never-ending tirade of motivation to hate the characters and thus the story and, by extension, the world they live in, then the game is not so bad.  My recommendation:  Do not pay full price.    \n\nAnd, to the Devs:  I know you guys worked really hard on this.  Believe it or not you CAN tell.  But somewhere along the line\u2026  *sigh* The review has to reflect the final and whole product.  Better luck next time.  8)\n", "timestamp_created": 1514690683, "timestamp_updated": 1514690683, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38885113": {"recommendationid": "38885113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175133786", "num_games_owned": 1002, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519175977}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "Kinda funny", "timestamp_created": 1514686966, "timestamp_updated": 1514686966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38879773": {"recommendationid": "38879773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034039927", "num_games_owned": 808, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514673039}, "language": "english", "review": "I love their Neptunia series so had high hopes that another turn based RPG from the creators of that would hit similar highs, yet the end product is just boring.\n\nOn the plus side the humour found in that other series is present and accounted for. No fourth wall demolishing here but the characters inject plenty of in-universe humour into the story and it was pretty cool to learn more about people. Some scenes and ideas can drag on a bit though, like Fang's abrasiveness to most people he meets.\n\nUnfortunately, the combat that makes up the majority of the experience is just dull. Characters have special attacks, but using them takes away SP you need to either use items or leave the dungeon to restore, which resulted in me saving them for the bosses or healing. Especially due to the amount of enemies you can run across in any given stage. This left just normal attacks, but these are very limited as well. Neptunia's combo system for normal attacks was a lot of fun with the choice available from the start. Here you get one attack per turn until you pump earned WP into adding additional slots. Even when you do have more attacks the tactics come down to figuring out which damage type the enemy is weak to and then using nothing but that on them. No switching between different types during the battle or readjusting combos between fights. There also seems to be an unnecessary split between physical and magic special moves, but since each character is generally more proficient with one over the other it can lead to some moves just never seeing use outside of maybe curiosity.\n\nThen there is the grind. You start off with very little as the game uses two experience systems. The first is the standard XP that grants boosts to stats on level up. The other is WP, which is a resource you can spend to unlock various things of characters. Stuff such as aforementioned attack slots, new specials or boosting stats further. The ability to choose is nice but so much WP is needed to give characters the same amount of options those in other RPGs would have at the same point without a WP system that it can drag earning enough to unlock sufficient options. The big selling point of the game - fairy partners you can assign to characters - ended up being little more than the equivalent of accessories that gain experience from battles too. Not exactly the clever twist on RPG mechanics I was hoping for and just adds another grind to the game.\n\nIt's kinda a shame, because when I got to the bosses and felt free to actually go all out with specials and items (especially once I'd used WP to unlock a variety of options) there was an element of fun. They had significant special moves and multiple health bars in most cases so indulging in those hard hitting moves or making use of buff techniques made me feel more involved that mindlessly hitting the normal attack command. I just don't feel like the payoff of those boss battles is worth the grind though all the common monsters on the way.\n\nAt this point I feel like I've been pushing on just because it's an IF/CH RPG and not getting anything back out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1514674612, "timestamp_updated": 1514674612, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38871760": {"recommendationid": "38871760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358156045", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514660064}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0411\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0430\u044f .....", "timestamp_created": 1514660186, "timestamp_updated": 1514660186, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38869562": {"recommendationid": "38869562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138781649", "num_games_owned": 1182, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1520757716}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Nagyon j\u00f3 j\u00e1t\u00e9k, csak aj\u00e1nlani tudom.

I love the characters, the setting, the music, but most of all, I love the story. While the story can be a bit generic for some people, I thought it was excecuted well and it got me feeling all kinds of feelings. \n\nGameplay wise, it is based around the \"Neptunia-combat system\" and will play extremely similarly like the Neptunia maingames and Mugen Souls games. This is actually one of (if not) my favorite combat systems, and the FFF version added another depth to the game via attack-typings, and a different custimization of attacks.\n\nThis is my favorite game on steam, and one of my most favorite games/franchises of all. The game is high on fanservice, which is great for some, but even if  you don't enjoy that, the story and gameplay should make up for it.

para tener el juego a el 100% se necesita invertirle mucho tiempo sobre todo si se quiere completar las misiones tanto principales como secundarias, tener los personajes en m\u00e1ximo nivel, desbloquear y conseguir todos los objetos etc.\n\nLo Positivo:\n-Bastante contenido para finalizar el juego por completo.\n-Buenos personajes.\n-Suficientes habilidades y combos por personaje.\n-La habilidad \u00fanica de cada personaje jugable es bastante diferente por lo cual se pueden hacer diferentes formas de juego y estrategias con cada uno de estos.\n\nLo negativo:\n-El juego no est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol, as\u00ed que para las personas que no saben ingl\u00e9s se pierden de una gran parte del juego como lo son los di\u00e1logos.\n-El movimiento en las batallas llega a ser un poco limitado (aunque para ser de batallas por turno est\u00e1 bastante bien)\n-Una historia no tan buena, la cual pudo haber sido recreada de una mejor manera.\n-Desde cierto punto de vista el juego se puede llegar a tornar un poco repetitivo.\n\nEn fin, a este juego le doy un 8/10, es bastante entretenido, y m\u00e1s a\u00fan si te gustan los JRPG;

If the game were restructured in a way which minimized the frustration factor of having to repeat what you just did TWICE and instead designed it to be either much wider, larger or more open where the \"extra\" content was accessable without having to back track over and over and over again then I wouldn't mind but unfortunately the dungeons have 2-3 \"zones\" on average and the dungeons with 4-5 zones have 2-3 zones which are basically a single hallway.    There was no real consideration in the development of the maps,  they're very VERY linear and VERY boring by the 6th time you've run through them because you HAVE to run through each map about 6 times to get a 100% achievement score.\n\nI'm so fucking sick of this game.

La princesa en apuros, una masoquista dominatrix que trata a todos de sirvientes. La nerd, una friki de las hadas con intensiones pervertidas. Y asi muchos otros personajes bastante desviados del esquema esperado de un tipico cuento para ni\u00f1os.\nCon todo esto se desarrolla la historia dando lugar a situaciones de lo mas comicas.\n*En cuanto al gameplay esta bien pulido, con animaciones pintorescas (y salteables gracias a dios).\n*La dificultad es ideal para aquellos que como yo son re casuales en los rpg por turnos.\n*El apartado artistico es muy bueno aunque los escenarios se los nota un poco simples comparado con el detalle que tienen los personajes. Y la musica es perfecta.\n\nEn cuanto a las contras...\n*Se le nota que esta mal optimizado, pues para el poco detalle que tienen los mapas deberia correr mucho mejor. Igualmente en este tipo de juegos con 24fps peasant style lo jugas tranquilo.\n*Blur blur blur y mas BLUR... cuando estas grindeando para conseguir los logros hardcore en donde tenes que matar 10k de monstruos, que te pongan un blureado antes de empezar la pelea, cuando salteas la animacion y cuando termina la pelea se vuelve literalmente un dolor de cabeza. Por suerte no soy yo pero hay mucha gente a la que le agarran mareos por el tema del blureado y en el juego no existe una opcion para desactivarlo. Muy mal ahi por parte de los devs.\n\nPor ultimo, no se si ponerlo como un punto negativo,  pero existe un logro (\"We're In The Money!\") en el que es practicamente imposible conseguirlo con el maximo dinero que conseguis por peleas aun con todos los boosts.\nEse logro claramente esta puesto para que les compres el DLC Surprass Your Limits que te desbloquea 3 dungeons donde cada pelea te aumenta un lvl en toda tu party y te puede llegar a dar hasta 12 veces mas oro del que conseguis sin dicho DLC. Asique si sos de los que les gusta completar los juegos te recomiendo pagar el dolar que cuesta ese dlc porque sino el tiempo que te toma es INHUMANO.

The main character has absolutely no depth whatsoever, he's a totally cliche \"let's save everyone / reluctant hero\" type of guy without any backstory and real motivations (half of the game is about the main character wanting to get good food to eat - seriously?). Out of the main cast, probably only Tiara has some real backstory going for her and even that isn't too well fleshed out. \n\nSecond of all, all the story is presented in a Visual Novel, \"talking heads\" style. There are no cutscenes, even ones rendered with the in-game engine, so basically every scene, even the most dramatic / important ones, are just talking heads.\n\nThird of all, the combat is simply repetitive and boring. The locations are totally empty, there's nothing in them besides monsters and the occasional treasure. No story, no setting nothing. Plus, they all look and feel more or less the same. The ratio of fun fights to dreary fights is strongly in favor of the second - especially since there are not that many  monster types and the later variants do not really add a new mechanic - just more firepower. \n\nThe leveling system, based on a typical double resource XP (autolevel) / WP (invest in skills) is somewhat fun, but the fact that you need to grind the boring and repetitive fights to get any real number of WP makes it a chore.\n\nOverall, I've had much more fun with the Legends' series, with the Tales' series, hell, even with The Last Remnant and Final Fantasy XIII.

I'm going to spoil it so  people don't bother playing it.\n\nThis game has an interesting turn based battle system that lets you customize your combo attacks. It tries to be fresh with the seal unlocking side plot. Other than that, the attractive and colorful character design are the selling point for this game.\n\nNow that we are done with the half decent elements about this game, everything will go downhill. The most glaring aspect that you will notice at the first dungeon is that the control, CG models, map, and battle system are all ripped from Neptunia games.  You can say that it is natural because both games have the same developer, but I would argue that it reflects the effort that are put into this game.\n\nThe story is not amazing, it is rather generic and overdone. A boy adventuring with a fairy, and later friends, to save the world. An overdone plot can be done well and subverted but this game done none of them. Now, I am going to move to the characters because, no matter how generic the story is, the characters are the downfall of this game.\n\nThe main character is the typical teenage wish fulfillment light novel protagonist. He is lazy and doesn\u2019t want to do anything, but at the same time he is talented and dependable. A bit perverted; therefore hated by girls, but at the same time romantic enough to make them interested in him. So yes, he is everything that the story demands him to be, not relatable and realistic at all. The other cast are as tropey as the main characters, ranging from tsundere girl, chunni girl, genki boy, fan service girl, butler guy, to some random mascot character; because every games need a mascot character. Most of them are just appearing to join the party and throw random jokes mid game. Most of them can be omitted with the only consequence that the game will be boring because there will only be the  main guy, fairy, and tsundere girl.\n\nThe plot actually tried to be subversive by introducing time travel; however, none of this opportunity to redo the plot was dedicated for exploring the characters. It is just giving a second chance to the main character to do better, while also making the gameplay longer. Now imagine all the problems that I mentioned warped up perfectly with a Japanese dub that is recorded with a quite low quality mic (yes, the English dub is actually better sounding), I hope you can relate to my claim about how there is not much effort put in this game.\n\nI will not suggest people to buy this game, especially if you are a jaded RPG player.", "timestamp_created": 1504197264, "timestamp_updated": 1504197739, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.335406", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34570073": {"recommendationid": "34570073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165159446", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502442031}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4eba\u8bbe\u6ee1\u5206\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u5c31\u663e\u5f97\u5f88\u5e73\u6de1\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u5efa\u8bae\u76f4\u63a5\u8d2d\u4e70Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force\uff0c\u65e2\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u672c\u4f5c\u7684\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u753b\u8d28\u4e5f\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1503988417, "timestamp_updated": 1503988417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34508900": {"recommendationid": "34508900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151478527", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512461130}, "language": "english", "review": "i must say there are not many games that i play twice but this i have played more than 3 times.. what more can i say it is very enjoyable with a lovely story line. every character is lovable exept for sherman he can go fuck a pig. other than that it is a wonderful game. really really loved it. shout out to developer whos hard wok is appreciated", "timestamp_created": 1503765018, "timestamp_updated": 1503765018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34349384": {"recommendationid": "34349384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067653526", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494743150}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine a nep nep game without all the awesome characters with whom you developed a strong bond over the course of zillion games \n\nIt's still worth playing I guess, but it's just not the same.", "timestamp_created": 1503145349, "timestamp_updated": 1503145431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34327754": {"recommendationid": "34327754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078056195", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503024222}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as I would like to even get into the game, as I am a big fan of Idea Factory, I can't because there is a lovely bug with the camera where it won't stop spinning.

The graphics are colorful and light-hearted, but too simple and not in that retro-way \u00e0-la Ys that we all love, grown up with games such as Final Fantasy IV, Chrono Trigger, Ys, and the later sagas like Golden Sun.\nIt's like an in-between an old graphic and a new 3D one, and it fails in both.\nThe gameplay is way too easy, even if it is highly customizable. Maybe it's -too- customizable, like in upgrading everything.. you end up grinding and using the same things over and over.\nUematsu is not here, and even if everyone praises the voice acting and so on, the soundtrack is really adoidable.. like one of those games during which you prefer to put on some EDM on your old computer.\nSo, a combination of poor graphics, overgrinding in recycled dungeons and a general lack of depth and length hasn't made me a fan of this series, although I'll give a try to the other Neptunia games for PC.\nOverall, easy and repetitive. I'm gonna borrow some lines from an Italian review I read some months ago: \"each of the dungeons, no more than ten, is made up by a single corridor in which you can collect one or two items and fight the same enemies; going through these areas is so exceedingly boring that the gameplay becomes pathetic\".\nCan't recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1502743466, "timestamp_updated": 1503228403, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619690", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34205090": {"recommendationid": "34205090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066188237", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495463943}, "language": "english", "review": "Until it went all [spoiler]time travely[/spoiler] on me, I was pretty entertained. The gameplay was solid and, while the grind was a bit much at times (also making me tune out a bit), I liked the characters and how combat worked.

The only somewhat special thing about the combat is the \"unique\" mode that each character have that either booster their stats for a negative effect or special effect such as allowing u to see the enemies' stats. But even so, u hardly ever gonna be using them and it for a multiple reason (which will be explain slowly) the first obvious one is because it waste 1 of your turn\n-The combat is also rage inducing. The miss and hit system is horrible. Unlike other well made rpg. Missing your attacks happen but it's not that frequently. For everyone who play rpg, u know how annoying it is when a missed attack ruins everything but it not happen often so it kind of ok. Not in this game. The chance of missing an attack is so high. I've misses my attack more than i hit the enemy more than ever. It's ruin everything for me multiple times in 1 sitting. Either missing an enemy and leaving them with sliver of hp and then they kill my unit or heavily wounded them making u waste resources to heal them. Or just simply misses and extend an easily winable fight to another 5-6 seconds. Comback to the  1st point. Because u misses so much. Activating the character's unique ability is just making it worst. The unique ability usually making your character do more dmg for the cost of either costing more mp or losing defend stats. And because u misses so much, in the end it doesnt really change much. U just get a nagtive effects for no reason at all. The battle in this game is basicly comes down to \"Don't miss your attack\"\n-The beginning of the game, by that i mean the first like 10 hours or so (which is where im at, not sure about the rest will update it when i feel like playing more) doesn't have any strategy to it. All u do is just spam normal attack or using skills occasionally for more burst dmg. Buffing skill is pointless because u are wasting alot of mp that u could have just put it into dmg skills and it gonna ended giving u more dmg at the end (and also because u misses so much, and u cant miss with skills). This quickly become boring along with it very generic battle system making it a sleep inducing progress\n-Unessarily back tracking. At the end of the dungeon, there are no way to exit it but to back track to where u came from. There are literally no reason to do this but to waste your time for no god dam reason. The monster gonna chase u again and force u into battle with it boring battles of \"praying that your attack will not miss\". U can't instantly run from the battle but instead have to go to the edge of the \"limitted zone\" to do so. Which will take up at least 3-4 turns. So have fun wasting even more of your time\n-The enemy AI is horrible. It's will focus attack your Leader unit which mean u can't use a range attacker as a leader or else it's will get burst down. If they are not in range to attack your leader, they will attack a random unit in there range(and also try to move closer to your leader sometimes). At the current moment of me playing, there are no taunts or anyway to direct the monster to focus your tank. So the battle is again comming down to \"not to miss your attack, and the enemy not attacking your range/dps units\". Basicly a RNG fest. Sound fun doesn't it\n-The grind is horrible. It's so bad. Even at the start of the game u already have to grind. Your characters gonna misses even more if they're under level (it's already so bad when that at the same level). So have fun try and grind after grind\n-The boss have so much health. Even for me who equiped the op weapon from the dlc, it's still take so long for the boss to die. When u get a solid play going and u know that there's no way for u to lose, u still gonna be stuck with the boss that have a ginomous health pool. Combo it with it stale and boring combat system. It's making me so bored that i have to change to the resolution to extremely small and just spamming Enter button while watching some youtube videos until the boss died. (also have even more fun when u misses your attacks alot of as well)\n-The obnouxious music that plays when u Fairize ( this comes down to my taste). Holy Shit it's so bad\n-The story is very, very generic. I know i put it in Pros but it doesnt matter. Credit goes where it's deserved \n\nIn general the game likes to waste your time (and lots of it for no reason). And it just very boring at the moment. May get better later on but it doesn't matter if the game can't hook me in after 10 hours of play time (also u may wonder that my play time on steam doesn't match the one i said in this review. I played the game while in offline mode)\n\nI may have forgotten some. But that it's for now\n\nI have yet to play the remaster version (may do it in the future) and i hope that it fixes these issue\n\nThere maybe many grammatic errors and spelling mistake. I don't feel like checking for them.

He initially gets told about a rumor: the one who can remove the Fury from the ground will have any wish he desires granted.  Through a series of unfortunate events, he gets duped into traveling the world in search of other Furies in order to revive the Goddess.\n\nPersonally, the story made me laugh so hard I thought I was coughing up a lung at one point.  The only thing honestly keeping me from giving this a 9/10 is [spoiler]the goddamn time travel arc[/spoiler].\n\n[h1]Gameplay: 5/10[/h1]\nThe gameplay is nothing to be too excited about.  At a certain point it's mostly just a bunch of button mashing to either force an avalanche attack or avoid it in order to get through battles faster.  \n\nSimilar to Hyperdimension Neptunia, your characters start in a formation (which can be edited) and the game creates the turn order based on the AGI stat.  However, unless you use a skill or a magic attack, all attacks are single-target only as opposed to multi-target.\n\nAlso, with a system like mine, I should not have frame drop at all and it occurs quite often, either while skipping through text or when loading in a dungeon.  Specs at the bottom of the review for an idea.\n\n[h1]Music: 9/10[/h1]\nFrom Compile Heart's and Idea Factory's other titles, I was surprised to find the soundtrack within the game files itself, which is part of why I'm giving this a 9/10 (who doesn't like free soundtracks?).  The music during Fairize especially surprised me the first time I heard the tracks.  Other than that, unless I was grinding levels or quests out, the music was always turned on.\n\n[h1]Length: 9/10[/h1]\nIf you're like me and try to obsess over achievements, you're guaranteed to get a lot of play time out of this.\n\nEven if you aren't, my first playthrough still ran me 39 hours, short breaks included.  If you go on the general rule of thumb of $1 per hour of gameplay, you're still beating it at full price (although maybe wait for a sale anyway.  It's on sale during all of the major holidays).\n\n[h1]Overall Score: 7.5/10[/h1]\n[h1]Personal Score: 9/10[/h1] (because I laughed hard throughout and cried at the normal ending, despite what I mentioned in the story spoiler).\n\nPC Specs:\nIntel i7 6700k @4.0GHz\n32GB DDR4 RAM\nGigabyte Radeon R9 270x", "timestamp_created": 1499590950, "timestamp_updated": 1499607760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507054", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33373168": {"recommendationid": "33373168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121099890", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513887277}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a good game.", "timestamp_created": 1499517983, "timestamp_updated": 1513695489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33366489": {"recommendationid": "33366489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283940262", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500339641}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun vidya but apparently they launched one that's the exact same thing but better.\nBuy that one, or don't buy it at all.

Buy advent dark force, if you are hesitant about or don't like JRPGS, this won't change your mind.\n\nKind of dissapointed I bought this one since advent dark force was on sale as well and I could've gotten that :(\n\nThe story is preety good. Some of the characters will grow on you, and some you'll learn to hate while others you will not care for. However be careful which characters you begin to like and use as your main force in battle because hearing them shouting the same 3-4 lines in combat will make you hate them preety freaking fast. \n\nSpeaking of, the combat is a turn based active combat system, which means you take control of one of your units, walk up to the enemy, do some button pressing, to either just mash the buttons and deal a bit of damage or make combos using launchers and pursues to deal a bit of damage with a cherry on it. If you play on medium or above difficulty you will like come across a steep difficulty curve in the latter part of the game, which means that you haven't grinded enough. I almost got my party whiped twice at 2 specific points where I didn't understand why the enemies were so tanky. At first you might think that you should split your party, having one ranged and 2 melee, a tank, a dps and a healer but don't bother, the enemies attack randomly and using abilities is just pointless, the mana bars empty faster than mcdonald's on a \"everything is 90% off\" day. take my advice and just get 2 melee and 1 ranged pure physical combo gods. Max out their combos and physical damage and give them launchers and purusers attacks. That's the best I've found so far. Also just keep Fang in your team, he becomes very powerfull, very quickly. The combat also has this \"tansformation\" Thing where you can, after taking or dealing a bit of damage, have a big song and dance after which the character puts on some new clothes and gains bonuses to stats and access to a special ability that takes 40% of their total HP and a bit of mana to perform. But aside form 1 specific character which is really good, I haven't been using these abilities since a good old combo to the face does the job most of the time.\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about. Late ps2, early ps3 era graphics with simple dungeon design that won't force your brain a lot. There's a bit of platforming in the dungeons but nothing too hard. Weather this simplistic design works to it's advantage or not is up to personal prefrence, really. \n\nAs to what really grinds my gears is that I can't skip the fairization animation (or at least I don't think you can, I haven't dug deep into the config menu to see if you can or not) or the animation for the ultimate abilities and after casting each around 100 times they really start to weigh on my enjoyment. Also, I'm not really sure how the magic system really works, I maxed out one character's magic damage and took all it's abilities and cast them but they were mere specks of damage to the enemies meanwhile combos took at least half of any normal enemies HP bar and took less time to cast. \n\nBut regardless, if you are looking for a traditional jrpg to play just for the nostalgia of playing a jrpg similar to the early final fantasies but with a more updated and simplified combat and upgrade system and ps2 graphics then you should REALLY buy Advent dark force, otherwise if you want to experience how Fairy Fencer F was before advent dark force, though I don't know why you would, then this game is for you, otherwise if you don't like jrpgs or are unsure of them, don't bother.", "timestamp_created": 1499360728, "timestamp_updated": 1499360728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33309431": {"recommendationid": "33309431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390152168", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503654226}, "language": "english", "review": "this game has a great soundtrack and cute characters, i like this game", "timestamp_created": 1499342663, "timestamp_updated": 1499342663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33288515": {"recommendationid": "33288515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031656472", "num_games_owned": 587, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481598857}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a Nep game without nep and with a fetish for swords\n\nSeriously you can end this game falling in love with what is basically a sword\n\nIf this sounds like something you would like buy Fairy Fencer F: Advent Dark Forces because its a remake of this with more stuff and mostly the same story", "timestamp_created": 1499283706, "timestamp_updated": 1499283706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33283969": {"recommendationid": "33283969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332252684", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499423043}, "language": "english", "review": "Like this game", "timestamp_created": 1499275029, "timestamp_updated": 1499275029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33275159": {"recommendationid": "33275159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010455916", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504462036}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Nice", "timestamp_created": 1499261678, "timestamp_updated": 1499261678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33249189": {"recommendationid": "33249189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057019005", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 4934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489868536}, "language": "german", "review": "Das Spiel selber ist gut - ziemlich gut aus meiner Sicht, aber anstelle sich damit abzugeben, sollte man sich lieber gleich die erweiterte Fassung von Fary Fencer F holen.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/524580/Fairy_Fencer_F_Advent_Dark_Force____ADVENT_DARK_FORCE___F_ADVENT_DARK_FORCE/", "timestamp_created": 1499203316, "timestamp_updated": 1499203316, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33245286": {"recommendationid": "33245286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132576269", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503914545}, "language": "english", "review": "tldr: JRPG with turn based combat, heavy grinding and plain story.

The story is bland and painfully boring, the combat is just button mashing and grinding.\nThe thing that really bothers me, is that they try to spice the combat with status aliments and elemental strength/weaknesses but you don't need to worry about that at all, just smash normal basic attacks, because that's the most effective way to clear the enemies and proceed.\nI realy like turn based combat, but this is the bad type of it. 90% of the im i was like: \"just get over with it\" or \"let me finish this game already\".\nThey even added weapon weaknesses. When i saw that i was like \"cool! something original\" but 5 minutes later i realised its just like the case with the elemental weaknesses, you just don't have to care about them because the game is way too easy and the fastest way to clear the game is to smash the enemy with normal attacks.\n\n\n[b]Con[/b]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Way too grindy\n    [*]The combat is boring and silly\n    [*]The story is bland\n[/list]\n\n[b]Pro[/b]\n\n[list]\n    [*]The japanese voice acting is pretty good \n    [*]Harley's bikini ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n[/list]\n\nThanks for reading my review and i hope i didn't angered the grammar police.", "timestamp_created": 1499197047, "timestamp_updated": 1507381702, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33239373": {"recommendationid": "33239373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251990280", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514631894}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice RPG, good story, great animation and cute & Loli :3", "timestamp_created": 1499188252, "timestamp_updated": 1499188252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33192668": {"recommendationid": "33192668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375006798", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 167, "playtime_forever": 1869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 194, "last_played": 1520761614}, "language": "russian", "review": "13 \u0438\u0437 10 + \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u043a \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u044b\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c.", "timestamp_created": 1499101728, "timestamp_updated": 1499101728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515544", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33184046": {"recommendationid": "33184046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081950202", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499910085}, "language": "english", "review": "Excelent waifu world", "timestamp_created": 1499089078, "timestamp_updated": 1499183864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33180305": {"recommendationid": "33180305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149776391", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499084270}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e14\u0e35 \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e46 \u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e35\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22 \u0e41\u0e19\u0e30\u0e19\u0e33\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e21\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e14\u0e39", "timestamp_created": 1499083016, "timestamp_updated": 1499083016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33170910": {"recommendationid": "33170910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314487077", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503206765}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u633a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff0c\u6709\u5174\u8da3\u53bb\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u5165\u624b\uff0c\u4f46\u5730\u56fe\u91cd\u590d\u5ea6\u6709\u70b9\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u538c\u5026\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u633a\u597d\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1499064857, "timestamp_updated": 1499064857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33152462": {"recommendationid": "33152462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153567653", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 2256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499027588}, "language": "english", "review": "Anime-style RPG with Final Fantasy-ish turn base style of game.

Yet, after fully completing the game, I would argue otherwise!\n(By the way, completing the game is pure insanity. Thus I would suggest you refrain from even having that slight idea on this game or any other title from the same studio!)\n\npeople tend to compare this game with another title by the same studio due to their similar mechanics, the Hyperdimension series. I will not be doing that, instead I will try to judge this game as it is. Also, again I state, even though most of what I say here will probably sound unappealing, check on the bottom of the review for there I will try to justify why I believe that is not the case.\n\n\nStory: (Might contain spoilers)\nAll JPRGs have a storyline. Some are good, others are horrendous. This one is leaning towards the bad, unfortunately. It is basically just \"There is a goddess of good and a god of evil, they both are in a state of hibernation. We must revive the goddess of good by collecting some stuff and so on!\" You can basically tell where this is going by now. There is nothing that interesting about the story and it is rather transparent to be frank. \nMost of the story is presented in a Visual Novel fashion of storytelling. If you have played a visual novel before you would immediately understand what I am referring to. If not, however, it is basically just showing a 2D picture of a character whom is supposed to be conversating, with animated mouth movement and maybe the occasional one hand raising up, and that is it. It was intentional to have the story be a Visual Novel, but it felt lazy in a way. Also, there are only a hand full of 3D animated cutscenes, so yeah...\n\nCharacters: \nOne of the strong points of this game, yet not strong enough to compete with other titles, I dare say. Since this is a JRPG you would expect a large party of characters, and you are correct. except, in terms of character development, only three are affected. And the rest are just there. When inspecting each character individually, they are all one-dimensional. Each one has just one unique trait and personality, that is it. Yet when together, the interactions and dialogue are truly great! I do like the comedic side of this game and how these one-dimensional characters were able to bring that sense of comedy to life.\nI won't explain character traits here. But believe me, one look at a given character says it all.\n\nOverworld: \nThere isn't much to speak of here. the overworld is basically menus with pretty pictures. In town, you click the button on screen to access the inn, shop, whatever. world exploring is just looking over a map and choosing a place to go to and you instantly teleport there. That place you went to is where the game is. As in, where you can move freely and do your combat and whatnot. Unfortunately, even though these places can be forests and deserts, but when carefully looking, it is your typical standard dungeon. In other words, gameplay is only shown in dungeons. \n\nThere is one pleasant thing about the world map, though. You have the option of stabbing swords on the ground (Sounds odd, I know) to gain some buffs into the dungeons you wish to visit. Example, stab a sword that grants bonus exp but reduced defense next to dungeon \"X\" and there you go!\n\nMechanics: \nvery few commands when exploring. There is movement, press \"B\" to jump, press \"A\" to attack/interact. As for combat mechanics. It is a turn based battle in 3D. Your character has a small space for you to position him/her. After choosing, you pick his/her action. Whether it be basic attacks, magic or status elements. \nThe game does a huge plus by introducing a fusion mechanic at the beginning of the game. Hooking that player fairly early. As for difficulty, the game is very easy. So easy, in fact, that I did not bother with learning combos until maybe a few quests prior to finishing the game\u2019s storyline.\n\nMusic:\nThere aren\u2019t much. But for what there is, it is rather pleasant. I do like most of the songs in the game. Maybe two or three I would consider listening to outside of the game. And to the game\u2019s credit, the songs in some way does fit the aesthetics.\n\nVisuals:\n3D Graphics are slightly higher than a regular PS2 game. Visual Novel art is pretty. Nothing more to that.\n\nOverall:\nCritically, this game does almost everything averagely. and that will disappoint so many people. But it is that very reason why I loved this game. It is Average with good character interactions! With all the newly released games and their \"Super amazing next gen gameplay mechanics!\" and whatnot, it was very relieving to have a game that you can just enjoy without putting much effort into it, Plus the combat was easy. Thus, it was overall a very relaxing experience for me!\nI do hope that I was able convey my point in this review.\n\nCritical review 5.5/10\nMy personal review based on how much I appreciate the game 7.5/10\n\nEdit: It is said that Fairy Fencer F: Advent Dark Force is the remade better version.

I believe you should buy that instead because it has more content and basically has the same story as this game or so I was informed.\n\nNow that I said that, here is the review of this game.\n    The story itself is good. It has 3 different endings so you it has some replayability. My first full game walkthrough took about 27.\n    Here are the good things:\n        1)The combat is slightly more complicated than Neptunia and slightly better than the first 3 Rebirth series. The core gameplay is the same as Neptunia like the turn base and being in range to attack the enemy. The way this game does that differently is you get your skills differently and your damage isn't based on you weapon(Kinda). The way you get your skills is instead of just leveling up and unlocking it, everytime you fight an enemy you get WP. This WP can be used to unlock new skills or improve your damage/defence/amount of attacks you have.  You also cannot buy weapons for your characters to imrpove their damage. With WP you can unlock different weapon attacks like let's you have a sword and you unlock an axe attack, during battle when you use the axe attack your sword becomes an axe for only that period of attack.\n       2)Great soundtrack.\n   I do have a few complaints I have about this game. Well this part are all spoilers so read at your own risk. \n       1) Some things are just left unanswered. [spoiler] After the main character travels back in time, one of my party members suddenly became a bad guy and it was never shown why he became a bad guy. All they said was it may be a side effect of the singularity but it was never confirmed. They should have clearly said why he became a bad guy.  [/spoiler]\n       2) Forced platforming[spoiler] Before you can reach one of the bosses, you have to do some platforming. There is an item that if your lucky, one of the old bosses you fought will drop it which makes this platforming section easy. If your unlucky like me, you have to make a jump perfectly just to get the boss. If you fail, you get to start over from the entrance of the map.  [/spoiler]\n       3) Once you beat the last boss, you have to start a new game. It just asks you if you want to save the game then takes you to the main menu. Once you press continue, you go to new game +. They should have made going to New Game + an option.\n   After all said and done, this game is still a pretty good game which is why I gave it a 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1497632732, "timestamp_updated": 1497641044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32401230": {"recommendationid": "32401230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067716954", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480401668}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun JRPG.

I find these Asian RPG's have a really fun combat system, google it if you don't know what i mean, and this one executes it really well. \n\nMost of the playtime for your first playthrough will most likely be cutscenses though. There are a lot of cutscenes. However, they are usually narrated and add to the story quite nicely. Usually.\n\nSome things are not explained well and you will probably miss a good amount of things on your first playthrough however new game + does not increase the difficulty so you can breeze through that in almost no time with skipping the cutscenes.\n\nSome big cons are available though:\n\n-the grind for certain side quests is absolutely huge. Like unbearably huge and it will make you agitated as fuck.\n\n-sometimes your characters will bail on the fight and you will be left with just one or two people who you have trained and the fight will get a little harder\n\n-there's only like 8 characters and some of them are just flat out useless. I'd say there are 4 usable characters however you obviously don't get to start out with them all\n\n-the cutscenes are really nice but after you skip them all in your second play through the game becomes really short, especially for how long the cutscenes on your first play through made it feel\n\nOverall, this game is pretty fun and solid though.

is okay and is enough to keep you going but really the bad guys in this game feel more like their bad just for the sake of being bad. And really the game just sets you on one path, it's alright and passable with the fact it does just....barely enough to say it's a story. Story rating: 5/10\n\nBattle: Battles can be as you'd expect....no literally their easy! mash your strongest ability and literally breeze through the game without a care. Battles rating 3/10 really needs a hard mode >A<\n\nBGM: Oh boy can it hype me up though for a totally easy and manageable boss fight! the music is great and no less makes good use for story and battles. In truth the story wouldn't have gotten such a high rating without the music =w= Music rating 7/10\n\nOverall rating of judgement: I WANT to like this game, I really do but.....ugh it just feels like such a chore to play it. It's too easy, the story just barely passes and the battle system grows old after awhile. I end up playing this game for a few minutes before going to another game.

I will be reviewing the game on a pro/ con style and end with my final conclusion.\n\nPro:\n      Great story. The story is full of laughter and moments that are sad or shocking. Those last two are very notable since the game is a cutesy RPG so dealing with the concept of death of a beloved character is very sudden. It really helps attach the player with the characters and plot.\n\n     The characters are all likeable. The main party members are very memerable with their crazy dialog and unique personality. Each character is special and tied with the story, they all play a pivital role to and their personalities remain constant to a degree.\n\n     Music is phenonenal. Each track is very nice especially the sad tune since that really tied with the overall mood at times but there are other songs that i enjoyed which begs the question....why is there not a sound track that can be purchased on steam.\n\n     The level design is for the most part varied. Some levels are pretty much palet swaps. The rest of the levels are unqiue since they have a gemic such as a windy level or lava, or forest. The one set back is how the second half of the game uses the stages already visited to because of time travel which feels lazy but it is whatever.\n\ncon:\n       The grind is real for those who want those achievements like getting 100million gold.\n\n        Unlocking secret characters like lola has to be done every playthrough even if on a previous playthrough you have gained all the furies.\n\n\nConclusion:\n        The game is great. Great characters and story that make the game very lively. The rpg elements work well since every level up makes you feel much more stronger. It is debatable on whether it is better than the hyperdimension seres but it was a blast to see how things worked out. I reccomend the game to any rpg gamer.", "timestamp_created": 1494628422, "timestamp_updated": 1494628437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588209",

I only went for one ending but I'm overall happy with it.  In terms of story, I felt it had a shout out to Final Fantasy 8, however, it was FF8 done RIGHT and I was pleased with the ending unlike how 'whipped' Squall becomes in the end.

[spoiler] I stack up my high potions at Shukesoos floor 3 but you can do this over and over again if your a high level but you don't need to be that high of a level it only a lvl 9 boss [/spoiler] The game is super lengthy i took me 33 hours on normal to finish and im still not 100% finished yet. the enemies are eazy to walk around like you have to wait a while then you can walk of course thats the ony thing i do.[spoiler] i find that more charters need to have steal it's only one guy who has it and thats the only way to get good costumes or at all unless you wanna pay 50,000 G for one outfit and theres only there that they sell in the store and it's later on in the game[/spoiler] and sometimes i noticed that some charters stay quite s you kind forget that they exist.i love this game it's totally worth every penny i give it a 8/10 because of those boss battles. if your thinking of getting this game just buy the new one i haven't played it yet but i heard it brings 2 new charters and better story. if you can't afford that one then get this one", "timestamp_created": 1490254385, "timestamp_updated": 1490254816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30677964": {"recommendationid": "30677964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065746586", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490098736}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a lot like meeting your girlfriend after not seeing one another for 6 months.

The powers of fairize aren't as great as the game made it seems, they barely increase their powers about 1.25x which is hardly anything. Abilities can be build and levels don't really determine if you have a stat increase. STAT Increase (WP) is by a different system like gaining gold to use on your skills. Wish there were a way to chain all three characters with 100% success rate or some other damage magifying abilities. The grinding is tremendous in this game just like any JRPG but its fun and won't leave you bored for long. Maps are used repeatedly throughout the storyline with changed enemies of course.

This support characters can be equipped to your party members and can give them passive skills and stat boosts according to the \"Fairy\" you equipped to them. Of course, 1 \"Fairy\" per party member only. They vary from Rank C being the lowest and Rank S being the highest and they can level up to level 10. The number of passive skills they provide and the boosts they give to stats increases as they level up.\n> The conditions in the dungeons in Fairy Fencer F can be adjusted using your \"Fairies\". The system is called \"World Shaping\" But first, your \"Fairies\" must first go through the \"Godly Revival\". A little bit of storytelling. In the lore of Fairy Fencer F, there was once two deities that have fought each other for a long. The Vile God and the Goddess. The two sealed each other using multiple \"Furies\", which are magical swords that contain \"Fairies\" and gives the user immense power, and they both are now in a state of a deep slumber. When you enter \"Godly Revival\", you will see the statues of the two along with the \"Furies\" stabbed through them. \"Godly Revival\" allows you to remove this \"Furies\" from either of them using the \"Fairies\" you possess. Each \"Fury\" stabbed in the deities have their own passive skills and conditions for \"World Shaping\". The \"Furies\" stabbed through the deities have their own ranks and in order to remove them, you have to use a \"Fairy\" of the same rank as the \"Fury\" you wish to remove. \n> In order to change the conditions of a dungeon, you have to stab the \"Fury\" that went through \"Godly Revival\" near the dungeon whose condition you want to change. No \"Fury\" must be near another. The area of effect of the \"Fury\" increases as they level up. The higher the level your \"Furies\" have, the better.\n> Each party member has their own unique skill called \"Special Command\". This \"Special Commands\" does not require SP(or mana in Layman's Terms) in order to use. Some provides additional damage at the cost of using SP per attack you execute. Some allows to take down any foe, except bosses, in one hit.\n> Each party member has combos which are set of attacks you can execute in your turn if you used the \"Attack\" command. This are customizable. The number of attacks in a combo are upgradeable up to 3 through \"Weapon Boost\".\n> Each type of monster in Fairy Fencer F has their own weakness in weapons and luckily, the weapons of your party members can transform to different weapon types according to the attack they do in the combo. When a monster is hit with a weapon that is its weakness, there is a chance that an \"Avalanche Attack\" may occur. \"Avalanche Attack\" allows the player to execute the combos of the other active members to one enemy using only the turn of the active member that attacked the monster that triggered the \"Avalanche Attack\".\n> Dungeon crawling is the main play of the game. You get to walk through different dungeons in the map of Fairy Fencer F. Some maps are are simply re-color or re-organized versions of the other maps in the game. Dungeons in the aren't that long so it really wouldn't consume much time for you to walk through them not unless you are grinding or hunting or item collecting.\n> Quests are offered in the game. This won't affect the story whether you do them or not. It's a different story if you want to get the achievements. The Quests are offered in \"Guillermo's Pub\" and this quests have their own ranks from Rank E to Rank S. You start with Quest Rank E and after clearing a few quests of that rank, a promotion quest appears and if you do that, your Quest Rank steps up.\n> \"Synthesis\" is also a system present in Fairy Fencer F that allows the player to craft items and equipments using items that are required. The \"Picture Gallery\", which presents the artworks, CGs and backgrounds of the game you have previously seen, and \"Sound Gallery\", which presents the BGMs that you have heard in-game previously, are unlockable through \"Synthesis\".\n> A location called \"Shukesoo's Tower\" is present in the map of Fairy Fencer F. It is a collection of floors that features their own set of monsters to battle and their own rewards to give. It has 40 floors in the main section and 40 floors in the DLC section. The DLC section features super high leveled monsters which are a challenge to those who are grindy enough to face them. The height of \"Shukesoo's Tower\" depends on how many \"Furies\", which is also the same as \"Fairies\", are stabbed on the map. The more \"Furies\" stabbed on the map, the more floors will be available in \"Shukesoo's Tower\".\n> The storytelling is done through using visual novel presentation. It also, although rarely, features an in-game animated cutscenes.\n> New Game+ carries over all your stats although you have to recollect all your members again and you have to remove the \"Furies\" again in the \"Godly Revival\".\n> The game has 3 endings. Each of them are relatively easy to get. \n\n-STORY-\n\n> Once upon a time, a hungry young man named Fang is loitering around a city to find some food. In his search, he discovered a sword that is stabbed on the ground that was said to grant any wish although many have tried to pull it but no one was successful. Out of desperation, he pulled the sword and effortlessly, he removed it from the ground. A Fairy living in the sword named Eryn appeared before him and told Fang that he is now a Fencer for he was able to remove the Fury from the ground and it was now his task to recover the 100 Furies scattered throughout the world. Fang refused and decided to leave Eryn alone. One day, Fang was caught for stealing food and was thrown to jail. After 3 days, Eryn rescued Fang and went out the prison until the guards found him. Eryn powered the Fury and Fang fought the guards and defeated them easily. After the fight, Fang still declines the role as a Fencer until Eryn declares she has no recollection of her memories. Only the task of collecting the Furies to revive the Goddess and her name was all she can remember. Forced by conscience, despite declaring he has none, Fang decided to help Eryn get her memories back as repaying for her rescue. Now, they set on a journey to reclaim the Furies and revive the Goddess and bring peace to the entire world. Of course, they will face hordes of monsters, encounter villains who wish to revive the Vile God, handle a masochistic rich girl, fight an edgy edgelord, resist a hottie fairyologist, fight hunger, hate on a damn pretty boy, contemplate on what the heck is one of their party member for the rest of the game, look for ways for money to get those info of Furies from that cute kid who is obssessed with money, spend hours of level grinding, search google for walkthroughs and guides, do multiple playthroughs, skip everything in New Game+, do everything all over again. BUT! Those things will not stop our heroes from collecting the Furies. Join the Fang Gang in their quest for the Goddess! Stay tuned in FAIRY FENCER F!\n\n-GRAPHICS + PERFORMANCE-\n\n> Graphics are pretty basic. They may not be the most beautiful there is but they fit quite nice in the game.\n> The game itself has low requirements in order to be played HOWEVER knowing Idea Factory+Compile Heart, optimization is not good. Fairy Fencer F places the workload on the processor.\n\n-CONCLUSION-\n\n> I am near the character limit of this review.\n> Recommend the game?

If you never played the other series, then it's really up to you whether or not you want to take a risk on a comedy JRPG with a plot written by a pubescent middle schooler.\n\nPros:\n\n-Most of the characters don't look like middle school girls, so people won't judge you as much.\n-The scenery style and color looks slightly less like cotton candy vomit than in Hyperdimension Neptunia.\n-Animations and models look good.\n-Voice acting isn't awful.\n-Can be run on lower-end machines if you edit the files to remove shadows, or sometimes with no editing at all.\n-Additional playthroughs are much quicker, and you can skip cutscenes, so you don't have to dread New Game+.\n-All endings can be obtained on one playthrough if you save at the right time.\n-Great soundtrack.\n\nCons:\n\n-It's Hyperdimension Neptunia in traditional JRPG clothing. You know it, I know it, IF knows it, and the people judging your taste in games know it.\n-Grinding is necessary to unlock certain characters on the first playthrough.\n-Some of the plot and much of the dialog is cringey, but you should expect that at this point.\n-Combat is very easy, even on the first playthrough. Even more so if you grinded to unlock certain characters. This follows an apparent trend with JRPGs becoming increasingly easy these days.\n-Characters are largely one-dimensional, and all plot-twists are revealed within the first half of the game.\n-Battles against bosses and villains is the typical \"boss in battle is a giant monster but is human in the field\". Many of them are recolors, or appear as regular monsters with a recolor later in the game.\n\nIf Steam used a numerical scale, I'd give Fairy Fencer F a 6.5/10. It's not a very long JRPG, and it's certainly far from being the most entertaining or well-written, but it isn't awful and that's saying something in a market that is flooded by cringe-inducing games and television series that operate on the assumption that if it's anime, somebody will buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1482293721, "timestamp_updated": 1482293721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28470326": {"recommendationid": "28470326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097464980", "num_games_owned": 694, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482164186}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u59b9\u5b50\u5f88\u840c\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u5c31\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e86\u3002\n\u6218\u6597\u6bd4\u4e00\u822c\u7684rpg\u7a0d\u5fae\u6709\u610f\u601d\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u5230\u4e86\u540e\u534a\u6253\u4e2a\u602a\u8981n\u4e45\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u8fd8\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u65e0\u804a\u3002\n\u5267\u60c5\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u597d\u8bf4\u7684\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u770b\u6765\u633a\u8822\u7684\u3002\n\u597d\u8bc4\u662f\u7ed9\u5f53\u5e74\u51fa\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u7684\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1482164560, "timestamp_updated": 1482164560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28447062": {"recommendationid": "28447062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036861948", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489283997}, "language": "english", "review": "As Expected from Compile and Idea, Another Epic JRPG but this time with cute fairies <3\nCant Wait till Advent Dark Force Will Come To Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1482067038, "timestamp_updated": 1511638774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28437881": {"recommendationid": "28437881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016081042", "num_games_owned": 543, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482024276}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game with some annoying game designs.

If you're looking for smooth difficulty in a JRPG, look elsewhere.  More on that later.\n\nI found the story to be decent, got a few laughs from it and generally enjoyed myself while playing.  Combat is simple, if not a bit easy; you set up combos for your basic attacks(shortly after you start you unlock the ability to exploit weaknesses), use skills/magic, and use a mechanic called Fairize which gives you a boost to your stats, starts a side song, and unlocks a high damage but risky ultimate move.  The cast is not too uncommon for a JRPG, especially if you're familiar with Idea Factory's other games, and whether this is a good or bad thing is up to you.  Art style is not bad, it is the same style that IF uses for their other games(along with how overworld exploration is handled) and mixes JRPG elements with a bit of a VN style for talking.\n\nI give this game a cautious recommendation for a reason though.  While I find it rather solid, there's things that bother me a lot.  The first, and most blatant thing, is how the difficulty is.  Overall I didn't find my journey to be too difficult, and this is including picking up what side Furies(equivalent to a sidequest) I could.  The game is MOSTLY easy, save for several sticking points at seemingly random intervals where the fights are more difficult than anything else in the area(or next area), and that's not even counting area bosses.  Second, a certain major plot point makes it feel like you're playing the same exact stuff again without a change.  Third(this one is more a personal gripe), it felt like the game didn't know where it wanted to go to end until sudden railroad, not as much a buildup other than certain macguffins.  Last, I felt that characters didn't develop as much as I think they should have.\n\nAs I've thought more and reflected, I'm going to stick to my guns and give the cautious recommendation.  Will I play it again?

This is a jrpg (and a fairly easy one I'd say) with a visual novel-like narration and very interesting characters, lots of grinding and several \"meh\" plot twists, so if any of this bothers you, you're probably not gonna enjoy it. Otherwise, go for it. \n\nThere's plenty of things to dislike in FFF: Running into dungeons for hours because Fire Stones aren't spawning. Those stupid plot twists where almighty gods and creatures are inside people and objects. The fact that the boss hit you for 50 damage and the cutscene's like \"AW, MAN, HE'S SOOO STRONG, WE NEED TO RUN AWAY\". And about this point, the game's too easy. Enemies do very little damage, and if they do, you've plenty of healing magic to deal with them. Also, Fang is in the game. And even if with time he gest a little better, your first impression of him is that he's a patented asshole. Not a good quality for your supposed protagonist, isn't it?\n\nBut what FFF does good, it does VERY GOOD.\nThe music is FANTASTIC.\nThe fact that everytime you break a seal of the Goddess she loses a shard that covers her, and reveals her voluptuous body, keeps you motivated.\nThe characters are wonderful, and probably the best aspect of the game. Everyone of them has a fairy companion, so you basically interact with a \"couple\" instead of a single character. These couples are funny and have very well defined personalities: there's the noble-like girl with her pokemon, the lazy girl with a big bald man that scolds her, a dumb and lovely fellow with her fairymom, and, well, a green cat with a blue afro and a sword through his skull, and his sexy male butler. I couldn't make this up even if I wanted.\nThe point is, it's a funny bunch. It's lively, it's noisy, and it feels like a real adventuring party where everyone is given a bit of spotlight.\nAlso Harley is the best thing in the game and so is the fanservice regarding all of the female characters.\n\nThe combat is also good. You've got this weird combo system instead of a single attack, you can chain combos between allies and air juggle enemies with the right setup. It's not really intuitive, but as soon as you get it, you're gonna go full Soul Calibur on those bizarre monsters.\nYou can transform, or Fairize if you'd like, and use super-final abilities. Both of those things feel AWESOME every time you watch them, it really spices up your regular jrpg turn-based combat. So even if you're levelling up or grinding WPs, you're not gonna get bored. Well not immediately at least.\nWPs are basically experience points to upgrade your characters. It's fun to have it, but you're soon gonna find yourself in the mental state that \"you're gonna unlock everything\", so it's not like you can \"build\" characters.

This game was amazing! I bought it and Valkyria Chronicles and Tales of Zesteria all at the same time and planned to play each just an hour to try them all out, and then play them casually over the new few months inbetween League of Legends matches.\n\nI had two days off, and played Fairy Fencer the ENTIRE TIME, I did 20 hours of gameplay in 2 DAYS IF THAT, may of been a day and a half!!! I couldn't stop playing, it's fun, and unique, and runs sooooo smooth.\n\nPros:\n+Interface is terrific, so smooth on PC and it loads so fast that everything is so convenient, a truly well built system.\n+Voice Acting was great, the only obnoxious part was how robotic the fairies sound when they are fused. Not quite sure i understand why them fusing turns them into robots?\n+Fun combat system, never got bored with it, really enjoyed the music, and it made Fairize mode feel even more amazing when the song would pop up and stay with you until combat was over.\n+DLC Adds a lot of fun features, although it may be recommended to NOT use the ultimate armor or weapon accessories,  as it will make you pretty much invincible for 3/4s the game.\n+Harley is Waifu Bait for life.\n+Very Keyboard Friendly\n\nMids:\n=Story is great, but honestly, you're gonna wanna wait for \"Fairy Fencer F: Advent Dark Forces\" to come out in 2017 instead of buying this, unless you can't wait, essentially it's the same story, but they are adding a lot more depth to tie off a lot of loose ends with this one.\n\nCons:\n-Not enough Harley, NEEDS MORE HARLEY. (Changing that with Add-on pack?)\n-Expansion pack is going to cost roughly the price of buying the game at full cost again (Fairy Fencer F: Advent Dark Forces; just an expansion that adds more story and allows you to use a party of 6 instead of the forced party of 3)\n-I didn't play this years ago when it was released for the PS3 because I'm an idiot. \n\nYou'll love this shit.

grinding\n\n- Regular enemies become a chore to take down and are annoying at most\n- The different bosses' themes are great, but since you're going to fairize almost immediately the theme will be overriden, which is kinda sad.\n- I am really bad at objective opinions\n\nI really, truly recommend this game, however there is an \"expansion\" coming out summer 2017 that MIGHT have to be bought as

"english", "review": "This JRPG is a story about a fight between a Goddess and a Vile God who had different points of view : the Goddess wants to protect the world by bringing peace whereas the Vile God wants to take over the world to make chaos. At the end of the fight, the Goddess and the Vile God were sealed because of the furies which were used during the fight.\n\n  A long time later, a young boy Fang who is a normal guy who loves eating. He met Eryn, a fairy who is a part of Fang's sword. Fang became a Fencer and now, he will accomplish his destiny : to collect all the furies in order to ressurect the Goddess who will bring peace to the world. Will he be able to protect the world ? Then, Fang will do a long journey with his friends to grant their common wish. \n\nPositive points :\n\n- An excellent soundtrack \n- A simple gameplay which is very effective (similar to Neptunia games)\n- The boost points\n- 60 FPS\n- A great character design \n- A game which will take at least 50 hours if you want to earn all the achievements\n- The story is original and very interesting \n- The characters are endearing \n- The backgrounds are beautiful\n- The CG gallery is excellent\n\nNegative points : \n\n- The landscapes are repetitive sometimes and the textures can be improved\n- The game is a little bit too easy for some gamers maybe\n\nConclusion : I played this game hundred hours if I add my ps3's stats and I was never bored by it ! I recommend this game to all JRPGs fans without any doubt. By the way, the negative points I mentionned earlier have been improved in the game Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force which will be available in 2017 on Steam. Thank you Compile Heart for making great games like Fairy fencer F ! Now I will wait for Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force and I already know that this game will be a huge art which will spread you strong feelings.", "timestamp_created": 1479926584, "timestamp_updated": 1479927296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785806", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26752109": {"recommendationid": "26752109", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985187715", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487328934}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5728\u5976\u5b50\u548c\u80d6\u6b21\u9762\u524d\u8fd8\u4e0d\u5c48\u670d\uff1f\n\u4ec0\u4e48\u7537\u4e3b\u592a\u96be\u770b NPC\u592a\u96be\u770b\uff1f\n\u770b\u5230\u95e8\u5916\u90a3\u644a\u6ca1\u6709\uff1f\n\u90a3\u5c31\u662f\u9999\u6e2f\u8bb0\u8005\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u8dd1\u7684\u6700\u5feb\u7684\u4eba\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1479845015, "timestamp_updated": 1479845015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26744000": {"recommendationid": "26744000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101136252", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487744354}, "language": "spanish", "review": ":megusta:", "timestamp_created": 1479807910, "timestamp_updated": 1479807910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26742654": {"recommendationid": "26742654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008755524", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473835968}, "language": "english", "review": "Good VA both languages (I preferred English especially due to Galdo :P) \n\nStorywise, it's pretty cliche- won't get into details, but it's a fun ride nonetheless. \n\nIt's not THAT grind intensive.

Set in a bright colorful world with just the type of characters I would expect to see.  Cute outfits and stock consumables fill the item shop in the hub city. I really liked the way you could change the story by deciding whether you wanted to release the Goddess or the Devil. The swords being able to change the dungeons was also an interesting idea. All things considered it was just what i was hoping it would be at first.  However the game became a struggle after the first 10 hours due it its restrictive combat system and sluggish leveling.\nBefore I get into that, there are side missions to help you get additional items, but after the first round you just pick all the ones for the area you will be visiting and you will usually complete them as you travel thru the dungeon. There were a few that had me change the monsters in the dungeon or hunt down something interesting but most were quickly forgotten as soon as I accepted them. \nThe combat system in this game places each of your characters facing the enemy in a small circle. For fights with 2 or less it's not a problem, but once you start going against big monsters with a full party you begin to realize just how tight the arena is. It seemed like I could make better use of the small space by increasing the character range but that leads me to my other issue. As you get more experience, each character earns points to increase various stats and buy new abilities. Some abilities are unneccessary but still i never felt i had enough to build my characters like i wanted. I had the DLC weapons on the entire time but I never felt overpowered. I pushed myself to make it about halfway through the story. (current hours 29) The battle system doesn't really get fun until you have at least a 3 move combo. While trying to balance your points between obtaining these moves, magics and other stats you realize that they don't go that far. This is when the game became too much of a grind. and when I couldn't go any further.\nIf a slow grind doesn't get to you in what is an alright RPG then go right ahead. But I can't reccomend it and I unfortunately will not be playing anymore of the games from Compile Heart as the battle/upgrade system is seen in all the ones I have looked into.", "timestamp_created": 1475640582, "timestamp_updated": 1475640582, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.389681", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25863750": {"recommendationid": "25863750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235276752", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493726165}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e08\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e18\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e44\u0e07\u0e14\u0e35 \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21RPG\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e01\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e36\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e14\u0e35\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e46 \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e15\u0e23\u0e07\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e21\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e15\u0e49\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e1f", "timestamp_created": 1475639553, "timestamp_updated": 1475639553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25858736": {"recommendationid": "25858736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153659976", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512895568}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e14\u0e35\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a", "timestamp_created": 1475607497, "timestamp_updated": 1475607497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25853669": {"recommendationid": "25853669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125719175", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 3301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472776180}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game that uses the same engine as the Neptunia series.

I finished the game 3 times with NG+ to have all endings (you can do it by playing it from 1 gameplay but 3+ save files) and I never got bored. Well, it was boring to have Pub Quest items, but they are only for achievement. This game is lack of skills. I mean main character has 6 skills and the other ones have 5 and at late game your normal hits more than your skills with some heroes. But, the skills you have are very fun to use, they have nice effects and action. And monster types never changes your type of play. I played same type at every monster and never died with all my characters.\n\nStory (7/10)\nThis game's story is pretty cool. It has cool jokes that makes you laugh and sad times some points. I did not ever get bored on my first gameplay. I played Tiara's ending first (not knowing choice point) and it was very touching ending. I do not want to spoil it and will not go to details, but I can guarantee it is really cool. The reason I gave \"7\" points is somethings in story not logic. (spoiler) After time-jump after Tiara's death, the reason of Sherman's BIG change never revealed and was very meaningless. It looked to me like it was only for making it a little dramatic. (spoiler) Also many bossed, you need to defeat them 2-3 times. You kill them, but in story Fang is defeated, he gets buff then you go rematch. It was a little annoying. But general story is fun to play.\n\nMusics (9/10)\nI found every music GREAT in this game. I mean, yeah I may have overreacting, but all of them was cool to me. There was no annoying musics and some of them was epic. Only reason I took 1 point from this one is, when you are fighting with bosses there is a music playing really cool and EVERY time you do Fairize the music of it interrupts is until you lose Fairize Mode. Yes, it is normal when you are fighting against normal mobs, but in boss fightes, a music comes that you can't listen it unless you do nothing but listen in Sound Gallery, when you do Fairize that you need it always, Fairize's music always interrupts boss fight's music and it is annoying.\n\nDLCs (5/10)\nLike in many games, you pay some cash and you are overpowered against game. They are just for boosting your power and do nothing other. One of them for costumes and it is cool I guess, but the other ones have no other meaning. Ah, there is a one for 100-750 level dungeons, but I do not need to play it to 750 level. It will just make the game boring.\n\nOverall (8/10)\nThis game is great fun to play. It has some annoying points, but if you do not count them it is great game. Story is not boring, jokes are funny, gameplay is cool, musics are great. They all have some bad points, but they are not that big to make game bad. You should buy the game. If the game is in discount, I think you MUST buy it.\n\nThese are my personal opinions, if you play it and not agree them, I can not do anything about it, but I am really honest about them.", "timestamp_created": 1474140569, "timestamp_updated": 1474140569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25539321": {"recommendationid": "25539321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138374517", "num_games_owned": 1177, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455306855}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u63d0\u4e9a\u62c9\u597d\u53ef\u7231\uff0c\u63d0\u4e9a\u62c9\u7684\u88d9\u5b50\u597d\u6f02\u4eae\uff0c\u80d6\u6b21\u8fd8\u662f\u84dd\u8272\u7684\uff0c\u597d\u60f3\u51fa\u5979\u7684cos\u554a", "timestamp_created": 1474083327, "timestamp_updated": 1474083327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584831", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25508206": {"recommendationid": "25508206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052790160", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474352213}, "language": "english", "review": ">take 70% of boss' health in one hit\n>cutscene of \"oh no he's too strong for us\"\n>teleports away\n\npretty decent transformation sequence sim would get rused again", "timestamp_created": 1473929838, "timestamp_updated": 1473929838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25501438": {"recommendationid": "25501438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070615190", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515218579}, "language": "english", "review": "Ethel best girl", "timestamp_created": 1473807232, "timestamp_updated": 1473807232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25501039": {"recommendationid": "25501039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097695747", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442923534}, "language": "english", "review": "Fairy Fencer Fablous", "timestamp_created": 1473804950, "timestamp_updated": 1473804950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25476037": {"recommendationid": "25476037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129834207", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515511517}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

No es un mal juego, pero no puedo recomendarlo. \n\nEs un jrpg con cosas buenas y cosas muy malas. Lo primero que hay que destaca es su dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico, pues como aficionado a la animaci\u00f3n japonesa debo decir que, aunque sea un dise\u00f1o gen\u00e9rico y en ocasiones est\u00fapido, sus personajes sueltan ALGO de carisma. El prota es el t\u00edpico imb\u00e9cil subnormal que con su buen coraz\u00f3n y su energ\u00eda espiral se abro paso en un mundo plagado de muchachas adorables. Que s\u00ed,que es un juego japo y los japos son muy suyos, tan t\u00edpicos y conservadores que el d\u00eda que hagan algo DISTINTO se me caer\u00e1 el pez\u00f3n izquierdo. \n\nEn fin, a lo que vamos. Como digo, su dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico lo considero simple pero efectivo. Otra cosa buena : su sistema de combate. Es una mezcla entre combate por turnos y combate t\u00e1ctico. Esto es, que tenemos un escenario por donde nos movemos libremente ( ojo, libremente ) en cada uno de nuestros turnos. Y eso est\u00e1 bien, no es el sistema m\u00e1s maravilloso que encontrar\u00e1s pero s\u00ed que sabe disimular el puto ast\u00edo que dejan ya los jrpgs basados en turnos. Que no son malos, pero si has jugado ya una cierta cantidad como yo, siempre es algo bueno ver algo \"distinto\". \n\nSigamos. Qu\u00e9 hay m\u00e1s bueno... ? ah s\u00ed, la forma de subir a los personajes. Te permite subir literalmente como te d\u00e9 la puta gana a cada uno de los protagonistas. Ninguno tiene  un rol predeterminado y eso, quieras o no, es una alegr\u00eda. Estoy hasta el pene de subir a la chica mona de healer o support por que... sea una t\u00eda. Ya sab\u00e9is, japos y sus costumbres milenarias. \n\nCOSAS MALAS : \n\n\nLa puta historia. No es que sea mala, pero en ning\u00fan momento sientes inter\u00e9s o preocupaci\u00f3n por lo que va a ocurrir. Bueno, quiz\u00e1 haya un punto en la aventura que s\u00ed capt\u00f3 mi atenci\u00f3n pero...luego te das cuenta de que es una  puta mierda. Si lo hab\u00e9is jugado ya sabr\u00e9is qu\u00e9 digo. Es una historia muy japo, con ese trasfondo tan \u00e9pico y serio que se ve contrarestado por el tono desenfadado y KAWAII de los protagonistas, que en casi ning\u00fan momento parece que est\u00e9n en una misi\u00f3n de suma importancia para salvar el mundo. Su puta madre. \n\nLa m\u00fasica. No es mala, pero joder, hay 3 o 4 pistas ? y al final, la mejor canci\u00f3n que hay es la que en un principio me daba una grima importante. \n\nLa narrativa, en general. Cualquiera que haya jugado JRPGS sabe que la narrativa es una cosa importante, pues se quiere explicar una historia. Quiz\u00e1 el primer punto negativo que he puesto se hubiese salvado si la narrativa fuera BUENA. O que existiese. Todo se basa en putos di\u00e1logos, con los mismos retratos de los personajes, lo \u00fanico que salva todo esto es que el juego est\u00e1 doblado en japon\u00e9s y como m\u00ednimo puedes darte cuenta de el tono que tiene cada situaci\u00f3n por la actuaci\u00f3n de voz de cada uno de los personajes. El caso es que todo ocurre en un mismo sitio, no hay sensaci\u00f3n de progreso. El mapa que abres al principio es TODO el juego. Claro, luego hay zonas secretas y su puta madre pero en fin, que no. Se echan en falta cinem\u00e1ticas, alguna que otra. Como m\u00ednimo para ensalzar momentos \u00e9picos o situaciones diversas, pero todo corre o bien con el motor del juego ( que es bastante pobre ) o con las ilustraciones, que cada protagonista tiene como 3 o 4 distintas as\u00ed que ya os pod\u00e9is imaginar la cantidad de veces que ver\u00e9is la misma cara. \n\nLas misiones secundarias. Muy malas, y lo peor es que muchas las haces sin darte cuenta, ya que en cuanto las aceptas muchas ya las puedes entregar. Imag\u00ednate, es la primera vez que veo algo as\u00ed. Aceptas una misi\u00f3n y la puedes completar en el mismo momento, sin salir de ah\u00ed. Es de chiste. Aunque hay muchos objetos que necesitar\u00e1s una cantidad rid\u00edcula de dinero para comprarlos as\u00ed que no deja de ser un medio para ello, un medio muy mal puesto, eso s\u00ed. \n\nLa rejugabilidad. El juego te ofrece rejugarlo pues hay distintos finales, pero creedme que una vez acabas al igual tienes ganas de volver a pasar por todo. Y no me vale eso de guardar y cargar, eso es para noobs. \n\n\nEn fin, Fairy Fencer F NO ES UN MAL JUEGO, pero si ya has jugado a unos cuantos jrpgs, no te lo recomiendo. Si nunca has probado un juego de rol con un esp\u00edritu y identidad japonesa  tan elevado y quieres probar cosas nuevas, te lo recomiendo sin duda. \n\nPara mi es un 6/10. NO es un mal juego, pero hay cosas mejores.

Since it's made by the same company as the Neptunia franchise, I wasn't really expecting a [i]good[/i] story but my expectations were wrong.\n\nLet's start off with the positives. The writing is still very anime-y but the story is told like a Visual Novel so it's able to flow nicely and coherently. The characters are pretty likeable (despite the main protagonist being unlikeable at the beginning) and there are a lot of optional skits that help develop some personality in each of them despite being a pretty short JRPG (20-30 hours for the first playthrough).\n\nCombat is standard. If you've played a Neptunia game, it's the same thing: Turn-based in a 3D realm. A different aspect of the whole leveling process is the \"Weapon Point\" system where you can spend points to obtain new skills or magic in (mostly) any order you like. This lets you see noticeable differences in your strength.\n\nOh, and the music is pretty great. The game takes a \"Tales of Symphonia: Sylvarant -> Tethealla\" route with the music where the normal battle and Fairize music change after starting the 2nd half of the game. It's a nice touch that I personally love. The final boss music is fantastic as well. Without it, the final boss would not have been so great.\n\nI noticed a lot of complaints about bland characters. The thing with that is you can easily pile any JRPG or anime character into a single archetype without regarding any of their other traits or back stories. It's just dumb to have that mindset. All of the characters, from the main cast to the villains, are very unique and memorable. One of the secret characters in particular play a great role in developing the main character's motivations which made me actually [i]feel[/i].\n\nAnother complaint I've seen is the fact that the game re-uses assets. Without going into spoiler territory, I'll just say that the whole direction of the 2nd half of the game actually played out the way the story intended so that complaint is just moot. I definitely did [u]not[/u] get the feeling that they were just trying to \"prolong the game\".\n\nNow on to the bad. Combat. It's either way too easy or you have to suddenly start grinding. The difficulty is really...weird in this game. There are no options to select a difficulty so everything is always going to be fixed. Given that info, I'm surprised there was such a weird fluctuation in difficulty since you'd think it would be [i]easier[/i] for the devs to adjust the difficulty with only 1 setting.\n\nAnother thing that is a side-effect of the weird difficulty is how some of the fights play out. There are always cutscenes before, during, and after the boss fights which doesn't always match up to how easy/hard the boss was. For example, I completely stomped one of the bosses and right after a cutscene plays where my character is saying \"I don't think we can beat him...\". It's pretty awkward but it does that to fit the narrative of the story I guess. They could have fixed that by giving different dialogue options (Scene A plays if you win, Scene B plays if you lose/don't kill him in x amount of turns) but I shouldn't expect that much from a low-budget game.

You are way better off expanding your physical attack. You should also expand moves per turn right away. There isn't much point in going into any defense systems either. Magic is only good for healing moves. Your gear does matter for creating resistances and increasing attack.\n\n[b][u]Positive[/u][/b]\nThe combat itself has great pieces to it. The ability to analyze an opponent as a special ability. Fang going into Serious mode. Tiara being used as a healer and using her barrier to make sure the healer doesn't die. If you take down a foe way beyond your level and it was hard fought it feels great. There is plenty of things to do in the game such as increasing your rank in quest and goddess.\n\n[b][u]Negative[/u][/b]\nI was nearly 14 levels below what I was intended to be toward the end of the game. Whats worse is the creators seem to have known that was the case. Creating secret character you can only get if your level 40 when I was just level 20. I guess your supposed to grind or do new game +. Well I don't agree with that attitude because it's lazy. Combat felt challenging while I rushed through the game. Then I was forced to grind and suddenly combat was way to easy. If you are to low level enemies will practically one shot you. The quest level up system is also horrible. You have to grind hidden items for hours and for what? Nothing basically. The characters are also even more generic/flat then in Neptunia games and in those they are standard anime characters because they should be for the jokes to work better.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nIt's not a horrible game, but god it could have been better then this. The story and characters do get better, but just not descent enough in the end. It came off lame at the end of the day. It has plenty of humor, but just doesn't have enough interesting concepts and scenes to carry it well. The combat is great, but the upgrade system is incredibly uneven. I hate to say it, but maybe if this game had dating sim stuff in it the stories would have been more interesting. The girl whos in love with money is great, but even that gets tired. Honestly for all the people who complain about Neptunia 2 this game is easily not as good as that one.\n\n[b][u]Value[/u][/b]\n$5 tops... especially if you like Neptunia games you stand a better shot at liking it.", "timestamp_created": 1470962929, "timestamp_updated": 1470965246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24811865": {"recommendationid": "24811865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059796383", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497925617}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this game, thank me later.\n\n\nalso\nTIARA BEST GIRL", "timestamp_created": 1470844176, "timestamp_updated": 1470844176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.399734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24795135": {"recommendationid": "24795135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036959786", "num_games_owned": 1072, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470807563}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who doesnt enjoy grindy RPGs and/or RPGs this is a game for someone who wants a good game + RPG.

Su historia, aunque en principio bastante gen\u00e9rica, tiene una serie de giros argumentales que hace que se mantenga interesante hasta el final. Si en algo destaca, es en sus personajes, que a pesar de usar los estereotipos comunes en el anime, tienen personalidad y carisma. Emocionalmente, es una obra cargada de humor, pero tiene sus momentos emotivos que consiguen que te involucres sentimentalmente con los personajes. Jugablemente, es bastante similar a la saga Neptunia, pero con algunas diferencias, sobre todo relacionadas con el crecimiento del personaje. Aqu\u00ed, en lugar de desbloquear nuevos combos y habilidades cuando alcanzas determinados niveles, se te otorgan puntos especiales que puedes invertir en desbloquear los que pienses que m\u00e1s convienen al personaje, siempre que cumplas los requisitos necesarios para poder desbloquearlo. Esto, unido a la mec\u00e1nica de vincular el personaje a un hada, la cual le otorga unos efectos pasivos determinados, dan bastante flexibilidad a la hora de mejorar a los personajes. En general, la jugabilidad es divertida, aunque no sea muy variada y puede hacerse un tanto repetitiva por el grindeo que en ocasiones exige. La banda sonora es bastante buena, y cuenta con la colaboraci\u00f3n de Nobuo Uematsu, compositor principal de la saga Final Fantasy. Del mismo modo, su estilo art\u00edstico cuenta con la colaboraci\u00f3n de Yoshitaka Amano, artista conceptual de Final Fantasy, aunque los sprites de los personajes y fondos est\u00e1n hechos por la misma gente que la saga Neptunia, lo cual es notorio. Si tuviera que destacar un punto negativo es que, a pesar de tener varios finales, estos no var\u00edan demasiado la historia principal, cambiando unicamente la escena post-cr\u00e9ditos. Este error, sin embargo, tampoco influye mucho en la calidad del juego, y adem\u00e1s, parece haber sido corregido en su remake, Fairy Fencer F: Advent Dark Force, en el que se han a\u00f1adido varias rutas extra que alteran completamente la historia. En definitiva: es un gran juego, al que siento que le falta alg\u00fan detalle para poder considerarlo una obra maestra, aunque quiz\u00e1s ese detalle si lo tenga el remake, el cual recomiendo sobre \u00e9ste.", "timestamp_created": 1470751746, "timestamp_updated": 1474926847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24765348": {"recommendationid": "24765348", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960344344", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470597904}, "language": "english", "review": "I played 4 neptunia games already and thought it would be good to play this one also from Idea Factory International.

This switching system is what makes planning even more important, so first and foremost, a strategy needs to be fostered in order to be able to face any kinds of situations. Of course, sometimes you will meet enemies who are just too overpowered, in this case, players will have to train their characters until they reach a level which allows them to rival these hostiles.\n\n\n\nThe reason for which I keep comparing this game to HDN is actually because both games are created by Idea Factory and Compile Heart. This is why Fairy Fencer F is heavily identical to HDN series, although there are still some major changes, for players who have already experienced any rebirths, they will be able to recognize the combat system very soon, the only difference is Weapon point system which is not set in any HDN game. As for the storyline, the game is not related to HDN at all, Fairy Fencer F has a pretty classic tale of fantasy and adventure, anymore of this will spoil the story, so I\u2019ll stop here~.\n\nFor items in game, FFF does provide various weapons and other equipments, but it did not inherit the complex \u2018\u2019plan\u2019\u2019 system found in HDN, therefore, there are only a handful of dungeons, without the DLC dungeons, I won\u2019t recommend you to aim for the achievements\u2026..it will just take too long. \n\nThe general art design is pretty, so are the soundtracks, although many of them are rather classical, it does make players immerse in the story and in any battle, of course, for some, this feeling only lasts for the early period of game.\n\nThank you for reading this review, I hope it will prove to be helpful to you as well as giving you a vague concept of the way this game works.~\n", "timestamp_created": 1470392055, "timestamp_updated": 1470392055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552680", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24698737": {"recommendationid": "24698737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144200989", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442098168}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Bu oyun bilerek oynad\u0131\u011f\u0131m ilk JRPG oldu\u011fundan bende yeri b\u00fcy\u00fck asl\u0131nda ortalama bir JRPG oyunu galiba 50 saate bitirdim ve yava\u015f yava\u015f oynad\u0131m bu \u00e7ok az bir s\u00fcre Bir JRPG i\u00e7in ama oyunun konsepti g\u00fczel en az\u0131ndan 3 sonu var (Galiba Bakmaya \u00fc\u015feniyorum).", "timestamp_created": 1470265680, "timestamp_updated": 1470265680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24684121": {"recommendationid": "24684121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015519160", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445938342}, "language": "english", "review": "yes...

Unlike neptunia though the characters are nicely fleshed out, the story is fleshed out and not as ridiculous as neptunia (dont get me wrong i love nepenp) This was just.. better. \n\nI did get a little annoyed you had to revisit the same areas twice, and i will forever say 'oh my' like Tiara now, seriously she says it ALOT. The fury system is fun and i liked all the beautiful art for the cards, i do wish some were more powerful than they were, like the cute dark girl, but its a give or take. I also like that you can unlock bonuses to keep. I did play half the game without realizing i could put skill points into more than just base stats and get new attakcs, regarldss i did not die once in this game even when underskilled. It is easy but also challenging if you want to try out the hard bosses. \n\nAltogether it is a very fun game with a great story and characters. You can still change outfits and accesories which is always fun.

I posted the fixes on the forums, so it's possible that people with identical setups could now have this sorted in minutes if they know what they're looking for, though.\n\n[u]The game has many elements that are simply broken[/u]\nWhether its crafting recipes that require ingriedients that do not drop in the game at all (you have to hack the code using a third-party-program like Cheat Engine to make them work), or some that require multiple copies of an ingriedient that is UNIQUE and thus you cannot get more than one of without the aforementioned hacks;\nor the \"Seize\" (steal) skill that seems to have a misplaced decimal in its success-rate, and thus you can spend half-an-hour spamming it against enemies too weak to damage you before it actually works.\n\nAnd this is before you get to the litany of frankly [b]bizarre design choices[/b].\nA \"magic\" and \"skill\" system that doesn't scale properly - so instead of choosing the \"right tool for the job\" you always need to spam the most powerful one for it to deal any damage - even if its a screen-wide AOE and you only want to injure one enemy.\nAn AOE system that is worthless because each of the abilities \"knocks back\" the enemies - spreading them out too far for any follow-up AOEs; as well as having inappropriately scaled templates so that often a low-level AOE literally means \"one or two enemies only if you're lucky.\"\n\"Magic\" is largely worthless - the Mana (SP) costs are too high early on for it to be viable for builds; and late-game it's too weak to be useful as anything other than \"use the most powerful spell to one-shot trash for quicker clearing\".\nThe elemental resistance system has such a negligible effect as to be worth ignoring.\nThe \"Skill\" system is identical to magic, except it uses the same stat (Physical Attack) as your combos, and thus is simply superior - making \"Magic\" even more redundant.\n\nThe weapon-combo system requires an inordinate amount of \"Weapon Points\" (WP) to fully unlock, which forces you to sit on your hands for ages with lame-duck characters; and because you're neglecting putting WP into the \"Fairy Fury\" stat, the game's unique selling point (turning into a fairy-powered pseudo-robot) is generally superfluous.  Even if you do put points into it, you're just looking at a 2% buff to your stats for every unit you upgrade.\n\n[u]The game is painfully repetitive.[/u]\nIt uses a \"travel back in time to the start of the game\" gimmick to recycle assets and pad the length out - doubling the playtime from 5 hours to 12 hours.  This adds very little to the experience, although it does allow you to enjoy your levelled up characters a bit more and thus get juicier combat.\nUnfortunately you then complete it again, and find that the \"NG+\" mode is essentially just another play through identical to the first; except now the enemies pose no challenge because you can one-hit them all.\n\nHell, if you equip the overpowered-as-hell DLC equipment the game throws at you from the start, you can have had this \"I walk through the game suffering no damage and one-hitting everything\" nonsense through your first play-through!\n\nAnd all-the-while the side-quest system expects you to repeat zones you've already cleared using the \"alternate enemies\" Fury function, in order to farm those kills and their drops.\n\n[u]The game locks you out of content with no warning or indication.[/u]\nThink you've cleared all your side-quests in the Tavern?  Think you've got all the \"Find a new Fairy sub-events\"?  Double-checked to make sure no-one anywhere is prompting you for more?\nWell, must be safe to complete the next event and move on, right?\n\nWRONG.  Several events require you enter a dungeon - and then exit it [b]without completing it[/b] - in order to show up.  No indicators, no warning, no suggestion whatsoever that you should stop doing the only task you currently have issued to you and walk out of the dungeon the very second you walked into it.\n\nThe game punishes you for being efficient in how you clear the zones.  And these are MAJOR elements of content.\nThere's a character you can't unlock if you beat him while you're BELOW a specific level...  Whether you repeat content by grinding out the level; or by playing through the whole game in NG+ from scratch, they expect you to repeat it all again.\n\n[u]The game takes every opportunity to waste your time[/u]\nWhether it's a ridiculous drop-rate; or a frustrating crafting (synthesis) system; or sub-quests whose rewards are less than the value of the items they want you to turn in; or forcing you to play through AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN to maybe stumble across whatever you've missed...\n\n[h1]The game comes across as one whose designer understands what elements are required of a JRPG, and has tossed them in with [b]no understanding of why they are there[/b] or [b]what purpose they serve.[/b][/h1]\n\nWhich is a shame, as the game has a lot of potential:  The characters are fun, the art-style is cool, the graphics are pretty good.\n\nIf it wasn't for the game constantly recycling its own content in order to pad out its length, it would be one I would recommend.\n\nBut ultimately there's between five and eight hours of gameplay here, but it has deliberately been padded out to about sixty hours of pointless frustrating unsatisfying and downright miserable busy-work.", "timestamp_created": 1468432128, "timestamp_updated": 1468432128, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24297744": {"recommendationid": "24297744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312215615", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507568568}, "language": "english", "review": "a very \"worth your money\" game the graphics look a little bad but that game play and battle function........ you can't say no to those system", "timestamp_created": 1468424489, "timestamp_updated": 1468424489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24296749": {"recommendationid": "24296749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004472496", "num_games_owned": 512, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 7987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474893644}, "language": "russian", "review": "[quote=Lola]\"I love money!

Why the hype you may ask...well continue below to find out.\n\nPros.\n\n1.Firstly, I have to award Compile Heart for this excellent port! This was fantastically done incomparison to Hyperneptunia first installment. It ran perfectly on my system which is just an Intel Graphics 3000 with Core i3. No lagging, no nothing, smoooooth transitions. Love it.\n2. The english dubbed of all the characters. Listen lisssssten! The voice actors were bloody amazing1 Hands down. I was so engaaaaged in the storyline. It was well done, congrats to those who chose these individuals. they deserved a medal which leads to\n3. Characters and storyline was engaging, I understood the premise completely and was satisfied with the conclusion.\n4. Gameplay. *geeks out* It was amazing, original, engaging, battle system beautifully done...I wow just wow.\n5. Graphics on point for me, no it aint 1 million HD but it was pleasing to the eye.\n\nI could continue on and on all about the game but it lacks something fundamental.\n\nCON:\n1. It is toooo BLOODY EASY! I did not die ONCE throughout the game and I dont mean my entire party being eliminated. I am talking about a single character not dying! While yes I have been playing JRPG games and know the ropes, BUT! if agarest generation of war can kick my rear end to the curb..although frankly, some of those bosses were just plain dumbassly overpowered. This just was too easy! They should put a hard mode or something and yes! The tower exists to challenge me, but I'd would prefer it throughout the game and not just at an optional section.\n2. The challenges for each character is dumb. Why would I jump I dont know 2000 times for each character to complete the 'JUMPING CHALLENGE'  and what walk 1 billion metres with EACH character! Listen that a just BS.\n3. Lastly, it aint as bad as agarest with ending criteria's however once again a hint or suggestion to what affects an outcome would be greatly appreciated. No I am not saying spell it out and no I am not an imbecile that lacks discernment; I am a top student of my department in a section of Medical sciences, not boasting but just saying. And I dont believe that I should play the game,  what 3 times before I 'know' what to do to get what is what. That just a waste me damn precious time.\n\nBut overall, Great game, it has its flaws but that in no way should deter anyone from the 50 hours of entertainment and possibly more...if you do more than one playthrough, that it has.\n\nAll the best, enjoy your time Fang and the gang:)", "timestamp_created": 1467769926, "timestamp_updated": 1467769926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24113292": {"recommendationid": "24113292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095220713", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483371836}, "language": "english", "review": "Plot:\nYou're just a starving handsome badass, that wants to eat Double BigMac, but accidentally pulls out a fucking steampunk overpowered blade with a sexy fairy girl soul - and now You've to find another 99 swords for no reason.

Thus, avid JRPG fans may have a much different view from mine.\n\nAs many other reviews state, the game takes about 20-30 hours to complete your first runthrough of it, and boy is it worth it. The gameplay itself is good enough for what it is, and although the combat isn't anything revolutionary, the strategy in it is solid enough to make it very enjoyable. And as far as the story and characters... that's where the game comes into its own. There are three main characters, and a decently sized supporting cast that the game does a great job of fleshing out, which is surprising for side characters. Be prepared to laugh as well, as the main character's personality is hilarious at times, and the other characters all have their quircks that come out and incite laughter. Another amazing thing that I love about the game is the varied endings. There are three main endings, as well as multiple \"secret\" characters that you do things to obtain, all of whom affect the dialogue.\n~~~\nPros\n+ The cutscenes are quite nice, with high quality texture models and animations\n+ Fairly in-depth combat, which is easy to grasp but also satisfying later in the game once you learn the ins and outs\n+ AMAZING story, which will likely draw some tears at some points, and of course a plethora of laughs\n+ The characters are all amazing in their own way, there will be some you despise, some you love, and some you just accept. There also is much development in the characters relationships to one another, and yes - there are love routes you can attain (which are done very tastefully, and this comes from a person who typically despises romance novels, animes, and games)\n+ GREAT attack animations, which can actually keep you entertained at times, and I found myself sometimes just letting the animations play out rather than skipping them\n+ Well done soundtrack, with over 50 songs that play at various times, and although some of them begin to get old (ESPECIALLY if you choose to grind), it's undeniable that a majority are actually very enjoyable to listen to. If you enjoy them enough, you can also use a converter to extract the soundtrack from the game files (.ogg to .mp3), and listen to them outside of the game.\n\nGood/Bad\n~ The main story requires little to no grinding, which I personally am fond of. I normally prefer to not need to bore myself of a game because I'm forced to grind in order to have a chance. If you play through the game with minimal grinding, you'll have some trouble at parts, but IMO that's the fun of it when you have your back to the wall, fighting with all you've got. Some grinding will be fine, especially in the second arc of the game, but DO NOT OVERGRIND! The main story will become very boring to play when you become OP.\n~ Some purposely cringeworthy dialogue from the main protagonist, which will make you cringe but also laugh, and the side characters call him out on it.\n~ Personally, I'm not a fan of the hilariously oversized weapons, but they do look awesome, and they're a standard characteristic of games of this type.\n\nBad\n- Aside from a few dungeons, most of them are fairly bland, and the textures are often muddled. Of course, it's not the main purpose of the game to look beautiful, but I'd much rather the dungeons be more interesting\n- Keyboard is fully playable, but if you have access to a controller I'd recommend you play it with that. However, I did make it through the game on nothing but M&K without changing controls, so it's not the worst I've seen\n- Fps drops even on a good rig at times (GTX 970, i7 4790k, 16gb RAM), usually when loading the world map or a new dungeon where enemies are spawning, but it's brief and still only drops to about 30.", "timestamp_created": 1467585886, "timestamp_updated": 1467590161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24063247": {"recommendationid": "24063247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062394411", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493545502}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the neptunia games, I liked them, so I decided to try out Fairy Fencer F.\nI never thought I'd say this, but in terms of gameplay, this game looks to be even better than the nep rebirth games, atleast, that's what I think.\n\nGot it gifted by an total awesome friend, so thank you for that ;3\n\nSo ehm, I'm not really good at giving actual reviews, so sorry for that :p\n\nOhwell, I just want to tell you guys you really should buy this game ^-^", "timestamp_created": 1467584695, "timestamp_updated": 1467584695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24060635": {"recommendationid": "24060635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163236589", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497718547}, "language": "english", "review": "+Turn based RPG like Neptunia games\n+Good Skills/abilities/combo system\n+Possibility to customize the fairies with a skill you want (even if limited to their rank)\n\n-Male characters are ugly\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1467578353, "timestamp_updated": 1499897653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24045564": {"recommendationid": "24045564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114667836", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457117264}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story with multiple endings which most of you wont see because its too much of a pain to REgrind thru it. its a jrpg =grinding fest.

I think I don't recommend it for hardcore players but it's definitely worth just for the story.\n\n[b]Entry[/b]:Game has the same fighting system as neptunia but not identical mechanics, there are some parts like upgrading your weapons which Neptunia series (as fas as I played) don't have.Overally it's turn-based oldschool RPG system with addition of being able to move on the battlefield.\n\n If you think about DLC, some of them will only make game ultra-easy...like Ultimate Armor or Weapon Change acc set., but there are some for level cap increase and if you're not scared of [strike]calm[/strike] titanic grinding then go forward for these, they make the 100kk gold achievement a lot easier.\n\nSo now it's time for some more raw info:\nPros:\n- Great,addictive and touching story.(Plus 3 kinds of ending!)\n- It's easy to take a shine to heroes.(Prota and Antagonists...there are no 2 copies in game)\n- Eye-catching animations of skills.\n- Music may take a while to get used to but then it will be awesome.(Sang aloud awakening themes)\n- Loli. Maid costume. Harley(You'll know what I mean).\n- Legendary swimsuits.(I really had to put that separate)\n- Visually attractive.\n- Stupid requirements to unlock achievements and Lola(I find it as Pro because It lets you play for longer with various styles)\n- System of \"increasing the numbers\" like jumps made(lol) to make your characters stronger.\n- Crafting system! Althought not unlocked at start...\n- For people that search easy-going playthrough with some stops for grind(without DLC).\n\nCons(No?):\n- I find english dubs having some flaws like Tiara's \"NEXT!\"...it eats my ears.\n- Major grind for 100kk gold achievement.\n- Pretty dumb fight system sometimes.(Giant monsters able to dodge 60% of your attacks...)\n- A lot of skills might look ultra powerful like Fang's final attack...well...No...they don't deal more than Ethel's normal skill.\n\nSo, if I forget about anything.

Value them as you may.\n\nGraphics: 3/5.  Heavy on the polygon side, some of the characters seem to have some hit boxes still rather than a more smooth circle or sphere.  The dungeons look nice, but there aren't that many of them.  I would say that some of the dungeons probably were underdeveloped or potentially rushed.  To be sure, they could have put a tad more thought to it.\n\nAudio: 3/5 The voice acting is solid enough in both English and Japanese.  There are some minor problems with the English characters (a couple of them sound whiny even when they're talking normally, which tended to grate on me).  The music is a little generic, but the songs used for the \"speical power\" mode do fit nicely.\n\nBattles: 1/5 There's not a lot here.  It's a button smash, where you don't need to use the special abilities.  Almost EVERY fight, including the final boss, can be beatdown with a faceroll.  This detracts heavily from the overall \"fun\" factor.\n\nGameplay: 2/5 There isn't a lot of gamplay per se.  You go to a dungeon, of which there are 8 or so, kill the stuff that needs killing and go back to town.  Given all the dungeons are just a matter of moving the cursor and hitting \"enter\", it's not that hard to find.  There's no real \"overworld\" like you expect in a RPG, or even some adventure games.  Town options are limited.\n\nStory: 2/5.  It's pretty standard fare: gather X and save the freaking world.  How it goes about it is somewhat different though.\n\nFun factor: 3/5.  The characters have some great lines between them.  Some of them are unlikable and the ones that ARE likable are ones you can get behind.\n\nDLC: 3/5.  The good news here is that it's CHEAP (I think it's $5 or less for all of it).  The bad news is that the DLC adds in some extra dungeons (mainly rehashes or established ones at higher difficulty levels), and practically unbalances the game.  I mean, you don't need to buy ANYTHING in-game with the weapons the DLC offers.\n\nOverall: It's not a great game by any criteria you can apply to it.  It is an easy enough romp, and stuff you can go through without a guide or instructions.  I'd probably call this a \"weekender\".  If it's on sale, it'd be worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1467306500, "timestamp_updated": 1467306500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23955883": {"recommendationid": "23955883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240498672", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467290618}, "language": "german", "review": "Auf Keinen Fall Kaufen habe einen Gaming Laptop und das spielt crashed alle 2 minuten", "timestamp_created": 1467296040, "timestamp_updated": 1467296040, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.318725", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23954014": {"recommendationid": "23954014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016967385", "num_games_owned": 959, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468220368}, "language": "english", "review": "Weeb", "timestamp_created": 1467291260, "timestamp_updated": 1467291260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23934685": {"recommendationid": "23934685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079487675", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454790805}, "language": "spanish", "review": "A parte de divertido y de contener un sin fin de momentos de humor bastante est\u00fapido pero genial al mismo tiempo, es relativamente dif\u00edcil, lo que hace que de verdad sea un juego de estrategia.

I wasnt expecting it to be anything good.\nOhh how wrong I was.\n\nShort version : If you like JRPGs in general this is a good one. PC port is good, has keyboard cues & mouse support.Has English voice overs\n\nLong Version :\nBut first I should mention that Im already a fan of Animes & JRPGs & other popular Japanese stuff in general even tho im not one. So I dont really find fantasy stories & themes like this awkward as some others do.\nI dont usually play games for long stretches unless its a competitive multiplayer game or a really hard game which im tryin to beat but cant(example:dark souls). But occasionally there will be compelling games which you just cant put down because they give u just the right amount of depth & enjoyment.I guess thats what the RPG genre is known for but many RPGs fail in some way & end up being a boring chore. It can be uinteresting characters to unresponsive world.\n\nFairy Fencer F is not even an open world RPG. Its a typical JRPG,safe city zone where u manage ur party & dungeons for questing & grinding. But even then It kept me going... I just didn't get bored at all, the grind did not feel like boring grind. I cared for the characters & enjoyed the music & combat animations. Its not one thing which makes it good. Its all the little bits that combine & polish this to near perfection. Add to that english voice overs & a PC port which does not disappoint. It even shows keyboard button cues on screen, yes you can play with keyboard & mouse just fine. And just like most JRPGs it has very in-depth(sometimes confusing)Player development(I mean stats.. like buffing up your character in different ways).Although all confusion can be cleared by reading through the mini-teaching sections which pop up everytime you open a new menu or encounter something new.Im not even mentioning the absoulutely hilarious conversations the lazy protagonist has with his companions, which are a treat to listen to everytime.\n\nAt last.. this game is a typical JRPG & a good one at that & the fact that its a JRPG so it may not be for everyone, as the title mentions that its a turned based combat game. But if you're into that sort of thing like me, then look no further. \nIf you're still in doubt I suggest you buy the game & play it for 1 or 2 hours & then decide whether its your taste or not, you can refund it if you did not spend more than 2 hours  & 15 days on it.

fin avec une once de nostalgie. Nous avons l\u00e0 un bon vieux JRPG qui reprend les codes du genre avec ses qualit\u00e9s et ses d\u00e9fauts le tout remis au go\u00fbt du jour. Un jeu que je conseille sans h\u00e9sitation car j'ai pass\u00e9 de bons moments dessus, comme d'habitude je vais tenter de d\u00e9crypter les diff\u00e9rents aspects afin d'aider les personnes ind\u00e9cises \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e de l'acqu\u00e9rir ou non.\n\n\n- [b]Graphiquement d\u00e9j\u00e0[/b], car c'est la premi\u00e8re chose que l'on voit du jeu, je suis assez partag\u00e9 on va dire. D'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 tout le plan 2D avec les artworks des personnages et des d\u00e9cors sont splendides, de l'autre la 3D est vraiment in\u00e9gale : les personnages sont bien mod\u00e9lis\u00e9s et dot\u00e9s de textures tr\u00e8s fines alors que les d\u00e9cors dans lesquels on \u00e9volue donnent une impression de travail fait en vitesse. Apr\u00e8s \u00e7a ne me g\u00eane pas tellement mais il est bon de le savoir je trouve. Par ailleurs niveau diversit\u00e9 d'environnements c'est pas non plus la grande joie, on \u00e9volue dans des donjons totalement lin\u00e9aires, il y en a un de glace, un de feu, un dans des plaines, un autre dans un d\u00e9sert, un sur des \u00eeles flottantes et d'autres dans des sortes de ruines robotiques. Il y a bien des variantes mais \u00e7a ne change vraiment pas grand chose. Donc oui, beaucoup de recyclage dans les environnements en sachant qu'il y a une vingtaine de donjons dans le jeu. En parlant de r\u00e9emploi les monstres souffrent aussi de ce probl\u00e8me \u00e0 savoir qu'on croise souvent les m\u00eames mod\u00e8les de cr\u00e9atures mais avec des skins diff\u00e9rents, c'est assez regrettable je trouve mais pas r\u00e9dhibitoire non plus.\n\nMention sp\u00e9ciale aux phases de dialogues entre les personnages : les artworks 2D en plus d'\u00eatre magnifiques sont anim\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s naturelle (ils bougent l\u00e9g\u00e8rement, clignent des yeux, respirent etc). Je n'avais encore jamais rencontr\u00e9 une telle technique d'animation dans un JRPG et je suis totalement bluff\u00e9. \n\nPar ailleurs les effets visuels en combat sont tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ussis.\n\n- [b]D'un point de vue audio[/b], on a acc\u00e8s aux voix japonaises et \u00e7a c'est vraiment g\u00e9nial. La plupart des phases de dialogue sont doubl\u00e9es ce qui renforce vraiment l'immersion. Les musiques sont nombreuses, appropri\u00e9es et agr\u00e9ables, rien \u00e0 redire \u00e0 ce niveau.\n\n- [b]Le gameplay maintenant[/b]. C'est du tour par tour o\u00f9 on contr\u00f4le 3 personnages simultan\u00e9ment parmi 6 disponibles, on \u00e9volue dans une ar\u00e8ne en 3D o\u00f9 on les d\u00e9place \u00e0 notre guise (avec une limite de de port\u00e9e par tour quand m\u00eame). Apr\u00e8s pour le reste c'est du classique niveau JRPG : un mouvement et une attaque par tour. Il y a quand m\u00eame pas mal de subtilit\u00e9s qui rendent le syst\u00e8me combat unique et tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able. (nos h\u00e9ros peuvent notamment entrer dans un mode ultime pendant un court laps de temps ou encore lancer quelques aptitudes uniques)\n\nD'un point de vue personnalisation les protagonistes montent \u00e9videmment en niveau et au fil des combats on peut attribuer des points pour augmenter soit leurs caract\u00e9ristiques brutes (attaque, d\u00e9fense, port\u00e9e etc) soit d\u00e9bloquer de nouveaux sorts/attaques. Le jeu dispose d'un syst\u00e8me d'encha\u00eenements d'attaques tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant. On commence avec une attaque par tour et \u00e0 la fin du jeu chaque personnage pourra lancer un combo compos\u00e9 de 4 attaques en sachant que l'on peut cr\u00e9er ses propres enchainements \u00e0 partir de nombreuses techniques de bases qui auront toutes leurs utilit\u00e9s selon la situation.\n\nEn plus de \u00e7a il y a \u00e9videmment un marchand aupr\u00e8s duquel on pourra acheter de nouveaux \u00e9quipements, on acc\u00e8de \u00e9galement \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de craft assez rapidement. Chaque personnage peut \u00eatre li\u00e9 \u00e0 une \"divinit\u00e9\" qui pourra monter en niveaux et donnera acc\u00e8s \u00e0 de nombreux bonus passifs.\n\nLa progression se fait, comme je l'ai dit au d\u00e9but, par le biais d'une carte du monde dans laquelle on se d\u00e9place pour aller dans des donjons. La ville principale sert de lieu d'accueil o\u00f9 on peut trouver des commerces, une taverne et d'autres zones... il y est possible de parler avec nos compagnons mais aussi \u00e0 pas mal d'habitants pour y r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer des qu\u00eates secondaires et faire \u00e9voluer l'histoire principale.\n\nLa difficult\u00e9 du jeu est assez \u00e9trange, la premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s simple mais arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la seconde on se retrouve pas mal dans l'embarras. Ca m'a oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 farm pendant quelques heures pour me remettre \u00e0 niveau mais rien de bien affolant, tous les adeptes de JRPG sont habitu\u00e9s \u00e0 ce genre de pratique. :p\n\n- [b]A pr\u00e9sent place au sc\u00e9nario[/b], je l'ai trouv\u00e9 plut\u00f4t int\u00e9ressant. Pas sp\u00e9cialement original mais les personnages ont tous leur personnalit\u00e9, ils sont attachants et il y a plusieurs fins possibles. Le tout m'a tenu en hal\u00e8ne pendant ces quarante heures sans aucun probl\u00e8me. Attention les sous titres sont uniquement disponibles en anglais, le niveau d'\u00e9criture n'est pas forc\u00e9ment tr\u00e8s soutenu mais il faut quand m\u00eame poss\u00e9der des bases relativement solides pour suivre le sc\u00e9nario avec aisance.\n\n- [b]La dur\u00e9e de vie[/b] du jeu est honorable, on est dans la moyenne des JRPG modernes on va dire. Pas loin de 50 heures pour boucler la qu\u00eate principale ainsi que les secondaires en sachant que je n'ai pas termin\u00e9 les DLC et que je n'ai pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir les 3 fins diff\u00e9rentes, \u00e7a laisse de quoi faire !\n\nEnfin les DLC ne sont pas utiles pour un sou, ce ne sont que des items cosm\u00e9tiques ainsi que des objets sp\u00e9ciaux visant \u00e0 faciliter un peu l'exp\u00e9rience du jeu. Disons qu'au mieux cela \u00e9conomise quelques heures de farm. Un des DLC d\u00e9bloque \u00e9galement 3 zones d'xp de tr\u00e8s haut niveau o\u00f9 il est plus simple de trouver certains objets rares. Il faut donc voir ces DLC comme des codes de triches ou des trainers payants, on peut tout \u00e0 fait s'en passer car ils ne font qu'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la progression pour les joueurs les moins courageux ou ceux d\u00e9sirant uniquement se concentrer sur la trame principale.\n\n\nDonc voil\u00e0, bilan tr\u00e8s positif pour le grand amateur de JRPG \u00e0 l'ancienne que je suis. J'attends avec impatience la suite (Fairy Fencer F : Advent Dark Force) qui est annonc\u00e9e fin juin sur PS4 en Europe et un peu plus tard sur PC. C'est vraiment chouette que de plus en plus de jeux de r\u00f4le japonais sortent sur PC surtout qu'ici le portage est tout \u00e0 fait satisfaisant, le titre tourne comme un charme en 1080P et je n'ai rencontr\u00e9 aucun bug, ralentissement ou plantage.", "timestamp_created": 1465160559, "timestamp_updated": 1465400467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696970", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23401578": {"recommendationid": "23401578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070338916", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465967072}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u901a\u5173\u4e86\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u4f5c\u753b\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u90fd\u633a\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u6218\u6597\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u62db\u5f0f\u52a8\u753b\u4e0d\u80fd\u8df3\uff0c\u5237\u602a\u7ec3\u7ea7\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u6709\u70b9\u6d6a\u8d39\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u88c5\u626e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6211\u633a\u559c\u6b22\u7684\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6700\u540e\u7684\u6bd4\u57fa\u5c3c\u3002\u8fd9\u6b21\u770b\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u6253\u51fa\u7684\u662f\u666e\u901a\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u6253\u7b97\u7f13\u4e00\u7f13\uff0c\u8fc7\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u518d\u6253\u6253\u4e8c\u5468\u76ee\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u65b0\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u559c\u6b22\u56de\u5408\u5236\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bd5\u4e00\u8bd5", "timestamp_created": 1465138378, "timestamp_updated": 1465138378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23375324": {"recommendationid": "23375324", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994073479", "num_games_owned": 605, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465023051}, "language": "english", "review": "Meh... can't say too much about this. Took about 20 hours to beat but wasn't very difficult to do so. Bosses are pretty easy all the way to the end. I only got one ending  out of three apparently but I'm not feeling too motivated to get the other two. I was really playing for the sake of knowing what happened at the end and it wasnt very satisfying i have to say. Pretty cliche anime-type ending but I wasn't expecting much more than that.\n\nCharacters weren't bad but if you are familiar with anime or manga at all they all fit into the typical character types, which is  pretty much a given as soon as you are introduced to the main character. Cliche as they are they are still fun to listen to. \n\nThe sound and music are decent but nothing special at all and you quickly realize there isn't a very large musical score to accompany the game and you'll here the same tunes over and over again.\n\nThe areas are pretty small  and there really isn't any exploring. There is an ability to search for inivisible items but I hardly used it because just didnt seem worth it.\n\nThere is a \"game-plus\" mode where you play the game again with what appears to be levels and abililties from your previous clear but honestly not sure why you would do that.\n\nGameplay was alright, better than FFXIII but that isn't saying much there. \n\nOverall I wouldn't buy this unless it's on sale. It isn't bad but it won't ever go on my list of favorite games.\n\nI think there is like a sequel but I do not think it's on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1465025811, "timestamp_updated": 1465025882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23372668": {"recommendationid": "23372668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200702853", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466293144}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b3e\u840c\u7cfbRPG\uff0c\u662f\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u3002Tsunako\u8001\u5e08\u4e00\u5982\u65e2\u5f80\u7684\u597d\u8bc4\u3002\nTiara\u68d2\u68d2\u7684\uff0c\u590f\u7ec7\u4e5f\u68d2\u68d2\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u611f\u89c9\u914d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u592a\u201c\u5c3d\u5174\u201d\u3002\n\u56e0\u6b64\u6211\u9009\u62e9\u54c8\u62c9\u548c\u95f9\u95f9\uff01\n\n\u8bf4\u4e9b\u9898\u5916\u8bdd\uff0c\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u201c\u753b\u5730\u81ea\u7262\u201d\u7684\u65e5\u672c\u5c0f\u4f5c\u574a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5730\u96f7\u793e\u662f\u201c\u897f\u8fdb\u201d\u6700\u679c\u65ad\u3001\u6700\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5382\u5546\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u79fb\u690dPC\uff0c\u767b\u9646steam\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u76ee\u5171\u7779\u7684\u6210\u7ee9\u3002\u5728\u76ee\u524d\u4e00\u6f6d\u6b7b\u6c34\u7684\u65e5\u7cfb\u5927\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u5f97\u9f13\u52b1\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u7684\u3002\u5982\u679c\u80fd\u591f\u9020\u798f\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6b7b\u5b85\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u80fd\u591f\u8ba9\u65e5\u5382\u770b\u5230\u6668\u66e6\uff0c\u5728\u575a\u6301\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7279\u8d28\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0cIF\u548cCH\u5c0f\u59d0\uff0c\u4f60\u6765\u4e00\u90e8\u6211\u52a0\u4e00\u90e8\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1465009937, "timestamp_updated": 1465480998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23362117": {"recommendationid": "23362117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063051890", "num_games_owned": 769, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464892347}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Tsunako.", "timestamp_created": 1464965180, "timestamp_updated": 1464965180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23340491": {"recommendationid": "23340491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026656369", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477155308}, "language": "english", "review": "great game and a great story\n", "timestamp_created": 1464855719, "timestamp_updated": 1464855719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23303177": {"recommendationid": "23303177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142160806", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1520977746}, "language": "english", "review": "I've really enjoyed the game, so far.

Este juego es curioso porque tiene un tono general de humor y de no tomarse nada en serio pero luego hay unos giros argumentales y algunos temas que cambian bastante ese tono, te pilla bastante por sorpresa. \nLa historia no es que sea lo m\u00e1s original , pero entretiene y deja una base muy buena para avanzar. Los personajes son muy buenos, cada cual con sus peculiaridades y rarezas xD. El dise\u00f1o de personajes est\u00e1 genial, con chicas para todos los gustos, como tiene que ser! xD. \nEn cuanto a gameplay, se parece mucho a los hyperdimension pero con un sistema de combate algo renovado aunque muy parecido, siguiendo el tema de combate por turnos en el que te puedes mover por el campo de batalla y usar ataques que tienen un rango de acci\u00f3n diferente cada uno. Luego tienen las transformaciones especiales que te hacen m\u00e1s fuerte. Todo se evoluciona mediante puntos , tanto para aprender habilidades como para mejorar al personaje. Los ataques especiales de cada personaje son geniales, con animaciones muy curradas y epicas y con fanservice incluido tambi\u00e9n xD.\n\nEl prota del juego tambi\u00e9n es bastante original ya que no es el t\u00edpico heroe, m\u00e1s bien solo quiere comer y hacer el vago xD. Pero se ir\u00e1 implicando cada vez m\u00e1s por supuesto, pero es bastante diferente a lo que nos tienen acostumbrados.\n\nEn general muy divertido, tanto por el gui\u00f3n como por el juego en si. De lo poco negativo que le veo, a parte de estar en ingles (aunque a mi no me molesta, pero es un impedimiento para muchos otros) ,  es que es bastante repetitivo el desarrollo y adem\u00e1s se repiten muchos escenarios porque te hacen revisitar los lugares. Desde luego se han ahorrado modelar escenarios as\u00ed xD. El final es algo escueto tambi\u00e9n y esperaba un poco m\u00e1s pero bueno...\n\nEn fin, juego que recomiendo a todos los amantes de los jrpg como yo, sobre todo si habeis disfrutado de los hyperdimension neptunia, este seguro que os gusta tambi\u00e9n. Si no te gustan los juegos de rol... no se que haces leyendo esto xD. Y si, tambi\u00e9n tiene fanservice, trajes chulos y hasta una loli saca cuartos y una pettanko ninja.

Aura Kingdom, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, Kingdom Hearts). Das Spiel hab ich bisher einmal durchgespielt, und zwar mit Japanischem Ton.\n\n[b]Review:[/b]\nDie kitschige Story hat mir gut gefallen (nicht \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig gut, aber okay). Das Setting ist insgesamt sehr stimmig und macht gute Laune, teilweise wird es auch sehr dramatisch.\n\nDas Kampfsystem ist ganz nett, aber eher anspruchslos. Es ist eher wenig Strategie oder Geschick n\u00f6tig, um durch die K\u00e4mpfe durchzukommen. F\u00fcr mich waren die K\u00e4mpfe eher angenehme Beilage, der Schwerpunkt lag f\u00fcr mich auf der Story.\n\nWer Animes lieber mit japanischem Ton schaut, und vielleicht auch etwas Japanisch kann, dem kann ich die japanische Sprachausgabe SEHR empfehlen. Ich selbst kann Japanisch auf fortgeschrittenem Anf\u00e4nger-Level, und vieles war f\u00fcr mich gut zu verstehen - so konnte ich nebenbei mein H\u00f6r-Verstehen trainieren. Die Synchronsprecher haben wirklich tolle Arbeit geleistet, es ist einfach ein Ohrenschmaus den Dialogen zuzuh\u00f6ren. Zur englischen Sprachausgabe kann ich nicht viel sagen, vermutlich bringt diese aber nicht das Feeling so gut r\u00fcber wie die japanische.\n\nAuch kann man, wenn man will, einige optionale Ziele im Spiel erreichen. Items sammeln und fusionieren, starke Waffen sammeln und mit verschiedenen Methoden die Stats weiter erh\u00f6hen - was am Ende aber nicht viel bringt da die K\u00e4mpfe nicht sehr schwierig sind. Trotzdem eine gute Zugabe.\n\n[b]Fazit:[/b]\nNicht uneingeschr\u00e4nkt empfehlbar, aber wenn man keine allzu hohen Anspr\u00fcche an das Spiel stellt, dann ist es eigentlich ganz gut.\n\nAm besten kann man das Spiel genie\u00dfen, wenn man das Augenmerk auf die gute Story/Dialoge legt, und alles andere als nette Beilage betrachtet. Wer gerne auf kleine Details und eine stimmige Atmosph\u00e4re achtet wird das Spiel m\u00f6gen. Fans von kitschigen Animes und Visual-Novels sind hier sehr gut aufgehoben. Action und Anspruch wird man hier eher nicht finden, daf\u00fcr ist das Spiel nicht gemacht - vielleicht ist das auch ganz gut so, denn so bleibt das Spiel eher leicht und heiter.\n\nKampfsystem 4/10\nStory 6/10\nJapanische Visual-Novel 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1462705148, "timestamp_updated": 1462987348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22849319": {"recommendationid": "22849319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287311595", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481310922}, "language": "german", "review": "Nahja ich finds bis jetzt sehr kitschig und so klischeehaft, dass einem fast das Essen aus dem Mund f\u00e4llt bei den Zwischensequenzen.

loaded with charming characters. The action takes place in a world where a God and Goddess were in a fight to the death. Their terrible struggle left a fantastic assortment of powerful weapons littering the landscape. You will find not everyone who tries has the ability to wield these relics. It is only those who are worthy of them that can pull them free. Fencers wield these weapons with the assistance of the fairy that resides within the weapon. For once, you are not really saving the world. At the beginning, there really is no peril that a hero/heroine must raise to defeat. In fact, the protagonist of this game isn\u2019t even really a hero at all.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe game is a mixture of a visual novel and an action role-playing game. The story is driven by discussions the playable characters hold as well as their interactions with the NPCs. During the discussions, a static image of the characters is on screen. To emphasize which character is doing the talking, that particular character will have an animated mouth. Emotions are conveyed through a mixture of symbols and facial expressions. If the characters are having a story based discussion, it will be fully voice acted. If it is a random conversation, it will generally be just text on the screen. This works quite well although I do prefer the voiced sections over the just text sections. \n\nWhen in town you simply select between the various options and you enter into the related screen. You do not need to walk to the item shop or inn when you arrive at the town. This is handy because it saves you from having to remember where each place is and having to run back and forth between them constantly, but I still prefer to have explore-able towns. Dungeons are thankfully free to explore when you get to them. The world map is simple to navigate, it shows places you have already opened and explored. It also conveniently has your next destination(s) flagged on the map as well as where any events or sub-events may be taking place. \n\nDungeons are where you are going to spend most of your time (outside of dialogues between characters). You are free to roam around as you please. Monsters can be seen wandering around and you have the option to fight them or attempt to avoid them. If you choose to fight them, you can attempt to get a preemptive strike by swinging your weapon right before the battle screen is triggered. If successful, all your characters will get a chance to strike the enemy first. If you fail or if the enemy sneaks up on you, you will be the one ambushed giving the enemies the chance to strike first. Just walking into an enemy will put your characters and enemies in that standard cue to fight. The fight cue is always displayed and lets you know who will get their turn next. When you are controlling a character in combat, you have a movement circle. You can move anywhere in that circle before you take your action. Once you take your action, your turn ends and the next in cue gets to take theirs. Since each weapon type and ability has its own range and effective arcs, it makes for a nice variety when playing.\n\nThe game has a lot of customization options available to you. While you can\u2019t change your weapon, you can reconfigure it so it changes into a different type of weapon during combat. You are given free choice of what armor and accessories you want to wear as well as your secondary fairy. To make up for the fact you can\u2019t change your weapon, you are given weapon points after battles. These can be spent on how you want to customize the weapon and your related weapon abilities. If you prefer to do a lot of simple physical attacks, that is great. You can set yourself up that way. Do you prefer getting really high combo scores? Well you can buy new combos too. There are a ton of customizations options and luckily you are not locked into your decisions as taking one of the ability does not preclude you from taking a different one later. With enough grinding, you can max out everything for every character.\n\nFairies make this game more interesting. They do that in three ways.  The first is the fact that when your Tension gauge fills (fills when you do damage or takes damage, but reduces when you miss or heal yourself), you gain the ability to merge with your weapon\u2019s fairy and become much more powerful. Another way the fairies are interesting is that you can acquire new ones as you play. While you can never swap out your main fairy (fused to your weapon) you can swap out your secondary fairy. You can customize the abilities of the secondary fairy to some degree as well. When you acquire a new one, if you equip it, it will level up and gain new abilities. You can also merge it with one of the sealed weapons found impaling the fallen God and Goddess that I mentioned earlier. By merging it, you gain new abilities for the secondary fairy. The third way they are interesting is the fact that you can stick a fairy imbued weapon into the ground to \u201cshape the world\u201d using the shaping abilities of the fairy. This changes up how dungeons work as well as adds extra levels to a tower in the game. By sticking the shaping weapon into the ground, you will get positive and negative effects that will change how the dungeon will play out. You may get extra experience while doing the dungeon, but you will take more damage from magical attacks. It might even change the enemies in the dungeon making it feel a little different when you go through it.\n\nThe story and characters in this game diverge a little from the standard clich\u00e9s for this type of game as well. Instead of being a band of heroic figures rallying to save the world, you have a band of misfits each doing it for their own personal and selfish reasons. The protagonist of the game doesn\u2019t even want to do it. He just pulled a sword out of the ground because someone told him it would grant him any wish he could think of. All he wanted to wish for was a nice meal. He accidentally became linked to the fairy in the sword who then forced him to go on the quest because she has amnesia and wants the other fairies to help her remember her past. Another Fencer is out for her own personal gains and is really full of herself. Another is just studying fairies\u2026 you get the idea. None of them are actually real heroes! That makes this game much more fun than the clich\u00e9, \u201clet\u2019s save the world from evil\u201d shticks of other RPG games. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s another enjoyable Idea Factory game. If you like the story telling, humour and fan service found in their other games, such as the Hyperdimention Neptunia series, you will likely enjoy Fairy Fencer F as well. If you are looking for a fun dungeon crawler style RPG that has zany characters, by all means give Fairy Fencer F a go.\n\n[list]Pros:\n\n[*]It\u2019s long and made longer by having to continue the game in New Game Plus to actually beat the game fully\n[*]A lot of customization options including cosmetic changes to the characters\n[*]Fun characters that all feel like they do have their own personality.

You play as Fang, a guy who ends up acquiring a Fury without realising the responsabilities that come with it. Furies are swords left on the planet long ago after a battle between the Vile God and the Goddess, and each of them has a fairy inside. The fairy inside your Fury, Eryn, explains to you that the Fury is only able to use to those who are destined to fulfill the wish of its fairy. She then explains to you that she wishes you find 100 Furies in order to awake the Goddess. This is where your journey begins.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay overview:[/u][/b]\nWe could say that the gameplay of this game is divided into two very different genres. For me, the real meat of the game is the combat, which despite being somewhat repetitive, allows for a lot of different approaches due to the variety of abilities that you can use. Combat is turn based, and in each turn you move your character freely inside a circle and must get within range of the enemy in order to attack. If you get close to this outer circle you can attempt to escape the battle. You\u2019ll be able to to switch between Fencers on the fly, once you have more on your party, but doing so while in combat will end your turn. As you acquire more Furies, you\u2019ll also gain access to more fairies which you can use to increase your stats and get hold of more abilities. Not only that, but acquiring more Furies allow you to start working your way to free the Goddess, or the Vile God if you prefer, and will also enhance your fairy abilities.\n\nThe other part of the game plays pretty much like a kinetic visual novel, in which the player has no actual impact on the conversations and outcomes. That said, I find the dialogue to be rather amusing, if somewhat uninspired. If you\u2019re looking for a deep story, great plot and memorable characters you probably won\u2019t find that here. Still, I find the dialogue rather funny with the ocasional joke here and there, and most of the characters behave like teenagers which gives the game a less serious tone. Also, most of the main story dialogue is fully voice acted, while optional conversations are not.\n\nYou\u2019ll be spending a lot of your time revisiting [i]Zelwinds[/i] the main city in the game. Here you can go to different places and talk with random people. You\u2019re also able to buy and sell items, get side missions (kill & fetch quests) and acquire information about the whereabouts of the next Fury. Still, the city feels somewhat lifeless since everything happens through a menu screen. There is no depth to the places and to the different people you find there, they are pretty much there just for the sake of being there, and this made me care less about the actual game world.\n\nThere is also a world map where you can go to various different locations, such as dungeons. There you\u2019ll battle enemies and find varied items. Inside dungeons you can move freely and see enemies wandering, and if you manage to get in close and attack them you\u2019ll trigger an ambush and the battle will start, thus allowing to attack first. Of course, if the enemy gets the drop on you, you\u2019ll be the one getting ambushed. This is probably where I spent most of my time, grinding in dungeons to level up my characters and fairies, doing side quests, collecting items and selling them so that I could afford potions, etc. If you\u2019re not too fond of grinding, you might have a hard time later on with some enemies.\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b][list]\n[*]Good looking anime style visuals\n[*]Tons of customization and unlockables\n[*]Great soundtrack - featuring pieces from different musical genres\n[*]Fun turn-based combat - with tons of different abilities\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b][list]\n[*]Repetitive dungeons\n[*]Lifeless locations & bland NPCs\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Final verdict:[/u][/b]\nIf you\u2019re looking for a memorable story and unique characters you might want to steer away from this, unless you\u2019re a hardcore fan of the Neptunia games and the likes of Idea Factory. The story might be interesting for some people until a certain point, and most of the character reactions are rather predictable. Still, if you\u2019re looking for a solid RPG experience with a very robust turn-based combat system this might be something right up your alley. There are tons of unlockables for you to track down, and if you\u2019re into completing side quests there are always some for you to do. Thus, revisiting old dungeons will always yield some kind of reward.\n\n[b]Overall, I\u2019m enjoying my time with Fairy Fencer F, despite its flaws. If you\u2019re unsure it is worth the full price, grab it on sale.

Fairy Fencer F follows the usual game mechanics seen in the company's other titles, however, I feel Fencer is a notch above the rest of them. The story feels more structured, the music is pure nostalgia, and every character you encounter is memorable in their own right. The story is the usual JRPG fare, mixed with self-aware jokes that are perfectly timed, and plenty of dialouge to flesh out every character, as any good RPG should do. As someone who grew up playing games like Lunar and its sequal, Fencer felt right at home to me. This title is so enjoyable that even a second playthrough after the credit roll is worth it, just to find, synthesize and collect everything that was missing the first time around.

Not only is he blatantly broken in pretty much every moment of the game, his goofy attitude that made him even bearable in the first place get's replaced with a layered hardass-attitude that turns him from \"Happy-Go-Lucky\" into a \"Brooding\" Protagonist.\n\nLike Neptunia games, this game's combat system is flashy and all about unleashing special attacks that do a lot of damage. However, you honestly get to a point to where you cheese through everything anyways, so it doesn't matter much. \n\nThe story is meh.

However, it has a lot of untapped potential that bears mentioning-- potential that other games made by the same company might fulfill better.\n\nThe premise of the game is somewhat bland-- there's a good deity and an evil deity, they hate each other, and mortals want them revived. They can do this by collecting Furies, which are magic weapons scattered around the world. Mostly by accident, the main character Fang gets wrapped up in the plot because he unseals a Fury by accident.\n\nThe story is lighthearted for the most part, barely dipping into troubled territory later on. Expect a lot of self-referential humor and Anime Silliness sprinkled throughout, and enough fanservice to bear mentioning, but not enough to feel egregious. I got the feeling that the story was played very safely, barely deviating from several common anime tropes. While it was certainly done well enough, it wasn't really the strongest part of the game overall, especially later on when you must repeat several areas of the game.\n\nLocations are greatly varied, but none of them really stuck out to me, and the enemy design and overall art direction was also pretty standard anime fare. Expect a lot of reskinned enemies and common thematic areas-- the fire zone, ice zone, desert zone, windy zone, etc.. Overall, the setting works for the game, but like the plot it feels like it was just playing it safe. The best part of the locales is the World Shaping ability, which allows players to give unique effects to areas like increasing EXP gains and drop rates in return for losing HP gain or silencing spells.\n\nThe combat is the standout part of the game. You command a group of three Fury-wielding fighters, and take turns against your enemies on a 3D map. Characters can move within a circle around them and attack within a smaller range around them. If you've upgraded a Fury to do so, basic attacks can combo together for more damage overall, and since Furies are magical, they can shift their form to several different weapons. Most monsters have specific weaknesses to certain weapon types, and attacking these can chain together even more attacks from allies nearby. Attack animations are quick and flashy, with big effects and pronounced swings. Skills and Magic are also available, and are even flashier, with full-screen animations. However, while each character's skills and attack spells are unique, characters have at most 9 different skills and attack spells. Since some spells and skills are stronger than others, I found myself seeing the animations for the stronger skills (like Fang's Eruption Edge) over and over again later on, which made a flashy, cool animation somewhat mundane.\n\nCharacters can also Fairize, a transformation power that combines them and their weapon for more power. It's very flashy and changes the music, as well as making almost every encounter laughably easy. It also unlocks the use of an HP draining ultimate ability, but I rarely used these. Strangely, the devs decided to give every character a skill that they can use while not transformed that's more powerful and cheaper than the ultimate skill. This added up to more viewings of Eruption Edge, and more frustration. Characters also have a special ability, but to be honest, I never used these. They take a turn to toggle or use, and I usually felt that it was better to just deal damage.\n\nHowever, the combat is marred by its sheer volume. While it's easy to get from story point to story point, since characters join the party with effectively no training, if you get a new character you like, you have to stop and grind. Even with World Shaping to take the edge off, the grind will take up many hours of a standard playtime.\n\nAt a discount, Fairy Fencer F is a good purchase for JRPG fans. There's even DLC to raise the level cap by 900 levels for some reason (???).", "timestamp_created": 1459800173, "timestamp_updated": 1459800173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

Als es dann im Angebot war, schlug ich zu und bereue den Kauf in keiner Form!\n\n~Vorsicht! Diese Review ist in einigen Punkten mit Spoilern \u00fcbers\u00e4t~\n\n\n- Story -\nWas ist denn so schwer daran, Furies, Schwerter mit magischen Kr\u00e4ften versehend, zu sammeln, mithilfe dessen die G\u00f6ttin wiederzubeleben und dabei den Weltfrieden wiederherzustellen? Nun, Fang, der Protagonist, kam halbverhungert in einer Stadt an und bekam von Dorfbewohnern zu Ohren, dass wenn er dieses eine Schwert namens Fury aus dem Boden zieht, bekommt er einen Wunsch erf\u00fcllt. Diese Chance l\u00e4sst er sich nicht entgehen, dennoch als er es herauszieht erscheint Eryn, eine Fairy, die den Fang zum Fencer erkl\u00e4rt. Dieser jedoch will nur seinen Wunsch erf\u00fcllt bekommen: essen, essen und essen.\n\nEin richtiger M\u00fc\u00dfigg\u00e4nger und halbherzig darauf interessiert, was seine Aufgaben und Pflichten eines Fencers sind, zogen beide los nach Sol Plains, wo sich eine Fury aufhalten soll. Unterwegs begegnen sie Tiara, ein M\u00e4dchen, welches mit ihrem Tee Fang kurzzeitig l\u00e4hmt und es sich herausstellt, dass auch sie eine Fencer ist und hinter dem Fury her ist.\n\nNach einiger Zeit sto\u00dfen immer mehr eher merkw\u00fcrdige als auch epische Charaktere in deine Party als auch auf einige interessante Feinde wie z.B. Paiga von der Dorfa Company; ein Waschlappen, wie er im Buche steht.\n\nDie Wiederbelebung der G\u00f6ttin war so gut wie vollzogen, doch ein Kampf brach mit Soldaten der Dorfa Company aus und in diesem Durcheinander passierte es: Tiara wurde umgebracht. Wut staute sich in Fang an und als die G\u00f6ttin schlie\u00dflich wiederbelebt wurde, sprach er nur einen Wunsch aus: er will Tiara wiedersehen!\n\nEin kleiner Lichtblitz erfolgte und...\n\n__________________________\n\n- Charaktere -\nMir ist immer wichtig, dass Charaktere ihre eigenen Macken haben und sich auch sehr unterscheiden. Denn nur so ist das perfekte Chaos vorprogrammiert. Fang mit seinen unstillbaren Hunger, die masochistische Tiara, welche doch im Kerne ein nettes und liebes M\u00e4dchen zu sein scheint, Harley mit ihrer \"Schlampigkeit\" und Pippin. Achja, Galdo, welcher sich ein Vorbild an Fang angenommen hat und Ethel, eine ehemalige Assasine, welche es dank Fang geschafft hat, mehr als nur \"Kill\" zu sagen.\nEine recht durchgemischte und dennoch gut abgew\u00e4gte Gruppe, das muss man mal so sagen.\n(Ich wei\u00df, ich verga\u00df eventuell Charaktere, aber ich habe diese noch nicht freigespielt.) \n\n- Musik -\nThe Carefree Man. Mehr muss man echt nicht sagen, ist einfach gro\u00dfartig, der gesamte Soundtrack.\n\n- Grafik, Optik -\nAlles ist sch\u00f6n anzusehen, auch die Cutscenes sind wunderbar dargestellt, erinnert mich schon leicht an die Cutscenes aus Tales Of Symphonia DotNW. Schade nur, dass sich manche Dungeons so ein bisschen \u00f6fter wiederholen (same here, Nep-Nep...), aber trotzdem optisch sehr sehenswert.\n\n- Gameplay -\nDass man sich Combos, Spezialtechniken und Magie durch sogenannte \"Weapon Points\" freischalten muss, ist eine sehr gute und schicke Idee. Gef\u00e4llt mir sehr gut, auch die Idee mit der \"Transformierung\" und dass die Spezialtechniken daraus HP kosten, auch nett.\n\n- Wiederspielwert -\nAuf jeden fall! Auch wenn man die Story kennt, die Unterhaltungen zwischen den Charakteren sind Dinge des Spiels, die dazu anregen, es ruhig \u00f6fter mal wieder zu spielen und vor allem zu genie\u00dfen.\n\n\nRund um gibt es f\u00fcr mich nicht viel zu meckern, das Ending war auch toll und vor allem die K\u00e4mpfe dorthin waren jetzt nicht zu schwer, als dass man sofort einen One-Hit-Kill abbekommt oder so.\nAuch wenn das Spiel schoooon etwas l\u00e4nger h\u00e4tte sein k\u00f6nnen, kurz und knackig hat aber auch was, ne?", "timestamp_created": 1458037512, "timestamp_updated": 1458037512, "voted_up":

Nonetheless, the skills, magics etc were actually quite cool to use, but I also like the idea of the fury effect. It somehow made it easier to farm WP + Levels.\n\nBonus : Sequel?

"english", "review": "So, here we are again, another jrpg game...\n\nNow before I go into detail about certain game elements, I want to tell you that the recommandation is completely biased and you should try to decide for yourself if the game is worth the money or not. Also, you might've noticed I played this game for over 40 hours but I'm not reccomending it, and well, the reasons for that are explained below, if you want to read them.\n\nFirst of all let's start with the gameplay, it's the usual IF dungeon turn-based combat in which you have certain characters to select from and you make a party of maxium 3 and go beating up monsters and leveling, and all those other elements you'd expect to usually find in a rpg. The combat is alright, and the controls aren't that bad either, considering the guys that made neptunia made this it's bound to be good right...\n\nNext let's talk a little about the story and characters. The story is so blend it makes me puke, it's the usual bullshit there's an evil God and a good Goddess and you must revive the goddess and stop the guys who want to ressurect the God, and all that nonsense, seriously, the plot is also a mess, and they try to squeeze in all these elements inside just to cover up for certain plot holes. The easiest element that can do this for you: time travel... And the ending is exactly what you'd expect it to be if you have this kind of stories.\n\nWell, you might be thinking, okay, if the story is bad, maybe the characters might help. Well, the characters are so typical, and tehy're the sterotypes of anime, which is what I hate the most about games such as this, unoriginal character concept is seriously a turnaway. You've got a typical lazy mc who wants to do nothing, two main love interests a tsundere and a yandere, the usual loli, the big boobed chick that's there for fanservice and don't get me started on the fact that there's a cat that talks or whatever that thing is. Now, don't get me wrong, the characters are what they are but there is certain plot development.\n\nNext, let's go in detail about the music and voice acting. The voice acting is decent, I would say good, but that's still not enough to sell this game for what it is, considering the music feels repetitive and every song feels like the other, seriously I'd rather listen to my own songs than to the ingame music at some points.\n\nThe final element I'd like to talk about are the achievements, and how insensitive some of them are. Now don't get me wrong, getting the achievements is not a matter of skill but rather a matter of time in this game, with that being said there are a couple of achievements which are if not impossible, then they would take about a couple hundreds of grinding without using any dlc. And even with the dlc they would still take tens of hours to achieve.\n\nPluses:\n-decent gameplay\n-well implemented turn based combat\n-good voice acting\n-skippable animations\nMinuses\n-overused plot\n-stereotypical anime characters\n-repetitive music\n-mindless grinding\n\nAll in all Fairy Fencer F is not a bad game, neither a good one, it's in the middle and everyone can have an opinion about it. Seriously if not for the story and characters this would be a game to remember, but as it is of now, it's all about the grind, and even if you are to finish grinding you would still feel like you achieved nothing...\n", "timestamp_created": 1456670325, "timestamp_updated": 1456670325, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21521665": {"recommendationid": "21521665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276027693", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 2629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457238400}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5954\u7740\u753b\u98ce\u6765\u7684\uff0c\u753b\u5e08\u4e5f\u786e\u5b9e\u6ca1\u8ba9\u6211\u5931\u671b\u3002\n\u5267\u60c5\u5c31\u4e0d\u8981\u62b1\u592a\u5927\u671f\u5f85\u4e86\uff0c\u6211\u8ddf\u4f60\u8bf4\u6211\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u901a\u5173\u540e\u5c31\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u60c5\u2026(\u2299_\u2299;)\u2026\n\n\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\u8fd8\u7b97\u86ee\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u4e5f\u5bf9\u5f97\u8d77\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u94b1\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1456659073, "timestamp_updated": 1456659073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21521471": {"recommendationid": "21521471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159107016", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456658309}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e40\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34\u0e14\u0e15\u0e32\u0e21\u0e14\u0e35", "timestamp_created": 1456658483, "timestamp_updated": 1456658483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21516935": {"recommendationid": "21516935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278399312", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455193353}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5c31\u592a\u77ed\u4e86\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u90fd\u597d\u3002\u5267\u60c5\u5c31\u4e0d\u80fd\u7ed9\u4e2a\u5927\u56e2\u5706\u5417\uff1f\u4e8c\u5468\u76ee\u4e5f\u662f\u60ca\u559c\u8fde\u8fde\uff0c\u56de\u5408\u5236\u4e5f\u633a\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1456640646, "timestamp_updated": 1456640646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21510793": {"recommendationid": "21510793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118057251", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 2927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456603323}, "language": "english", "review": "Biggles!

few twists here and there which make it interesting enough.\n+ Story, while chock-full of tropes, is surprisingly engaging.\n+ Humor. I found some parts really funny.\n\nCons:\n- Progression system isn't something to write home about. It's tolerable, but not very engaging\n- Some game mechanics, while giving the impression of being related to story, really don't affect anything plot-related at all.

You're better off going in a straight line to the objective in every dungeon instead of looking for loot/monsters to kill. Side quests are practically worthless, rewards are ok but when you literally stomp every enemy your level (and then some) you don't really need to be careful when playing. For perspective, I had to play against enemies 2x my level to even get a sort of challenge, since I couldn't roflstomp enemy mobs then. So don't buy it for the gameplay.\n\nStory wise though it was fun. Funny to play through, has funny little bits of trivia that you can pick up while you're in town by other civilians, though those interactions are just going to a menu (kinda) and selecting characters to talk to.\nIgnoring the side stories, the main storyline is quite enjoyable. Only \"problem\" would be that it's not particularly deep in terms of character development, but that's irrelevant since it's pretty much a casual game to enjoy for say... 14 hours or so. \n\nCharacters also have weird challenges that you could grind if you wanted to, but those seem to be put in for those who wish to punish themselves. Like \"jump 10, 50, 100, 2000, 5000 times in a dungeon with <x> character\". And the reward for completing more and more jumps/attacks/whatever doesn't stack well, so eh. \n\n7/10, worth getting on sale. Not sure about full price though, since I'm fine with spending 7.99 for what I got, but full price of $30 is a bit much. I really would've liked a bit more depth to gameplay/story for more fun, but it's ok as it is.\n\nBuy on sale (like all games), grab the additional dlcs (get the ultimate armor pack to enjoy the OP playstyle faster), could skip the cosmetic sets though.", "timestamp_created": 1456397198, "timestamp_updated": 1456397198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21440329": {"recommendationid": "21440329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174467631", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457174007}, "language": "english", "review": "Crash with white screen.\nAnyone has a solution?", "timestamp_created": 1456390000, "timestamp_updated": 1456390000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21431734": {"recommendationid": "21431734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036036927", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456345929}, "language": "english", "review": "Writing this review right after I finished one of the 3 endings. \n\nFairy Fencer F is a really pleasant experience. \nThe story will drag you in, make you play trough all of it and after you finish it it will leave you asking for more.\nI must admit that there was not a single moment where i got bored while playing this game. The story was a truly wonderful experience.\n\nThe combat aspect in this game is rather challenging if you didn't use the weapons/armor provided by the DLC ( and if you waste your money on cosmetics and not potions or equipment, like i did ) \nBut in most dungeons you will end up spamming basic attacks and heals, at least when fighting against low-tier mobs. \nThe Boss fights were challenging most of the time and made me think of actually using some sort of strategy and forced me to even prepare for those battles beforehand. \n\nThe visuals in this game are what you would expect from a decent JRPG so nothing bad or special to comment on that.\n\nAnd the last thing to comment on was the character design and development.

Having grand aspirations on becoming something more than your  parents were, following your own path in life and trying to enjoy yourself within the best of your ability. You would run around at recess playing basketball or playing in the fake metal castle and jungle bars that you gotten hurt from time and time again. Coming home to a warm dinner and greeting your parent or parents and having them ask about your day. The polar opposite could occur, you could have been that weird kid that everyone use to avoid and the teachers didn't know what to do with, you would sit recursively in the corner of the cafeteria, and talk to yourself inside of your head. You would pack a lunch that you made yourself, or if you had lunch tickets that would have to satiate your appetite until the next day, because your family was too poor to offer you any type of sustenance.\n\nNo when you came home, it was usually to a house of yelling and throwing things, your mom could have been a junkie your dad an alcoholic and the many brothers and sisters you have, were all so fuck up beyond belief, they were never home. Your mom could have various men over to feed her habit, and sometimes these men would molest you, and so would your father after a stupor. This type of child had no chance in life. These children are brought into the world to do nothing but suffer. They play escapism in their minds to ease the pain that they are in. The only remedy for them would be to take them out of that hostile environment and place them with a truly kind family.\n\nChild 1 would exhibit some issues, but for the most part he would live a pretty decent life, giving the fact he/she would have the social skills and the support that they need to push on through. If not brought up properly they would proceed to become entitled and have this persisting narcissistic personality disorder. Nothing would ever be enough and everything that bad ever happened would be others fault.  So while both children would have these things in their minds growing up, child 1 for the most part would be extremely more likely to succeed instead of child 2, who would developed a multitude of mental illnesses, where they couldn't cope with for the rest of their lives. \n\nI have witnessed both of these things growing up, while attending school. You could always tell the children who were damaged and the children that had a pretty much life of leisure. I fall somewhere between child 1 and child 2, a mixture of real bad shit, and real good shit. A loving home, but also a broken home. A sheltered childhood, rampant with violence and chaos outside, filled with children growing up way to fast, and running dope on the street, like it's some sort of normalcy for them. My house was filled with a lot of fighting, arguing and general malignancy from many family members. A loving mother, grandmother and aunt, protecting me from the harms of the real world and the neighborhood. I spent most of my childhood indoors in front of the TV playing video games that my mom or grandmother would rent for me at blockbuster, I had a five dollar a week allowance that I could spend on whatever I wanted.\n\nWe were very poor, but we always had the lights on, food on the table, and a roof over our heads. My mother and grandmother would buy me the latest consoles even if I had to wait a bit, they would put layaway's and surprise me at birthdays and Christmas, my mom would write little sayings in my book bag for valentines day saying how much she loved me, and my grandmother would always cooked what I wanted for thanksgiving and Christmas. I had many good memories and many bad memories, but these three women always tried within the best of their ability to always make sure that I was always taking care of. I always had new clothes throughout the school year, and I always use to go to parks with my aunt because as said earlier the neighborhood was too bad to venture outside. I was hated throughout elementary school because I wasn't like most children. I use to get terrorized on the bus and made fun of because my hobbies included listening to music and playing video games. I was picked on for being overweight, and for being to proper and respectful.  Teachers were always antagonistic towards me, because I was the kid always questioning things, as to make them feel like it's more work for them, as oppose to enlightening a young mind.\n\nI would go through middle school and high school pretending to be something I am not. I would dress in my own style that consisted over various name brand clothing, I would always get the latest shoes  and colognes and I would put of this mask of someone who is wealthy and happy. I gave my mom and grandmother a lot of stress during this time, we didn't have the money to keep up this image and I would get into fights with them about it. I was popular, I hung out with people who made quadruple my mothers income, they would ride around in Mercedes and BMW, while my mom had this rinkydink Buick from the late 80s. I was ashamed of her jobs that she took to support me, and ashamed of where I lived and the cars that my family had. I tried everything to the best of my ability to make sure no one found out. I was loved, people knew who I was, they wanted to be me, they wanted to be able to be what I was. Girls were actually intimidated by me, come to find out later on, the reason I had such a hard time dating was because of the fact that these girls didn't think I would take it seriously and feared rejection.\n\nI'm not tooting my own horn, I began to hate what I have become, what I was, what I was turning into. It was fake, I was a fraud, I was everything every kid wanted to be in middle school and high school, but I was horribly depressed. Until one day I couldn't take it anymore, and It caught up to me. In the middle of high school I had an immunity disorder, for some unknown reason I would get sick every week. I missed more than a 120 days of school. I had bronchitis, mono, flu, strep, pulled groin, dislocated knee, walking pneumonia, I had it fucking all. During this time my grades were awful, I mean they always were terrible, but they really tanked. A little after summer, and after 9/11 I didn't attend school, I was majorly depressed and wouldn't leave my room, by this time I moved into a better neighborhood and things were a bit different. Like I said though, I stayed in my room all day and finally I was expelled for missing too many days. That was it, it was over, my so called friends forgot about me, and my popularity meant jackshit. I would suffer from this for an obscene amount of time.\n\nFrom that point on things didn't get better they just got worse and worse. At the end of 2011 I was hoping for a better year, I've been reclusive and working the job I still work at till this day that I hate, but at the end of 2011 I was hoping that I would finally have a good year, that this is the year that I would make a change. 2012 comes in, off to the same start as any other year, my grandmother had her 75th birthday, and I was as close as ever to her, till late March, where she got sick, she was hospitalized and had two mini strokes and passed away, 2013 would come and my uncle would be hospitalized with the same issues my grandmother had, he would last one more years and die in October of 2014. Every year since 2012 had been the worst years of my life, 2013 was particular horrible, but that's a bit too personal to get into, so lets just say it was just purely awful.\n\nIt's 2016 right now, and I am terribly unhappy, and have difficulty living each day.

You can easily explore the whole dungeon in just a few minutes\n- Boring, uninspired dungeons\n- Lack of challenge in combat\n- Pretty common, forgettable, short storyline \n\nIf you are looking for games where you can enjoy the story and character's interaction, you will enjoy this game. \nOverall, I give this game 7/10.

Fairy Fencer F is different in my opinion.\n\nIt's a turn-based rpg with a combat similar to Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth series and Mugen Souls. If you played those games you'll probably notice many familiar things. \nFairy Fencer actually has a lot more useful and polished features compared to Neptunia Rebirth series. While the game starts off simple, its core gameplay gradually gains more and more stuff. And I'm not talking about just crafting feature or sub-quests. There are unlockable combos, enemy weaknesses, team-attack system, character-unique actions, fairy card bonuses, etc.\n\nSure there is still quite a few in-game stuff which makes you wonder 'This could've been so much better if you added X', or 'Why did they not exploit this further?', or even 'This system doesn't make much sense.'\nBut all in all I wouldn't call it a wasted potential. \n\nThe game is not the best, but a very solid and enjoyable JRPG in my opinion.

"english", "review": "Conceptually, Fairy Fencer F would seem to be a return to the roots of the JRPG genre: a traditionally-styled game with a distinctly Japanese story and aesthetic. Consider the alliteration in Fairy Fencer F\u2019s title, which calls Final Fantasy to mind, or the game\u2019s development team, which includes composer Nobuo Uematsu and artist Yoshitaka Amano, both of Final Fantasy fame. How unfortunate, then, that Fairy Fencer F is no glorious return to the heyday of the JRPG, but rather a strange, distorted effort, terrifically fun in bursts but plagued by unfortunate technical issues.\n\nFairy Fencer F is the story of young warrior Fang and his fairy partner, Eryn. Fang's excessively cynical and derogatory attitude is likely to grate within mere minutes of starting the game, in which he constantly complains about his new path in life. You see, as the game begins, Fang is told by a shopkeeper that if he is capable of pulling out a strange sword embedded in a rock, he will be granted any wish he desires. All he wants is tasty food (a running obsession that becomes unfunny almost instantly), but, upon yanking out the sword, he is greeted by semi-amnesiac Eryn, told he is a legendary fencer, and asked to free the world's Goddess from her stasis by finding and using Furies, fairies trapped in mythical weapons. Fang\u2019s annoyance at having such a burden suddenly dropped on him is understandable, but his continued whininess and apathy is exceptionally irksome. Eryn is more likeable, though the moment another female appears on the scene she goes into (similarly unfunny) jealous-possessive-angry mode.\n\nFairy Fencer F's least irritating character.\nI soon met Tiara, a stuck-up, bratty fencer who harbors a genre-standard terrible secret. She also doubles as an exposition machine, teaching you about the plane beyond reality where the Goddess and evil deity are sealed and giving you a free inn to recover at--when she's not being bossy and condescending. Notice a theme here? The majority of Fairy Fencer F's cast was ripped straight from the pages of Anime Character Tropes You Can Implement Easily. Suffice to say, it takes a fair amount of time before a truly likeable character joins the troupe. Certain party members become more tolerable as time goes on, but it's hard to shake those awful first impressions.\n\nLayers of Fear Announcement Trailer\nCheck out this new psychedelic horror game from the Polish developer Bloober Team.\nSaddled with a party of people I would have liked to punch in the face given the opportunity, I ventured out into the exploration portion of Fairy Fencer F. Much to my relief, exploration and combat are a fair bit more energizing than watching barely-animated character cutouts complain to each other. Combat is turn-based with positioning elements: You and your enemies move around a small field and trade blows with each other, launching area-of-effect spells and utilizing strategic positioning to your advantage. The basics aren't tough to grasp, and as you earn more weapon points in battle, you can customize your stat boosts and add multi-hitting combo capabilities to your characters' strikes.\n\nThis kind of cringe-worthy dialogue is par for the course.\nThe majority of Fairy Fencer F's cast was ripped straight from the pages of Anime Character Tropes You Can Implement Easily.\nA neat addition to the formula is the tension gauge: as characters attack and use skills, their tension increases and multiplies the damage they deal. Once tension reaches a certain point, characters can \"fairize,\" transforming into quasi-robot-armored fighters with access to special, super-damaging techniques. However, playing overly defensively--using lots of healing items and spells, retreating from enemies, running away from battle--reduces the tension, and if it dips below a certain point, your combat efficacy will suffer. It's a neat system that makes the combat considerably more engaging. It's quite fast-paced, as well--the handy L2 button allows you to skip a lot of long-winded combat animations.\n\nYou can find new dungeons to explore at set points in the story, where you'll find some Furies to collect (along with the fairies that inhabit them and/or possibly another fencer). Once you've got a Fury/fairy combo, you can summon the pair to remove one of the binding blades sealing the Goddess and the Vile God. Doing so upgrades the abilities of the fairy, who can then either be assigned to one of your party members or to a dungeon via a process called \"world shaping.\" While the stat bonuses fairies can provide to party members are nothing to be sneezed at (and they also level up through combat), world shaping is particularly cool: by assigning a fairy to a dungeon, you also get persistent effects throughout that dungeon, i.e. an experience boost when defeating enemies. This helps make sub-questing less of an out-and-out grind, as it helps tailor some dungeon settings to your liking. The dungeon romping itself is also more engaging than developer Compile Heart's previous endeavors, with multi-level layouts and traps.\n\nThis still frame is only a little slower than the game's average frame rate.\nAs much as I enjoyed the fundamental combat and dungeon-crawling, it was sometimes difficult for me to enjoy them. In many of the dungeons, Fairy Fencer F suffers from an atrocious and varying framerate, frequently dipping into the sub-20 frames-per-second range. Compile Heart games tend to suffer from this problem, even though the visuals aren't terribly complex, but Fairy Fencer F is particularly awful, to the point where dungeon crawls can lead to motion sickness and headaches.\n\nThe irritating cast and miserable framerate dips aside, you must also contend with sudden difficulty spikes, recycled environments, and an inconsistent art style. Even the much-touted Yoshitaka Amano and Nobuo Uematsu\u2019s contributions are disappointing. Amano's contributions are a handful of art concepts, while Uematsu's--or more specifically, Uematsu's team of musicians, the Earthbound Papas\u2019--music is uneven; some tracks are absolutely fantastic, while others are entirely unmemorable. Yet there are glimpses of a game that could have been consistently entertaining: combat, when it's not running like a slideshow, is satisfying; there's a lot of customization available to the player; and that butt-rock theme that plays during fairizing is rousing in much the same way Uematsu's Blue Dragon boss music was.\n\nFairy Fencer F has its bright spots, but it's not a game I can heartily recommend--there's too much detritus to dig through in order to get to the fun bits. Compile Heart has announced a sequel, so here's to hoping the move to more recent hardware will solve their games\u2019 lingering technical problems--and here's to hoping the resulting games will be better as a result.\n\nDid you enjoy this review?\n\nFairy Fencer F\nFairy Fencer F / PC\n\nTHE GOOD\n Fun combat with a good amount of depth\n Lots of customization options to play with\n\nTHE BAD\n

that one's even more repetitive than the personas). You clear a level, go back to town, chat, clear a level go back to town and chat, all the way through the end.\n\nThe game is very easy and my god please play with the japanese voices, english ones will make you cringe every time you battle.\n\nWhat I really liked with this game is how fast the battles can be, since you can skip every single animations. In fact you can also skip every scenes. I made one playthrough(newgame+) and skipped most battles and every scenes and it took me 45 minutes to make it, lol.\n\nThe game has some really good ideas done right, but it just gets boring very fast, even though I personally enjoyed it. The battles lack some strategy and some better weakness/resist system, as well as the character developpement is meh; once you're mid-late game it kinda halts there. Music is all right and the level design is a joke.\n\nLate game; the characters are pretty much identical since they nearly got all the same stats, the only difference is the main character having some slight extras, and a few different spells here and there between the characters.\n\nFairy Fencer F also has plenty of side-quests and stuff, but it's really boring and pretty much identical to what you do in the storyline.\n\nWhen I first saw the battle system i thought: Wow it's like Grandia/chrono trigger! But it easily fell appart once you fully understand it. It's still decent though. But it lacks strategy.\n\nFor my experience, I'd rate it an 8 since jrpgs are my favorite genre of games, but I EASILY understand the metacritic score of 66. The game feels empty and unpolished.\n\nAlso crashed on a few occasions.\n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't pay more than 10$ for it.", "timestamp_created": 1455778384, "timestamp_updated": 1455778638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21286420": {"recommendationid": "21286420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045200386", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471123970}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing the story is amazing the combat is amazing and just this game overall is wonderful loved it from beginning to end and i bet anyone who plays this will say the same :D and there was parts that were hard but that just made it even better! i love a good challenge!

About a 20-25 hour playthrough. Lots of touching moments, plot twists, and other stuff that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Worth the 8.99 I spent on it, and wouldn't mind paying $30 for it. I'll be picking up Advent Dark Force for PS4 at full price when it releases. I doubt it will get one, but I really hope this game gets a (true) sequel, ADF is just a remake with some added content and endings, similar to how Neptunia has the the Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth remakes. Also, its much more well optimized compared to Re;Birth 1, whereas that game I get a framerate all over the place (on my laptop, haven't tried either of these on my desktop, due to some issues that will hopefully be resolved soon) FFF I usually get a constant 30 FPS. Controller support is great, played the entire game with a Steam Controller. \n\n+Overall story\n+Characters you'll love and get attatched to\n+Well optimized port, as well as controller support\n+Fantastic Dub, never switched to JP voices\n\n-Some moments in the story are a little silly, or should be explained better in my opinion\n-Certain area in the game where I had to grind for awhile, this could be the fact that I was underleveled prior to a boss, or the game just had a weird difficulty spike\n-Don't like to complain about the length, but I really wish this game was longer. 20-25 hours is a pretty decent amount of time for a game, especially today, but the devs should take this complaint as a compliment being that I loved every moment so much I wish it could just be a little longer.\n\nOverall, I would give this game 8.75/10. I'm sure I'll be doing another playthrough before I know it, somewhere in the near future. Thank you IFI for releasing this on PC, don't think I would have picked it up on my PS3. Again, I bought this game on sale, but I would easily pay full price for it, on PC or PS3. I'll pay $60 for Advent Dark Force on PS4 when that comes out too. I'm glad I played this game, just goes to show what masterpieces JRPGs can be. Even if this game doesn't have as much of a budget as your Final Fantasy, Persona, whatever you like, its such a different experience from other games I've played and I might even put it up there as one of my Top 20 games. This review was all over the place due to me forcing myself to write it at 4 AM, right after completing the game, but thanks for reading.

had fun with it but I know why.\n\nIf you aren't used to JRPG style turn based and/or don't particularly enjoy the whole 'anime' vibe, you probably won't get huge amounts from this game.\n\nHaving not really played any previous JRPG games, the turn based combat was something it took me a while to get used to but it's not the worst.\n\nThere's depth but the game clearly hasn't had a huge budget as seen from repetetive level designs re-using assets, constant repeating of levels for side-quests and monsters that are hilariously out-of-place at times.\n\nI had fun with it though.

If you're a fan of J-RPGs and romance anime, you'll surely love this game. TL;DR down below.\n\nThroughout the entire game, you are given a good amount of characters to choose from with more in the later parts of the game. As you progress further into the story, a bit of farming may be needed as enemies become more and more tough to deal with, but as a J-RPG it was already expected. The mechanics of the game maybe a bit tacky and confusing at first, but eventually it becomes easier as you continue to play. \n\nNow, the story was probably one of the best stories I've ever experienced in video games. Each part of the dialogue does its job well, when you need to be happy or laugh, you are met with corny jokes and ridiculous events, but when you need to feel for the characters in the game, you will without a doubt feel the sadness they show. Honestly, as you continue playing the story, you will become immersed and will develop a love for each and every character you play as. Hell, maybe you'll love some characters who you don't even play as. \n\nNext, the replayability potential is high as there are four different routes you may choose from and because there is also a new game+ type system where your stats from your previous run will be brought over to your next run and don't worry, the enemies won't get easy because of this. \n\nFinally, if you actually read all the way here, I give my thanks for doing so and for considering to buy this beautiful, funny and amazing game. I was truly surprised by how much I loved playing this game and regretted for not getting it sooner. As a gamer, I know that some people are out here to buy only one game and that there are many games to choose from. Believe me, I had high doubts when I first bought it since I was entirely new to the J-RPG genre in general. But, this game has been a blast to play through and I wish more people could experience it. Idea Factory truly have outdone themselves with this game.\n\nAs it stands, I have finished this game and no longer have a purpose to play it once more. Not having a reason to see my favorite characters again, truly made me sad. But, their sequel is coming and I hope it will live up to its predecessor.\nI, as an avid gamer, am looking forward to the next sequel Idea Factory is releasing and hope to see my favorite characters once more.\n\ntl;dr: Beautiful, amazing and funny.

Before I bought this game, I did some research, watched a few gameplays, poked about on information here and there and wasn't able to really gain much interest into wanting to play/ let alone buy it. However, during that time, I was quite bored and wasn't able to acquire or find the entertainment I was seeking in the games I played prior to this one. Thus I decided to give this game a chance, after all, I believe that you can't simply take the viewpoint or words of another and deduce instantly what the game itself holds or has in store for yourself. This game did not disappoint. The compelling storyline and diverse characters were what really captivated my interest throughout the game, and I cannot simply forget the complex fighting schematics involved. Regardless of how the combat might become quite repetitive after awhile, It simply never became a problem for me, I never tired nor grew old of viewing the same skill sets, nor felt weary of farming for a little while on some dungeon for a few minutes to an hour. I just played the game as it was, and was happy for how it is. Sure some of the graphics could have been better, or whatever else people would talk about afterwards, but I found this game to be good precisely how it was made, and am happy to have spent my X hours playing this game.

Some are really rude\n- Switches between 3D and 2D\n- Reminded me of Kingdom Hearts at first glance\n- Get stabbed to unlock your power\n- The main character likes sleep and food. Easiest time I've had connecting to a character \n- DLCs can be turned off, because the DLC gear is so OP, especially for beginngers\n- Simple, so you don't have to think so hard about playing this. Give the gamer brain a break\n\nMy Cons:\n- Some characters are extremely irritating. \n- Lots of dialogue scenes (skip became my best friend) \n- 3D camera felt awkward at times, either hovering too high or too low behind the character, Wish it was a tad further back to have a wider range of view\n- Hooking up my PS4 controller was annoying. Might not be a game problem but it interrupts the game flow when the controls get 'stuck'. I've read that other people have this problem too. Sucks right? \n- Very simple, so don't get this for the challenge\n\nMix:\n- After playing Skyrim, the turn-based combat was irritiating for a long while. Also, as with most turn-based combat, it can get stale and repetitive. Luckily, it's pretty. \n\nAs my second Anime game, it's far more enjoyable that the first one I ever played. I want to get stronger, unlock more, collect all the furies, and free the lady. So that's a good thing right? It makes me want to do those things and keep playing. \n\n(PS I did get this game on Sale with all the DLCs so that may have sweetened my attitude towards it)", "timestamp_created": 1454494052, "timestamp_updated": 1454494052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20927820": {"recommendationid": "20927820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093364045", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510538786}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic storyline and visually stunning.

You breathe a sigh of relief\nas you close your eyes on the couch, with the\nerratic weather outside  shifting from rainy to \nsunny, as if in sync with Summer-Rain's own\nname and temperament. You glance over to your \nphone and thumb through, seeing Mrs. Novocaine's\nmessage from the time of Melody's Escape.\n\nWondering why she wanted to talk suddenly, you\nopen and see a long message about how so much\nhas changed for her and she wishes to try to\nreconnect with you, and that she might have made\na terrible mistake. You turn off your phone's screen,\ndisgusted. Booting up your computer, something\ngreets you on the store page with petticoats,anime\nand swords.\n\n[b]FAIRY FENCER F.[/b]\n\nRaising an eyebrow, you click [i]'buy'[/i]. Minutes later,\nyou're in a land of sword-and-sorcery with a vague\nhint of technology, and as you progress through the\nsurprisingly riveting and engaging story, guides and\nwalkthroughs describe how Fairy Fencer F has links\nto the [i]Hyperdimension Neptunia[/i] games. \n\nThe story, in all its bright technicolor anime glory,\nis more than serviceable, with a healthy selection of\nwaifus who serve as weapon upgrades (!), so much\nso that you find yourself lost in the semi-open world\nas well. You explore the world as the selfish slacker\n[b]Fang[/b], 'duped' to become a [i]Fencer[/i], a warrior using\nwaifu-weapons, such as his Fairy-weapon-waifu [b]Eryn[/b].\n\nAlong the way, you meet the stunning, highbrow, \ngothic-lolita [b]Tiara[/b], another Fencer who is manipulative,\ncunning and a closet sadomasochist, together with the\nbuxom [b]Harley[/b] and the mysterious, mecha-commanding\n[b]Galdo[/b]. The quest is a simple one where the story takes\nunexpected turns- the Fairies need to be collected and\ntheir power harnessed to reawake a Goddess chained \nafter an apocalyptic battle, but things might be more\nthan they seem.\n\nYou fall asleep as you pull out the sixth Fairy sword \nfrom the Goddess's body in the underground vault,\nbefore waking up to what you realize is your head\non two soft thighs and the strong scent of \nstrawberries.\n\n[i]\"...Summer... I can explain...\"[/i] You stir, before seeing\nSummer-Rain's perfume bottle on the table in front\nof you. You stop dead in your sentence, knowing\nthat she doesn't make it a point to show off things\nlike Tiara or Ms. Novoc-\n\n[i]\"Morning.\"[/i] The soft voice says while you turn in her\nlap, the burnished afterscent of cigarrettes being\nmasked by the strawberry perfume. Your face turns\ninto one of intense indignation. [i]\"Novocaine.\"[/i]\n\n[i]\"Starboy. I... We need to talk.\"[/i]\n\n[i]\"YOU need to talk, but not me.\"[/i] You are about to\nleap out, but at that instant, Summer-Rain walks in\nthe living room, busy with a box of cake and a tub\nof ice cream to celebrate the end of the term. Your\nblood runs cold, and Mrs. Novocaine looks livid.\n\nSummer-Rain stares at the both of you, having\ndropped everything. [i]\"...Starboy....?!\"[/i] Summer-Rain\nbegins, her lip shaking and her eyes filling with tears.\n\n[i]\"Summer...! I was playing Fairy Fencer F, and- and- \nI can explain!\"[/i] Mrs. Novocaine looks at the both of\nyou before she grabs your arm, snuggling up to you\nand giving Summer-Rain a bitchy look. [i]\"Yes...! DO\nexplain, hun!\"[/i] Your blood turns to block ice when\nyou hear the pet name that Ms. Novocaine used to\ncall you. \n\n[i]\"You have ten seconds to explain yourself!\"[/i] \nSummer-Rain demands, shaking. You realize the\nsituation is delicate, especially after all that has\ntranspired these last few days. Novocaine wanting\nyou back. Summer-Rain by your side. The universe\nis still turning somehow, despite these two living\nGoddesses vying for power over you and your\nheart. Your two Fairies.\n\n[i]\"I was playing Fairy Fencer F and fell asleep from\nthe exhaustion of the exams when I woke up to\nfind my head in Ms.- I mean Mrs. - Novocaine's\nlap, and I was about to tell her to get out when\nyou came in!\"[/i] You blubber, as Summer-Rain burns\nholes through you with her death stare.\n\n[i]\"No hun! Didn't you enjoy our little reunion after\nall this time...?! Didn't you like playing with-\"[/i]\n\nSummer-Rain screamed then, and screamed all\nkinds of profanities that you never thought she,\nor any other woman would even utter. All this\nvitriol and bile she had was built up over the\nyears, and now she was letting Mrs. Novocaine\nreally have it. Mrs. Novocaine fell silent and\nwhen it was finally over, she left without a word,\nclicking the door shut behind her, leaving both\nyou and Summer-Rain looking at each other in\nstunned silence.\n\n[i]\"I thought you'd never believe me...\"[/i] You say,\nbreaking the silence after finally meeting her\neyes. Both of you are close to crying, realizing\nhow much you truly love one another.\n\n[i]\"I'm not her, Starboy.\"[/i] She says, reminding\nyou of how Ms. Novocaine always gave you\ntrouble when it came to faith. [i]\"Ice cream's\nmelting. Gimme some help-\"[/i] You ignore \nSummer-Rain's deadpan way of trying to gloss\nover the situation and rush to give her a hug.\n\n[i]\"I love you, Summer.\"[/i] You whisper. She hugs\nyou back tighter, not wanting to let go.\n\n[i]\"I know, Starboy. I know.\"[/i]\n\n[b]FAIRY FENCER F.[/b]\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1454395960, "timestamp_updated": 1454395960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530736", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20905736": {"recommendationid": "20905736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144798449", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495895576}, "language": "french", "review": "c'est un jeux super j'ai kif\u00e9 srx c'est le melleur jeux jamais cr\u00e9e au monde je veux une suite de cette serie svp \u2665 et je veux que cette serie se finisse jamais aussi *^* \u2665\n", "timestamp_created": 1454385824, "timestamp_updated": 1454385824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20904171": {"recommendationid": "20904171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156819556", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 1421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485220883}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u952e\u9f20\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c4e\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u624b\u611f\nxboxone\u624b\u67c4\uff0c\u5c4e\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u624b\u611f\n\n\u62ff\u4e86\u4e2a\u5317\u901a\u7684xbox360\u624b\u67c4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7adf\u7136\u80fd\u73a9\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u679c\u4e00\u4e2a\u73a9\u5bb6\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u624b\u67c4\u5462\uff1f\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5dee\u8bc4\u6211\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6539\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1454376755, "timestamp_updated": 1454427791, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438650", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20901028": {"recommendationid": "20901028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100887629", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445817791}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game and its something pretty fresh to the RPG genre.

Its one of many modern Jrpgs that focuses more on style than substance. The two minute long video on the store page is testament to this. Its not a game for everybody, but those who like this sort of thing will probably enjoy Fairy Fencer F.\n\nHere's a pro/con list of some things I noticed while playing the game.\n\nPro:\n-The battle system can be very flashy and exciting\n-There is lots in the way of equipment, items to keep you scouring the game\n-The female characters are pretty hot (Yes its a video game but the characters adequetly represent the image of beauty by which they were designed)\n\nCon:\n-The dialogue is terrible. Its just bad. I suppose you might enjoy it if you're a diehard anime fan or teenager. But as someone who prefers dialgue that is both well-written and engaging I found this to be unbearable.\n-The main character is on-par with the most annoying characters in Jrpg history (right up there with Squall and Tidus)\n-There is little in the way of exploration or engaging interaction with the world. You pick an area, go into a dungeon, deal with random cutscenes filled with nonsequitor dialogue then head back to the hub screen. There are no towns, no npcs living in the world, no depth or quirkiness to establish the world as anything more than the 2D backdrop for all the fluff and nonsense this game calls a story.\n\nI'd keep playing this game if I had nothing else to play ONLY because the combat can be mildly enjoyable in short bursts. It is ABSOLUTELY not worth the retail price. Even at 70% off (8.99) I'm hesitant to recomment a purchase.

Every bit of design - art, music, animation, game designs - is INTELLIGENT and comes together sensibly. To give an easy example, you know how in some JRPGs, the animation times for your most powerful attacks can sometimes get tiresome because it just makes the battle TAKE SO LONG!? Well in Fairy Fencer, nearly all of them feel quick and snappy. With some notable exceptions, the game treats your time with respect. Dungeons never overstay their welcome and fights are quick and to the point, perhaps even too easy. Additionally, the voice acting is surprisingly solid, the dialogue is rather witty, and visuals are colorful and eye-catching. The characters may be heavily based on anime & RPG tropes, but they're all likeable in their own way (and the ones who aren't turn out to be villains har de har).\n\nSo I do thoroughly recommend this game, but with a couple pieces of advice. There's some \"quests\" that require rather onerous item grinding and there's a character that can only be unlocked if you're a certain level which requires some more grinding. I'm a bit of a reluctant completionist and so ended up doing these. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't. They don't appreciably advance the story and, in fact, make the game too easy. The result was that I finished with less excitement and joy than I otherwise would have. Unless you plan on beating the game 2x, I'd avoid the grinding. But then if you're gonna beat it 2x anyway, why worry about the grind the first time?", "timestamp_created": 1453961656, "timestamp_updated": 1453961656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

I've made a review of that game too, so if you're curious go to my profile and read it.\nFairy Fencer F was a game that I bought shortly after R2, and paid full price. At first, I thought it was just a simplified copy of R2 and I left the game on the side for months. A week ago, I chose to give a chance to the game, and I'm really glad that I did, because it was a unexpected awesome journey.\nLet's talk about the combat first: It's a turn-based JRPG, but you can move in your turn. Each character has a different attack range, and you move in your turn to reach the enemies to attack.  You can attack normally, use skills, magics, itens, escape, activate each characters special condition or Fairize. This last command can be activated when your tension gauge is full and it lets your character make a fusion with your fairy, making you temporally stronger and activating some special skills.\nThe normal attacks, unlike R2, only hit one enemy, despite the range of the weapon. Speaking of weapon, since your fairy is your weapon, you can boost the atributes and unlock skills, magics and normal attacks. For example, you can raise the amount of normal attacks you can perform in your turn, unlike R2 where all characters can attack 4 times and there is no ''skill tree'' to unlock.\nYou will collect more than 20 fairies in the game, and you can equip them to each character to make a resonance effect, and create some new abilities or boost some attributes in the equipped character. Since the story of the game talks about the battle of the Evil God vs the Godless, you can go to a certain shrine where both are pierced by many swords of different ranks, and you can use fairies of the matching rank to take away that sword in a battle and create a shaping effect on your fairy. This shapping effect will buff or debuff certain attributes or skills in the dungeons and some even change the enemies of those dungeons. \nEach character has some kind of achievement to complete, like ''Walk 1000m as the leader'' or ''Win 10 battles without taking damage''. Those achievements will raise stats like Agi, Str, HP, SP, etc. It's something that it's not present on R2 but it's now present on R3.\nLeaving the combat mechanics behind, let's talk a little about the story and character development. Since Fairy Fencer F it's from the same creator as Hyperdimension Neptunia, and Neptunia it's a game with a lot of jokes, without taking itself too seriously (except if you take a specific route in R2 that it's dark as fuck), I was expecting the same here, and when the main character first appeared, I thought this game would be a bad copy of Neptunia. At first, Fang is basically an idiot and I wasn't liking the character in the first hours.\nBut the game managed to surprise me with one thing: character development. Soon, Fang starts to get more mature and the events around him force him to change. This is another crucial difference from R2: the story is way more serious. There will be blood, deaths and regrets. As the story progresses, even the way Fang talks change, reflecting his own change. There are three endings: the Normal End and two endings, one for each girl. I will not tell who they are. I've only got ''A girl ending'' but the romance felt convincing and I really cared if they would manage to stay together in the end, which is a surprise, giving that most games have bad developed character interactions and romances. Unfortunately, not all characters are developed and I didn't care about some of them in the end. There's one in specific that I think it's very stupid (Pippin), and ironically you can use him as a weapon in R2. \nOh, there is another surprise too: the OST. The songs are awesome. Check them out on youtube.\nBut there are a few bad things, for example. there's just little world customization compared to R2, and less endings too compared to R2. The enemies are repetitive, only changing colors as they grow stronger, and some dungeons are repetitive too. Those are the same problems of R2, but I felt that there's only a few original enemies in Fairy Fencer F compared to R2. I missed some events and characters, but I don't feel like playing it again to complete what I missed, unlike R2 where I beat the game 3 times. \nThat said, with it's great story, character development, combat mechanics and progression and an awesome OST, Fairy Fancer F is worth full price, and it's a game that I will always remember with care. If you like this genre, go ahead and buy it.

I failed as I see\n\n[u]Emotional part:[/u]\n\nAh where should I start..\n\nAt first I thought: \"This will be a basic like RPG storyline nothing to be so amazed about\" but luckily I was wrong and I can totally understand that ~92% positive rating. The charatcers were the basics: The funny one, The hero, The need to be saved one, etc.. but they something plus which I can't put in words. The story as I mentioned were great but I won't pin-point it out because that would be a spoiler and rule #1 no big spoilers in reviews ;) It stars as you would expect to start but It becomes better turst me. So just wait and see ;)\n\nAs I played this game I never felt like I should put this down. Something always moved me to go back and fight and play this game.There were some \"WTF?! Are you serious?!\" moments in both meanings and some \"Oh ffs\" in both meanings aswell :D . Maybe these were the ones that kept me moving, because maybe I couldn't belive they were seriously about that. But as I played more and more I eventually finished this game (for once atleast) and I feel sad.... There's no more... It's over... Althought the ending is great, It's still over. It was a great journey I want to relive it again like I played it for the first time.\n\nYou can ask my friends, 90% of it (who know me well) will say that I'm not that emotional type of guy who cry on every death or etc. I'm the exact opposite, you can almost say I'm dead inside emotionally, but this game made me \"feel\" on some points...( Not like crying or etc. , but you can figure out what I mean. )\n\nI COULD write more stuff like this, but I WON'T it would take a novel and you are here a review. (And it would get akward... :D )\n\n[u]In short:[/u]\nGreat game, great story, great characters and DEFIENETLY worth the money (DLC not necessary to the game it just plus items and dungeon, but you won't get more in the story if you don't buy them) 9/10 because of the small bugs and problems, but one of the best games I played so far. Love it <3 CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE NEW GAME COMING OUT\n\n[u]BEGINNER'S GUIDE:[/u]\n1. When you get a character use your points for the LEARNING skill. Trust me I had to struggle without it AND it will help alot in the late game. No spoilers :)\n2. Upgrade your teammates aswell in both skills and items (SPOILER [spoiler] Expect Lord Sherman, trust me... Ok No more spoilers [/spoiler]\n3. I suggest to you to focus on the main storyline, because you can acidentally trigger an alternative ending. (Like I did -.-+ )\nYou can find further help [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545335863]HERE[/url] , but it includes some spoilers (and also an achievement guide) , so finish the game first atleast once ;)\n4. The cards: I like them but I don't suggest to go further then Level 2 in the badges, only IF you especially love one character. The Foil cards: yeahhh now thats a different story..... In overall they cost 12 or more dollars and the game cost app. the same. If you REALLY REALLY intend to get it or you just really liek that character I won't stop you but you won't get you mony back. Backgrounds: Simple clean, great. If you hit the jackpot you get a 3 dollar background which is the best in my opinion and also MONEYYYY $$$$$, Emote icons: Well you decide\nMore info [url=www.steamcardexchange.net/index.php?gamepage-appid-347830]HERE[/url]\n\nWell that's it folks :) If you read it through I would appreciate a rating cause this is my very first long review :)\n\nSPECIAL THANKS:\nZozo_500 for gifting me this great game as a christmas present :) You da best :)", "timestamp_created": 1452822262, "timestamp_updated": 1454546613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545276", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20532004": {"recommendationid": "20532004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039651852", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456250797}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game", "timestamp_created": 1452820078, "timestamp_updated": 1452820078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500159", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20529790": {"recommendationid": "20529790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057219226", "num_games_owned": 481, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 6841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465933572}, "language": "english", "review": "Fairy Fence F remedies succesfully every disappointment Hyper Dimension Neptunia Re;Birth2 caused.", "timestamp_created": 1452809315, "timestamp_updated": 1454166258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20522037": {"recommendationid": "20522037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120649118", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454577828}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f", "timestamp_created": 1452779289, "timestamp_updated": 1452779289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20518227": {"recommendationid": "20518227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141306163", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 5215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455164142}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5178\u578b\u7684\u65e5\u5f0fRPG\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u65b9\u9762\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff1f\u4e0d\u8fc7PC\u7248\u5e76\u4e0d\u5168\u3002\n\u8bf4\u4e00\u4e0b\u65e5\u5f0fRPG\u548c\u6b27\u7f8eRPG\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u65e5\u5f0fRPG\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5f88\u4f4e\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u4e3b\u89d2\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u638c\u63e1\u53cd\u6d3e\u7684\u751f\u6740\u5927\u6743\uff0c\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u662f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u8981\u662f\u80fd\u8ba9\u73a9\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u5c31\u66f4\u597d\u4e86\uff08\u6977\u6a21\u6216\u53db\u9006\uff0c\u9053\u5fb7\u70b9\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u53cd\u6b27\u7f8eRPG\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5927;\u4e0d\u8fc7\u80cc\u5305\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u70b9\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6211\u8fd8\u662f\u559c\u6b22\u65e5\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u6b27\u7f8eRPG\u6280\u80fd\u57fa\u672c\u662f\u70b9\u4e0d\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u65e5\u5f0f\u51e0\u4e4e\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u70b9\u6ee1\u3002\u8fd8\u6709\u6b27\u7f8eRPG\u7684\u80cc\u5305\u592a\u5c0f\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8bf4\u4e3a\u4e86\u5199\u5b9e\u3002\n\u8bdd\u8bf41\u4ebf\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u771f\u96be\u505a\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u666e\u901a\u7ed3\u5c40\u90a3\u4e2a\u6210\u5c31\u662f\u600e\u4e48\u56de\u4e8b\uff0c\u603b\u6709\u88ab\u725b\u5934\u4eba\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u3002\n\u8981\u6211\u6765\u8bf4\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u662f\u53ea\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u8c08\u8bdd\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u80fd\u6709\u9009\u9879\u5c31\u66f4\u597d\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1452754798, "timestamp_updated": 1452754798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20514376": {"recommendationid": "20514376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046962626", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 6736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518665229}, "language": "english", "review": "A turn based JRPG.

The game play is very similar to Hyper-dimension Neptunia and take the role of a third person turn based RPG. The level grinding in the game never got to tedious and each battle did require some strategy and the characters equipment and move customisation took quite a lot of thinking, you could also put certain effects on the dungeons which put even more thought into what to do. The story is overall very engaging a throws some unexpected curve balls that even I, an avid anime fan and RPG player didn't see coming, which should be commended. The humour in Fairy Fencer F should also be praised, it had me laughing quite a few times. The characters are one of the best parts of the game, the main character, Fang's character development was really incredible as he retains his attitude but at the same time turns into an empathetic character who genuinely cares about his friends. The other characters such as Tiara and Eryn get little to no character development (excluding Ethel, best girl) but are still funny, admirable and relatable, you really do come to care about these characters. The music was also overall good though some tracks did start to lose some appeal after a while they still remained decent to listen to. There is also a fair amount of stuff to do after you finish the game and is impossible to do everything in one play through. Okay I've talked this game up enough time to delve into it's flaws.\n\nFirst of all the difficulty, in my first play through I completed the game in about 32 hours during that time I died twice. For clarification one of those times was because I wasn't paying attention to the game and did one battle too many while EXP grinding. As long as you aren't a complete idiot and pay attention this games difficulty isn't that high and overall isn't the most challenging though I'm an RPG veteran. Secondly, there was a point where they say you have to pull all the swords out of goddess to unseal them and then they completely forget about it and it has no impact on the ending. Thirdly, the ridiculous hidden characters/fairies, as an RPG I understand secret characters are going to be difficult to unlock but Lola's requirements are really unforgiving as you need to complete all of her side quests, which are really easy to miss. For the two S-rank fairies I have no issue but one particular A-rank fairy, Dohn, is completely asinine much worse than Lola. To unlock him you need to do a  pub request that only appears when you haven't completed a certain dungeon and you have to complete it immediately and you get it after you complete the dungeon. Now you might think that's not so bad but allow me to provide some context, you get given no signs that you get this fairy after completing this request, the quest is only available for a short while when you haven't completed a dungeon so you are viable to miss it. Adding onto the chance of missing it is the fact that pub requests barely offer any good rewards for completing them and most of the time you won't have requests high up on your priorities. All of this culminates in a fairy that even harder to get than the S-ranks.\n\nI think that this game is for casual gamers who haven't got all the time in the world but can spare a couple hours a week to play this game. It's funny, engaging and entertaining.\nOverall, a good game.", "timestamp_created": 1452614549, "timestamp_updated": 1452615015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.996669", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20480565": {"recommendationid": "20480565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098639783", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455142506}, "language": "english", "review": "For anyone on the fence about this game, it's your typical RPG-turn style fight kind of game with the ability to modify dungeons a little bit.

While the replayability is kind of low in my opinion (the 2nd playthrough thing is completely useless) and some of the secrets you won't even have a chance to think about unless you knew it was coming, but the characters are fun, the skits are really funny and of course, the Fan-Service isn't too bad. Multiple endings mean you'll have to play the game at LEAST 3 times before you see everything, but it's still a fun game.\n\nIf there was one thing I really didn't like about the game, it's the amount of time you have a particular party member in your group for. I know there are games where you lose your party members if you're not careful, like in most Fire Emblem games, but this was a little ridiculous.\n\nOther than that, it's a fun game.

Il problema \u00e8 che c'\u00e8 solo un tesoro nascosto per area, il che vi far\u00e0 fare dentro-fuori dai dungeon molte volte, se volete craftare certe cose, la cosa sicuramente giova per quelli che vogliono farmare un po' di livelli ma dopo un po' ti assale la stanchezza.\n\n- Il fatto che ricominciando la partita in New Game +, i nemici non diventeranno pi\u00f9 forti rispetto alla partita precendente, perci\u00f2 nei primi momenti molti nemici saranno un 1-shot-city.\n\nDetto questo, se sapete l'inglese, vi consiglio questo gioco assolutamente, sia che abbiate giocato ad altri J-RPG sia che sia la vostra prima esperienza.", "timestamp_created": 1452089999, "timestamp_updated": 1452095355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20350417": {"recommendationid": "20350417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156610782", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454939701}, "language": "english", "review": "- Fried Rice Simulator\nTeach you how to spell Fried Rice with \"Z\" in it\n\n- Nepgear Simulator\nWith diff personality thou.

Aber nun gut, fangen wir an.\n\n[h1]Genre:[/h1]\nFairy Fencer F ist mit Sicherheit ein klassisches Beispiel des JRPG Genre. Wir lesen recht viel Dialog, machen einzelne Missionen und lesen noch mehr Dialog. Man k\u00f6nnte es schon glatt als Visual Novel durchgehen lassen, g\u00e4be es nicht das Kampfsystem.\nWer bis dato keine Erfahrungen in dieser Richtung gemacht hat, wird mit Fairy Fencer F [b]sicherlich nicht gl\u00fccklich[/b] und sollte hier aufh\u00f6ren zu Lesen. Es gibt andere Spiele, die deutlich besser zum Einstieg geeignet sind, wenn man sich mit dem Genre JRPG oder Visual Novel befassen m\u00f6chte.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nIch w\u00fcrde behaupten, dass die Story bei Fairy Fencer F sehr generisch gehalten ist.\nVor Urzeiten, bekriegten sich die G\u00f6ttin, die alles Gute verk\u00f6rpert und der finstere Herrscher, der alles N\u00f6se verk\u00f6rpert aufs \u00c4u\u00dferste. Dabei benutzen sie die sogenannten Furys, (Eigenname f\u00fcr Schwerter) und letztendlich haben sie sich gegenseitig aufgespie\u00dft und versiegelt. Einige Furys verfehlten ihr Ziel jedoch und landeten auf der Erde, wo sie fortan darauf warten von der richtigen Person gefunden zu werden.\nNun wechselt die Story von diesem dramatischen Hintergrund, auf unseren k\u00fcnftigen Protagonisten Fang der durch die Stra\u00dfen schlendert und Hunger hat. Ein einfacher Stadtbewohner sagt im Scherz, dass wenn er das Fury Schwert dort hinten ziehen kann, ihm die dort drin gefangene Fairy jeden Wunsch erf\u00fcllen kann. Er zieht das Schwert nat\u00fcrlich ohne Probleme und so kommt es zum schicksalshaften Treffen zwischen Eryn und Fang, die nach einer kleinen \"Zusammenrauf\" - Phase losziehen, um alle verbleibenden Furys zu Sammeln und die G\u00f6ttin wiederzuerwecken.\n\nErst ab Mitte des Spiels hat man dabei einen gewissen Plottwist, der sich aber eher auf die Charaktere auswirkt, als auf die Story.\n\nIst die Story deswegen schlecht ? Nein. Nur wie gesagt ist sie eben auch nichts Besonderes. Es ist einfach eine \"normale\" Story, f\u00fcr das Genre.\n\n[h1]Charaktere:[/h1]\nDiese sind allesamt, wie aus einem Anime herausgeschnitten. \n\n[list]\n    [*]Fang - faul,gefr\u00e4\u00dfig / besitzt aber ein gutes Herz und ist ernst, wenn es darauf ankommt\n    [*]Eryn - pflichtbewusst und st\u00e4ndig Fang am Kritisieren, weil er kein \"guter\" Fencer ist\n    [*]Tiara - die masochiste, verzogene Prinzessin mit tragischer Vergangenheit\n    [*]Harley - der \"Plot\" in diesem Spiel und ist diese zerstreute und sorgenfreie Forscherin\n    [*] - - - Ich will nicht mehr vorweg nehmen, aber diese Charaktere sind einfach nichts Neues\n[/list]\n\nErst ab dem bereits angesprochenen Plottwist, \u00e4ndert sich Fang etwas und wird ernsthafter und reflektiert sein Handeln etwas. Die anderen Charaktere allerdings nicht. Lediglich ein weiterer Charakter \u00e4ndert sich massiv, aber das w\u00e4re Spoilern der Story.\n\nDie Charaktere waren nicht schlecht, aber irgendetwas fehlte, was sie halt etwas gepusht h\u00e4tte. So wei\u00df man beispielsweise selbst am Ende der Story Nix \u00fcber Fangs Vergangenheit.\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nDas wird wohl die Meisten interessieren. Fairy Fencer F, setzt hierbei auf viel Dialog und Kampf. Sprich ihr geht in die Stadt, dort geschehen ein paar Events und habt ihr die alle durch, r\u00fcckt eure Gruppe wieder aus um die Welt zu retten (Furys zu Sammeln).\nDie Dialoge sind vorgegeben und man hat keine M\u00f6glichkeiten darauf Einfluss zu Nehmen. Es gibt lediglich 2 Schl\u00fcsselsituationen oder Events, die zu unterschiedlichen Enden f\u00fchren. Ziemlich mau, wie ich finde.\n\nEin recht gutes System ist das Worldshaping. Dort k\u00f6nnt ihr eure Fairys dazu benutzen einem Dungeon gewisse (De)buffs zu verabreichen und somit zum Beispiel euren Schaden oder EXP erh\u00f6hen. War ein nettes Feature.\n\nDas Kampfsystem hingegen war gut. Es ist klassischerweise ein Rundenbasiertes und erm\u00f6glicht auch das Benutzen von Combos, sowie dem Setzen von Schwerpunkten bei den Charakteren.\nNur ist es nie so schwer, dass ich tats\u00e4chlich ins Schwitzen gekommen w\u00e4re. Die einzige Herausforderung waren Bosse, aber auch die konnte man im Zweifelsfall nach ein paar Grinding Einheiten, bequem in die Pfanne hauen.\nDas Spiel bietet also die M\u00f6glichkeit des taktischen Tiefgangs, aber setzt es nicht voraus. Da war \"The Last Remnant\" deutlich anstrengender, wo ich minuzi\u00f6s meine Taktiken planen musste um zB eine Belagerung zu schaffen.\n\nUnd damit kommen wir zum Grinding. Ja, ich habe es gehasst. Einige Charaktere die sich im weiteren Spielverlauf anschlie\u00dfen, erfordern das der Charakter ein bestimmtes Level erreicht und somit habe ich 2 ganze Stunden damit verbracht im gleichen Dungeon Monster zu t\u00f6ten und es h\u00e4tte mich noch mehr Zeit gekostet, h\u00e4tte ich nicht einen +90% EXP Boost via World Shaping auf den Dungeon gesetzt. Das ist kein gutes Gamedesign !\n\n[h1]Soundtrack:[/h1]\nWar gut. Einige davon waren recht passend und h\u00e4ngen mir noch im Ohr. Gerade die Kampfmusik die ich viel zu oft H\u00f6ren durfte... Ein wenig Vielfalt h\u00e4tte hier nicht geschadet\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1]\nFairy Fencer F ist ein sehr generisches und klassiches JRPG. Viel Text, solide Kampfaction und wenig Bedarf an Taktik. Ich bin da recht schnell durchgekommen, aber die multiplen Enden konnten mich noch nicht reizen, es erneut durchzuspielen. Eventuell hole ich dies irgendwann nach.\nDen Vollpreis ist mir dieses Spiel \u00fcbrigens nicht wert. Ich denke bis ca 15\u20ac ist Alles in Ordnung, aber die 27.99\u20ac sollte keiner freiwillig Zahlen.\n\nIch kann dieses Spiel also bedingt Empfehlen. Wer schon einmal in der Richtung etwas gespielt hat, wird gut mit dem Spiel zurechtkommen und es wahrscheinlich m\u00f6gen.

I liked the Anime style comedy and dialogue, but the combat and progression just didn't keep me interested.\n\ng-Rating Categories: \n\n>>gameplay [1] \nThe game is basically dialogue and combat. There is no exploration really. You unlock different areas of the map as you progress, but they are stand-alone dungeons. The dialogue was great as was the Anime-style humor, but I couldn't get into the combat. It's turn-based inside an \"encounter\" arena that lets you move around to position before attacking or performing some other action. I think a more traditional turn-based RPG encounter mechanic would have been better (no movement) because the camera got in the way and honestly I didn't find the positioning to offer much variety from a strategic perspective. It was basically move >> attack, move >> attack.  \n\n>>graphics [2] \nThe dungeons were very bland and generic, but the cutscenes and character art were awesome. \n\n>>gui [2] \nI played with a keyboard mostly. Although there were times when I had to use the mouse because sometimes keys were not mapped to some actions (like selecting a character to heal).\n\n>>glitches [3] \nSolid.

I expected it to be some anime bullshit that I might find amusing and I was curious about the combat. What it actually ended up being was possibly my GOTY 2015 and that\u2019s not even a joke.\n\nInitially, Fairy Fencer F seems like it\u2019s pretty much stupid bullshit that gets by on being moderately amusing and has really anime jokes that are tired and obnoxious- a refined woman who\u2019s slightly masochistic, a busty blond who\u2019s too casual about nudity, the same shit you\u2019ve rolled your eyes at a thousand times if you like anime. And at the start of the game, the combat\u2019s nothing special either, as like most RPGs it has the terrible habit of not giving you many tools other than \u201cpress attack, maybe cast a spell if you\u2019re feeling saucy\u201d for the first hour of the game.\n\nWhat made me keep playing was the UTTER goofiness of Fairize (a sort of super mode you get) and the music that comes with it. Full Contact starts with the lines METAPHORPHOSIZE YOUR HEART, UNLEASH THE HELL INSIDE and doesn\u2019t get any less ridiculous from there, and every time you Fairize there\u2019s a (skippable, something I was grateful for by hour 20) magical girl transformation cutscene where you impale yourself with your weapon. The other thing was the ridiculousness of the protagonist Fang, who starts off as a lazy hedonist who\u2019s only glimmer of a better nature is agreeing to help his fairy partner when she reveals that she\u2019s lost her memory. The writing is genuinely enjoyable too, although early on is marred by the previously mentioned anime staple \u201cjokes\u201d.\n\nHowever, it only gets better. The battle system opens up, and while disappointingly I never felt challenged to prove my mastery of the combat system, it was still interesting and engaging to learn and improve at. The game\u2019s one real flaw to me (aside from fanservice, especially with Harley) is it\u2019s just too easy- a flaw that\u2019s only noticeable because the battle system is so good you can feel that there\u2019s room for real challenge outside of \u201cmy numbers are higher\u201d. The story and characters meanwhile, skyrocket in quality, with everyone quickly becoming likeable, the main character having a real and noticeable character arc, and the tone seamlessly and naturally escalating in scope and gravity without ever having a jarring \u201cwhen did the comedy end\u201d moment. Even some of the tired jokes get used in actually funny ways, and the rest fade into the background or simply vanish.\n\nFairy Fencer F is legitimately a great game, which is the absolute last thing I expected it to be. I highly advise anyone who has any interest in RPGs or anime-y games to pick it up.\n\nAlso, it has accessories like in a Tales game, and that\u2019s awesome. They\u2019re also reflected in the transformation cutscene, as are alternate costumes (of which there are very few)\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=587697879]Look at that goofy little plush.[/url] Buy this game, seriously, it\u2019s good.", "timestamp_created": 1451754200, "timestamp_updated": 1451754671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20210474": {"recommendationid": "20210474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070304002", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464659495}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed HyperDimension Neptunia, you'll love this.

This game, I spent 48 hours on it based by Steam hours, but I had to look-up more things to do it, reading things mediculously. Two hard achievements to do would be the 100M Gold achievement and the 10,000 monsters slain achievement. No joke, it will take over 20+ hrs to grind both out cumulatively. If you're getting this game purely for achievement whoring, don't expect it to be as easy as Neptunia's. The game takes itself more seriously than Nep's, but similar to Nep's, there's mindless grinding and the game itself is relatively short. Beating the main story should take less than 15-20 hrs easily if you're reading everything. Less than 50-60 hours to complete all achievements if you studied up on things, best of luck, guys! <3", "timestamp_created": 1451718230, "timestamp_updated": 1451718230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20205685": {"recommendationid": "20205685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271290125", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451833939}, "language": "schinese", "review": "A good way to kill time\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1451714065, "timestamp_updated": 1451714065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20204809": {"recommendationid": "20204809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075596552", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490830746}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si te gust\u00f3 el modo y las mec\u00e1nicas de juego del Hyperdimension Neptunia.

"playtime_forever": 3034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450916171}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to preface this review by stating that it has spoilers for some intricate game mechanics as well as light \"plot\" spoilers. If you're against spoiling at all, you'll more likely not want to read this, otherwise read-on. There's plenty to talk about. \n\nI think the best way to describe my dissappointment with this game is to talk about all of my gripes with it, starting with grinding. First of all, I'm the type of person who doesn't mind grinding in games, heck I might even say I enjoy it and don't find any trouble in throwing countless hours doing the same repetitive actions when I want to. My troubles are with how the game handles it - poorly.\n\nFor starters, it makes no sense to invest anything in magic. The game has this system named \"Shaping Effect\", which allows you to change how the dungeon is going to be played. They have lots of effects, and some are really beneficial, like raising EXP gotten, or WP (points gained in battle to upgrade characters' skills and spells), but they all come with negative effects (unless you have an S rank Shaping Effect). These EXP and WP modifiers come with negative effects like raising SP consumption to twice as much, making you take twice as much damage or just straight up Silencing and Sealing you so you cannot make use of spells or skills - since you're going to be grinding a good deal, it makes such Shaping Effects relatively useful. Couple that with how slow it is to select spells in the menus and how many commands you'd have to input, grinding becomes considerably more efficient with just regular attacks. You can literally set up the game to \"autobattle\" and just pressing X to end encounters within seconds if you're building your characters with Silence and Seal in mind, which trivializes pretty much everything. If you plan on grinding for the DLC areas, you're going to be spending a lot of time battling the same monsters just to get to the DLC and then battle the same monsters reskinned in the DLC area, just considerably more difficult, which feels very lazy and isn't really worth your time or money (wasn't worth mine at the least).\n\nAnd even then, this game is pretty easy even without exploiting any clearly unbalanced mechanics, and it's not really a problem in itself, especially if you're not a very big fan of grinding, Fang (the main character) is just straight up broken, all other character are exchangeable among themselves. That is... until the game 'forces' you to grind ~10+ levels to get to Lv. 40 at a specific point in the story just to get a missable party member - which doesn't even make any sense - as the game does not explain why you have to be Lv. 40 to even get him (mind you, they didn't even reference it in the game, you'd have to look this up online), which is just very frustrating. What's the point of making a game easy if you're just going to force players to grind to attain their coveted 100% completion? Sure thing, you can just wait and unlock him on New Game Plus, but hey, that's a party member, why would I have to wait him to join me if I can just make him join me now?\n\nSpeaking of skills being useless, the game gives you access to a whole load of buffs / debuffs early on for fairly cheap WP and that made me think the game would be pretty awesome, with lots of choices in playstyle and whatnot. Sure, buffs are useful if you want to make use of them, but they're completely unnecessary - now debuffs are pretty much worthless. They'll work on regular mobs, which could be pretty good since they last for quite long, but more often than not do not work on bosses - the kind of encounters you'd actually want to debuff and buff yourself for - which is a major flaw. I mean, what'd be the point of using them in random battles if they're just going to end very quickly and waste your SP that could potentially be used for healing?\n\nThe game also has a wide varity of items in it, and they're mostly pretty nice but since you can just ignore all the SP restoring ones and you'll likely be overlevelled for most of it (enemies will barely be able to touch you) you'll likely not have any use for them (Aside from: Return Wings, the 'escape dungeon' item; Dimensional Clocks, the 'respawn all enemies item'). And when it comes to collectible items, quests can be really annoying. Some of them require you to steal from countless, specific monsters to get an arbritary number of non-droppable (or low rate drop) items, whose only way to acquire otherwise is to hope for them in RNG chests (which you really should not, as stealing is a lot quicker). Not to mention the highest-chance Steal skill has been bugged since the game first released on consoles and was never fixed, which just adds to frustration. Keep in mind the rewards for these quests are often not worth it.\n\nThe story is fairly clich\u00e9, although I don't mind it much. I just feel they could have invested and fleshed out more the secondary characters, especially Ethel and Pippin. There just isn't much to connect to, so you end up not caring much about most of them. The story also feels a bit lazy, and will often make you revisit areas due to it. You'll go 'back in time' and they'll be slightly different, having some new monsters and reskins here and there, but it's pretty much the same. It also adds insult to injury that a lot of dungeon layouts might as well be the exact same. I don't mind if you're trying to save costs and reuse some of the graphics, but you know something's wrong when your Final Dungeon is a carbon-copy of another place you've already been to.\n\nAs a conclusion, this isn't the worst JRPG I've played but it's sure as hell dissappointing - I really wanted to like it.\nIt has a lot of things going on for it, like pretty anime graphics and a great soundtrack (which by itself was amazing, but along the game gets oversaturated by repetition), but that alone isn't enough to offset the numerous poor game design choices they've made all throughout it. The game developers really dropped the ball on this. At the end I wasn't enjoying myself and just had to rush it to put the game to a close. I'll also likely not be touching New Game Plus, as I see no point in skimming through the game to see the missable content I've already screwed myself from getting my hands on. This game does not compel you to replay it through.\n\nSuch disappointing game.

The game's combat is a bit repetitive and that's the only complaint I have with the game (its combat system is quite similar to that of the HyperDimension series), however what really drew me in to this game are the whacky characters, particularly the lazy main character Fang. There are some good laughs to be had here and if you love the HyperDimension series then I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game to you.

I played this game for only 1.5 hours - and I got bored to death already! ^^ Obviously, Anime fans seem to like it. And I can see why. But to me, what I saw so far was not very appealing. Dialogue is presented in visual novel style, with solid voice actors. What I disliked about it is how absolutely not serious it is. They try to be funny all the time. They try to be cute. And it has this childish/family friendly touch. This is just not what I want from a RPG. I am not an Anime fan, but I am open to it. There were a few Animes I enjoyed. But I like the more serious ones. Not the cute ones. The story might have been interesting to me, but I just don't like how it is presented in this game. The gameplay doesn't seem to be very special. Standard JRPG turn-based combat, as far as I can tell. It's not bad, but it's also not enough to keep me playing despite the mentioned things I dislike about the game. So while I can see that it's probably a nice game for others, it's just not for me. Even after this short amount of time, I am pretty sure I won't play any more of it.\n\nAnd I am completely aware, that I will most likely get downvoted like crazy here. ^^ But that's ok. The review should reflect my personal opinion. And my opinion is that I just don't enjoy the game. And I am sure there are people out there who would feel the same. So that's why I have to give it a thumbs down. I am sure the game can stand one thumb down, with otherwise 93% positive reviews. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1450874709, "timestamp_updated": 1450876138, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23,

As it stands, the battle system is fairly enjoyable, you're given some freedom in picking which Persona *cough* I mean, Fairy to use, which augments your stats and grants you certain bonuses and debuffs that might effect your adventure through a dungeon, like an exp bonus at the expense of having lower defense, more money but harder enemies spawn, etc.  As you earn experience, you also earn secondary exp referred to as \"WP,\" which you can apply to the stats of your choice (if by choice, you mean adding extra attacks in battle through leveling Combo!).  Battle play out very....slowly...as characters have played out attack animations and the game requires a lot of loot farming to finish missions, luckily, this is rendered much less annoying by the fast forward button they let you use to skip animations.  Of course, a fast forward button is a bandaid solution to the greater problem that battles take very little strategy and the whole gameplay rythm relies on a lot of menial drudgery.  \n\nSide quests are lazy too.  Most of the missions in the game are shoved into a quest board with scant flavor text that is only really worth reading for the location and enemy information that it might (emphasis *might*, the times when it doesn't give you useful information are always on the rarest, most difficult-to-find items) provide.  \n\nDungeon design is also...you get it by now.  Mostly corridors, with minimal interactibles except for the odd enemy or treasure...floating cube thing that very thoroughly fails to blend in with ANY scenery you happen to find it in.  Locales you visit have no real significance.  Go here for that MacGuffin, then go here for the next one, etc etc.  You could have flipped the order of most of the dungeons in the game and it wouldn't have really changed anything.\n\nThe plot is weak for a few reasons: the world, the characters, and the pacing.  First, the world is very shallow.  You have one hub town, and it's just a bunch of menus (Neptunia players will not be surprised by this).  There are NPC talk events that come up regularly, but most of them are either useless random comments about really nothing, like a drunk passing by or something, or vaguely silly scenes where an NPC does something weird and your character reacts to it.  World building is pretty much non-existant, except to further drive home the heavy-handed and simplistic world the main plot already sets up.  Main plot establishes really quickly: evil corporation appears good, but is really doing bad stuff!  Side NPCs occasionally: we love the evil corporation so much because they throw money at us, etc.  \nSecond, the characters.  The characters for the most part sit very comfortably in shallow archetypes that they don't venture out of very often.  Even with fairly frequent talk topics after major plot developments, you never really see how the group becomes the True Companions that are willing to die for the main character despite his less than stellar charisma and lazy attitude for most of the game.  It doesn't help that the game resets about half way through, resetting character development for everyone except the main character in the process, and further shortening the character arcs (if you can even call them that) of the party members.  \nThird is the game's issue with pacing.  The fact that the timeline resets mid-game reeks as an excuse to reuse the already minimal-effort dungeons.  Indeed, after that mid-game reset, the game introduces about a handful of new dungeons, that might as well be reskins of the existing ones anyway.  This move also resets character development for most of the cast, turning the focus on the main character as he tries to convince them he isn't crazy and really IS from an alternate timeline.  If their motivations for joining the party weren't ALREADY flimsy (pervy researcher girl wants to come along so she can perv on your party's female fairies), they become seriously flimsy after the reset (hey, this crazy guy claims he's from the future, might as well tag along and perv on his fairies while I watch this play out).\n\nPositives and Negatives Breakdown:\n+Great port: Borderless windowed option, runs smooth even at high resolutions and at max detail.  No crashes, no save issues, works competently on keyboard+mouse, but best on a controller.  \n+Fun, if mindless dungeon crawling: the gameplay is fine.  The story can't really stand on its own, and there's little narrative or lore motivation to doing sidequests, but if you enjoy the gameplay, it's an alright treadmill to get on for a few hours.\n+Good art--CGs in story events and character side-events are well done, frequently putting characters in pervy situations if that's your thing.\n+/- Music--there are a few standout tracks, but it's mostly very bland and forgettable.  \n-Weak story\n--Weak pacing\n-Weak Characters\n-Weak world-building\n-Recycled dungeons out the wazoo\n", "timestamp_created": 1450513405, "timestamp_updated": 1450513405, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525690", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19770387": {"recommendationid": "19770387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067815217", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467767925}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: \n1.

This game is very easy and you just need to grind a little bit to either sustain one shots of bosses or give them a huge burst befor they reach a certain amount of hp. This burst needs to kill them.

This is going to be a long review, so if you don't like reading, then the first sentence sums it up.\n\nI've played many RPG and JRPG games through my life, and most of them were pretty spectacular. Golden Sun, Persona 3 and 4, Pokemon (if that counts), Chrono Trigger, Fire Emblem: Awakening, and Skyrim, to name a few. So I'd like so think that I've seen all the odd's and ends of what RPG/JRPG games should feel like. \n\nFairy Fencer f had every good thing RPG's have to offer. The story, the art, the music, the characters, the combat system, the customization, the grind (maybe not good to some people), and most importantly for me, a DYNAMIC main character. I'll be going into details, trying to avoid spoilers since I always hover over them anyways.\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nFF's story seems basic at first. Two deity's, the benevolent Goddess and the vile Vile God, each fighting to take over the world. They both get sealed away, and the world is left alone all normal. Your quest is to collect Furies (sealed fairies) in order to revive the Goddess and get your wish granted. Seems prety run-of-the-mill, right? But then you meet your two protagonists, the unlikeable Fang and the sarcastic Eryn, and you quickly get pulled in by Compile Heart's signature comedic dialogue. And in classic JRPG form, a TON of twists happen throughout the game that make you upset, confused or heartbroken. They come fast and strike hard, leaving you devastated or driven enough to keep playing; to solve whatever just happened. The story is far from basic. It's a wonderful tale of treachery, love, heroism, justice and cookies. Oh and Pippin I guess...\n\n[b]Art & Music:[/b]\nEverything in this game was gorgeous. The landscapes, the cutscences, the characters, even the menu's were well designed and easy to use. The music gave emotions to the dungeons and aligned with events in the story; mystery, excitement, regret etc. I will say that you'll be sick of hearing the word \"Metamorphosize\" halfway through the game, since it's the first word of the theme song that plays when you Fairize.\nI figure I should also mention Voice Acting since that was pretty great too. I used the English voices because I knew Christine Marie Cabanos was in the cast. There was plenty of emotion, and none of the voices were painful to listen to like Compa from HD (Except Pippin)\n\n[b]The Character's:[/b] \nI'm as much of a fan of your \"Tsundere\" or  \"Onee-Chan\" trope characters as the next guy. Heck, I played through Hyperdimension and found it enjoyable. For those of you who don't know, basically a trope is a stereotype, for example the \"Rich girl with the annoying laugh\". But there were only three characters I can think of that fit into a solid trope: Soji, Apollonius and (maybe) Zenke. \nAll the characters were so completely diverse, and their chemistry was amazing. You had the \"Tsundo-masochist\", \"Jarl Ulfric the Baker\", \"Kill, Kill, Kill\", and the \"Japanadian\". All the characters had interesting backstories, and you really felt like you were growing with them on their journey. Just not Pippin though.\n\n[b]Combat/Customization/Grinding:[/b]\nThe game consists of an Overworld, a single Town, Goddess Revival and Dungeons (Shukesoo's Tower included). Similar to most RPG's, the dungeons are filled with non-random enemy encounters that trigger a battle sequence. You can gain the advantage outside of battle by hitting the enemy first (akin to Paper Mario). \nThe combat system is almost identical to Hyperdimension; turn-based strategy. You can customize your team in many, many ways. You can change combos, armor, Fairies, stats, formation, members, partners, accessories and even fighting styles (Turning a brawler into a gunner, for example). The only thing I was disappointed with in terms of customizations is that [b] there are only two costumes per character [/b]. Everyone gets a default costume and a bath towel/bathing suit (DLC, by the way), with the exception of Ethel, who has three.\nI love grinding in RPG's. Shoot me, I'm weird. But this game was special in that it was actually fun to grind. You can upgrade each character individually using points earned from battle. Tiara can either be an all-out magic user or a Glavie wielder, or a swordsman, or an archer etc. It's very fun to play around with different strategies. I never used Pippin though, so I can't give analysis on that...\n\n[b]Fang:[/b] \nFang get's his own section because I hated him at the beginning. If you've ever watched a Romance/ Slice of Life anime before, you've met Fang; Lazy, undecided and unworthy of the ladies he's surrounded by. But oh my word. That is all I'll say. Let him annoy you, allow him to get at you and then you will feel all the emotion I felt through this game. Amazeballs.\n\nIn conclusion!\nStory: 9/10 - Draws you in. Makes you think, work and FEEL. I got the ending I didn't want, so maybe I'll edit this later.\n\nGameplay: 10/10 - I love the mechanics. Dungeons, shopping for armor, grinding. The whole RPG shindig.\n\nCharacter's: 10/10 - Individualistic, lovable, and well defined. But Pippin...\n\nMusic: 9/10 - Electronic? Orchestra? J-pop? Rock? Yup, and it's all great. But one over repetitive song robs this of a 10.\n\nReplay Value: 10/10 - Hard Achievements, three endings I'm dying to see, and ridiculous character customization.\n\nOverall: 9.5/10\nThis game truly deserves to be among the great RPG games out there. Where Hyperdimension is niche and weird, Fairy Fencer f is a beautifully crafted masterpiece of a game that I would kill to play again for the first time. I highly recommend this game if you are a casual, hardcore or die-hard fan of RPG, JRPG or Anime games.\n", "timestamp_created": 1449484545, "timestamp_updated": 1449484545, "voted_up": true,

The story so far is great with amazing story. 20 hours af playing this game and i think the story still very far from ending so it really worth your money though i buy this on sale about $5 or so. If you like Neptunia series then you'll like this where they came from same developer.\n\nWhat I don't really like about this game is that you have to learn from net about monster, tactic, and what kind of attack that monster weak for. You'll get basic tutorial and stuff but it not really tell you what element weak against what element so it abit difficult for new player in RPG genre like me. And when you play with keyboard i just don't get it about why they map keyboard button like that because it's kinda absurb like you jump with backspace LOL, so i recommended using controller instead.\n\nBut overall I love this game so I recommend this game for you who like TBS game, visual novel story and anime style character.", "timestamp_created": 1449291303, "timestamp_updated": 1449291303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19486339": {"recommendationid": "19486339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049648035", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440577099}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game if you like the Hyper Deminsion: Neptunia series.

Nep from Hyperdimension Neptunia. Since I'm been urging to play Hyperdimension Neptunia for awhile now why not try a game that's similar to it? After buying the game, playing it and having almost sleepless nights. I have come to the conclusion that this game is worth the money. \n\nThe storyline is good, it has some funny dialogues [spoiler] (For example if you try to remove a piece of the seal from the so called Bringer of Destruction, you'll get two lovely ladies scolding at you. Not to mention one being a masochist) [/spoiler] and alot of other stuff. I don't wanna spoil anything you'll just have to see it for yourself. \n\nGameplay is also good, I'm pretty sure most of you have played simple turn based rpgs. Like you just choose the command and it does it. Well this isn't your simple plain old turn based rpg. This one has movements, that's right movements where you can actually move your character and then execute command bla bla bla. I'm pretty sure most of you has (have?) already experienced playing games like these with these kinds of gameplay. Anyway this is just my opinion and I'm not a professional at anything. Oh did I forget to mention that you can change the clothing of your characters? :3\n\nDLCS are optional if you want some early-late game boost.\n\nThe endings can be different.\n\n\"Don't judge a book by it's cover\"\nSame applies with games\nSo what are you waiting for?

Reviewer hier verfassen, dass es w\u00e4re so als w\u00fcrde man einen Anime schauen, DAS erschlie\u00dft sich mir \u00fcberhaupt nicht, da die Geschichte wie in einem Visual Novel erz\u00e4hlt wird und die k\u00e4mpfe v\u00f6llig seperat dazu in einer 3D - Umgebung stattfinden.\n\n\nNun kommen wir zum Review:\n\n[b] Positive Punkte\t[/b]\n\n+ die Charakter sind sehr sch\u00f6n gezeichnet\n\n+ die Vertonung ist super gelungen\n\n+ die Geschichte wird lustig erz\u00e4hlt, sodass man immer wissen m\u00f6chte wie es nun endlich weitergeht\n\n+ die Kampfmusik nachdem man \"Fairize\"ausgef\u00fchrt, hat mich immer wieder zum grinsen gebracht :) \n\n\n\n[b] negative Punkte\t[/b]\n\n- es gibt keine Animationen die Interaktionen zwischen den Charakteren w\u00e4hrend der Dialoge veranschaulichen\n\n- angenommen Quests aus der Taverne wurden meiner Meinung nicht ausf\u00fcrlich genug Beschrieben, sodass ich nicht ohne hilfe des Internetz keine Chance hatte weiterzukommen\n\n- der Shwierigkeitsgrad ist zu niedrig angesetzt, ich hab das Spiel ohne Schwierigkeiten durchgespielt. Bei mir sind insgesamt nur 2 Charaktere je ein mal gestorben. Ganz zu schweigen von irgendeiner Taktik die ich bei k\u00e4mpfen anwenden musste.\n\n\n[b]Fazit\t[/b]\n\nMich hat selten ein Spiel Aufgrund seiner Story und der guten Vertonung so lange gefesselt, ich habe mich immer wieder gefreut wenn es eine neue \"Unterhaltung/Zwischensequenz\". Allerdings ist wie schon Aufgef\u00fchrt der Schwierigkeitsgrad viel zu niedrig sodass man in den K\u00e4mpfen einfach eine Haudrauf-Taktik anwendet die meist kurz durch Heilzauber/-items unterbrochen wird. Wer auf Animes / Mangas steht kann hier getrost zugreifen, allerdings auch nur wenn man den Erz\u00e4hlstil von Visual Novels mag.\n\nNoch ein paar abschlie\u00dfende Worte zum Kampfsystem, diese gelten allerdings nur denen, die b]keinerlei[/b] Erfahrung mit J-RPGs haben.\nDie k\u00e4mpfe werden hier sehr schnell repetetiv, da man sich hier (dank des zu niedrigen Schwierigkeitgrades) auf ein paar Aktionen beschr\u00e4nkt und diese dann mit sehr geringen Abweichungen wiederholt.\n", "timestamp_created": 1448936727, "timestamp_updated": 1448936727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19398082": {"recommendationid": "19398082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101021608", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451321394}, "language": "english", "review": "LOVE IT SO MUCHHHHHHHHHHH!

I'm only an hour in, and it seems much more complex than Hyperdimension. First is the weapon boost system, which allows you to allocate \"Weapon Points\", gained through battle, to increase your combo, learn new skills, and upgrade stats. You also get \"Fairies\", which you can equip and level up for cool benefits that start off with little benefits such as \"Ice Support +3\", but they also seem to be able to give you additional skills. Your weapon also apparently changes when you equip different kinds of combos, at least that's what the game tells me. The Main Characters (Fang and Eryn) are hilarious, Fang manages to pull off being a total Jerk, while being funny at the same time, which is good, otherwise he'd be unlikable. If you like Hyperdimension Neptunia, you'll like this. If you haven't played Hyperdimension, I'd say play this if you enjoy RPGs that will suck away all your time, and then play Hyperdimension, because this is a tad more serious (and by a tad, I mean a LOT) than Hyperdimension, which throws you head first into anime and video game references, this at least so far has kept it light on the video game trope references.", "timestamp_created": 1448828830, "timestamp_updated": 1448828830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19370050": {"recommendationid": "19370050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055916663", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461259182}, "language": "english", "review": "You wanna play a good fucking rpg game?

Personally I\u2019d say that this game is an upgrade from Neptunia (the first one at least), since the story features a much nicer progression that starts off slice of life like and turns into one that actually takes itself seriously by the end whilst still maintaining its sense of humor. My only complaint is that the game tends to be fairly easy with no difficulty settings whatsoever, especially in NG+ where you will probably OHKO or 1 combo to death everything and only presents some challenge in the extra dungeon. Hopefully this will be fixed in its continuation/reboot Fairy Fencer Advent Dark Force. \nAlso I strongly recommend to avoid reading the contents of costume DLC if you are planning on buying it since it will spoil you about your party members and it IS a big deal since it HAS been a while since I last played a JRPG that maintained some mystery about your final party formation, at least comparing to some like Tales of series which spoil you straight from the game cover and Final Fantasy alike. Comparing to those I got really excited about things being a little more unpredicted.\nSolid game with surprisingly good and involving story, nice Neptunia like battle system, suffering only to easy main story battles. Definitely a must buy for all Neptunia lovers and also for those who are looking for JRPGs on steam. Even if you don\u2019t enjoy Neptunia and niche games, but love RPGs with nice story and multiple endings give this one a shot and it might just be worth your while!

For those who don't like HDN there isn't anything here that will change your mind about the Compile Heart's style. The gameplay is the same, the characters are all full of tropes, the dialogue is hilarious for all the right/wrong reasons, and there's a whole lot of disjointed visual novel style scenes to go through.\n\nNow for those who have never tried a Compile Heart game before to sum up the gameplay briefly: There's an overwold map with minor interaction where you point at the next dungeon, all dungeons are fairly short and samey, the combat system has some pretty good depth to it but due to how easy their games are any depth becomes meaningless, and most importantly you can spam jump while in dungeons.\n\nNow speaking specifically about this game the gameplay, as mentioned above, has a serious problem in the difficulty department. There will never be a point you'll find yourself grinding for levels because the game doesn't start punishing you harshly until the enemies are basically 1.2-1.7 times your level. A cool new feature this game has is also the ability to distribute the stats into the character the way you want, AND while you perform actions with your characters they gain stats for the traits that relate (ex, jumping a bunch in the dungeon boosts agility, using magic a lot boosts SP, collecting items a lot boosts luck) unfortunately there is almost no noticeable difference because everything is just so incidental. \n\nThat may all seem negative, because it kind of is, but for some reason none of that matters once you start getting into the gameplay. The semi-strategy RPG style layout with aoe hit zones and movement zones mixed with the turn based combat is indescribably way more satisfying than it ever should be. It's hard to explain why and can only be experienced first hand.\n\nMoving onto the story... well. It's a JRPG and Compile Heart really likes doing the classic (you're a hero now, you need to do x, and stop y from returning and save the planet) JRPG story, but they enjoy doing it with large parties of really enjoyable characters who are all quite hilarious. Also the main character in this game is quite possibly the most unlikable likable main character to come out this year. \n\nOverall: While FFF might not be as good a game as HDN was it is certainly a fantastic addition to the library of any fan of JRPGs.", "timestamp_created": 1446717586, "timestamp_updated": 1446717586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18886640": {"recommendationid": "18886640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075876410", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471673073}, "language": "english", "review": "the gameplay is fun and the stories great too !", "timestamp_created": 1446704850, "timestamp_updated": 1446704850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18882226": {"recommendationid": "18882226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078369464", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485081172}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bon ^^", "timestamp_created": 1446676844, "timestamp_updated": 1446676844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18873047": {"recommendationid": "18873047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114899632", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487627136}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it.

If you enjoyed games like Neptunia of Mugen Souls, then you won't need to read reviews to see if it will be worth it. Just watch some gameplay and you'll know if you want to.\n\nThe game features a Fairy Link system, giving you more personality in your custimization of your character(s). If you want to have a tank, mage or maybe a strong damage per turn. The only real walking you'll be doing is in dungeons, so you don't have to sidetrack the towns in order to go everywhere before heading out. The final part that the game offers is its \"Gods Revival\" option. By using existing Fairies you can upgrade them once with a unique ability and World Creation stats used to powerup and powerdown your dungeon experience. These mechanics make for a unique experience, but offers only so much.\n\nBut what's [i]good[/i] about the game?\nIt has some great soundtrack to accompany you through your experience. Every type of dungeon has its own unique BGM and you are welcomed with more than 1 battle track. The game is also easy to understand. The battle mechanic isn't hard to figure out, but unlike Final Fantasy X; which uses the same Turn Order for battles, there is little to take advantage of. The story is lovable and you get to enjoy many faces that develop (sort of) over the course of the game. It also takes advantage of the \"cliches\" of games. The side events are also very Japanese with their slapstick and airheadness and ecchi.\n\nAnd what's [i]bad[/i] about the game?\nLike mentioned often it suffers from cliches. If you know a bit of gaming you'll be able to foresee certain events. The game also features a cast of 6[spoiler]/7 to 9[/spoiler] playable characters. If you are going for completion you'll use 2 of those at any given time meaning you have 1 spare seat left. The game also suffers from the lack of difficulty. You can get behind big time, but you can train yourself back in the game, but once you get ahead by a lot you'll breeze through the game with little to no difficulty. [spoiler]New Game+ also leaves you with EVERYTHING so it will be even easier.[/spoiler] The game also features a huge world map that won't be used in any way [spoiler]and instead of more dungeons you'll get to play every dungeon twice, thrice or even four times.[/spoiler] The battle music will also get on your nerves since they aren't memorable.\nLastly the biggest flaw for the game is its shortness and cryptic level. If you go for a straight playthrough you can beat it in 15 hours, no problem. If you want to go for 100% you'll have to consult a walkthrough because the game is not going to tell you anything about any unlockable or (hidden) items. [spoiler]The game has a lot of missables and I mean a lot, you'll probably end up playing the game twice or thrice to get everything + the 3 endings.[/spoiler]\n\nBy the end if you read it you'll notice more bad things than good things, but that's because bad things stay with you better. I had a good time by the end of the game. The flaws are noticeable and could have been removed, but it's not hindering your experience. All by all I think it's still pretty fun to play. It's not New Game+ worthy though.

Being an enthusiast about Anime didn't have anything to do with my review. I will say that this game is incredibly detailed. The developement of the characters was meticulously thought through and the interactions of the characters don't change for the sake of story developement. All characters are very different and very in personality. The idea of time and it's affect on the world when the particular sequence appears is actually quite accurate. Any change in a timeline can have the potential to change everything about the time stream that you currently travel which is why I believe it was a well thought out paradigm of the story. With the inclusion of the choice of Good or Evil makes this an interesting blend and includes several even more interesting character interations. Players don't necessarily have to grind to finish the game, but it does certainly help. The idea of overkilling enemies has always been a thing for me and with the DLC added to the game, adds the possibility of total annihilation. Getting certain materials to create new weapons, armor, items, misc. items, and other synthesis materials is difficult but if it were easy then it wouldn't be worth the effort. The synthesis items are much stronger than what you can buy and If you farm the materials then it is worth that much more. I would say to be careful about the boss battles when reviving the God or Goddess. If you have the DLC it is easier than normal, however once you reach a certain rank they will start getting though your armor so don't rely on the DLC to last you the whole game. It wont. Overall I recommend this game to any and all RPG enthusiasts out there even if you don't like Anime. It is a rich story full of spontanious and often hilarious conversations.

This is because they are, effectively, much the same game. I didn't actually realise this untill coming to play Fairy Fencer F and only took interest in it due the aforementioned cover art.\n\nI don't believe that Compile Heart/ Idea Factory have too much intention of copy/ pasting their old games, they've just got an engine they like and a design formula that works for them. That and they don't really like to spend effort making many new assets so they use alot of already existing enemies. Further evidence for this belief of mine is Omega Quintet on the PS4, which utilizes a higher version of the engine (or they're pushing it, at least) to make another [i]very[/i] Compile Heart/ Idea Factory game, which again is not as good at Neptunia.\n\n[b]Enough rambling about the devs, on with the show[/b]\nFairy Fencer F is a fun game, certainly not the most fun I've had out of a game, but enough fun for me to play it, complete it  and leave it with happy feelings and no intention to 100% it. \n\nThat being said, I expect achieving 100% in Fairy Fencer F wouldn't be particularly difficult, as there's very little to do in it.\n\nExtremely little, infact, to the point where the midway plot point which originally comes across as a potentially totally awesome bit of story telling starts to feel like a \"We were running out of time!\" cry of help from the developers, and it's quite a shame, as Fairy Fencer F is qute enjoyable to play.\n\nWith almost no post-story content aside from a tower I found completely by accident and grinding the randomised treasure chests in dungeons, there's very little backing the game. I'm not, of course, saying that a game cannot stand on it's own two legs without extra stuff to do, it's just that having extra stuff to do gives it more life, more playability and more things to keep you, as a player, interested. The tower isn't even what it sets itself up to be, it's just a menu with a list of set fights to go through. So yeah, basically, there's nothing post story unless you like luck roll grinding for hats.\n\n[b]So, why is there a man in my Not Neptunia?[/b]\nFang is, bluntly, wicked. He's great, he's brisque, a bit gruff and does what he likes, all the while making a show of being uncaring while actually being a good guy deep down. I guess that makes him a tsundere. I love me some tsunderes. Much of the first chunk of story is Fang pratting about while going on a quest to save First Girl's memories, and \"gradually\" warming to Second Girl. There is a Third Girl who is by far and away the best, but I'm assuming time cuts didn't give her a look in.\n\nFang has a mate, as well, who is basically his goofier self in large shorts. There's also another man and potentially his sister that you need to have to NG+ to feasibly get unless you grind all the nothing like a madman.\n\n[b]This music, though[/b]\nI'm making a section for this on it's own because the music is fantastic. The opening video music is awesome and much of the actual gameplay music is also fantastic. A quick bit of searching led to the discovery that the music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, the man who did the Final Fantasy music, among many other brilliant soundtracks. Sadly, halfway through the game the cool battle music is replaced by slightly boring battle music, I can only assume this is to reflect Fang being serious, and the game being boring from this point on for a while, but never mind.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe battle system is a carbon copy of Neptunia 2, as is the dungeoneering and shopping. The only differences lie in the stat bonuses and ability unlocks being reshuffled to the Fairy Upgrade system, which allows for some mild character ability customisation and is fairly cool, and the aesthetics of the game. Visually, it's quite nice. the dungeons tend to be more detailed than that of Neptunia and alot of the tilesets are completely different, making it feel like a different world, which it is.\n\nThe story is short. Really short, but could have been brilliant, so I was quite surprised when I realised that, yes, I really was nearing the end of the game, and about to fight the Final Boss For Real, and yes, his head is hilariously tiny (I was crying laughing at him and his tiny head in this serious bit of story).\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nYou may have noticed that I used the word \"potentially\" alot, that's because the mix of nothing aside from story, the story being very short at that, Fairy Fencer F comes across as a potentially brilliant game that just didn't have enough time spent on it, which is a massive shame. Furry Fencer F is still a fun game to play, it's just not as fun as it could have been. Fairy Fencer F isn't a bad game, though, it's just not what it could have been. I prepurchased the game for half price (~\u00a311), and that's about how much the game is worth.", "timestamp_created": 1445696461, "timestamp_updated": 1445696510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18656464": {"recommendationid": "18656464", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977632179", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445724183}, "language": "english", "review": "cannot get this game working at all money back time...\n\nbefore anyone gets this heads up has sound no picture all support for this game sucks \n\nFullScreen=0\nBorderlessWindow=1\n\ndoes not work \n\nMedia Feature Pack for N and KN versions of Windows 10\n\ndoes not work\n\non windows 10 rolled back to xp 7 and 8 all fail\n\nuninstall reinstall removed SLI to have only 1 card failed...", "timestamp_created": 1445689855, "timestamp_updated": 1445689855, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.403917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18653250": {"recommendationid": "18653250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237345126", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455984806}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5996\u7cbe\u5251\u58eb\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u662f\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u6b66\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u6570\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u5728\u540e\u671f\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5996\u5723\u7684\u5408\u4f53\uff0c\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u9760\u5347\u7ea7\u6b66\u5668\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u66f4\u6709\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8ffd\u51fb\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u654c\u4eba\u3002\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u7740\u7279\u6b8a\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u4e14\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u6765\u89e3\u9664\u5973\u795e\u5c01\u5370\u7684\u5996\u5723\u3002\u8fd8\u6709\u6700\u4e3a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u8eab\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6280\u80fd\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u4f1a\u5c06\u5200\u63d2\u5165\u80f8\u4e2d\uff09\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1445675026, "timestamp_updated": 1445675026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18648034": {"recommendationid": "18648034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058002825", "num_games_owned": 1411, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 2370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445989426}, "language": "english", "review": "While the story starts with a silly story, it soon ends in high notes with a emotional twist and great sense of progression and character development. \n\nAs with many traditional JRPGS, it is very grindy but the combat was fun and the game has many characters to play with and tons of furies to collect.", "timestamp_created": 1445643965, "timestamp_updated": 1445643965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18636113": {"recommendationid": "18636113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019048563", "num_games_owned": 948, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 2825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445902451}, "language": "english", "review": "Somewhat short.

it hadn't been created in Neptunia's shadow. Personally, I didn't care for the HDN games and never got too far into them because the story/characters didn't really interest me.\n\nAs for this game, I really loved the characters (except Sherman, more on that later), the artwork is fantastic and it had a nice concept. Even the english VAs aren't too bad though some of the deliveries are poor and the fairies don't have voices in the english option without a workaround. The major downside is the game play.\n\nThere's a mechanic in the game where you pull out swords from either the vile god or the goddess using the power of fairys. The furies allow you to obtain abilities and add bonuses to dungeons.\n\nHere's the thing though..Whether or not you pull the furies out of the beings has no impact on the story at all. So the games main mechanic and purpose is basically just pushed off to the side and when you do pull out all the furies you get a wimpy boss that's no different than the end boss.\n\nIn fact, If you want any challenge to the game, try not pulling out the furies after the first required to open new dungeons. I had actually skipped the tutorial telling me about world shaping and it didn't occur to me to put more than one fury into the ground until Zepla valley and the only reason I even bothered to at all was for achievement purposes.\n\nThat's right. The game is extremely easy if played how it was intended. My first play through was long because I read the story and I ended up playing through two more times because I missed a subevent for a fury piece required to unlock the second to last fairy. These three play through took me at most 30 hrs...So why do I have over 80 hours of play time? Freaking button mashing the last floor of Sudokoos tower while watching tv for the steam achievements.\n\nYeah. That's right. I did it for the achievements. If I had picked this game up on the PS I wouldn't have cared but seeing those last character achievements locked just bugged me and since I knew I wouldn't be playing this game again I made the dire mistake of saying \"what the hell\" and deciding to just unlock these useless grindy, boring waste of time achievements.\n\nNow, as for my dislike of Sherman. His role in the story is useless. [Spoiler]He is revealed to be the games main antagonist but he could be replaced by Bernard and the story would've been better. It's revealed that the Vile God's descendants destroyed his family so he attempts to take over the vile Gods powers for..what? It would've been far better if he had joined Fang in his mission to protect Tiara and revive the Goddess. On top of all that, somehow being rid of the vile God for good turned into only resealing him and both God and Goddess end up as they were at the start of the story.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, if you want to pick up this game, do it from a bargain bin and do it for the story and characters.

For better or worse. Read it carefully.\n\n[quote='gravitationaltim']I can't say this is one of the better JRPGs on Steam, given that most JRPG players demand a certain level of depth and character development in their games, but nonetheless I would still recommend it.\n\nIt's a very well designed game, in that all the art, animations, menus, and customizations are well polished. Most people that catch me playing it think it looks really cool, and you get that feeling while playing it too. The dialogue is often funny and the characters will even surprise you, but it's still as a whole a kind've hollow experience.\n\nIt's easy to become overpowered, the monsters and environments aren't very diverse, the story is pretty generic with no real revelations or challenges, and sometimes the characters seem bored and flippant about everything that going around, not to mention the bad guys aren't very interesting or intimidating. Depth is certainly not the games forte, but I didn't end up minding it too much.\n\nIt's actually kind of nice to have nothing invested sometimes, the characters almost seem aware that they're in a silly JRPG and the developers put in plenty of missables/grinding/extras for people hoping for more of a challenge. There's so much fun small stuff packed in, like all 39 of the furies you can collect having something to say about current events, or buffing/debuffing areas to grind more efficiently. Lots of cool ideas with the battle system, even though it mostly doesn't matter since you can blow away anything in the main game after level 40. Even though the characters aren't going to have any complex problems or feelings, they are all colorful and enjoyable, I ended up liking everyone and having a hard time choosing my party.\n\nIf you really dig playing RPGs and don't mind a bit of repetivieness and grasping plot points, it's a really fun game. I feel like I've been negative, but I really loved it quite a bit (obviously... my hours)! I stopped playing just to write a positive review, and now I'm getting back to it...[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1445093493, "timestamp_updated": 1456671711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18526477": {"recommendationid": "18526477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253534653", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472787708}, "language": "english", "review": "Like the Story Line of the game it's really Fun to play", "timestamp_created": 1445090383, "timestamp_updated": 1445090383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18498511": {"recommendationid": "18498511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058043953", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444977712}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the very definition of a lot of Japanese RPGs since 2005. Mediocre and completely soulless. It's not bad and it's hardly good either. It's average, ordinary, undistinguished, middle-of-the-road, lackluster, forgettable and other synonyms related to second-rate.\n\nCharacters are common stereotypes found in many Japanese media directed towards teenagers such as in animes and mangas. Here's some examples:\n\n1) The \"hot-blooded but borderline mentally ret-rded\" MC.\n2) The \"cutesy but sometimes annoying\" female lead.\n3) The \"tsundere pseudo-noble lady\" rival of female lead to be the best girl.\n4) The \"one who exist solely as fanservice\" supporting female lead.\n\nThere are a few more characters but if you're familiar with animes and mangas, then you can guess for yourself what kind of character they are. Don't bother getting attached to them either. All of them are one-dimensional. ALL OF THEM. \n\nStory is juvenile and uninteresting as it has already been done countless times in other JRPGs. A completely average main character \"accidentally\" became the hero. He gains the responsibility to save the world by collecting \"something\" to \"free the God(dess)\". Main villain appear, so does other unimportant and boring side characters, hero formed a party, went travelling, stuff happens, some \"plot-twist\" happens, hero got defeated briefly but the power of friendships/love gave the hero strength to defeat the \"real\" villain and the end. In other words, been-there-done-that. No effort was put in the story at all. I personally lost interest during the middle of the story and pretty much rushed through the ending. Sorry to say it didn't get any better. In fact, it got worst. Oh, can't forget the fanservice. Think of the poor basement-dweller players if we didn't get any fanservice.\n\nCombat system was acceptable, for the first hour at least. After that it's down hill. Despite having a number of different types of combo to execute like in Xenogears (one of my favourite JRPG of all time) and Radiata Stories, most of them became obsolete as players are forced to use only a specific amount of those combo in battles. And no, you can't change them during battles. Meaning you have to use the exact same fighting animation on every battle. Throughout the WHOLE GAME! Magics and skills are useless as normal attacks are more efficient. While you can transform into a stronger form in battle, it gets tedious doing so in every battles. Get use to the skip button 'cause you'll be using it a lot to skip the 10 seconds animation with the super cheezy song every time you transform. \n\nLook, I could go in detail why I don't recommend this game but that would be a waste of my time. Just trust me on this, if you're expecting a masterpiece with a engaging story, memorable characters and a fun gameplay, look elsewhere. If you're really desperate in playing this mediocrity, at least buy it on sale.

Many. Laughs.\n\n(TL;DR at bottom)\n\nShort summary: This game is phenomenal in so many different ways between its character design, plot progression, and even the reuse of levels (Yes, this is actually a decently done well thing in this game!). Replayability is very high (as long as you have a guide with you, preferably on the first time around so you don't miss stuff set up for the 2nd playthrough). This game is witty, hilarious, fun, and I honestly found myself addicted and wanting to get everything. And I just normally don't do that. So props to the devs.\n\nBreaking it down...\n\nPlot: 9/10\nI wanna give it even a 9.5, but when you consider how much further they could've gone, I suppose a fantastic 9 will do. The plot isn't really predictable at all. There are few twists and turns, and the entire thing will have you laughing or crying because feels. From a story driven perspective, amazing.\n\nCombat: 8.5\nAt first, combat is dull. Grinding WP to upgrade your abilities/versatility can be a bit slow BUT once you pass that hump OHMYGOD IT CAN BE WONDERFUL TO DESTROY CRAP IN THOSE B.A. FAIRIZE THINGS. \n\nWaifu: 10/10\nJust... Yes. I'm not even gonna write anything more.\n\nDungeon design: 6/10\nThis is the weakest part of the game tbh. They reuse dungeons and dungeon design for multiple places and it's dull. Despite my low score for this, nearly everything else outshines the reuse of the dungeons. I know I'm giving it a 6, but really I weight this section far lower than the others.\n\nCharacter design: 10/10\nAnd not just cause of waifus. Each character has their own unique personality and each one is lovable in their own way. Hell, even the shop keeper has a funny personality when you get new sub-events to talk with her.\n\nMusic: 10/10\nLove that intro. I watch the intro video sometimes Just so I can hear it. Then again you can unlock a music gallery later <3\n\nTL;DR: buy it if you like anime, funnies, and waifus. Also, use a guide so you don't miss stuff (cause you will otherwise).\n", "timestamp_created": 1444785318, "timestamp_updated": 1444785318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18462797": {"recommendationid": "18462797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066100131", "num_games_owned": 666, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517950180}, "language": "english", "review": "Need more wifus pls but good <3\n", "timestamp_created": 1444780805, "timestamp_updated": 1444780805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18457276": {"recommendationid": "18457276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040603453", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464979482}, "language": "english", "review": "Story is to go on a quest to collect 100 possible Waifus to awaken a goddess (giant Waifu?) to seal a evil god and save the world!!!!\n\nCombat reminds me of Arc the Lad Twilight of Spirits (maybe just the Arc the Lad series but nvr played them) where you can move around before attacking/switching/healing.\n\nHas an ok soundtrack, Full Contact is not liked by a few people but thats just their taste in music.

The dialogue is great, and i enjoyed every character. The more I played it though, the more it felt like a walking grind. I feel like if you're not browsing around the ONE town you can visit (and you don't navigate through the town, it's just a menu you browse through), then you're just making your way to the next dialogue event that you have no control over. \n\nCombat===\nThe combat seemed interesting at first, but as I started unlocking abilities, I noticed the only significant levelling up you really do is in the passive stat boosts. Skills seem lackluster compared to the basic combos you perform that have a chance to \"avalanche\" causing all of your other characters to attack as well. Buffs and debuffs feel like a waste of time to me except maybe on the longer battles. I noticed no difference in buffing a character's speed.\n\nWhen walking around the world, you can try to engage an enemy with a Symbol Attack, but it gives you no advantage over just walking into them. You are guaranteed the first turn if successful (which you really get anyways so long as they don't successfully land an ambush on you - you can permanently negate all ambushes just by getting a passive). The only incentive to doing Symbol Attacks is the associated achievement that gives you permanent stats.\n\nCrafting===\nThere isn't much to say about this. You make basic items that the shop eventually unlocks for you. There isn't much of an incentive to crafting. \n\nMoney===\nOnce you unlock the Tower of Shukesoo (sp?) money is no longer a factor. You can repeatedly do floors for the massive gold/consumables/materials. You also start every fight with 100% HP and SP. This makes setting up a script on your keyboard to farm while you're asleep a little too easy (literally just repeating Up arrow and Enter). By the time you wake up, you'll have all the money you'll ever need, and enough WP to pick up all important skills. \n\nLoot===\nAlmost non-existent. I'm a completionist, so i like to check every nook and cranny for loot. 99% of the little loot stars (or whatever you call them - their equivalent of chests) provided consumables that I could just buy from the shop. There was never a piece of armor or an accessory hidden away that I couldn't just buy in the shop. There is no point going beyond the linear path.\n\nExploration===\nNon-existent. As stated above, there is no loot worth getting, and no paths that lead to anything interesting. It's nothing but an accumulation of dead ends, and next zones. During your travels, every zone has exactly 1 return path, and 1 progression path. Every map is also given to you, which is readily at your fingertips. There is nothing that can cause you to take a dead end path except your own curiosity, which they do not reward. This game is the very definition of linear. \n\nProgression/Consistency===\nAs I progressed through the game, it seemed like they threw a lot of the comic relief and good character development out the window. Everybody just became buddy buddy, there was no internal conflict, and no character retained anything that made them interesting during their introduction. This bothered me the most. \n\nOverall===\nThere is a lot more about the game that bothered me, but I'm already bored of writing this. I loved the characters at first, but it felt like they stopped trying halfway through the game. I also feel like a lot of the game aspect was a bit ill-conceived.

He isn't afraid to tell people off and doesn't opt into heroic deeds mindlessly.\n+Combat: There is a wide variety of spells and skills, and the combo system is great.\n+Art: The character portraits are varied, distinct, and well constructed.\n+UI: It might not be the most minimal UI, but it is well thought out, looks nice, and has a lot of options for easy navigation (excluding page up/page down requirement.)\n+Sound: Satisfying navigation sounds...and...come on, that music though.\n+Dynamic: There are ways to change the difficulty, types of mobs, and rewards you encounter.\n+Progression: Every levelup really feels like it makes you better, and there are so many things you can upgrade and level.\n+Convenience: You can skip animations and dialogue with ease!\n+Save Slots: Thankfully, as is standard, there are plenty to use.\n+Settings: Plenty to mess around with.\n+Tutorial: While at first a bit obtrusive in the \"Try walking to walk!\" sense, it is actually very comprehensive, and you will have zero holes in your knowledge of how to play. This also makes the game EXTREMELY kid friendly.\n\n[h1][b]Cons[/b][/h1][b] I wish to state these are minor, except the last two.[/b]\n-Story: Relatively generic, but it does have its good points.\n-Dialogue: Tropes and lack of inspiration abounds. However, I like the references, and I think some of it is meant to be in the spirit of parody.\n-Camera: It sort of moves on its own...slowly, and you can move it yourself...slowly.\n-Performance: This is a VERY minor con, but there are ocassional slowdowns when loading an area, and expect to potentially wait a bit if you tab out of the game.\n-Strategy: Or the lack thereof. Unfortunately resistances, normal attacks, and weaknesses are not differentiated enough to make you REALLY hurt if you don't plan, and often party positioning is of very little significance.\n-Fodder: The regular mobs quickly become walking goodies and experience that pose little threat. As you progress, most of the bosses will also enter this category.\n\n[h1][b]Neutral[/b][/h1]\n+/- While the level design in terms of art can be fairly varied, unfortunately, many assets or whole levels are recycled. So I'm a bit mixed on this one.\n+/- Fanservice: While almost always tame (excluding harley...) it does exist.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[h1][b]Introduction[/b][/h1]\n\nWelcome to Fairy Fencer F...yep, that's a name! In Fairy Fencer F, the big bad and the big good fought a long battle ages ago and both were sealed as a result. In this world, the divine weapons they fought with/used to seal each other are called Furies, and are essentially inhabited by/an alternate form of Fairies. Those who wield the Furies and collect the Fairies to attempt to unseal the Goddess or Vile God are called Fencers.You play a Fencer called Fang, who likes Food.\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]\n\nIn Fairy Fencer F, scenes and towns act like menus in a visual novel, while the overworld map is a literal map with interest points you can visit. Upon entering one of these areas, you can move freely. In battle, each character can move within a certain circumferance each turn, and you can select skills/magic from an easily accessible menu, or just hit enter to attack it normally. You can also use the menu for special abilities and to select items.\n\nWhile the story is, broadly speaking, cliche, I like a lot of its finer points. An easy example is that while black force and white force waged war and both fell, it is up to you to do the work to unseal them, you get to choose who, and you get a share of the power from extracting the weapons sealing them. Likewise, the game allows a lot of variety in dungeons through \"World Shaping,\" a feature that lets you alter the properties of the dungeons such as exp/item rewards, the mobs themselves, or outright give yourself certain buff/debuffs.\n\nCombat is relatively fun, and the combo system makes it unexpectedly engaging. The downside to combat, however, is the almost complete lack of strategy required. You'll probably always win no matter what you do.\n\n[h1][b]Graphics[/b][/h1]\n\nSo the graphics are a mixed bag. They're good...in a way. The art can have a lot of variety, and this includes the level design art, but the levels themselves can be outright rehashes if not just using rehashed assets. I think the UI is overall nicely done, but some of the elements could be a bit sharper or have a bit less/more going on. The character art is pretty great, actually, but...you won't see much animation. This is pretty much the common trend. \"Nice enough...but.\"\n\nI think that even with all of its faults considered, the graphics really are entirely fine, its just that in comparison to modern games it could use a facelift/seems dated. An easy example would be how much this game would benefit from better/higher res textures in the dungeons. Are they horrible? No, they look decent, just not good, and the quality itself is lacking...blurry/etc.\n\n[h1][b]Audio[/b][/h1]\n\nThe audio in Fairy Fencer F has far fewer counterpoints than everything else. The music can be quite nice, as background ambience or high-octane bloodpumpers, but you're going to get a bit tired of hearing some things repeatedly. I find, unlike many games, that the menu sound hits the sweet spot between pleasant and assertive.\n\nWhile I quickly switched from English to Japanese, I didn't find the voice acting to be especially bad in the English, but the voices themselves kind of took away from the experience for me. On the other hand, the Japanese voice acting was better than expected. The voices suit the characters, the timing, and the emotions seemed synced to where they should be in delivery. \n\nOverall the sound is good when you notice it, unobtrusive when you don't. I did have ONE issue with it: there is a very jarring popping sound that randomly occurs.\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]\n\nThis is a fairly solid JRPG, great for a dive into a new world, and good for fans of the genre, but not for those who really want to be challenged. If you like easy or story-based games, or even just having a little fun while unlocking/collecting things, this is a good choice. Great as a genre introduction or for young kids.\n\nI will repeat: If you want to be challenged (Dark Souls, SMT, Mother, Valkyria Chronicles, etc.) you should definitely look elsewhere. Otherwise...I think it is worth the full price.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1444507479, "timestamp_updated": 1444508754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.729217", "comment_count": "19", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18415669": {"recommendationid": "18415669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008713957", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467456908}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Humor cinco estrellas, una historia aceptable y la jugabilidad no est\u00e1 mal.

Dragoon, Breath of fire, Star ocean ) and since the ps2 era I have been looking for decent RPG games as they seem as rare as unicorns these days.\n\nI bought this game on a whim, was on sale and I just recently been watching alot of anime again and decided \"Why not?\"\n\nVery happy I did, really brought back some memories for me, the classic turn base combat with over the top moves that have cut scenes. The classic hero line ups ( hotheaded boy, cute girl, geek girl etc ) and just that lighthearted playstyle that puts a smile on your face. \n\nThe music in this game shocked me also, I really loved the music in this game!..and not just the battle music too or the transform epic rock music thats voiced. but the back ground music of the game areas have a really good sound too and some voiced in japanese. really makes you enjoy just walking around or just grinding more.\n\nThe story of the game overall is ok, not amazing in truth. I did play it in English so maybe it did not get its full Japanese justice to the story as it was intended, and the game is not very long. But it has very good endgame content and choices/secret options in the game that changes the whole story ( such as in a second playthrough you get a playable guy I never got in first playthrough etc ) so there is replayablity.\n\nI would 100% recommend this game to any JRPG fan or anime fan overall.

I'll write this review so simple (before this review, i'm already wrote the review about this game, but i can't post it because of my electricity problem.)\n\nPros:\n1. JRPG filled with cute girls...\n2. There's some funny scene\n3. Great soundtrack\n4. Great gameplay (skills, attack styles, etc)\n5. You can upgrade your character\n6. You can boost the dungeon (using fury)\nAnd the best of that is\nIt has male character & harem style (LOL)\n\nCons:\n1. Graphic more worst than HN Re;Birth 2 (and Re;Birth 2 more worst than Re;Birth 1) Idk what should I say... I can't say this game is a classic JRPG (because there's some scene that having best graphics (ex: short movie in-the game)) well... I can say it looks like an old game that should run on Pentium III and GeForce GT8xxx...\n2. I'm using dlc (swimwear set).

Solid 60 FPS at 1080p and not buggy.  Other than a little stutter on enemy load on level entry, it's flawless.  Other companies should strive to port games like this.\n- Visually beautiful.  Characters, outfits, effects, it\u2019s all really nice to look at.\n- Character and skill advancement system has a good \u2018hook\u2019 to it to keep interesting.\n- Music is wonderful.\n\nThe Bad\n- Character personalities are extremely 1-dimensional.  There are no characters that I even remotely care for as they are clich\u00e9 incarnate.\n- Level designs are completely uninspired, and at no point do I feel like I\u2019m exploring.  Enemy and item placements make no sense.\n- Story is simple and boring.  There\u2019s no sense of tension, which is likely due to the uninteresting characters.\n- Combat gets \u2018old\u2019 in that it\u2019s a bit grindy.  Battles are solved with generally the same strategy every time, fairize meter resets, and enemy formations are not varied enough.\n\nIt reminded me a lot of the Neptunia series.

what to expect. You can skip reading this and pick it up as you will fit right into Fairy Fencer F.\n\nFairy Fencer F ditches the futuristic feel of the Hyperdimension games and returns to the more traditional scene. Countryside with shopkeeps and all kinds of taverns. It feels very Atelier-esque. Basically, Hyperdimension Neptunia, but set in the scenery of Atelier Rorona/Atelier Totori.\n\nYou play as Fang, a [spoiler]male[/spoiler] main character and meet [strike]Nep-Nep in red hair and wings[/strike] Eryn, a fairy that inhabits a weapon. Together you must find 100 other fairies to revive the Goddess and stop the Vile God from destroying the world\n\n...you know, standard JRPG stuff.\n\n\nWhile I joke about Fairy Fencer F being Hyperdimension Neptunia in a different setting, FFF actually does a good job in separating itself from HN. Sure there are Nep references here and there (Pudding!) but on the whole, FFF really does feel like it's own universe. \n\nIf anything, the game sort of feels too short. It's about half of Hyperdimension Neptunia. Half the party members, half the dungeons, half the items and half the length to beat a playthrough. \n\nOne thing FFF beats Neptunia over though, is a fully fleshed out combo system for attacks. While Special Attacks are rather limited (Each Character has around ~5 of these) the standard attacks can be combo'd with an insane amount of styles. Your weapon will automatically shift from a sword, to a gun, to a scythe or arrow depending on how you set up your chain attacks. Also, the EXE gauge returns in the form of \"Fairize\". Build up the gauge and Fairize to do double the damage.\n\nAnother thing that FFF does uniquely, is the Fairies themselves. I really liked this. You can assign any fairy you have to any of your party members, and each Fairy has different stats to boost the character with. Equip a Fairy that gives you bonus Fire damage to a member who specializes in Fire attacks to do insane damage. \n\nI wish there were more fairies though -- the game says you have to find 100 fairies to revive the goddess, yet I believe there are only around ~45 fairies you can actually obtain. They all range from badass dragons and monsters to cutesy fox girls and buff tough-talking dudes. They each have their own charm (they are all fully voiced too!) and I just loved collecting all of these different kinds of fairies.\n\nI would have liked to of had an option to take fairies from defeated foes. Several enemies and baddies had some very fantastic and cute looking fairies that I would of liked to add to my roster instead of them just dying. Yeah sure the dude is dead, but I can take his cute fairy and make her my companion can't I? ;_;\n\nI hope Fairy Fencer F gets a sequel. I'd love to play another one. It has it's own unique charm that's different from Hyperdimension Neptunia.  Heck, you know what would be even greater? A Hyperdimension Neptunia x Fairy Fencer F crossover.

I can't remember the last time I power played an RPG as thoroughly as this one. \n\nI have gone through two playthroughs already and going for a third to get my last ending. Japanese and English voice acticing are amazingly done, though if you choose to hear the game in Japanese you will be treated to some extra voiced content when viewing some Sub-Events back in town. While the game is not punishingly difficult and never posing much of a challenge with the main storyline, there is a degree of challenge present in the sidequests to keep things from being a boring button masher. \n\nWord of advice to completionists not wanting to miss anything on their first playthrough, upon entering a new dungeon and viewing the cutscene, leave immediately and go back to town and accept Lola's quests as they are time sensitive. Try to fight every enemy you see at least once, inspect the maps throroughly to look out for diamonds containing possibly missable loot and obtain the Item Sonar ability as soon as you can. \n\nOverall I recommend this game highly to any JRPG fan that is into a good story filled with likeable characters with a great balance of drama, action and comedy.\n", "timestamp_created": 1442659821, "timestamp_updated": 1442659821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18080542": {"recommendationid": "18080542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012141757", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 2633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467870658}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great rpg game that follows most of the old classic rpg elements. \nlevel grinding: check\nloot farming: double check unforunately (you'll know why)\nGREAT and LOVEABLE CHARACTERS: YES!

Most people that catch me playing it think it looks really cool, and you get that feeling while playing it too. The dialogue is often funny and the characters will even surprise you, but it's still as a whole a kind've hollow experience.\n\nIt's easy to become overpowered, the monsters and environments aren't very diverse, the story is pretty generic with no real revelations or challenges, and sometimes the characters seem bored and flippant about everything that going around, not to mention the bad guys aren't very interesting or intimidating. Depth is certainly not the games forte, but I didn't end up minding it too much.\n\nIt's actually kind of nice to have nothing invested sometimes, the characters almost seem aware that they're in a silly JRPG and the developers put in plenty of missables/grinding/extras for people hoping for more of a challenge. There's so much fun small stuff packed in, like all 39 of the furies you can collect having something to say about current events, or buffing/debuffing areas to grind more efficiently. Lots of cool ideas with the battle system, even though it mostly doesn't matter since you can blow away anything in the main game after level 40. Even though the characters aren't going to have any complex problems or feelings, they are all colorful and enjoyable, I ended up liking everyone and having a hard time choosing my party.\n\nIf you really dig playing RPGs and don't mind a bit of repetivieness and grasping plot points, it's a really fun game. I feel like I've been negative, but I really loved it quite a bit (obviously... my hours)!

Exactly! What's not to like?\nThat's why I easily can recommend this game for everybody. You can stop reading here and go play a game. Want to know more? keep reading\n\nThe game has fairy simple and straightforward story, the battle between good and evil, it's not particularly interesting but passable. Characters are not bad, even though some of them have seelie habits.\n\nBut most importantly a game is fun to play. How fun? In sprite of being very combat heavy it doesn't feel like it, mostly because dungeons aren't big and manageable in one sit.\n\nEnough puns, let's get serious.\nOnto combat itself. All characters have skills (unique to character), magic, physical attacks of different weapons styles and one special skill which can be used in fairisied form. All of those have range, hit count and power. String of attacks until you are hit by enemy is a combo of course and you'll get that tingly feeling all over after launching a good one, also you can trigger avalanche attacks and do aerial combos. All this makes combat varied and fun.\n\nThere is a slight balance issue, though. A game is supposed to be played at least twice, first time around it feels like you are underleveled most of the time, the second time that you are too powerful already. It could have been easily avoided by having normal and hard modes, imo. On the bright side, it being as it is, makes all playthroughs after the first one really fast.\n\nAnd not so good part: some of those ingame challenges and some achievements are mean, unfair and unnecessary time consuming.", "timestamp_created": 1442513322, "timestamp_updated": 1442513322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18071421": {"recommendationid": "18071421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128369065", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443633259}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is extremely short passed it two times ..i got lola both playthroughs \ni even got to lvl 80 on my first playthrough.. it only took 15hrs to finish my first play and i did not skip a dam thing i saw all the events  hope the new game is ALOT LONGER then this. \nOnce you finish the story their really isnt any end game content other then the tower\n\n\nshortest compile heart game i've ever played\nstill recommend because it's not bad a bad game just short\n", "timestamp_created": 1442501355, "timestamp_updated": 1442501355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18066114": {"recommendationid": "18066114", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966542993", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441601514}, "language": "english", "review": "This reveiew is based on one playthrough of the game.

Most faires gave both a (+) & a (-).  Still didn't improve overall game difficulty.\n\nBattles are easy to learn, manage, and fun to watch. Quickly becomes repetitive. \n\nEquipment was too easy to come by to bother making it with mats. Level growth was automatic boosts to all stats, and the only variation is via equipped Fairy and Weapon Points (WP).  Don't get me started on the player specific abilities, that is a sordid story rife with complaints.\n\nOn the plus side WP had a good deal of variation, but alot of the magic/weapon attacks seemed either useless or overtly interchangeable with 2-3 others.  Why would I want to use magic to cure a debuff if there is an item for it?   Nothing in the game denies the use of items.  Granted AoE dispell of all debuffs was nice, but characters were only ever afflicted with one at any given time.  Not mentioning most were temporary or lacked any sort impact on the battle.\n\nIt was fun to make a bunch of items I'd never need or use, though. (Max Elixirs, the AoE HP pots, etc)\n\nSome people complain about the AoE targeting sensitivity being too high, but these people are just lazy. This is easily remedied by rotating the camera.\n\n[b]Game Stability and Hardware Req'd - 9/10 - [/b] Game has low hardware requirements but remains nice to look at.  Art style and quality gel together well.  Objects in the world look like they belong and doesn't have any obvious/jarring visual errors.  \n\nLoses a point for poor dungeon initialization programming.  Major FPS drops everytime a new dungeon is loaded, due to all the mobs being spawned simultaneously.  Major programming bug that should have been fixed prior to port.\n\n[b]Voice Acting and Music - 9/10 - [/b]To my surprise, the english voice acting was superb.  I'll probably play through the game again with the original voices to see how it compares, but not anytime soon.\n\nMusic was enjoyable for the first 10hrs or so. By then you've heard almost 80% of the music you'll hear all game and they're just on repeat.  Was nice that one of the battle specific songs was swapped out halfway through.  It was seriously grinding on my nerves, by then.\n\n[b]TLDR[/b]\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game.  The characters were entertaing to watch and the plot held together.   NOT worth $30.  I'd consider it to be worth $20.  \n\nI still recommend it for the story and characters.  It was fun to play through and I will prolly play NG+ one time through just to see what it's like and what changes. \n\n[b]Note:[/b]  Despite seeing alot of reviews referencing the Neptunia series, I've only played a few hours of Rebirth and hated it.  There are similarities in gameplay, but the story here isn't a bland piece of s*** built solely for comedic effect and wrought with plotholes.

Review time. After quite a few hours with this game, I can safely go into detail about whether you should buy it or not, keeping it spoiler free.\n\nIf you are TL:DR then here's the nutshell version: I love it.\n\nSTORY: Again not going to spoil anything in the story and rather experience it yourself. However, in terms of how good it is...It can be slow to repetitive at times, and i think I skipped a scene at one point because I felt it was irrelevant. The story itself is okay with quite a few twists to keep things refreshing. Though I feel that the story may be the weakest element in the game, AGAIN not that it's bad, it's enjoyable, but it ain't exactly perfect. If it's worth something, I did tear up a bit at times from certain heavy moments. SADLY: You don't get to make any real choices, it's rather straight forward with only three endings. One you get from ignoring all subevents involving your party. And two for...just google it.\n\nCharacters: Most if not all of them are brimming with personality and are unique in their own way, including the Fairies in which our main characters possess. The protagonist thankfully is not the cliche brave and goody-to-shoes hero, rather far from it as you will see if you start the game. Each character is lovable and I remember their names well, and I'm bad at remembering names, so that's quite the accomplishment.\n\nGameplay: Turn based as one might expect. Nothing much to say. You can use basic attacks, magic, or special animated skills to attack your opponents. You may also customize combos in which to attack your enemies with. Each character also has a special ability with special effects for each individual. There are other elements as well which are quite refreshing, but I don't feel like going into detail since it would be explained in the game later.\n\nSoundtrack: Fairly nice, especially when you use you VERY VERY powerful ability or 'FAIRIZE' as well. Though it can get a bit bland, but overall there are some tracks that stick out.\n\nVoice Acting: FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS!!! This is important! In my opinion i highly recommend you play this game with the japanese voice over in the options tab. The english dub is...there for those who really hate japanese, but I don't...find them believable like I do with the japanese Dub. The characters feel more alive without the english voice over, and the experience with the game fell a bit when I tried the english version for a while. Japanese is my recommended voice over.\n\nOverall rating: I would at least give this game a 8/10. Still places to improve on, but I've played a solid 24 hours with it, and even if you beat the game, you can restart the story without losing all your progress and restarting. There is replay value depending how you do on the first run.\n\nWARNING: I do not think there is an autosave for this game so before you leave and murderize your computer when you come back, always save. ALWAYS. I didn't lose any progress because i was paranoid as hell since the game leaves save points to help you do it manually. But you can also do it on the world map.\n\nHope this was helpful.", "timestamp_created": 1441822738, "timestamp_updated": 1441822738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17946445": {"recommendationid": "17946445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075466721", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 4267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441731885}, "language": "english", "review": "here my review..in english:\n\nPositive:\n+ short but good and serious story\n+ More Love for Harla and Effole please :3\n+ some good laughing moments\n+ nice visuals and stable fps in my opinion\n+ superior to the ps3 version\n+ easy gameplay\n+ addicting gameplay\n+ love the voiced dialogues (japanese)\n+ begins not so serious and then....\n+ love the music\n+ the animations a clear and lovely...\n+ a good example again, how to make a good gaming from few things\n+ unique characters (fetishes)\n+ interesting development\n+ nice fury/fairy system\n+ i enjoyed the sub-events dialogues\n+ Artwork is great as always...\n+ and much more\n\nNeutral:\n+/- some achievements are harder then in neptunia\n\n\nMinor negativ points:\n- after long runs client freeze with error (be sure to save often)\n- shorter gameplay then in neptunia (did ALL, 2 playthroughs, tower, dungeons,  level 999, achievements in about 67 hours)\n- I miss some interaction with the sub chars, I love the subchars personality, I wish there was some endings and more interactions with them.\n\n\nIts a fun Game and since  i love the Neptunia series a lot...I give this Game a stable 87% in my opinion :3 \n\nI support you guys..that you can make more and greater games in the future....", "timestamp_created": 1441735609, "timestamp_updated": 1441735704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17937552": {"recommendationid": "17937552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098473887", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441221786}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Exelente juego, me gusto mucho.

of battles alone.\n\nNow lets get to some of the dirty bussiness.\n\nThere are indeed still copy paste monster if not at least less. \nSometimes the game just comes out cliche and the timing of some things are inappropriate.\nEnglish has barely any lines for combat, you may be listening to \"Fang/Pain don't hurt\" I don't think any of us can figure out what the fuck Fang is trying to say, either way he needs a lesson in grammar.\nI like the combat but I can see it getting repetetive for others and you still indeed need to farm extensively but at least world forming will help with that at the same time it seems more difficult to farm.\nThere are skills that become literally useless further into the game.\n\nLets get into some more nuetral grounds.\nThey indeed have removed your ability to change weapons for lore sake but they have replaced it with a system where you equip a second fairy next to your main fairy which resides in your weapon. Anyways this secondary fairy will give you stronger and more passive buffs the more you train them because they do indeed level and I believe cap at 10 though they do take a bit more EXP than most characters.\n", "timestamp_created": 1441345761, "timestamp_updated": 1441345761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483419", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17866170": {"recommendationid": "17866170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126469102", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439322652}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "parecia inicialmente um neptunia com novos personagems,mas na vdd ele s\u00f3 \u00e9 uma vers\u00e3o ruim de neptunia", "timestamp_created": 1441305266, "timestamp_updated": 1441305266, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17858666": {"recommendationid": "17858666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183283177", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440875793}, "language": "english", "review": "Lola : nee nee, soko no oniichan. oniichan fencer deshou? ii jouhou ga aru dakedo, dou?\nX: hou, jouhou-ya ka. omoshirou sou da na, kikasete moraou ka\nLola : jaa, sono maeni, 30k gold choudai!\n\nenglish\n\nLola: hey brother, you're fencer, right? i've got some great infomation, interested?\nX: ahh, so you're an informant. seem insteresting. whaddaya got?\nLola: but before that, gimme 30k gold!\n\n\nLOLOLOL i really love that one!\n20/10\n\nUPDATE: serious mode ON\n\nif you never played nepnep, DONT WASTE your MONEY to buy this game and DONT WASTE TIME to write bad review lol.\nthe gameplay/game mechanic of nepnep and fang are nearly same, visual novel mixed with RPG game so that the player doesn't boring when listening to the story\nthe differences are the character and the story.\nso like i said earlier, DONT WASTE MONEY and TIME if you dont like visual novel mixed with RPG\n\nand since i really like rola, i recommended this game :D", "timestamp_created": 1441265094, "timestamp_updated": 1444309647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407431", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17849765": {"recommendationid": "17849765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101447520", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449820928}, "language": "english", "review": "i havent finished this game but its good yes good story, good graphics,good plot if you know what i mean", "timestamp_created": 1441214182, "timestamp_updated": 1441214182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17826131": {"recommendationid": "17826131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030894674", "num_games_owned": 746, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439837125}, "language": "english", "review": "NO nep and certainly not as good.", "timestamp_created": 1441099875, "timestamp_updated": 1441099875, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.391667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17824042": {"recommendationid": "17824042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042998347", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441148972}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a great fast-paced RPG, with a great story line to if.

sont bons quand il s'agit de faire des RPG qui marquent.\n\nCommen\u00e7ons par le commencement, au d\u00e9but \u00e9taient les Agarest. Puis sont arriv\u00e9s les Hyperdimension MK, avec leur univers d\u00e9jant\u00e9 et broyeur de neurones au possible, versant dans le n'importe quoi le plus dantesque et le plus jouissif, tant dans le gameplay que l'histoire et les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences. Puis un jour est apparu 3F (Fairy Fencer F).\n\nAvec :\n-Son h\u00e9ros plus japonais que nature, ultra-st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9 (le mec d\u00e9braill\u00e9, qui pense qu'\u00e0 bouffer, donc l'affinit\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire est le feu, et tous les clich\u00e9s qui vont avec).\n-Sa bande son tr\u00e8s rock \n       Alors l\u00e0 les amis, laissez-moi vous dire que \u00e7a envoie. La bande originale de 3F est peut-\u00eatre une des meilleures qu'il m'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 d'entendre sur un J-RPG depuis... Les tables de chiffres avec des amas de pixels en forme de personnages. Non je n'ai pas connu cette \u00e9poque, et oui, j'y ai quand-m\u00eame jou\u00e9 parce que Nep.\n\n-Son gameplay en apparence tr\u00e8s calqu\u00e9 sur les hyperdimension, \u00e0 ceci pr\u00e8s qu'il se trouve \u00eatre plus acc\u00e8s sur les combos et types d'armes que sur le remplissage de jauge pour attaque sp\u00e9 et guardbreak. Oui, question guardbreak on oublie, les boss ont juste UNE jauge de HP, pas de jauge de garde. Les combos ressemblent donc \u00e0 du Hyperdimension, mais les affrontements n'ont rien \u00e0 voir.\n\n-Son syst\u00e8me d'am\u00e9lioration des armes, juste parfait, rien \u00e0 dire. A ceci pr\u00e8s que le skin des armes n'est pas modifi\u00e9 par certaines upgrades. Un tantinet dommage, mais personne n'est parfait, n'est-ce pas ?\n\n-Son sc\u00e9nar, oh oui son sc\u00e9nar. Et l\u00e0 attachez vos ceintures, c'est rien de tr\u00e8s brillant mais qu'est-ce que \u00e7a emballe ! L'id\u00e9e de base est simplissime : Des Fencer s'entretuent joyeusement pour collecter des Furies dans l'optique dragonballesque de r\u00e9veiller une divinit\u00e9 qui leur accorderait le voeu de leur choix. Alors non, pas de background hyper pouss\u00e9 avec une atmosph\u00e8re myst\u00e9rieuse et... Non. On se contente de suivre cette joyeuse bande de clampins \u00e0 travers un monde donjon-rpg, avec une trame lin\u00e9aire fourmillant de petits events en tous genres. \n\nEt Soudain, c'est le drame.\nA partir d'un point critique du sc\u00e9nar, tout change radicalement. Les personnages ultra-superficiels au d\u00e9but font soudain preuve d'une profondeur toute autre, en particulier notre Fencer mal d\u00e9grossi et son app\u00e9tit d\u00e9mesur\u00e9 (pire qu'un ado, si si c'est possible.

Fencer F is an interesting game, it somewhat appears in the shadow of the Hyperdimension series and with the polish that those games had you should have high expectations for this one.\n\nIn the end those expectations are met. It certainly is fun and hilarious, you really cant go wrong with it, there is a pretty nice bang for buck with this title. \n\nStoryline: At first its pretty linear and well it drags you along with what seems like a cookie cutter story. Well things change and things happen which arent expected. The various endings are a bit lack luster though, they are bitter sweet but leave you wanting more. Though im not sure if this is getting a sequel, not even sure how they could do a sequel with the storyline this has. Its a lot more serious then hyperdimension but its still full of various jokes. \n\nCombat: The combat is very similar to that of hyperdimension's, by that i mean its got nice effects, nice moves, variation etc etc. Unless hyperdimension you have to earn the combats and the amount of attacks you can do, personally i think its a bit of a pain, it can become a grind fest. You control three charecters in this game.\n\nThe port: The port is good, no crashes at all, audio lag for a few seconds if you tab out but that fixes itself very quickly. Textures are serviceable, they could be higher res but i cant complain, they are good enough. The game runs at a solid 60fps. It uses the windows resolution system which means you can go nuts with the resolution options, you want 4k thats fine, want 8k yeah it works(suprisingly well with my 680 20fps at 8k isnt bad). \n\nOverall: If you like anime, rpgs, funny storys, bang for buck, multiple endings, hack n slash etc then this is a really nice game to buy.\n\nSide note this game is optimized for a controller which honestly you guys need, many games work a lot better with controllers and this is one of them. it would be nice for it to be optimized for mouse and keyboard, id say that is currently the biggest issue.", "timestamp_created": 1440882691, "timestamp_updated": 1440882691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547038", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17780265": {"recommendationid": "17780265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114110601", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497050853}, "language": "english", "review": "decent game play, psychotic characters. good game in my books.", "timestamp_created": 1440880394, "timestamp_updated": 1440880394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17774114": {"recommendationid": "17774114", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978705200", "num_games_owned": 1556, "num_reviews": 248, "playtime_forever": 1896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439344265}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Yo dude. What's happening?\"\n\"Um...Hi.\"\n\"I have a question for you. What does the 'B' in Susan B. Anthony stand for?\"\n\"Uhhhh\"\n\"BOOYAH!\" I pull a silver dollar out of my shirt pocket and present it and my car keys to the confused valet.\n\"Take good care of it and I'll throw in another Susanna.\" I remark with a chuckle. My name's PepsimanVsJoe and apparently I'm supposed to write a review for Fairy Fencer F. The problem is-\n\"The problem is you just gave your keys away!\" My partner cuts in. \n\"Huh? That was the valet.\"\n\"Have you ever heard of a Taco Bell having valet parking?!\" He looks at me like I'm an idiot. \"God you're dumb. Yet somehow you can manage to put two words together. I mean for crying out loud you don't even play videogames. I don't even play videogames! I hate them!\" He sighs, cracks his knuckles for an eternity, and continues. \"Luckily for us, there are three people that enjoyed playing Fairy Fencer F, and they're interested in talking about it.\"\n\"Really? Wow. I'd love to hear from them.\"\n\n\"...They're right over here.\" He leads me to a booth near the back of the high-class restaurant.\nA young man extends a hand, which I promptly shake. \"Hi PepsimanVsJoe! My name is Piven. My favorite games include Halo, Call of Duty, and Gears of War.\" \n\"And you like Fairy Fencer F? Really?\"\n\"Yes...well okay yeah it sounds strange when you think about it. Fairy Fencer F is an anime RPG about fairies and crap, but I think it's a well-done game. It reminds me of...well...Taco Bell. It's comfort food, the kind you never really get tired of. Playing online multiplayer gets pretty stressful, so it's nice having something I can chill with. The protagonist, Fang, is an interesting guy. He talks about eating and sleeping a lot, but he also has a strong sense of justice.\"\n\n\"I stopped listening after you compared the game to Taco Bell.\" said a voice hiding behind a Playstation Vita. Ignoring my meager attempts at a handshake, he introduces himself: \"The name is Joss. I play all of the RPGs. I'm an RPG sponge.\" \n\"What would you say is Fairy Fencer F's most admirable quality?\" I ask.\n\"Piven merely glossed over the storyline, which is actually pretty well done. It shows a surprising amount of ambition, even if it can be uneven at times. Thankfully the well-written characters make the far-fetched aspects of the plot easier to swallow. Also, unlike the Neptunia series, Compile Heart's bread & butter, this game isn't as light-hearted, which makes for a good change of pace.\"\n\"Yeah, The Neptunia games are pretty cool.\" Piven cuts in. \"But you missed the reason why someone would prefer Fairy Fencer F.\"\n\n\"Oh really?\" Joss frowns. Actually I'm just guessing he's frowning. It's hard to tell since he hasn't moved his face from behind that Vita.\n\"Playing FFF really highlights the pacing issues the Neptunia games can sometimes have. In those games you can spend a lot of time repeating certain dungeons, or going to multiple locations just to view more cut-scenes. Sometimes I just want to play the game, or at least get some new characters and have them stick around for more than a dungeon or two.\"\n\"...You have a point, FFF does seem a bit fresher, despite sharing many of the same qualities as the Neptunia series. However, FFF lacks the unique personality of the Gamindustri's culture and lore. That's not even considering the complete lack of amusing references and characters designed after your favorite games.\"\n\"My favorite games? Last I checked. Most of the NPCs in Neptunia are Merio, Looigi, and a bunch of other random nonsense from Japanese magazines that I've never heard of. They don't have anything to say, but I have to read every ridiculous comment that flies way over my head, just so I don't miss a plan or whatever else I need to 100% complete the game. At least Fairy Fencer F keeps everything focused. It tells a story I can relate to...at least as far as fairies transforming into weapons that are pulled out of the ground will allow.\" Before Joss can argue, he's cut off by -\n\n\"Name's Pam. I like 2D shooters, anything with a lot of action, and I'm weak for MMOs and Diablo-clones. You two fail to realize - or are completely ignoring -  the real problem with Fairy Fencer F: It's too easy! Sure, I can't go into these games expecting a level of depth comparable to hardcore dungeon-crawlers like Wizardry, but FFF is less challenging than the Neptunia games. At least those titles have the neat combo-systems, the three kinds of attacks, and so on. All I did in this game was mash buttons. The only fights I lost were when I was severely underleveled, and that was the DLC.\"\nI cut in \"You said you liked the game...didn't you?\"\n\"Of course I did! Compile Heart doesn't create challenging RPGs, but they deserve all the love in the world for making it so effortless to get through battles quickly. I can watch the flashy special moves, then just skip through everything for the real content: the characters and story.\"\n\"I agree.\" Piven speaks up. \"Compile Heart knows how to cater to its fans. They've captured an audience that ignores Visual Novels...by creating Visual Novels with RPG elements.\"\n\"Hate to say it, but I agree with dudebro.\" Joss admits. \"What makes this game enjoyable is that it allows the player to enjoy as much - or as little - of an RPG they want. They can avoid grinding and focus on equipment as well as tactics, or simply focus on what matters to them. Overall, I think we all just wanted a relaxing game, that didn't demand a lot from us.\"\n\n\"Psh...Grinding.\" Pam grumbles. \"The grind in this game is the worst. I think it's a law somewhere that Compile Heart has to include a couple ridiculous achievements that take forever. I think they do it just to sell DLC. Also this game has a plethora of minor cheevos. They're the kind where you get a little stat boost if you jump a thousand times or get the first strike in however many battles. It just seems like content for the sake of it, but at this point I'm just nitpicking.\"\n\"Hold up. Did I just admit to playing a Visual Novel?\" Piven looks like he wants to lie down and cry. \nMy partner, lulled to sleep by this incredibly fascinating dialogue, suddenly snaps awake. \"Well. There you have it PepsimanVsJoe. That was Piven, Joss, and Pam with their thoughts on the game. I expect a full write-up by tomorrow morning.\"\n\"I have the concluding paragraph already in my head.\" I tell him as I wave goodbye to everyone else. \"Thanks Mr. E\"\n\nFairy Fencer F is a polished and enjoyable adventure. For those who don't make it a point to challenge themselves, this RPG won't offer much in the way of depth. However, you will be too busy being charmed by its characters, art, decent storyline, and superb music to notice. Though it's also fair to say that non-fans of Neptunia, probably won't appreciate what this game brings to the table. The more traditional Western Fantasy might also be too much to bear for gamers expecting hi-tech futuristic worlds influenced entirely by videogames (not to mention the discouraging lack of Nep-Nep). Still, as somebody who is frequently swamped by hardcore dungeon-crawlers, complex and difficult 2D shooters, and the frustrating & fruitless endeavor that is raising my k/d ratio; I will always welcome Compile Heart. \n\nOvercome with the satisfaction that my brilliance brings, I don't even notice the valet running into me with my car.\n\n\"Ugh..\" My head is killing me. I slink out of my bed and nearly trip on a plastic cup. \"The hell? Oh right...the weeknight special.\" I say to myself. Sometimes after work I'll grab a super mega-64 oz gulpathon from the nearest gas station. Whatever I drink from that cup is then replaced with rum, vodka, scotch, whatever is on hand really.  Needless to say, having one of these every night probably isn't the greatest life choice.

So going into Fairy Fencer F, I was expecting a game with a half-arsed story, terrible game mechanics and a million anime girls. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the Male-to-Female character ratio is, rather than 100% female, closer to 1-1. There is almost an equal number. So the game delivers in providing a diversity of characters. tl;dr FFF character design > HDN\n\nFairy Fencer F is rich with dialogue, dialogue which comes in all forms. So far in fact, that as you collect 'furies' throughout the game and the corresponding fairies to each fury that are displayed in your inventory, each will have something to say on every topic in the game, it's endless fun to sit and browse through your fairies and learn each fairy's individual thoughts and point of view. The comedic value of the game is significant, I was provided with a significant portion of laughter. There are feels, and the soundtrack matches the artwork and tone of the game almost spot on.\n\nA significant flaw in FFF is the difficulty level, this game is far too easy, it doesn't take a lot of skill to play, which is fine for the most part with JRPGs since they are mostly story-driven (You only have to look at final fantasy to see that). However, it wouldn't hurt to throw in an actual challenge once in a while.\n\nAll in all the game was pretty good, I grew attached to some of the characters, I was pleasantly surprised by FFF, I was going into this game expecting to be utterly disappointed by a subpar game, drenched in 'waifus'. HOWEVER, as was made clear in my review, this game was far from that.\n\nGameplay - 7.5/10\nCharacter design / development - 8/10\nStory - 8/10\nSoundtrack - 9/10\nArtwork - 9.5/10\n\nRoom for improvement, but a fantastic game!", "timestamp_created": 1440601074, "timestamp_updated": 1440601218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17724820": {"recommendationid": "17724820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118752533", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468554610}, "language": "english", "review": "Harley is best girl", "timestamp_created": 1440600451, "timestamp_updated": 1440600451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17719138": {"recommendationid": "17719138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067546355", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440561672}, "language": "english", "review": "+The gameplay was prety good, but...\n\n-The game's story is just............ too short, and too predictable.\n\n-It's too VN like, but with only three different ending that doesn't seem to be that different one with another.\nThe player's choice doesn't matter at all.\nAt first i was like \"cool, i can set free the vile god instead of the godess!\", but it does not change the storyline even a bit.\n\nOverall i was a bit dissapointed\n", "timestamp_created": 1440562769, "timestamp_updated": 1440562769, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17711928": {"recommendationid": "17711928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085971974", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474445059}, "language": "thai", "review": "very good", "timestamp_created": 1440522819, "timestamp_updated": 1440522819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17704981": {"recommendationid": "17704981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220782340", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481044098}, "language": "english", "review": "I love how it mixes turnbased combat with a 3d enviroment that you maneuver through as you fight.

I have no problem with that because frankly I adore this battle system. Rather than just picking an enemy (or several enemies) like a typical JRPG, you move around a limited area on your turn and pick enemies then, sometimes with a box or something for which enemies you're going to hit. It adds a little extra element to it, in my opinion. Unlike Neptunia, basic attacks use a selection rather than an aiming box, so you can only attack one enemy at a time.\n\nPersonally I quite liked the story aswell, and as expected from Compile Heart (or at least, coming from Neptunia) I especially liked the characters. Except the ones I wasn't meant to like. There are only very few characters I don't find myself caring about, and they were either generic NPCs or showed up for only a short time. I do like how each o the fairies you collect has their own personlity in the menu, though.\n\nIn terms of being a port, it seems to be rather good. It's not once ran slowly for me, and in fact the framerate appears to be an improvement from the 30 that the PS3 original apparently had. I've only found one minor glitch so no problems there either. I don't know how well Keyboard and Mouse control, but it seems to have keyboard icons for menus which is a step up from Neptunia also.\n\nAll in all, I liked it.

I must say I was a little worried when I got sent back in time. I thought the game \"Yeah, you got sent back in time and you gotta do everything over again so you get girl.\" And boy, was I wrong. I mean the general idea is still revive the Goddess but with the way the story was written, it seems like it's actually sub-plot. That said this is the story of a lazy boy named Fang who prefers slack off in bed or eating Bahus' cooking and he is roped into reviving the Goddess by circumstance (and lots of peer pressure). And that's basically the gist of it.\n\nOnto gameplay. At first glance I thought this game would live up to the brutal difficulty of Re;Birth but it sadly didn't. However, I later realized that the game was designed to be played a certain way. And that is by stabbing furies various place in the world map and making use of what is called \"world shaping\". Let me give you the quick rundown. World shaping is an ability that fairies use when they are stabbed on the ground. They have a certain radius that are dictated by their level. Let's say that a fairy has a world shaping ability of -10% P.DEF and +10% M.ATK. This means that every creature in that dungeon (including you) have their physical defense decreased by 10% while all magical attacks are 10% stronger. There are various world shaping effects that help increase damage (taken and delivered), boost WP, experience, and even seal off skills which is accessable through Godly Revival provided you have the necessary fairies.\n\nOverall, I really love the amount detail put in the making of this game. Both story and gameplay wise. All characters have these quirks that make them stand out and provide an entertaining experience. There are some sexual innuendos, as well. Only one actually. It's a case of take 'em or leave 'em.\n\nI don't like saying that \"If you like anime, you will like this game.\" I don't like being that person. it's simply unintelligent.

Unlike the NepNep games, I actually hadn't played FFF when it originally came out. So, where to start...\n\nFor starters - if you like anime - this is probably more up your alley than NepNep. It has a much more serious tone yet still retains that sense of humor. It reads well. The plot is (mostly) solid. All-in-all, it was enjoyable.\n\nI like all the characters. Fang shows character development. Something which is largely absent from NepNep. Tiara and Eyrn do as well. Actually, all of them show character development. I guess that's part of what I liked too. Fang goes from a lazy bum who just wants to eat shit to a guy who gets shit done. As far as characters go - my favorite list goes something like Ethel, Eyrn, Tiara, Fang, Harley, Pippin...\n\nThis game leaves quite a bit unanswered. If you're an inquisitive sort, this game will wreck you. I find myself wanting to know some details which just weren't explained. Which is to say, most things don't leave me wanting answers. I'm hoping the sequel sheds some light on these.\n\nThere are some negatives. No game is perfect, of course.\n\nSome battles felt forced and lacked sense. I'm largely referring to the forced losses, which I feel it would be better if they just did story segments for some of them. With FFF, half the time I destroyed my MP meter only to get obliterated next phase when I actually *can* win the fight and it isn't a forced loss. It's too hard to tell the impossible battles from non-impossible. For example, [spoiler]before the final battle, the Marianne fight. During forced loss, she has three dots. You get her down to one, and then it RESTARTS, and she has six dots on her meter and it's Fang only. Seriously. Kinda unfair.[/spoiler]\n\nTL;DR - Best thing I played this year, but does have some flaws. Oh, and Ethel is the best. Also, [spoiler]Pippin = Excalibur[/spoiler]\n\nNote - I'm a Linux user, and I maintain the AppDB page for FFF on WineHQ. This game doesn't work perfectly on Wine at the moment.

It\u2019s also a console port, and as such, it has some peculiarities. \n\nFairy Fencer F is basically a turn-based RPG with beautiful anime-styled art. When you\u2019re not dungeon-crawling, you have a view of static maps and Visual Novel styled conversations with other characters. When you are dungeon crawling you get those same anime characters in 3D view. You only see the party leader until you enter a battle, and you can only choose so many of your friends to battle with you. \nBattles are turn based, but not static. You can move freely around a predesigned circular area of reach (and sometimes enemies will be outside this area), which gives you a sense of freedom despite the limitation, something move-by-places or only-x-steps type of turn based games don\u2019t give you. \n\nThe sound and voices are very nice and very fitting to the whole anime/fantasy theme, and I\u2019m particularly fond of the song used when you use \u201cfairize\u201d; it reminds me lots of the songs in Persona 3 and 4. By the way, did I mention you can choose between English and Japanese voices? Because you totally can. It had my heart right then and there.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll try to explain this as best I can. Basically you play as Fang, a Fencer, that is: a person who can wield Furies, which are weapons that contain fairies that add powers to the weapon/wielder. Your job is to go out and search for more furies - each one you get will grant you a new fairy. You can add these to your own weapon as \u201cresonance\u201d to make it stronger and give you some extra stats. The fairies you\u2019re currently using gain experience along with you and level up. Fairies are also ranked - the rank is used to remove the seals (swords) on the Goddess/God. While the story tells you to remove the Goddesses\u2019 seals, after the tutorial you can choose to remove the Vile God\u2019s seals as well, which is a neat touch! Each seal removed successfully adds different boosts/stats to the fairy used to remove it, which in turn adds it to you if it\u2019s the one you\u2019re using as resonance. Fairies that aren\u2019t currently being used in your weapons can be stabbed as their fury forms on the world map in order to provide various boosts, buffs and debuffs in the nearby dungeons (for instance, earn more exp, or gold, or drop rate\u2026 ). Since you can stab more than one fury into the ground, you can get quite a few boosts while on a single dungeon. \n\nYou have combos for physical attacks which you can customize, and you can at a fly switch between three different ones while attacking by simply pressing one key instead of another, all comfortably close by. Because you have so many ways to affect stats and boosts, the system ends up being quite flexible and enjoyable to play with.\nIt\u2019s a very interesting concept and I feel like I don\u2019t do it justice explaining it thus briefly. \n\nSaving is done through specific spots while inside a dungeon, or at any time within the world/city maps. While in the city you get to speak with a lot of characters and take up quests that can give you some prizes and can also be repeated (indefinitely, as it seems). The quests are fairly typical, but quick to get done, and go along with what rank you are. You can also craft some items to help on your journey. There is some romance in this game.\n\nBecause this was a console port, the controls at first can be a bit awkward (for instance, you can\u2019t use esc to exit menus, you must use backspace; you can use the mouse too, but it\u2019s really more of a hassle than using only the keyboard); however, once I grew used to them they were actually very sensibly placed and quite comfortable to use. I ended up using just the keyboard all the time. \n\nI do wish the game was free-roaming rather than turn based, and the fights do get a tad repetitive after a while, making the fighting aspect of the game feel a tad like a grind. However, the story is nice and full of funny moments and the characters are cute and extremely likeable, all of them with their own personalities, doubts and insecurities.\n\nThe game really makes you want to collect all the fairies and remove the seals to see what will happen, keeping you hooked with the story.

Character interactions is one of the main things I really enjoy with JRPGs so props to Iffy and Compa-chan.\n\nDLCs are nice to have but not really required to enjoy the game.. except for Tiara in towel. It is REQUIRED. It's the LAW. I mean seriously, the game will crash and Vile God would win if Tiara wasn't wearing that towel.\n\nI hope Advent Dark Force make it to Steam as well (maybe next year?)", "timestamp_created": 1440139120, "timestamp_updated": 1440139120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17637412": {"recommendationid": "17637412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069546410", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440130528}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u867d\u7136\u8bf4\u5730\u96f7\u793e\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u6211\u90fd\u662f\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70\u73a9\u73a9\u73a9\u7684 \u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e00\u4f5c\u6211\u5237\u7684\u6211\u7684\u809d\u90fd\u75bc\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1440118564, "timestamp_updated": 1440118564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502237", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17635533": {"recommendationid": "17635533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129409089", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517598678}, "language": "english", "review": "I really am enjoying this game.

I'm almost at the end so I may change some things upon completion but I'll just note how I feel so far.\n\nStory: It's nothing to write home about, the plot twists and the like are really obvious. That being said, just like in Neptunia it is really the characters that make the story enjoyable. The humor is good, and unlike some Rebirth 2, it doesn't really use whole lot of memes. The character interactions are fun and Tsunako is responsible for their designs which is always great in my opinion.\n\nGameplay: Again, see Neptunia. There can be a lot of grind depending on what you're trying to do but if you just play through you should have no trouble. In fact, the only time I felt there was a difficulty spike was on certain side missions when attempting to get extra furies. You have your level ups, increasing the strength of each character but beyond that there is the Weapon Points system, which allows you to choose extra stat bonuses as well as customize progression through choices in combo moves, as well as extending both combos and weapon range. The fury system serves the duel purpose of prividing both character boosts through stat upgrades as well as allowing you to change each area in subtle but noticable ways. You could increase both the weapons points gained while at the same time doubling the damage BOTH you and your enemies put out. Depending on how you use them, you can speed up some of the grind in game.\n\nControls: I mainly played with an Xbox 360 controller. Despite this the controls were very repsonsive. I only add this because I recently went through the PS3 version of Neptunia Victory and found the controls to be somehat lagging in comparison. I breifly used KB+M to get a feel in that regard, and for the short time I used them if felt just as good.\n\nMusic: Enjoyable, like most jrpg's if you like em the music is usually good, and Compile Heart always does well in that regard. \n\nIf you typically enjoy a lot of the jrpg's that have been coming out lately, you'll no doubt find this a charming and enjoyable game. I've still yet to beat it so I can't say much for replay value, but judging from what I've played it doesn't seem like there could be much, at least until more of the DLC is released. It's worth the time and for those still on the fence, if you catch it on sale like I did, it is more than worth the money.

Also, since this is an Iffy game expect a Grindfest for certain things, such as the Pub Quests, and sometimes leveling to do other things like the DLC dungeons.\n\nAlthough there is also things that can be easily missable if you don't check everything before progessing into a storyline dungeon. Most of the things that can be missed is Lola's Side Quests, and thankfully there's a guide for that along with getting another secret character too.\n\nSo if you're thinking this is just :nepnep: reskined, you're only half right.

The story is very good and detailed which also contains a lot of humour to make sure that the person playing it doesn't get too bored with the seriousness of it or just get fed up that the game is just filled with jokes ruining the feel of the game. The gameplay is also very good however the map design feels very repetetive which doesn't really ruin the game but it's just something they could of improved on. The combat is very good with the unique abilities everyone gets as well as the special element people are given, whether that be fire, earth, water etc. The DLC as well is very non important so it isn't one of those games which says that is compulsary that you should buy DLCs in order to proceed to the next part of the story.\nAll together i would rate this game a 9/10. It would be a 10/10 if the story was a bit longer and if when you complete the game it doesn't reset like it does in fallouts.

Easy achievement, just need some hardwork.\n\nNow let me review things up.\n\nPROS :\n1. Battles are very similiar to your typical Idea Factory game such as Neptunia, which is easy for me to understand.\n\n2. The WP Systems are unique since you don't need to bother ur equipment such as changing it (Armor and acc''re exceptional). You get to choose how the character would be, like if you improve their P-ATK, they'll be hitting as hard as they could and vice versa with the other attributes.\n\n3. Some of you might not know about this, but I found this interesting recently. If you change the voice from English to Japanese, you get to hear your fairy's voice act whenever u open the Fairies tab, since it didn't worked that way on English VA.\n\n4. Stories are good. Each protagonist have their own problem and are pretty interesting to talk with.\nGame itself is fun, since it pretty much have a fun dialogues.\n\nCONS :\n1. It's getting pretty easy on 2/3rd playthrough, since everything are much easier without handicap. (Handicap : Like add monster lvl to increased its HP, DMG, DEF, exp and gold or sth).\n\n2. The DLCs (except the costumes) are ruining the fun of this game. Told you, this game is ALREADY easy as it is without DLC, so don't bother to buy the Ultimate Weapon pack and others, unless you don't want to waste your time for 50 hours ++ grinding for 100% Steam Achievements. (44hrs gameplay and 86% achievement)\n\n3. Maps are pretty much the same, developer only change your spawn point, which is lame IMO, LMAO. But it was something to be expected since this is an IDEA FACTORY game (I've played many of IF's games on console)\n\nMy conclusion : \n8.5/10\nIf you like Anime style JRPG, with a rich story you should consider on buying this.\nDon't buy this game if you don't care about the story, cause that's pretty much what makes the game INTERESTING in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1439719284,

Put a couple of minutes aside. Pay full attention to me, because this isn't just a review. I'm going to pour my heart into this because I feel that's what this game deserves. This isn't just something you can score. \n\nAt first, this game's story is exactly like your standard anime, but it very quickly becomes something far greater. In my 32 hour campaign, there wasn't a single second in which I wasn't enjoying the absolute hell out of everything the game had to offer me. The adorable characters, the amazing story, the graphics of all of the spells...there wasn't a single second where I wasn't entertained. \n\nIt got to the point where once I reached the end of the game, I wasn't crying just because of the way the story ended, but also because of the very [i]fact[/i] that the game is over now. Sure I knew I could do a new game plus, but something about finishing the game was just so heart wrenching. I can't even remember the last time I shed a tear, and I am a rather stoic man, so it symbolizes a lot that this amazingly emotional game managed to make me cry in different ways at the same time.\n\nSomehow, the repetitive combat isn't a bad thing. The spell effects of each and every spell are entertaining and beautiful enough to keep you interested in seeing them forever. Getting experience and skill points is fun no matter what, to the point where even the slightly-mandatory grinding is even fun. That's saying so much.\n\nPerhaps the most touching, is that it's a [i]fully[/i] realized PC port. A game built with a JRPG engine has full mouse and keyboard support. Sure it seems like it would be standard for PC ports to have such things, but seeing a lack of mouse control in recent PC ports like DMC: Special Edition, it's hard not to feel grateful that the developers worked so hard to make mouse and keyboard work everywhere in this game. The amount of love they must have for this game must rival mine. And it does not surprise me, because it's extremely easy to fall in love with this game. You will have to practice the keyboard controls a bit (it took me a little bit to find out that Page Up and Page Down helps you aim your spells in combat, and Page Up re-centers your camera when exploring dungeons) but it won't take long, and the game's turn-based nature is very conducive with this control scheme, ensuring you have as much time as you need to figure out how, and where, to aim your spells.

To be fair, I've had my playthroughs of final fantasy and other rpgs, so to me, this turned to be more interactive and strategic than most . There's plenty I like about the game, but a few others I dislike. I'll start with what I like :D\n\nPositive\n- Funny, not too many games that introduce a humorous cast of characters actually make me smile and laugh. \n- Beautiful art style and anime, characters look and act how they were made\n- Easy combat system, items, attack, combos and spells pretty generic but very satisfying to see those combo strings and multiple damage hits\n- Basic but fair storyline, very generic and simplistic story to follow and understand\n\nNegatives\n- Rushed, many of the characters are thrown into your way and then into your party about 2 minutes after you meet them without even really understanding why or who the hell they are\n- Repetative; its a very simple system: go to town, events, buy info, free swords, go into dungeon, grind/complete quests (repeat) the side quests and events are really the only thing besides the storyline you can do\n- Very short dungeons (also a pro) The dungeons are usually consisted of less than 5 areas, you can complete the main quest in a matter of minutes\n- Protagonist (also a pro) I may get anime people jumping on back for this lol: the protagonist made me laugh and he does grow and develop throughout the game, but its just a hero I cannot get behind and makes me strongly dislike him later in the story. The early part had me laughing, but later on had me facepalming, honestly I wished  Sherman was the main protagonist, thats my opinion though lol.\n- Brief tutorials, while most people generically know what their doing; its a little bit of a slap in the face that Eryn's tutorials pop up for like 3 screens going ,\" yeah this is how you do this and this, good luck finding  these matierals yada yada. \" The game doesn't tell you where you can get specific items or materials. \n\nI still play the game and I still haven't finished the main story, so I'm no expert whatsoever; however this is a very fun game to play and kill time. The art style, the graphics and the gameplay are very fun .

So many extra things, but in reality, the normal weapon+combos+atk and a few mid-range special moves are everything you need.\n\nI only leveled to mid-30s, but the last bosses were probably slightly too easy, so don\u2019t level past there if you want to keep it challenging. If you complete the furies you\u2019ll be way over-powered!\n\nBut I was glad I didn\u2019t have to grind much. There are mechanisms to add abilities to gain exp out of party and more rapidly, so I didn\u2019t find myself grinding for exp or gold. You\u2019ll go to a new area and almost immediately gain 4 levels by the time you reach the boss just fighting the normal spawned monsters. I did have to grind a little for WP (power ups) in an area that gave more of it, but I ended up wasting it on character magic or moves that were more under-powered than what they already had..\n\nOverall a fun and short JRPG. My only gripe would be the crap dialogue. It\u2019s full of trite cursing that detracted from the overall story. It\u2019s pretty hard to root for the protagonist when he\u2019s calling women a b**** in every other scene\u2014this is not an exaggeration. I don\u2019t mind language, but it doesn\u2019t even flow, like a child who just discovered a new /bad word/. Eventually I got the feeling the game developers are clueless how to write diaglogue\u2014you can hire specific people to do that BTW. By Act II it\u2019s much better, but it\u2019s worth mentioning if you have children playing the game.

So the game itself is a fantastic JRPG it's more then i ever expected to be honest i didnt have such high hopes for it but after 15 minutes with this game i got consumed by it and couldn't stop to play :D. You play the game as Fang which is in my opinion the most funniest and trollish main hero i ever saw :D And with that lazy bastard and of course your other friends around you struggle around the world to collect the Furies and revive the Goddess.\n\nGood ones:\n+Epic and funny story\n+Epic combat system\n+Kawaii Usagi San <Later in the game>\n\nBad ones:\n-Not so many spells or special attacks as of Agarest for Example\n-No wonderfull special team combos or hidden special attacks containing 3-4 party members\n-Not so great talent and stat system\n\nAnd if you dont want to break your game experience dont spend your money on Additional Fairy Pack or even the Weapon Change Accessory Set and Armor Pack. On the description of Weapon Change Set it's said that's only cosmetic  but when you equip it it boosts your ATKP and MTKP tremendously. Same goes fo the Fairy Pack which gives you few ridicilously overpowered Faries but they cant be used for Godly Revival. Their stat growth and passive talents are game breaking. \n\nAfter all i reaaaly recommend this game for JRPG Beginners and Pro's alike ^^", "timestamp_created": 1439502816, "timestamp_updated": 1439503144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17523464": {"recommendationid": "17523464", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963219770", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467408016}, "language": "english", "review": "I will keep this short because I don't want to spoil too much of the story and it should be pretty obvious what kind of game this is, otherwise look it up on YouTube.\n\nThe game is part visual novel, part walking around dungeons and battling and part doing side quests. The battle system is somewhat similar to the Hyperdimension Neptunia series, and there are lots and lots of skills and battle points and other elements that you can advance in to get stronger in the way you like. Depending on the play style, it might be necessary to grind a few times, but nothing to write home about.\n\nI had so much fun with this title, it is unreal. I loved the art, I loved the characters and their dialogues. The battle system is fun, but it shouldn't be the only thing to care about. I was mostly interested in advancing the story and enjoying all the adventures and dialogues between the characters. They weren't always in agreement but as the story progresses you don't want to ever lose any of them, even those who may have tried to kill you before.\n\nAll in all, especially if you like JRPGs or

fun that i got with the Neptunia Series, Fan-Service is kinda there and References to the Neptunia Series are there but thats about it, 3 Endings in total, doesnt make it as replayable as i expectet,

Tiara Romance at first. And I didn't care anymore once I played it! It's a really nice game! Totally worth every cent you spend on this game! Cheers to Compile Heart for making this game! Really love the anime style art of the game, somehow similar to Hyperdimension Neptunia. Nice music, graphics, story, and artwork! Anyways, Overall enjoyed the game!\n\nCurrently using PC with these specs, with no problems so far:\nMicrosoft Windows 10 Pro\nIntel Core i5-4690k @ 3.5GHz\nXFX Radeon R9 290X Double Dissipation 4GB GDDR5\n4GB+4GB Dual Channel 1600MHz RAM\n2+4TB Seagate HDD\nDualShock 4 with DS4Windows for Gamepad\nFull screen 1080p\n\nNoticed some of a minor glitches here and there such as the Map appearing pixel messed up sometimes, and some stuttering for some seconds when entering an open area. Overall Love It! Specially Tiara! <3\n\nSPOILERS:\nOkay, so I just finished the game and got the Tiara Ending.... It's a bit sad with the lack of Harem end, but doesn't stop you from playing it~ haha~ Now aiming for the Eryn and Normal ending. It just feels that it should have a sequel~ Hope Compile Heart work on it soon~ Anyways, good job to the devs for making this game! Very nice graphic designs specially those animated Fairize sequence, and the soundtrack matches very well too~ Totally recommend this game to those who also love anime style characters and visual novel style storytelling! The ending wasn't the one I was expecting but gives you a bit of sadness and happiness at the same time.

[b][u]I don't hate this game[/u][/b], I'm just very disappointed in my experience with it. If anything, I want to like this game more than I actually do. With that said, onto the review.\n\nTL;DR version: A pretty bland game with bland characters, a bland story and bland combat. It's not worth nearly 30\u20ac for this. If you plan to get it, get it while it's at least 50% off.\n\nI came into this game from Idea Factory's Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 and 2, expecting it to be a somewhat more serious but still a lighthearted JRPG. For the most part, I got that. However, as I dug deeper into the game, there were so many different things that got to me that didn't really make my experience any more enjoyable.\n\nMy first problem is with the characters. They're not all that interesting, good character development happens mostly for 3 characters only (out of a possible 14) and I found none of the characters to be anything special. For example, Fang is a selfish guy who just wants to live his life the way he wants but eventually has to mature up to be a hero-type, Tiara is a noble-like character who seems to have a fetish for being verbally degenerated (I'm not kidding, she seems to get these moments of euphoria every time she's called the b-word), Pippin is a walking talking cat pillow that's supposed to resemble something of a veteran noble or something... Then there's Harley... [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498766987]I'll let you guess what she's all about with the help of this link[/url]. In short, none of the characters have anything that makes them especially interesting (other than a few small quirks), which makes them kind of bland in my eyes.\n\nWithout spoiling the game, the plot doesn't really hold water for me either. The objective is stated at the very start of the game: \"Collect furies, revive the Goddess, you win\". Pretty much towards the end of the game the objective stays the same, until some small changes happen here or there. The story itself isn't so bad that it's hateable, but when you're finished with the game you'll be left with several plot holes that you don't really get an answer to. In addition, not many moments really stuck with me as I progressed through the game. I guess the word that describes the plot is bland. In addition, there are some plot related things that left me with more questions than answers. Those would fall under spoilers, however, so I won't talk about them.\n\nHow about character levelling and combat? Well, coming from the HDN games, they're definitely different. The game uses a system called \"Weapon Boost\" to make your character better. Through combat you gain WP, which you will use to level up character stats as well as to learn skills, magic, abilities and new combo techniques. It's a rather simple system, but it might require the player to grind a bit to unlock some of the stuff he or she wants but overall, I like it. The combat still seems to come short of being interesting though. Comparing it to the HDN combat system, I feel it's easier to navigate menus and harder to make silly mistakes like cancelling your own turn because you accidentally pressed the cancel button twice when trying to leave the item menu. That's definitely improved, but at the same time the fighting itself is made slightly more boring than in the HDN games. Bosses and enemies no longer seem to heal themselves or their allies, which gives you less of a reason to prioritize different targets or strategize using more hard-hitting skills. Just gather enough adrenaline, put on your serious face, activate Fairize and whack the crap out of the boss and hope he doesn't deactivate your Fairize before you kill him. In the end, the experience left me with a rather bland taste in my mouth.\n\nYou might be noticing a pattern in my review. I keep using the word \"bland\" a lot, but that's about all I can say about this game. It's bland. Really bland. Coming in from HDN, I expected funny, quirky characters; I got boring, uninspired people I didn't much care for. I expected an enjoyable plot: I was left with more questions than answers. I expected a bland combat system to be remastered into something better; I got the same one with a few differences here and there. I want to like this game, but having experienced all of this just makes it very hard for me to call it a sufficiently enjoyable experience. Toward the end I just wanted the game to be over so I can move on to other games that I've wanted to play for a while now. Now that I've finished the game once already, I'll do just that. I'm definitely coming back to this later to play NewGame+ and hopefully get a different ending. And when that time comes, I hope I'll see the game in a new light and I might be able to rewrite this review and be more positive about the game itself.\n\nBut until that day, I'll stand by these words and say the game is, at the very least, not worth full price.

Once one figures out how to skip around the majority of useless talking then it's not half bad. \nThere are several key point which should be made however, key among them is the rather lacking travel system and places to explore. City navigation was reduced to a menu rather than walking around a city or town itself. The dungeons were repetative and by most game standards highly incomplete. I would even go as far as to say that the game itself is incomplete. There are many, many opportunities to miss things which one would think would be required to actually complete the game. This also doesn't even factor into account that your main goal is to pull all of the swords out of this goddess, of which you can't even achieve on the first play through. There is no real rpg aspect to the game as you do not have any real choices to make, you cannot influence the real out come of the game. The ending is set, though they did offer three different ones based on one conversation only (which means, you either talked to this person or that, not giving you a choice in any conversations is what this game is all about it seems). \nThere are only two ways to make playing and fighting in this game slightly enjoyable and relaxing. The first is to cheat with some form of hex editor and modify your xp and skill points. The second is to spend hours upon hours of grinding. The story line is a B at best, maybe a C+, it's nothing short of what a middle school student could have written for a short story. \nThe fighting system was passable, but left no room for diversity or customization of characters. The best thing about this game was the few tid bits of costume which you could place on different characters. \n\nFor my rating I will give the following on a 1-5 scale, 1 being the worst:\nGraphics 3\nGame play ease 4\nRpg / options 1\nStory line 2\nReplayability 1\nDiversity 2\nOver all 2\n\nIf you want some thing quick and lacking thinking then this is right up your alley.

This game is similar except instead of jokes on video games, the industry with silly fanservice, it's silly JRPG story spoof with puns on that and ...more fanservice. \n\nIt's very very similar to Neptunia, characters you get have combos you develop over time and they can transform to gain abilities and perks. The game feels like it had a much, much fatter budget however. Supported by the fact they have some Squaresoft employees doing things like music and art. Animations seem better done, there's less stuff re-used (though I've already run into a enemy that was in Neptunia so, there's that to think about) more enemy variety, ally variety etc.\n\nThe convo's with the animated sprites are better done than Neptunia as well, they have different poses, more of them, more on screen happen and they're more lively. \n\nThe game is more grounded than Neptunia however, it's less off the wall and ...more 'normal' but it's still insane. It has more depth to it in it's gameplay overall and larger dungeons ...they're still nothing wildly complex but they're serviceable. Characters are more customizable with how you develop them by way of fairies being linked to them and where you put points into their stats. \n\nDon't expect deep complex story telling here, it's light hearted, silly and ...well one of the screenshots has a wierd green bear character, so c'mon. (haven't gotten that far yet) What I do like is, everything moves fast, or is skippable, so you don't get stuck watching an overly complex move for the 5th time, just hit LT/L2 and you're onto the next thing.

The issue is that they drew up these maps in about 30 seconds and said \u201cwe\u2019re good to go!\u201d   By the way I just checked and this game came out originally in 2013! WTF! Xenoblade Chronicles came out in 2010 and for an inferior console and it looks about a billion times better than this!\n-\nExtremely simplified turn based combat, it\u2019s all about keeping healthy and doing more damage, no crazy strategies here. If the game wants to give you a tougher boss they don\u2019t actually come up with an interesting boss that will keep you guessing, instead they just do more damage and take less damage, quite simple and uninspiring. \n-\nA story that on paper seems like they could have done something good with it but in reality there is no story here, just an intro, and a bunch of clich\u00e9d fan service crap and cookie cutter bad guys.\n-\nOh, btw, there\u2019s no walking into towns, digesting beautiful sceneries, exploring and adventuring, etc.  Oh no, this game was made in power point, it\u2019s just slides of text after slides of text with anime girls in questionable outfits and when you think you are done and you can go out and explore the world, all there is for you is a menu and several options to choose from before going to your next lame dungeon, there\u2019s not even a real world map. There is but you can\u2019t walk around it and fight monsters in it, it\u2019s just a screen where you move a cursor to pick which dungeon to go into.\n-\nThere is one thing that does make this game playable (barely) and that is the dialogue. 99% of the dialogue in this game is excrement but that 1% can be hilarious in ways you haven\u2019t laughed in a game for a long long time.\n\nMy recommendation is don\u2019t buy this horrible excuse for a JRPG and buy The Legend of Heroes Trails in The Sky instead (it\u2019s on steam and it\u2019s an incredible, incredible game)\nBut if you must play it, do yourself a favor and buy the armor pack DLC that costs less than a dollar, that way you can breeze through bosses and finish this game as quickly as possible so you don\u2019t keep hurting yourself.\n\nOH, and a very important thing. If you are like me, married with family and happen to play your videogames at night when the wife sleeps, on the big screen TV with headphones, make sure she is very deeply asleep because my wife wakes up in the middle of the night and sees the tv and goes \u201coh, playing the witcher? Cool, have fun!\u201d and goes back to sleep. \nIt\u2019s not cool when she wakes up and sees cartoon gigantic boob dangling around the screen.\nScratch that\u2026 13 year old gigantic boobs and then looks at you with a \u201cdid I marry a serial killer rapist pederast Hitler?!?!?\u201d\n\n\nAVOID PAIN, AVOID THIS GAME.", "timestamp_created": 1439351426, "timestamp_updated": 1439360512, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490981", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17496098": {"recommendationid": "17496098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016263425", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443916031}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a whole lot of reasons to replay after you beat it but still a pretty solid game!\n\nBuy on sale and you feel like you got a great deal!", "timestamp_created": 1439336023, "timestamp_updated": 1439336023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519148", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17495294": {"recommendationid": "17495294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147627727", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439222026}, "language": "english", "review": "When I started to play with this game my first impression was along the lines of:\nGod These characters are annoying! \nThe main character Fang acted like a lazy asshole who cares about nothing but food. The main heroine and the face of the game Tiara acted like a giant SOB. The other heroine and the partner of Fang Eryn always seemed to have a few bad words for him.\nThough to be fair Eryn did have a reason to act the way she did. Just imagine you wait (for only God knows how much) for a lifetime partner to finally show up. And then when he finally arrives the only thing you get from him is verbal abuse, unwillingness and constant complaining about food. You wouldn\u2019t be happy about it either would you?\nAnd then I kept on playing and the magic happened. When the characters started to really interact with each other and solving the problems life gave to them they turned out to be really well thought out and lovable.\nI would say the main strength of the game is it\u2019s brilliant writing. The plot is the average the bad boys wants to resurrect the bad God the good boys wants to resurrect the good God but fortunately it\u2019s written in an entertaining way. The characters are not only good but they keep on developing and they get rid of their initial annoying quirks. The story itself is not ground-breaking but has it\u2019s nice touches and has a plot-twist around the middle I DID NOT SEE COMING!\nFor the actual gameplay:\nIf you played Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 or Re;Birth 2 then all I say it\u2019s exactly the same.\nYou enter dungeons from the main map. Inside them you control your assigned leader in the map picking up treasures and avoiding or hitting enemies. The actual battle system is turn based so when you are hit by one of them a battle sequence is initiated where your party fights against the monsters. When the battle is won you get back to the dungeon.\nInteresting take that you can\u2019t change weapons since each character has to fight with the fairy he or she has a contract with. In exchange you have a weapon upgrade system where you can raise your characters stats, teach them new abilities and moves, skills and magic trough Weapon Point earned by battling. However thank to this system your usual equipment are close to useless and the mostly serve as fanservice. In the game you will gather fairies you cannot equip as weapons but they can grant buffs and add dungeon effects using a system called world shaping. With them you can make the game a little bit harder or easier depending on you.\nI think the biggest flaw of this battle system is that you became overpowered very very quick. After that battles are a chore instead of a challenge and the game becomes rather boring. The other downside is the quest system which requires extreme levels of grinding.\nThere are 3 endings available but there is little difference between them. One for Tiara one for Eryn and a normal ending if you chose neither. Tiara\u2019s ending takes priority so avoid scenes with her if you want Eryn\u2019s. You should chose Eryn by the way.^^\nThe game offers a new game+ too. Many content is unavailable in your first playtrough raising the replay value of the game even harder. If you are interested in missable content then there is two playable characters who cannot be recruited unless certain conditions are met and a bunch of time limited sub-events.\nAll in all I recommend this game for everyone who loves jrpgs and doesn\u2019t mind grinding.\n", "timestamp_created": 1439331842, "timestamp_updated": 1439331842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17494798": {"recommendationid": "17494798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009663304", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487036441}, "language": "english", "review": "While this game suffers from a good amount of flaws (see below for details), it still manages to be an enjoyable experience.\nI'll be speaking numbers and mechanics so you get to know exactly what to expect from this product, and whether it's for you or not.\nIf you've played other games from this developer (like the Neptunia series), you can expect lots of similar aspects.\n\n\n\n[b][h1]The good points :[/h1][/b]\n- Fairy Fencer F takes about 25 hours to complete, and about 60 hours to get all achievements (I'm nearly there, so it's an estimate). This is a decent amount of time for an RPG, and at this price point, it's quite reasonable.\n\n- While the story is kind of a classic (hero must defeat an evil god), the narrative makes it enjoyable. A few plot twists here and there, with some of them being predictable, and some others not (which is the good part). The main protagonist doesn't have your typical \"hero\" personnality, which is refreshing. Interactions between characters are good enough, and you can get attached to some of them. This is a good sign, because if you can't feel anything for any character, that means the story and dialogues are bland and pretty much suck.\n\n- Good graphics, and runs on a solid 60FPS at 1080p without problems. I honestly don't care about 30 or 60 FPS, but some do so I'll write it down just in case.\n\n- Not a lot of grinding to do, except for achievements (the 100M gold is a bad joke, since you barely need money in this game at all).\n\n- Combat mechanics are turn-based, and you can transform (\"fairize\") your characters during combat to give them extra power.  Classic, but always works.\n\n- Good soundtrack and voice acting (Japanese, of course). With Japs, you know you can expect quality on these aspects, and this game is no exception.\n\n- World shaping. Basically, you can use special, reusable items to give special effects to a dungeon you are about to enter (increased/decreased xp/damage, etc).\n\n\n\n[b][h1]The flaws :[/h1][/b]\n\nNow, I'm gonna spend a lot more time on this part, because some stuff definitely can't be overlooked, and needs to be explained properly.\n> If you're a veteran RPG player like I am, there are other, more subtle aspects of an RPG that you have high expectations for.\n> If you're a casual RPG player, and are not too picky, these flaws won't probably mean much to you.\n\n- First and foremost, this game suffers from the \"Mash the attack button and that's pretty much it\" syndrome. I literally (and I'm not kidding) did the whole game without using AND learning a single combat ability or combo. I just pressed the attack button continuously, and used potions to heal myself from time to time. The only thing I did was pay a passive skill to increase my EXP and gold earned (mid-way through the game, because it costs a ton to learn), and everything else was put into basic stat increase (power, defense, etc).\n\u2022 In this game, you can learn magic and cast spells, but enemies/bosses are not proving very challenging so it just feels like a waste of time. Magic that increases a stat (speed, power, defense, magic, etc) are only single-target based, and last so few turns that by the time you've cast a boost on all of your party, it'll soon be gone from your first target.\n\u2022 If anything, making a \"mage\" is more about fun rather than a necessity. All characters, as you recruit them, come as versatile, and you end up prefering physical attacks because it makes things faster (going in menus is a pain after a while, no surprise there). Basic stat increase is also pretty much a joke, because it will make too little of a difference to your character anyway, except for special stats like the attack range and the number of combos.\n\u2022 Weaknesses to elements like fire, ice, etc, have barely been exploited, just like status debuffs, so you end up not even bothering about them.\n\u2022 Overall, the majority of the battle system & mechanics are completely useless.\n\n- The game also suffers from the \"Idea Factory loves reusing stuff\" syndrome (Idea Factory is the developer, mind you). If you've played the Neptunia series, you know what I'm talking about. The game reuses a lof of textures for monsters and environments, and you'll definitely find stuff, albeit with some slightly different colors, looking very similar to other stuff you've already seen before. Halfway through the game, something happens and this flaw becomes extremely accentuated, which I didn't appreciate at all. More effort was needed.\n\n- Some achievements are only there to annoy you. If you're not a completionist then it's all good, but putting a 100M Gold achievement when you barely need gold the whole game doesn't make any sense.\n\n- Lack of character customization. Not a lot of armors, weapons have a fixed sprite most of the time, and there are too few armors that change your characters' visual appearance as well. The Neptunia series had a lot more visual variety, so I got a bit dissapointed here. Good amount of visual accessories, but many of them are reused between characters.\n\n- A menu to customize your battle formation? The game is unfortunately not challenging enough (even for a newbie player) for it to have any usefulness.\n\n- The game does have a new game+ feature, but it doesn't bring a lot of extra content, unfortunately. It's more about a few features to get all the achievements, or to see another possible ending route (3 possible), rather than anything else.\n\n\n\n[b][h1]Closing words :[/h1][/b]\n\nThere are some stuff that I didn't mention, like the crafting or the collection of items called \"Furies\" which can be leveled up to give you special stats. I usually skip stuff that isn't important to the review (though it doesn't mean that these are bad).\n\nOverall, I'd say :\n- If you're a casual RPG player, and if you're looking at the story first and then the gameplay, then you'll definitely have a good time. The story is decent, the characters are likable, the dialogues are fun, and the battle mechanics are what you'd expect from a typical RPG.\n- If you're a seasoned RPG player looking first and foremost for difficulty and challenge, then you're likely to be dissapointed. All the game mechanics pretty much act as a \"wrapper\" for the story.\n\nFrom my personal standpoint, I buy Idea Factory games because I enjoy the colorful art, the nice looking anime-esque characters, the cool Japanese voice acting, and the story. I definitely do not buy them for their difficulty or game mechanics. If you know where your priorities are, you know where to set your expectations (especially with Idea Factory games).\n\n[b]Verdict :[/b] \"Yes, but.\"\nAlbeit a few flaws, Fairy Fencer F is a good RPG that will most likely leave a positive impression on you.\nOh, and it has nekomimis, I forgot to mention that. Very important.\n\nHave a great day,\n\nZanameth", "timestamp_created": 1439329242, "timestamp_updated": 1439329884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17494480": {"recommendationid": "17494480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086269685", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507085630}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game alot.

On average you can get anywhere from 20-30 hours on your first playthrough.\n\nSolid game that I recommend to fans of both anime and JRPGs.

The battle system is turn-based like neptunia but it feels fast and you can skip the attack and transformation animations, which are cool, via the L2 button in addition to the visual novel story parts.

Avalance effect didn't cut it enough for me, I'd hoped for more in the style of Agarest Generations.\n\n\nThe World shaping is a bit dull and slow, especially because you can't stack effects.

Overall good port from console, even if you want to play with mouse/keyboard (needs a little remapping, but not that much).\n\nStory-wise, this game is a typical J-RPG : the main part of the narration are the relations between the main characters, which have various personnalities. The story/universe is original enough to keep us interested, but not used to its full potential. Instead, it's used to bring more dialogs and character-development. Like most J-RPG. You like it or you don't, it's just a matter of taste. But if you like J-RPG, you'll probably like it. \nLike usual : you play western RPG for the world, eastern RPG for the characters.\n\nNow the graphics : pretty good. Full 3D anime-style with VN-like dialogs. The FPS are steady everywhere, the loadings are fast. You never really wait while playing this game.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's a mix between action-RPG and turn-based RPG. Mostly turn-based. But it's complex enough to allow strategy during the battles. Not that much as a full T-RPG. If you like T-RPG, but don't want to think to much or like the visuals of action-RPG, then this battle system is for you.\nHowever, battles can become a bit boring when you travel across a dungeon filled with weak enemies. But since we can avoid most battles, it's not that bad.\n\nBalancing : I haven't reached the end-game yet, but I can already see it coming. The main character is just a beast. Unlock the right skill (I don't remember which, but it's fairly fast to unlock), and spam it against medium-strong enemies. Money is not a problem after like 2-3 hours, so you can buy lots of TP potions and spam your skills. So, the strategy is : buff your main character, use him to focus on the DPS (don't waste damage on near-dead enemies unless you really need to lower their number), and finish the crumbs with the other characters. The support character can deal some damage, but not enough to really match the dps of the main character. I find this kinda sad : all other strategies make the battles a lot longer, and thus bring boringness.\n\nLast words : worth buying, worth playng, if you like J-RPG. You probably won't play it for 10 hours straight (it's not the kind of game that makes forget the flow of time), but you'll have no problem playing it like 2-3 hours a day everyday until you finish the game once or twice, since it's very enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1439132260, "timestamp_updated": 1439132260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17457870": {"recommendationid": "17457870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053865808", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439447669}, "language": "english", "review": "WARNING: This game will make you cringe EVERY FUCKING TIME, in this game the voice acting for the main characters are decent, but for the bandits its noticabally bad and makes me wonder if one dude voiced all of them..

The gameplay, or the fights, are turn-based and seem to be WAY too easy if you know what you're doing, so to challange yourself don't read any tutorials and just learn by yourself. There is a little grinding aspect to the game but don't be alarmed or turned off by this because you rarely ever have to do this. (Might continue the review when I get further into the game...

Seeing this game on sale for 50% off and newly released, not to mention the great reviews of the game on console, I decided to take the leap.\n\nPros:\n- Combat system is fantastic and a change of pace from your typical turn-based RPG\n- Unique Story / Protagonist\n- Great character customization in terms of combat and accessories\n- Good intro / tutorial \n- English Voice acting is actually pretty good\n- The port is well done and can be run on any computer without issue (I'm playing on a Macbook just fine)\n\nCons:\n- No difficulty setting (this is a personal issue though I feel)\n- Characters break the fourth wall / goofy (can be a turn off for some, story-wise)\n\nDefinitely worth the buy for any new / veteran JRPGers. Although I will advise to stay away from the item pack / fairy DLCs as they ruin the game.

But I find that it challenges your suspension of disbelief.  As you continue playing it, you start to realize that the story can dissociate drastically from the gameplay.\n\nFor instance...on the first playthrough, I one-shot a boss.  Cue the upcoming visual novel cutscene where the characters are wincing in pain and groaning about how strong the boss is.  I reaaally didn't get that impression.  \n\nSo my suggestion is that if you get the game...play the game and follow the story.  But don't play the game AND follow the story.  Treat the two separately, and I think you'll find that it's entertaining as a game and tells a fairly interesting story.  But if you treat the two as one unit, expect to lose some brain cells when the gameplay and story start hand-waving.\n\nThis game is a bit weird.  In an era of RPGs where you're able to allocate your stats as you see fit, this game sort of falls back to the traditional method of level-up = auto-allocate stats.  Granted, there is a way to boost your attack stats, but I dearly wish I could up my characters speed / accuracy.  Speed because I'd like to give a certain character in the party the ability to attack first.  Accuracy because there are certain attacks in the game that give 300% damage, but they miss really often.  \n\nIt turns out that it's not so much that they miss often but that the enemy has an easy time dodging them.  I figured this out when I used these techniques on low level enemies...whereas I would have a 20% hit rate on equivalent level opponents, At level 55, I had a 100% hit rate on level 30 mobs.\n\nThe only way to boost the speed and hit rate is to complete a set of challenges.  These require you to do weird things like jump around as the leader of the party or send the enemy flying so you can use interception attacks.  They wouldn't be so bad ordinarily, but I do have complaints about jumping 5000 times per character just to max out the challenge.\n\nPersonally, I liked playing this game a lot.  I just wish that I managed to get the Eryn ending first try.  I don't know what I did wrong to get the Tiara ending.\n\nOh yeah, I suggest turning on Japanese voices occasionally.  You'll find that all sorts of things are voiced that aren't in the English Dub.

Some of the best parts of this game, despite the combat being simplistic is how pretty it looks.  All of the spells, and abilities have their own little cutscene and  all actions happen snappily and quickly. The audio is good, the English dub is liveable but the Japanese dub is better (especially if you understand things that don't translate well).\n\nThe story is anime influenced and is more on the silly/moe side of that.  It is a fun story, nothing too serious and  slightly cliche at points.  The story is self aware of just how cliche it can feel, and sometimes makes fun of itself.  There is a deeper undertone but I doubt it'll matter.  Now get the boy his damn /FOOD/!  It is more cohesive then most straight up Visual Novels, but there isn't much choice as it only has 3 possible endings without much deviation in your activities.\n\nAs a PC port, it works perfectly.  And really that is the #1 criteria for any game that exists. The game only has resolution settings, including borderless mode.  That is pretty much all there is for PC related enhancements, everything looks crisper and cleaner then the console version so I can't really find anything to complain about this.   Its a fast game, the FPS feels smooth, the action is smooth.\n\nOverall it is a fun game to play, especially at its current price of $15.  Its a competent port, and is pretty to look at.  Its a bit easy, so you won't enjoy this game if you want a challenge.  Nor will you want this game if you're looking for a deep engaging story that will make your brain think on all cylinders.  But if you want something light hearted and easy to digest then this games story will pass for you.

They did a decent balance of humor with the story albeit very predictably. The ferrize thing though is just way over the top, but ignoring that and the fact they did it that way on purpose for the story and humor it is worth playing. I mostly enjoyed the interatctions between Tiara and Fang. And the side story with Apollonius wasn't bad, but I wish they did more with it. Don't get me started on the weird guy in the animal suit... Story wise the main complaint I had is the way the handled the main town. The conversations with the locals were all pointless and did not really endear you with the story, but personally I felt like I had to read it in case there was some subplot that would show up.... sadly they did not really take advanatage of that and no quests from any of the common characters ever occured.\n\nGameplay itself is pretty mediocre. Reason I say that is because really pretty much through 95% of the game I was just spamming attack + skip, ferrize + skip, attack + skip. This game definitely did not focus on strategy. Most of the time I got through battles without losing any characters because I just focused on stunning the monsters with combos so I would end up getting the game to trigger the event to get other party members to get a whack in. This even worked on bosses. I would generally advise not to buy the DLC that provides the armors unless you want to have two characters be nearly invulnerable for 60-75% of the storyline game. I'm telling you those armors are way overpowered! Don't get me started on the other DLC's where if you want the stat boost at all your characters are in towels?!?!\n\nNow the one thing I really do have to say was a decent idea for the battlesystem and that was the combos mechanic. It really did let me choose a moveset that I could get the maximum amount of damage. The main problem with the combo system is due to how much time it takes to play thing game (and how much I was spamming skip) I ended up only using the same moveset over and over and ignoring any of the other possibilities because 90% of the time the moveset I chose for the A button worked, so there was no reason to choose any of the other choices.

Though where to start...\n\nThe game itself is filled with humor that will make you smile, the characters are loveable and I personally am loving watching the story unfold and the characters all coming closer together, one humorous anime filled step at a time haha.\nThe combat is what you would expect from a game VERY similar to the Hyperdimension Neptunia series (also worth looking into if you are not familar) so not much I can really say there. It's short, sweet, and very simple to learn. The English voice acting is done right, as what is expected from the developers of these wonderful games.\n\nOverall if you are wondering if this is a product worth purchasing, then in all my hearts honesty, of my own opinion of course, yes it definetly is worth buying. As I have gotten farther on the PC port then I was on my PS3, I have come to realize how much I have missed out on when it comes to the overall enjoyment this game has to offer.\nNow of course this game has it's faults (mainly which comes to combat for me) but they are for the most part what would you expect if you have played any other heavily anime styled JRPG. I also wanted throw out as an almost last note the game is very well optimized right out the get go like everyone else has been saying. Something that the developers of these games have been having issues with when it comes to their ports. Anywhos...\n\nI'll quit typing here as I know due to the lack of reviews I actually write... I'm not very great at them. But I sure as heck tried my best! Haha anyways like I mentioned, in my heart this game is a gem. I almost want to say this was a very underappreciated game that never really did get the love it deserves. So please if you're interested do purchase this game, As I can promise you won't regret it;)\n\n\nAs always I hope everyone is doing well and living life the best they can! And I wish everyone the best! :) And of course thank you for reading!!!\n\n(I hope my review did justice or atleast did okay for anyone who reads this by the way haha!)\n", "timestamp_created": 1438971861, "timestamp_updated": 1438971861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17432354": {"recommendationid": "17432354", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989634078", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439330711}, "language": "english", "review": "basically its a waifu hunting game. i will get em all!", "timestamp_created": 1438971608, "timestamp_updated": 1438971608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17431675": {"recommendationid": "17431675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091682983", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439216828}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u590f\u7ec7\u9171\n\nsteam store\uff1a\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u7684\u8d2d\u4e70", "timestamp_created": 1438968346, "timestamp_updated": 1438968346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17431616": {"recommendationid": "17431616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001895744", "num_games_owned": 507, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450120663}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this Game Bcoz  Its Funny V V Funny Gameplay is Super\n\n\nand Especially because i want to Support Japanese Turn Based RPG's On steam  so more will come to pc :)", "timestamp_created": 1438968109, "timestamp_updated": 1438968109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540820", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17431500": {"recommendationid": "17431500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141371226", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494606447}, "language": "english", "review": "Really nice game.

The game is as Turn based JRPG that follows the standard premise for JRPG's but does a few things different from the sandard.\n\nI'll start with the story, the idea is that two gods (The vile god and the Goddess)had a falling out and paralized each other with each others swords. The swords that missed ended up in the world, embedded in the ground waiting for a capable human to pull them out. When someone pulls one out, the Fairy within the weapon is bound to them at that moment and it allows the person to weild incredible power. These people then become Fencer's, people who can weild these weapons and the fairies within them. Almost every goal for a Fencer is to collect 100 Furies (The weapons with fairies) and pull all the swords out of the goddess and in doing so, they will be granted a wish. So yeah, it follows a very obvious premise to JRPG's, having Gods, a single corporation that turns out to be evil behind the scene's and so on. So the story isn't very original in it's idea but it does do a couple of things different then other JRPG's.\n\nNext is the combat and if you've played any of the Hyperdimension Re;birth games then it's going to feel very similar, and by similar I mean it's the exact same as the Re;birth games. You have up to three characters on the battlefield and you move each one when it's there turn within a specific area. You can start off with a basic attack which will start your combo for that characters turn, but you start off with only one and have to increase your combos by aquiring them with weapon points. Just like Hyperdimension you can switch you attacks anytime you want for different one's which allows you to mix and match a lot of different attacks to find one's that go together. Your skills contain two catagories, Skills and magic. Skills are a combination of magic attacks with physical attacks and Magic is pretty self expainitory. Next is Fairize, this is your characters transformation allowing them to use the power of there Fairy to increase there stats and gives access to a unique skill. To access the transformation, there will a bar connected to the characters portait in the top right corner, when this bar fills up (By taking damage or dealing damage) and glows blue, you can access the transformation which gives the character an increase in there physical  attack and defense, but will start to decrease if you take damage. The transformation is nice but it can be turned off so easily that it'll barely last for a couple of turns if your getting beat and the increase in stats is quite minimal that you probably might not even notice the difference. Next, every character has a unique ability tied to them that they can only use, Fang has serious face (Well named there) which gives him a big increase in physical attack by 2.0 but his base attacks cost SP and his skills SP usage will also increase by 1.5. Tiara has a protective barrier that will only pretect her but can withistand really strong attacks and Harley has the ability to scan enemys and exposse there weaknesses. At the end of it, it's rather slick and fastpased, the animations look really smooth and the partical effects and skills look really good, the transformation could look better though.\n\nThe one thing I've always praised Idea Factory for is the art design. Be it with this game or Hyperdimension, the character models, the sceneary and the enviroment look beautiful and very well done. They're always so full of color and never look over designed.\n\nOn to the last thing that really kinda takes me away from the game and that is the characters themselves, I find it very difficult to stay interested in a game where most of the characters are so unbearable that I want to punch them in there face. I'll start with our main protagonist Fang, an egotistic, big headed, arrogent, slightly selfish food lover. It's difficult for me to find a place for me to start with him since I have a fair amount of problems with him. The things he's says seem only to elevate his own opinion of himself and has a distinct habit of down right insulting the other characters for no reason which makes it very difficult for me to feel anything for him when he acts like that. The rest of them have a habit of responding to a situation or each other in the most piculiar way that doesn't really make any sense, but some of them have had effort in putting personalities into them. It is nice however to see a male protagonist who isn't a cliced angsty teenager but the way they did it doesn't make him likeable in many ways, An example I can give for a good male protagonist in a video game is Yuri Lowell, I recommend looking for yourself why but I digress.\n\nYou may have noticed that I've been comparing this to Idea Factoy's other game Hyperdimension a lot and that is because it is practically the same game but with different characters and setting. The problem I find however, if I where to compare it to Hyperdimension, is that it doesn't have the charm or the personality that Hyperdimension has. That has many different characters with different personalities that suit there character designs for one, the other being that it just doesn't care, it will constantly break the fourth wall, refence other games and hardware, poke fun at the game industry and at animes. It has that charm to it that makes it enjoyable and fun to the point where you'll spend hours paying attention to the dialogue just to see what they'll reference next and what thing within the game industry they'll poke fun at, I mean come on, at the begining of Re;birth 3 they reference the Oculus Rift and Sword art online by creating a device called the \"Nepulus gift\" (Something like that) and having it looking exactly like the Nerv gear. The list goes on and one with what they'll do.\n\nI digress, I'm here to review this game on it's own, I compare it to other video games to give you general comparison of what I'm talking about. On it's own however, without comparing it, it it's fairly enjoyable to a certain degree. The art style and character models are beautiful, the combat is fast pased and fun once you start getting more combo slots and skills and the enemy variety is nice, but there are a couple of things that I've been nitpicking about just because it's me and I tend to point out every little detail. So I can recommend this if you haven't played any of the Hyperdimension Re;birth games or if you want something that's a little more serious, but it can be enjoyable if you look past the small nitpicks.", "timestamp_created": 1438950716, "timestamp_updated": 1438950716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17428073": {"recommendationid": "17428073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135863180", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 3414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493415717}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Mais uma p\u00e9rola da Idea Factory/Compile Heart!

This game is like Hyperdimension Neptunia, with a similar more tactical combat system. The port is very well optimized. You can clearly see, that the company learned from their last ports. If you liked the Neptune series, buy this game. You cannot be wrong with this one.\n\nCharacters are funny. The main character is a male, who is simple minded as they come.  \n\nBe warned, this game is a grind fest, because you have to level up the fairies, you gather. This fairy component is a little bit like the Persona demon collecting and levelling, giving the characters some skills and added stats.\n\nIncludes hillarious conversations, fan service, cute characters. \n\nI wanted to play for under 2 hours, to test it. Now I am at 6 hours play time, and I will never refund it.\n\nTher are two negative points. \n\nThey made the side quest system utterly useless, because you are not able to fulfill the level up quest. For these B-stage quest you need 5 elemental stones of fire, ice, lightning and stone. The droprate is so terrible and broken, that you need at least 20 hours of pure grinding, to fullfill that request. This part of the game needs definitly to be fixed. \n\nAnother point are the boss fights.

The combat is smooth and easy to learn even though there are multiple things that influence combat.  The combat is also very similar to the Neptunia V or the Neptunia Rebirth series.  The game is not exactly short either my first play through of the game took 33 hours.  The game has 3 different endings which does also increase the replayability of the game.\n\nUnlike in many RPG's you do not change your weapon instead as you play the game you aquire something called weapon boost points, these points allow you to customize your weapons stats increasing it's damage, magic attack, increase physical and magical defense how far your attack range is and couple other things.  With weapon boost points you are also able to get new skills, magic, abilites, and a few other things. \n\nSimilar to the Neptunia Rebirth series there is a world shaping option as well which allows you to change mobs or items in dungeons however unlike the Neptunia series there is normally a negative that goes with the positive for example you will gain 30% more exp but you will have 10% less defense.\n\nThe characters in the game are all likeable and have personality and over the course of the game you actually see their personalites change which is nice to see.  The english voices are all well done and none seem out of place for the character.\n\nThe bad in my opinion\n\nIf just following the storyline the game is rather easy.\n\nThe game has 3 different endings which is good however there really is no clear indication ever of what path you are on basically if you want the other two endings you will either have to go through it with trial and error or look up a guide. \n\nOther than that there really is no negative I can think of. Fun combat, Lots of customization, Easy to play, Enjoyable storyline, Enjoyable Characters, Good english voice acting, Characters with personality, and fairly long.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1438934348, "timestamp_updated": 1438934348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17425215": {"recommendationid": "17425215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126770429", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466843440}, "language": "english", "review": "Already at the start of the game I was laughing my ass off the whole time because you'd expect the main character to be some badass but that's not the case.

Runs really nicely and has zero snafus. The game itself is sweet!\n\n[b]Review:[/b]\n   Fairy Fencery F is a PC port of a Playstation 3 game with the same name, developed by Compile Heart who itself is a reiteration of Compile, the developes behind Puyo Puyo. This title is what many would call a JRPG seeing as you grind to level up so that in the end you can defeat the big bad while meeting colourfull characters along the way. \n\n   You follow the adventures of Fang, a derilict who just wants to find a free meal, who goes through dungeons to find \"Furies\" or swords which can be used to unlock a godess or demon that have been sealed ages ago. The encounters are viewable which is a big plus for me. In battle you control three members of your party who all have a special perk that can give them an advantage and a super mode which increases their defense and attack. There's really not much more to say seeing as this is your standard bread and butter of JRPG fare. \n\n   The game shares many many assets with the Hyperdimension Neptunia series. You see the same textures, enemies, and the game itself uses the same engine. Where it differs is the pacing, character design, and music score. I for one see FFF as being the project title that may have swung Compile Hearts around from making awful Neptunia games in to what are passable budget titles today. Make no mistake, with the visuals, shallow gameplay, and length of the game this may be considered a budget-esque title too. \n\n   All in all I really do reccomend this, especially for what I bought it for ($15). It really takes me back to the old days of JRPGs and how they had those simple charcter models and loads of anime cliches. \n\n~The best part about this is just how fast you can play this game.

So the game starts off with introducing the main character, Fang, who is one of the laziest protagonists ive ever seen, his first priority in any situation is food, and next is sleep. Having heard that pulling a fury out of teh ground will let him make any wish, and with a wish for food, he pulls the fury out and in turn becomes a Fencer, who wield a fury, and the fairy Eryn is introduced. She is really funny, and is the stragiht man to his antics, like food and sleep. They go on a journey and you meet another fencer in the first dungeon, but i wont go into detail as the story is one to experience for oneself. Just one quick word, ive only played a small amount of the story but its so gripping i cant stop, and have already played near 5 hours in the story mode (The ingame menu will tell you the total play time and this sessions play time)\n\nThe tutorial level comes quite quickly in this game and i for one love the combat system. Its turn based but each turn a character can move around a field in the map that has their starteing position as teh center of teh field. \nWhen your characters turn is in play, they can choose a variety of options, those being attack, skills/magic, items, wait and fairize. Ill get to attack a bit later. \nThe skills/magic menu when opened has two submenus for skills and magic, skills being physical attacks. Many different magics and skills have different radii and fields where you need to line up the attacking area, which is in red, with the enemies you want to fight.\nHuh? Whats Fairize you ask? Its sounds wierd but its where a fencer resonates with their fairy and thus their attack increases and special fairize skills are unlocked, oh and you get an anime-esque transformation sequence. And then theres also wait, Increases attack in teh next turn and makes you guard. A queue of who goes next is displayed on teh left side of teh screen.\nNow we'll get to attack. which when pressed can start a combo, this cant be done at the start, but as you go thorugh the game youll learn how to execute long combos.\n\nAs you go through the game collecting furies, they will have fairies which you can equip to your characters, which increase stuff like strength of sword/glaive/knuckle/etc attack or increase attack of one element of magic, you know earth air fire water. There is a way to make fairies stronger, but its part of teh story and i dont want to spoil anything.\n\nAll thats left to talk about is options, in which you can increase bgm voice and sound volumes seperatley and there a japanese to english voice switch, which is english default, which is a nice addition that i like seeing in these sorts of games.\n\nI highly recommend this to beginners of teh jrpg genre, veterans of rpgs in general, and anyone who wants a nice singleplayer campaign rpg expereince. \n", "timestamp_created": 1438884584, "timestamp_updated": 1438884584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17417621": {"recommendationid": "17417621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060798544", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477399882}, "language": "english", "review": "is it me or Tiara looks like a genderbend of Shidou from DAL", "timestamp_created": 1438884259, "timestamp_updated": 1438884259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493024", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17417573": {"recommendationid": "17417573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032214020", "num_games_owned": 542, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439773276}, "language": "english", "review": "Port is barebones, but functional.\nWorks fine with the controller, looks nice enough and supports most resolutions out there.\n\nIts fun so far while being a simple idea factory game like the neptunia games, though I do find myself enjoying this more than them.

Don't buy this game -  You like grindfests? then buy this game.\n\nThe characters themselves are created extremely well, to the usual highest of standards and fit well within the storylines.  Fang though comes across far too whiny in the early parts of the game though but at least, the other characters are hilarious especially Eryn and Tiara who no doubt will replace Nep as someones waifu. \n\nTiara and Eryn both are amazing characters, the voice actors do really amazing jobs in capturing their often hilirious quirks, such as Tiara strange kinky responses when shes verbally assalted by fang.  Both character design is perfect,  the other characters are all fairly well balanced too but don't nearly stand out as much as Tiara and Eryn. \n\nA great game but has a really poorly designed questing system which forces the player into loading/reloading dungeons countless number of times in order to get rare drops in order to synthesis stones to complete rank quests, these quests are extremely grindfest and incredibly frustrating especially if you get unlucky with crappy RNG, and to make matters worse these Collector Quests just get worse as you rank up,  Rank C is pretty bad - I shudder to think how bad Rank B and A will be,  but these shouldn't be designed this way - Compile Heart you disappoint me here,  you're better than this to throw in a really unnessary grindfest in order to progress your questing. \n\nSome stones are somewhat 'easy' to find with Item Sonar as they as the potential areas are close to the entrance, like with the ice cave so the re-loading of the dungeon isn't so bad, but other dungeons on the other hand, the hidden treasure could be far away and that takes a significant amount of time finding the hidden treasure, and thats even 'assuming' its not a useless sprout inside.    Basically, if there is a DLC or any cheat/feature that clearly displays the hidden treasure on the map immediately without having to use item sonar, then this is clearly NEEDED in order to keep your sanity after your 1000th dungeon reload and you still haven't gotten your stupid stones yet. \n\nClearly, this quest system just doensn't work very well at all, and unfortunately this heavily impacts the games fun factor once the tedium sets in.  Compile Hearts, please do not do this again with future releases - stick with the tried and tested methods that worked with the HDN series. \n\nAs for the rest of the game, I haven't had any issues - everything else is good.  Good characters,  good story lines with humorous dialogue and the voice acting is up to high standards.   The graphics and drawing are on par with the HDN series.  \n\nWhilst I honestly enjoy the game, and story - I just can't get past the mistakes made with the quest system, and thats the only - repeat ONLY reason for the not recommend review.   *IF* you don't mind a more hardcore approach to grinding and farming, especialy farming for stones so you can synthesis then you will enjoy Fairy Fencer F,  if your like me and have no patience at all these days for farming and/or get easily frustrated then I would do more research first before buying into this game.   \n\nClosing statements here is that the worst problems that Fairy Fencer F suffers from are insane grinds require for portions of the game, especially in farming for stones and stealing quest items which have a very very low success rate.   Another minor issue is that halfway though the game, the difficulty unusually spikes with monsters doing alot more damage, plus you'll face more in battles + boss battles get more intense, I'll not reveal anymore information on this because it'll potentially spoil it for anyone reading, but the spike feels like it wasn't tested enough and makes an already grindy game, feel even more grindy. \n\nAlot of content is also highly missable, such as recruiting extra characters which first time around, is more or less impossible and really aimed at NG+ so expect to play through multiple times in order to unlock alot of the extras.  Finally, if anyone doesn't believe me about the drop rates being really bad - just check the forums yourself and read all the posts regarding this - Don't take accept anyone saying that they are 'fine' because they are clearly not.\n\nWhilst reading through my review and reading through peoples responses, I think I came off as highly critical.  I make no real apologies here since everyone has their own right to post how they feel about any game they play, whether its a hateful comments or because they just really love the game and cannot stand any negativity.  However,  I think I was wrong to give this game a 5/10 and I will admit, that was a mistake - however, my previous statements I will still standby them.   \n\nOverall 6/10\n\n++ Slick combat system\n++ Good WP system for developing characters skill and abilities\n++ Cute and Moe Characters\n++ Great Storyline and Dialogue\n+++ Music Score by legendary Nobuo Uematsu \n\n- Highly missable content\n-- DLC heavy\n-- Too much emphasis on farming\n-- Some side quests and synthesis feels grindy\n---Major grindfest in certain areas of the game\n---Collectors quests has a long and unnecessary grind", "timestamp_created": 1438802830, "timestamp_updated": 1439263316, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383270", "comment_count": "41", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17403578": {"recommendationid": "17403578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088013168", "num_games_owned": 621, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475781690}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have played and loved either of the Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth games, skip to part B.

However, because of its cute supporting characters, entertaining (if somewhat grindy) battle system, hilarious (sometimes hilariously bad) dialogue, and genuinely interesting story premise, I had a really difficult time putting it down last night. \n\nSo you're Fang, an extremely lazy kid who by total happenstance becomes a Fencer, charged with collecting the Furies (magical weapons fallen to Earth) to unseal the goddess. Sounds simple, right? Well... not really. You also have the option to unseal her opponent, the Vile God (but who would do that, right?!) So the game doesn't seem to mind giving the player options in this regard, and it seems to be set up for multiple endings. \n\nTo  keep it short and sweet, if you're a fan of well made JRPGs, cute things and mixed humour, there is no reason in the world you shouldn't like this.

The Xbox3460 controller can be chosen as the input device in the configuration.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, I like the following things:\n[list]\n[*]You can skip spell/attack animations at the touch of a button.\n[*]Battle system is quick and fast. Battles with weak enemies don't drag on forever due to lengthy animations.\n[*]Characters are fairly likeable.\n[*]There's plenty of boobs going around.\n[*]The graphics are very colorful.\n[*]It's easy to use the camp menu to find what you need to.\n[*]The skill system is fun and easy to learn. Gain WP to learn skills that are prerequisites for better skills.\n[/list]\n\nWhat I don't like:\n[list]\n[*]Characters usually have one modified portrait at most to represent their speech, and the game tries rather comically to make it seem like they're doing things, such as pushing an ally aside by having one picture shove another.\n\n[*]This is obviously a fairly low budget game. A lot of art assets are re-used, like entire dungeons.\n\n[*]The story is just the typical JRPG thing. A reluctant hero saves the world to restore the goddess of light so she can defeat the dark Vile God. It would have been nice if the joking scenario Harley claimed was actually the real story instead of this.\n\n[*]The combo editing system makes little sense. When I go to the menu, I can't change anything even after learning a variety of skills for a character. Either this is a bug or the developers decided to introduce the system too early in the story (eg. it's something advanced I can't actually make use of yet).\n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1438785424, "timestamp_updated": 1438785424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604060", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17399764": {"recommendationid": "17399764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094907786", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440862654}, "language": "german", "review": "Plays like Hyperdimension Neptunia.....

actually very well made considering its a port.\n4: beautifull art style, as an anime/manga fan it was a very pleasent look.\n5: semi catching music.\n6: story seemed interesting.\n\nnow the bad:\n1: only main story is voice acted, so it feels a bit off when interacting with the rest of the world that is silent (completely silent, not even a \"hi there\")\n2: animation on the story line part is extremely simply done, or not done at all, it leaves much to be desired and you are almost better of not watching it while enjoying the conversation due to this. should have put in a minimum effort here.\n3: main character is a complete douc he, he is childish and annoying, he feels like a 8 year old, which gets tiresome Fast.\n4: combat controls are sticky, and feels unpolished, the movement in combat to get the right angles are a fiddle which takes the enjoyment down.\n5: the camera view is very zoomed in, both moving in dungeons and in combat, and the angle of it (even when changed) are not good for the control scheme.\n6: combat in general feel boring, sloppy, and extremely easy to the point of pointless (didn't find any difficulty scale stuff; but the combat setup wasn't good).\n7: dungeon \"background\" graphic was horrible; i do not mind the model graphic and animation of combat move, but base ground etc. was very bad.\n8: gameplay felt dull, unfinished, and badly made.\n\ni wouldn't recommand this game as a game.\nif it was a \"story\" or an \"anime\" i might recommand it, since as such a media i think it would do well.\nbut because of how bad the combat controls, combat feel, the flow, and the camera was, the overall gameplay experience was really bad.\ni find that kinda sad because the story itself seemed interesting, although the main character was just too much of an 8 year old douc he, which i found tiresome very fast.\n\nmaybe for young children it would be a great game, since gameplay feel etc. is something which isn't as noticable for them to be entertained; or for people that just want a story and don't mind the very childish beheaviour of the main character.\nbut for people that play a lot of games and like the game experience i wouldn't

But you actually have to build your way up with the Weapon Boost system. The mechanics are a lot deeper than I initially thought, and this is the type of RPG I like when it comes to that. Combat significantly improves the moment you start practicing the Combo system. It saves a lot of SP in the long run. Then there's also the Fairy system, which is essentially stat boosts and effects. It's simple and useful. I think the most advance would probably be the World Shaping. So far, I only used it to get more WP at the cost of double SP usage, but I didn't need to use SP anyway. If anything, it's helpful for grinding.\n\nVoice acting, they're both great. Though, there are parts in the English dub where they don't even voice, but are voiced in the Japanese voices.

For $15 this game is definitely worth it, but if you were going to pay $30 I'd wait for it to go on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1438751293, "timestamp_updated": 1438993336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17394294": {"recommendationid": "17394294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056484477", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481574850}, "language": "thai", "review": "GOOD GAME!!\n-  \u0e1e\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e15\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e14\u0e35!  \u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e04\u0e27\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e38\u0e21\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e38\u0e48\u0e21 Keyboard  \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30 Controller   \n-   \u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e17\u0e33\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e14\u0e35 \u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e08\u0e30\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19 Hyperdimenstion Neptunia \u0e15\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e23\u0e39\u0e1b\u0e41\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e42\u0e08\u0e21\u0e15\u0e35\n-   \u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e43\u0e08\u0e1e\u0e2d\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49 \n-  \u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e2a\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e04\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e41\u0e04\u0e48 4 - 5 G  \u0e40\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e17\u0e33\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e14\u0e35\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01!\n\n\u0e43\u0e04\u0e23\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e41\u0e19\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e34\u0e40\u0e21\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e23\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e4c Hyperdimenstion Neptunia   \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e41\u0e19\u0e30\u0e19\u0e33\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e04\u0e27\u0e23\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\n\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e40\u0e09\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e42\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e42\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e43\u0e19\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49 279 \u0e1a\u0e32\u0e17  \u0e04\u0e38\u0e49\u0e21\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01!!", "timestamp_created": 1438750557, "timestamp_updated": 1438751417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17394146": {"recommendationid": "17394146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047168143", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450363461}, "language": "english", "review": "I was waiting for a decent JRPG to release on steam!!

I felt the game was relatively well done, especialy for Shonen, and it managed to mostly avoid the obnoxious pit-falls of the genre.\n\nUntil the Thing. I forgot that modern Shonen also brings forth The Thing - the vaguely anthropomorphic not-an-animal which exists only to irritate the ever living hell out of anything with two brain cells to rub together.

regarding the port and comparability to Hyperdimension Neptunia:\n\nFirst off, the game runs smooth even on my old toaster card. This is likely due to it being more CPU intensive to begin with, but even then I am seeing no hiccups with my i5-4460 and my HD5750, running Windows 10 Pro x64 - in other words, the game runs smoothly at 60fps (which is the default lock as per the .ini file, but may be unlockable).\nThere are no in-game graphics options to speak of besides resolution and a fullscreen/windowed/borderless toggle, but then you'll hardly need more, seeing the game's artstyle and heavy reliance on animated 2D backgrounds and sprites. Further graphics settings may be available in the .ini file again, and AA can be forced via your graphics vendor's control panel regardless.\nSettings for controls, sound and so on are all there, including manual button remapping for your gamepad (which should help with getting non-standard Xinput pads to work), and Voice, Movie, Effects and BGM volumes have separate sliders, as they should have.\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, the game is close to Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth, which it supposedly shares the engine with. If you've played Neptunia, you'll find it easy to get into the systems, though even after an hour of playtime, there are differences and additions in Fairy Fencer F. \n\nThose differences include the Tension meter that raises/lowers your stats in combat and allows you to transform at a certain point (whereas Neptunia gave you more free reign with transformations), \"boosting\" weapon stats, learning new skills and what not through using them to earn and assign points, attaching Fairies to your characters for added perks, switching weapon styles to increase certain parameters like crit chance, speed and the likes, and Character Challenges which reward you with stat increases for various gameplay milestones. \nThese challenges also encourage cycling through your party members, as some of them demand a character to be the party leader or do things only the leader is able to. It is a nifty system I'm looking forward to explore more in-depth, as it should keep things fresh (if a little grindy in the higher ranks, I expect).\nOverall, the gameplay system at least feels more complex in terms of customization and late-game options than Neptunia (though take my judgement with a grain of salt - I'm not that far in yet).\n\nThe story and characters up to now seem like a good combination. The character dynamic between the protagonist and his fairy partner are funny and lighthearted, which reminds of Neptunia, but appears far more grounded and less preposterous than Nep did. If Gamindustri felt too wacky and over the top to you, Fairy Fencer F might deliver a more enjoyable experience.\nThe basic plot is very simple in theory: Collect all the Fury weapons and revive the Goddess, explore dungeons, talk to people in towns (again, more grounded than in Neptunia, though very similar in execution), and fill your protagonist's stomach.\n\nThe art design and music are straight-up gorgeous, as would be expected from the team behind them (which includes Nobuo Uematsu as composer and Yoshitaka Amano on the art, two big creatives that made Final Fantasy so good in its glory days). Fairy Fencer F offers some top-notch, high quality art in the typical J-RPG/Anime style. \n\nOverall, I am pleased with my purchase, and will continue playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1438723587, "timestamp_updated": 1438723587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17389488": {"recommendationid": "17389488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101863983", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445328465}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played and platinumed Fairy Fencer F on the PS3, and this review is based on my playthrough of that, and what I've seen for this port's optimization. I'll edit the review if I see the need to as I playthrough the game.\nThis is going to be very simple pros and cons to get straight to the point, and make some comaprisons with Hyperdimension Neptunia, since that's what a lot of the people buying into this are expecting.\n\n[h1]Characters[/h1] \nFang, Eryn and Tiara are fantastic comedy-centered characters. However, these are the only characters that will give you the same feel as Neptunia. Not only that, but every other playable character is almost completely insignificnt. (Minus a betrayal or two.) The voice acting is fantastic; both Japanese, and English. The art and character sprites are much better than in Neptunia.\n\n[h1]Dungeons[/h1] \nThe dungeons aren't copy pastes of eachother. That's right, did going through the same exact landscape OVER, AND OVER in Neptunia get on your nerves? You don't have you worry about it for this. Some of the dungeons are far more expancsive as well. Regardless, however, many still aren't the most visually appealing.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1] \nAlmost a copy-paste of Neptunia's system. There are some differences, such as the tension gauge, which is used to Fairize (Essentially the characters transformation, like that CPU forms in Neptunia.). You do not equip weapons, because each weapon is bound to the character it is equips on. Instead you power up your character with WP you gan through battle.\n\n[h1]Grinding[/h1] \nThe grinding in Fairy Fencer F is much worse than Neptunia. Although the game does not pose very much difficulty, you'll still be killing the same enemies OVER AND OVER to amass WP, to power up your weapons. WP is earned maybe 2-3 per battle, and is used to dictate your weapons Physical attack Power, to its Range, special attacks, normal combo attacks and even the amount of hits it gets in a combo. It also gets to the point where a single power up can cost 1000 WP. So get ready for the grind train when you go to play this.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1] \nIt's pretty generic for jRPG games. Sealed dieties that split their power in the past. Hero finds a \"fragment\" of the power and continues on a journey to unseal the \"goddess\", while the badguys try to unseal the \"demon lord\". You'll basically fight one badguy at a time sent by the enemy organization until you reach the end of the game. All threee ending are lackluster. Once again, it's Idea Factory, and Compile Heart's characters that make the game. \n\n[h1]Optimization[/h1] \nThey overlayed the buttons for default keyboard use; which they didn't do for Re;Birth's steam release. This makes it much easier to get used to the mapping. There's always full controller support as well if you're still having trouble. There's much more mouse support than Neptunia. YOU CAN MOVE AROUND WITH THE MOUSE. REVOLUTIONARY. I haven't had too many FPS issues, as I did with Re;Birth (Mainly Sister Generation) but, I'm newer to computer gaming, so I don't have much experience with FPS issues in the first place. Most of the DLC comes with the product. Of course, these are originally free DLC in the first place, but at least you don't need to go download them one by one like I had to do on the playstation store. It looks like they'll release the paid DLC in the future as well.\n\n[h1]tl;dr[/h1] \nIt's definetly a different experience than Neptunia, but you'll see the similarities. The grinding made me want to break the game disk; but now that I baught the game on steam I'll experience it all over again. \nHowever, it is most definetly worth the money.", "timestamp_created": 1438722245, "timestamp_updated": 1438727536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704438", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17389057": {"recommendationid": "17389057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149046461", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441048679}, "language": "english", "review": "Like Hyperdimension but with guys, and food other than pudding.", "timestamp_created": 1438720556, "timestamp_updated": 1438720556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419770", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17389012": {"recommendationid": "17389012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008205217", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438814170}, "language": "english", "review": "60fps 1080p.

other ports that are 1:1 ports without PC exclusive features. Resolutions up to 4K and possibly higher are supported! There are options to enable AntiAliasing in the FairyFencer.ini not only that but it can run at any FPS your pc can handle so those with 144Hz monitors can change the 60fps cap to 144 via the FairyFencer.ini located at the games root. Older video cards can disable shadows and effects to gain an fps boost (also found in the .ini). \n\nPerformance aside the game is quite fun to play! The translation wasn't screwed over, the combat system is great and the characters actually develop as the story goes. I have played through this game 8 times and exp grinded like hell and i'm still not burned out!\n\nOverall this was a hell of a good game. Would I recommend? What kind of silly question is that?

[/u]\n[i] For people who expierence low FPS on windows 8.1 i suggest you to update it to windows 10 beacuse after doing that it increase my FPS from 43 to 60. [/i]\n\n[u] Hope this helps because i saw some people having trouble with the FPS they have in game. [/u]\n\n[h1] A brief overview of the Story [/h1]\nA long time ago there was a conflict between a goddess and a evil god. The two deities didn\u2019t fight directly, but created a large number of special weapons imbued with their godly energy, each containing the life force of a fairy for others to use. Eventually, these powers sealed each other and the power vanished from the world. Going into modern times, warriors that wield the powers (Furies) are known as \"Fencers.\"\nFairy Fencer F places you in the role of Fang reluctant hero that is more interested in his next meal, becomes a Fencer\u2014warrior chosen by The Goddess to become companions to fairies, who are magical beings who can transform into a variety of weapons called \"Furies\" and warriors that wield them are \"Fencers\".\nFury weapons are said to be incredibly powerful, so Fencers constantly scramble to acquire them. By a strange coincidence, fang finds himself rescuing a young woman named Tiara, who is also a Fencer as well. This fateful encounter between two Fencers has dire consequences, and Fang soon finds himself involved in the ongoing conflict between the Goddess and Vile God.\n\n[h1] Gameplay and important elements[/h1]\nUnlike most JRPGs, you don't equip any new weapons in Fairy Fencer F. Since each Fencer is bound to one fairy partner, you instead upgrade your fairy to increase its capabilities and powers which is unique. (Unless you have the DLC weapons then equipping weapons will affect stats)\n\n[u] The combat system is close to Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 and 2. So hyperdimension fans you can feel at ease getting this game as you should be familiar with it. [/u]\n\nThe dialogue and voice acting are both well done, and the soundtrack is really nice as the soundtracks blends perfectly with the action going on in your screen.\nAs for the combat the characters special attacks have flashy animations. It is like watching a really cool anime. For example, Fate franchise.\n\nTo sum it up Fairy Fencer F is a enjoyable way to spend 45-50 hours for 1 play through, and would definitely recommend it to, JRPG fans, Anime lovers or those who want to try somethwing new.\n\n[h1] Official website links [/h1]\nhttp://www.compileheart.com/fairyfencer_f/        -japanese website\nhttp://nisamerica.com/games/fairyfencerf/#/top  -english website",

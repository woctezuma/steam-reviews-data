I love this game and I've barely dived into it. \n\nI started off as a stray cat on on the side of a road. I went through some tutorial stuff and chose one of the three clans. (Forest Clan, Mystic Clan, and I believe the Mountain Colony.) I went about my buisness. Meeting my local clan members, hunted, fought, etc. I also encountered some interesting story quest that I'm currently working hard on. I'm curious as to where these story quests are leading and I hope to get back on in a minute to continue my journey to find out. I can't wait to see what else this game offers as it seems pretty deep in a sense.\n\n\nLet's break down all the good points I personally found with game.\n\nMusic: Great. Not annoying and very nice to the ears. Excellent job to the musicians.  \n\nGraphics: To the level of RPG Maker's graphics with a little hint of DS styled graphics tossed in too. I personally like it and thinks it suites the game.\n\nStory: Not much to it at the start, but you tend to get the general idea. Nothing too gripping, but good enough to get you started. The game is designed for you to make your own story, so that's mostly what you do. (Like Skyrim, Minecraft, etc.) Story quests do show up later and they are interesting.\n\nGameplay: This is where the game shines. The menu interface is nice and simple, while the movement, hunting, and fighting work like a charm. The skill based level system is a nice touch, as it keeps the gameplay from feeling too stale and it also helps that you get XP for almost anything. (Outside the colonies.) You can also decorate your house which is pretty cool, and you even have a friendship mechanic with the citizens. (Still not sure how it works completely though. I'm still experimenting.) The hunger system that's in the game is nice and doesn't feel too intrusive. On a side note, hunting takes practice. So expect to take a good bit trying to figure out the hunting mechanic.\n\nConclusion: If you want a realistic cat simulator, then this game ain't for you. But if you want a game simular to Harvest Moon, Sims, or Animcal Crossing, then here you go. I do have one issue and that there's lag in the section with pruple rock pillars, even with fancy lighting turned off , but that's minor.\n\nMaking games in Game Maker is not easy. (I should know.) But this small team showed what you can do with the program when you know what your doing. Makes me rethink games I used to work on. \n\nAnyways, I love this game and I hope to see more for this game in the future.

A few months ago, after a nostalgia trip, I stumbled upon the Kickstarter for Cattails and I was so excited! I'm happy to say that I'd recommend this game, and that I personally feel it stands on its own apart from the Warrior's series. However, it's not without its flaws, and I can't help but want the game to continue being fleshed out for the $15 price tag. \n\nPros:\n[list]\n    [*] The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. It's relaxing and fits the tone of the game very well.\n    [*] Having kittens that actually grow up is really enjoyable! Unlike many other similar games, you get to be highly involved with your offspring.\n    [*] The dialouge gives you a feel-good vibe. This only goes for the Forest Colony (as it's the only area I've really played through), but every character feels distinct and becoming friends with them for the extra dialouge feels valuable. \n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n    [*] It doesn't do anything revolutionary. It feels a lot like a smaller Stardew Valley with a different coat of paint. This isn't helped by the fact that Stardew Valley is the same price ($15) with more content and polish (the difference between the mines, for instance). \n    [*] This may be a personal preference, but something about many areas of the map made them a bit... forgetable. Some areas blend together, and this is really unfortunate because some areas are given a lot of detail (the large tree in the swamp territory comes to mind). I was constantly getting lost despite frequently using the map.\n    [*] Although the dialouge that exists is well-written, after the first year and befriending the cats in your colony, you're going to get the same 5 or so lines of dialouge. Although there are other characters in other colonies to befriend, I just can't help but want more!\n[/list]\n\nConclusion: I'd recommend Cattails to anyone who enjoyed Untold Tales (this is a MAJOR upgrade), has already played through Stardew Valley, and/or has read the Warriors series. It's a casual, but sometimes challenging (took me forever to get a cardinal, lol), game that'll make you feel warm and fuzzy.

I'm not a warriors fan that much, but this game is so fun. Right now I prefer to play this game instead of my favorite game. The game is basically never-ending. There's no \"the end\", while there may be one, you can just keep playing on your save, and you can make new characters. The thing that makes it addicting, in my opinion, is the variety of things to do. When you think you've done everything, you haven't. Don't judge the game when you first start, I didn't play it as much and wanted to play it that much now. Make sure to upgrade your fighting and hunting, hunting gives you a fair amount of coins and land, while hunting gives you lots of food. The festival games are really fun, they also give you special coins for special items. Also, if you're going to marry a cat, make sure it has the red heart when you're talking to it. The game is adventurous, and the fighting is actually not boring, and the game is pretty casual most of the time. Honestly I would say this game is worth 60$, not that I want it to be 60$, because less people would buy it. 15 dollars is a very good price, you should get it even if you don't like warriors. Or cats. Often, you will find your inventory being a lot less full in the winter than any other seasons. (logic, duh.) So basically, you should get the game.

There's a surprising amount of depth to this game and you can just tell that the devs are thoughtful people. The only thing I don't like is the amount of killing lol. It seems a little out of place for such a cute game. One minute you're getting attached to an irrelevant NPC from your colony as they talk about their secret pet mouse that they couldn't bear to kill, and the next minute you hear sounds of the rival colony slashing them to death.

In this game you become a cat and you get to experience its life in the wild. When you start the game, you get to choose between three colonies of different cats and that colony becomes your new home. Some of the things you are able to do in the game is hunt, forage, mine, have a romance, and do a short story. The mechanics for the same are simple enough to get the hang of and if for some reason you do not like the placement of the keys, then you can change them. I haven't played around with the mining mechanic too much but it's like Stardew Valley. There are a hundred levels and the farther you go down the better gems you find. \n\nFor the romance option, for each colony you join there are three romance options in each colony. I have not tested it but I believe that even if you are in colony A but like one of the cats in colony B, you can still romance that cat. It's just out of your way to visit them. When you join a colony the romanceable cat starts with two stars and once you reach five stars you can date and then that cat gains a heart. Once that heart turns red then you can marry. Eventually you can have kittens and I believe you can have four. I haven't reach that part yet so I can not say what happens after you get the kittens. I believe you can name them and build your relationship with them. Also if you do not like your partner cat then you can get a black rose and break up with them. \n\nThe story/quest of the game isn't too difficult. It's pretty much a fetch quest of different plants, animals, and bugs that you can find in the game. Its taken me about three years in the game to really find everything. Some things are more rare then others and you could buy some of the items if you don't have the patience to look. The story doesn't have very much depth and they try and cover that up with the fetch quests but this game is not really big enough for a large story so the quest length wasn't too bad in my opinion. \n\nThey let you customize your cat at the beginning of the story. Through out the game, you can buy differant colors of fur for your cat and accessories at different colonies. One thing I like that the game does is that they allow you to recustomise your cat at any time in the game. You could be blue one day and white the next, with different colored eyes. The game also has an experience system where you upgrade four skills to level ten such as hunting, swimming, foraging, and fighting. The game also has festivals at the end of each season where you can play mini games and get tokens. The tokens let you buy quest items, furniture, accessories and even pets for your cat like butterflies and fireflies. \n\nThe seasons are ten days long and there are four seasons. The last day of the season is the festival where all the colonies gather. Another thing you can do in the game is upgrade your den/home. You can add a storage room, garden (kinda), nursery, and two additional rooms to put random stuff in. \n\nOverall I think this game is cute but there is a lot of grinding for the game and the main story is a fetch quest. If you do not mind that and even enjoy that type of game then you will have a blast. I think the customising of your cat in the game is well done and they give you a ton of options and the map is cute/pretty. The music in the game is also well done. There is a huge cat book series I read as a kid called \"Warriors\" by Erin Hunter and this game brought back major memories of that book series. So over all I like the game, I personally think 15$ is a bit much and would wait for the game to go on sale. The game is very grindy but other then that I had no issues with it and thought it was fun and brought back memories of my childhood. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513911668, "timestamp_updated": 1513911668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559567", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38507739": {"recommendationid": "38507739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054134534", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1237, "last_played": 1514309821}, "language": "danish", "review": "Addictive!

However, I also didn't follow the news on this game aside from its release date, so I could have an experience without more expectations than necessary. \n\nI'd also like to clarify this is my first attempt at a more in-depth review of a game, so I apologize if I'm not really up to par.\n\nAlso, this review may contain spoilers for events throughout parts of the game, if you consider things like characters and details on recurring events to be spoilers.\n\nAs someone who still plays Untold Tales today because I find it fun and familiar, I was hoping for an experience that wasn't a carbon copy of Untold Tales' simple formula, but took the parts that are still fun even now and remixed them into something even better, and something new, and, well... I wasn't disappointed. Cattails is altogether a very different experience from Untold Tales, that's something I can tell just by playing the small amount I have. It feels a lot more like Stardew Valley, which... I personally don't mind. Probably because I love Stardew Valley.\n\nThe hunting system from Untold Tales is here, but far better executed - probably because this game actually has a budget to work with and a more experienced developer, but I digress. There's also a lot more variety in the prey you can catch, and the general distance from which you can do so. Some prey even has variants, such as the three types of mice I've come across so far - there might be more, I don't know. I really like it, even though I spent about ten minutes in the tutorial because I didn't realize I had to press the spacebar to pounce rather than just releasing shift like in Untold Tales. Another cool thing that I'll put here is that what seem like uninteractable set pieces, like butterflies and fireflies, can be attacked and collected. I've been collecting butterflies myself.\n\nThere are three colonies, and after the tutorial you're given the option to join any one of them. Coco, the tutorial cat, pushes the Forest Colony but I'm a rebel, so I picked the Mystic Colony. They live in the wetlands and are led by Alisa. I haven't played with either of the other colonies yet, so my experience is 100% a Mystic experience.\n\nEvery colony has a few datable cats. After looking over my options - the older-than-you Slip, the leader Alisa who I haven't had a chance to get to know, and Nil, who needs higher self-esteem - I went for Nil. Mostly because I gave him catnip one time and he told me he didn't believe he was worthy of it, and I can relate to that.\n\nCat relationships are another place where it falls into being a lot like Stardew Valley. For one, it's not locked by gender - the player doesn't have an established gender. Secondly, you have a relationship level, one to five stars, with each cat. (The datable cats have hearts instead of green arrows in their dialogue boxes.) At four or higher, I think (I'm not sure?) the tutorial wizard Coco will appear in front of your den and instruct you to go get a red rose and ask the object of your affections out already.\n\nOnce you've been dating long enough and have a relationship of five stars, you can buy a certain item that allows you to ask another cat's paw in marriage. Holy catrimony, if you will. Once married, your spouse moves into your den and you can have kittens. I haven't had any luck with my many, many proposals to Nil so far, so that's about as far as my knowledge extends.\n\nSomething I do know more about, though, is dens! You start with a smallish den, but partway through your first winter Molby the Construction Mole will show up in front of it, install his calling card without your consent, and offer to expand your home for money. Some of these upgrades are useful! I've only got two so far, the nursery (required to have kittens) and the herb garden, which lets you grow the plants you forage from around the world, even out of season. You can decorate your den with items from all your exploring. The items don't disappear, which is nice. I've started a stockpile of prey next to my nest.\n\nOn that note, let's talk about skills! Hunting, foraging, and fighting, and probably other things I haven't noticed, all help earn you experience points that you can use to upgrade your skills. Unlike Stardew Valley, your skills don't just level up on their own when you do things - you can apply your experience points to any of the skills, which can be useful if you want to level up something like swimming. I haven't reached the cap (level 10) on any of my skills yet, so that's a bonus.\n\nThe seasons change, too. They're each ten days long, with a festival on the tenth day of each. A festival is where cats gather at the Sacred Temple, the center of the map, to just kinda chill and compete in festival games. You can earn special currency to spend on items like special colorings for your cat or hard-to-catch prey if you need it for something or decorations for your den or even a pet butterfly.\n\nThere's a lot more things that I can't really talk about because I haven't gotten very far in them - like relationships between colonies, and the mines, and even the main questline. I haven't spent a lot of time on any of those things, so anything I could say would be extremely limited and hasn't come up much in my experience. But that's a big part of this game.\n\nTL;DR: A unique experience, but if you came here looking for the sequel to Untold Tales because of the developer you'll be disappointed. If you really like Stardew Valley or other similar games, though, and are looking for something kind of similar but also different - this might be a good game to check out.", "timestamp_created": 1513400596, "timestamp_updated": 1513400596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38340350": {"recommendationid": "38340350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215056107", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1601, "last_played": 1514071020}, "language": "english", "review": "Im an alpha tester as well as a lover of Falcon's last games. I have played this game on and off for quite a while and i have a lot to say about it. I havent played as much as my best friend (an alpha tester and backer), but i've been involved in the communities discord and heard many opinions about this game! Now, here goes my review!\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay consists of living your life out in a colony as a wild cat. Your main task is hunting to gain food so your cat does not starve. Your cat can catch many wild critters by holding shift and sneaking up on the prey. It feels a bit unbalanced, because hunting is surprisingly challenging at first, but at high levels the prey basically walks into your paws.  The hunting feature is fun although leaves a bit to be desired.\n\nThe next mechanic is foraging. Your cat can pick berries and roots that will restore a tiny bit of hunger, and certain plants to heal you. There are also misc plants with effects like growing territory and giving your cat a boost. Its a cute mechanic and i dont have much to complain about it.\nAlthough, it feels a little unrealistic for cats to eat berries, but i wont complain. One of my cats in real life loves to eat people things sometimes, I caught her eating noodles the other day! It was hilarious!\n\nBattling is a major part of the game, and the thing i was most excited for.  The battle system is pressing spacebar for attack, and there are a couple special skills you can get, such as one that drains health overtime. But i have to say, the battle system could be much improved. Its repetitive, and at high levels, you can defeat patrols of 7 cats at once with ease, which is quite unrealistic. I believe developing the battle system offers a LOT of potential!\n\nNow, here are my main issues regarding gameplay. As people said, it is incredibly fun. Also as people said, it can get really repetitive. My main issue is the game has a lack of balance. When you level up, it becomes so easy (even on hard mode) the game loses a portion of its fun. Prey and items are able to be spotted up on the minimap at high levels, and defeating patrols is extremely easy. The game goes into a cycle of waking your cat, catching prey, talking to  the cats, Maybe mining or some misc activity, but it is not a fun long term game.\n\n Its good to play in short bursts, but i find a lack of incentive to be an issue. The game suffers because it does not have a very good quest or event system that can help you feel like you want to find items for a goal. There is a main quest where you can catch items and bring them to certain statues, which is something, but it is very simple and underwhelming, and seems to just be a continuation of the daily grind. It justs asks you to hunt items and bring them like usual, and does not offer anything unique, like a rescue quest, or a time quest, or maybe a special skill or reward for each quest.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is amazing, but i reccomend the following to improve the gameplay:\n\nA random event system where you may have to find certain items, another cat, or maybe that plays out a little bit of story. Or, a quest system where you can find and bring back rewards. Something that keeps you motivated to play! Maybe some special accessory or event when you collect certain items. There should be something to break that repitition cycle so many people speak of, making it a true wilderness adventure.\n\nBut, thats my take on it.\n\n\nStory:\n\nIll say that there is not quite a story in this game that is very developed. We have many cats we can talk to in our colonies, and they are quite cute characters. I like the uniqueness of the characters designs, and seeing my friends backer cats has made me very happy. You can give them items for dialogue, a fun system. Marriage and kits are great, and i have no suggestions on those.\n\n Now, i know falcon has heard this a lot, but a suggested improvement has been to have marriage eligibility for every cat. You cannot marry many of the cats, including some of the communities favorite felines in the game. I do think that would be a positive change. \n\nCoco, our mysterious helper, also has their own gamemode. Its the gameplay with the statues, where you give the statues items, the forest guardian quest. Now, my best friend, also an alpha tester, has said it leaves room for improvement, and i must agree. It was not very engaging to get the statues items, and it did not reap satisfying enough rewards for the effort. Now, why would i not like the system when i suggested quests and events? Well, it eases the repetitive grind. You are still looking out for the same items and living the same day, though, and it just did not seem any more interesting then your daily cat life.\n\n\nMusic:\n\nThe music? Well, it is what it is. Not amazing, but it has its moments. There are a couple tracks that play during seasons, which are nice, though i only really like the winter soundtrack. I still am satisfied with it, as music isnt a big deal for me, though it can get repetitive. I just realized I have the whole soundtrack too apparently, being an alpha backer, hehe.\n\nArt:\n\nI have a lot to say about the art of the game. Simply, I love it. The cats and enviroments look wonderful and natural. I have to say, this was a huge selling point of the game for me. Sure, you could say some of the cats profiles look a bit awkward, but the sheer effort that was put into it makes me unable to say anything bad about it. I love the charm of the leaves and bugs flying through the air, and the winter snow is beautiful. Thanks for making me feel like a real cat, falcon.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIm going to end by saying that I really love cattails. I know it seems like i gave it some negative comments, but i want the game to improve. I love the potential, direction, art, everything. This game is important to me and im very thankful to falcon for this amazing game yet again.  It suffers from repetition, a bit of ability imbalance, and a oversimplified battle mechanic, but succeeds in aesthetic and design, adorable and unique direction and customization, and charming characters. I have met many wonderful friends who play this game, mainly through the discord.Thanks for letting me live life like how it goes in my cats wildest dreams!", "timestamp_created": 1513395439, "timestamp_updated": 1513395439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532710", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38331608": {"recommendationid": "38331608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047285515", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513185662}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh man, this game!\nI'm a type of gamer who would love to see games where you are an animal to control. I have searched a bunch till I got into this!\n\nAt first I saw this game before release and though to my self that this is just some RPG Maker made game, something simple and something even I can make. After the release, the game has a lot of positive reviews, so I must be wrong!\nI bought it, and I tried it. Good god I was wrong! I played for a couple of hours and then I was stuck after days in this game.\n\nI have found some flaws in this game but not too big. FPS drop happens by certain spots ingame, these are quite familiar to me. I had used RPG Maker before, and I know when you adding too much stuff on one screen, the game lags and the framerate drops extremely, and it's just a 2D game which I don't understand why that's happening. However, I wonder if it has something to do with bitrate of the game. I mean... I have programs that has 32 bits and 64 bits, comparing them what I have notice is that 64 bit can handle more than 32 bits... right? Could it be that this game runs on low bits? Anyway...\n\nAlso after you get released from Coco on the first days, it gets quite lonely for not sure what to do. But it's not a big deal, you can then go explore and do whatever you want. But I do wish there were more intereaction with the cats around, like cutsceens, plots and more about them, you know?\n\nBut overall, it's really nice! The music... Oh god the music! I loving it!

Essentially it's a lot like Stardew Valley, but you- well, you're a cat. You hunt, forage, fight cats from other colonies to establish territorial dominance, do a little dungeon mining, collect item sets, and establish relationships with other cats.\n\nThe problem is that the gameplay mechanics themselves are rather basic, and after a few hours it definitely starts to feel repetitive. Stardew Valley sidestepped this problem by having a farm you could customize in almost every single way, along with stuff like fishing which made what could have been a throw-away mechanic engaging and lucrative. In Cattails, you're given character customization options, and you can eventually upgrade your home den to have stuff like a nursery or garden or aesthetic props, but none of it goes as far as Stardew does. \n\nCombat consists of pressing the attack button until your opponent is dead, occasionally using some special powers you unlock through XP gains. You can, sort of, dodge attacks by moving away from enemies, and you can usually run from any fight if it's too tough or you're being mobbed. Stardew Valley's combat wasn't very good or focal either, but there was at least some variety in enemy types and a certain satisfaction in destroying a bug with a sword. As far as I can tell, Cattails has two enemy types: cats and dungeon bats of varying degrees of HP and attack strength; both attack or run away if their health is low. Considering that you can partake in optional battles every day, the system just doesn't have staying power.\n\nThe dungeon stuff is also underwhelming. You collect ores and gems to trade in for tokens. I may not just be going down deep enough, but at level 20 of the mines, all there was to do was break open rocks and fight the occasional bat. If there's any collectibles or unique things to be found there, I haven't gotten to it yet.\n\nTo hunt, you sneak up to prey (but not too close), until a circle fills up above their heads and you pounce. This is done for animals on land as well as fish. You can forage a moderate variety of plants that do several things, from healing to nourishment to applying poison damage on enemies to cementing your colony's control of a region. \n\nThe relationship system is well done, but also comparatively limited in content. There are about a handful or so of interactible NPCs in each colony/faction, and AFAIK only through festivals do you interact meaningfully with other colonies outside of battles. You can date NPCs from your colony and eventually marry them and have kittens if you want. The writing is well done, amusing and cute, though characters tend to repeat themselves as the days go by. \n\nDespite its problems, though, I like Cattails. It needs more content put into it (after glancing at their website forums it looks like the devs are working on custom colony building) and it doesn't have nearly the same effortlessly addicting quality that Stardew Valley does, but it's bursting with charm.

There's a central MacGuffen that imposes a modicum of order and direction on all this murder, but while it's welcome, it's not really the point. \n\nThere are also cat politics which I haven't quite worked out yet (though again, systems that you haven't quite worked out yet are part of the joy of this sort of game). There's a mining section stapled on, which is fine. But mostly you walk around the landscape to murder small animals and to get slightly better at murdering small animals with practice. \n\nAnt it does take practice--there's an awkward rhythm to the pounce that is quite satisfying when you get it right, but the kill never feels guaranteed. I imagine that there's a lot of math happening in the background generating random-feeling pounce radii and the like based on the temperature and the time of day and how hungry your cat is, and so on. Fighting other cats is similarly fidgety and awkward, but in that good way, where getting into any fight at all is a fearsome proposition. You feel like you're part of an ecosystem rather than The Player Character in an important way. \n\nI could make some criticisms that are more like dev notes. (Menus are pretty bad: If you want to sell and then buy a commodity, you need to talk to a character, complete the sell transaction, leave the dialogue tree, talk to the character again and complete a separate buy transaction. There doesn't seem to be a way to assign special abilities to particular keys/buttons, so you're stuck with the default assignments until you have enough skills unlocked to strategically enable and disable them. There are some contextual situations where the game reads your inventory to see what you most likely want to do, and you go through \"Is this what you wanted? Y/N\" until it guesses right.) \n\nBut the rhythm is there. The core mechanic of wandering around and happening upon things and killing them because you are just an adorable murder-baby is there.

It basically boils down to \"who has the most numbers?\" \n>Getting money can be rather hard. Lots of things costs ridiculous amounts of money (nursery expansion is 500 mews!

Looking forward to what the devs release update wise in the future! \n", "timestamp_created": 1512585778, "timestamp_updated": 1512585778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38099640": {"recommendationid": "38099640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003178355", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512863531}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've ever played Harest Moon or Stardew Valley and loved it then you'll love this game too.

Yes and no.\nI've been following the development of the game for a while, so I had pretty high expectations for it. It meats most of my expectations, but not all.  The only real complaint I have right now is that there are a few promised features that aren't here just yet.  The create-your-own colony feature is the most obvious one.  But the dev promises it will be here early 2018.\nI've heard it can get repetative, and I somewhat agree.  It can get dull.  You hunt, fight, forage, swim, and mine.  Do any of them too much, especally on an easier mode, and it gets old after a few hours.  I've found bumping up the difficulty helps make it more interesting.\nThe music also has started to irriate me.  I often play without sound now, and that's really helped.  The music just feels overly cheerful and energetic at some points.\nI also must mention the puzzles in the game.  I'm not a fan, mainly because I wasn't expecting them.  I love puzzles normally, but these felt like they came out of nowhere.  So be prepared if you do Coco's quests, bring food and healing herbs.\nOne thing I do love is having kits. Right now each cat can only have one litter. But the kits are adorable.  Mine are kinda ugly though, but adorably ugly. Kind of like pugs.  The genetics in the game are by far my favorite thing. I am defineity going to be playing around with it to see what horrifying and adorable kittens I can create.\nIt's not a perfect game.  But it's still a fun game for a select group of people.  I happen to be one.  If you like games like Stardew Valley, and other similar simulation titles, you'll probably like this one.\n\nTLDR: Fun, sometimes gets repetative, gentics system is hilarious (in a good way).

I was a kickstarter backer--so I may be blinded by my own purchase a little--but this is a really cute harvest moon-like with cats and without a true farming or ranching mechanic. That said, without the ability to rule your own territory implimented yet, there's really nothing to do after you've collected all the shrine gewgaws. Granted, I've only started on training my two kits, but I think I'm going to hold off playing any more until I can make my own colony. \n\nAnd even then, will having my own colony make a difference? As far as I've seen, the only difference between territory owned by your faction and territory owned by another is that you're more likely to be attacked in the other's. There's no restriction on harvesting herbs or hunting prey outside my territory. I'm not totally confident that there will suddenly be court drama once I'm my own ruler, either.\n\nI really wish that there was an abundance of npcs (some non-colony ones perhaps?), and that some would try to trick you. As it stands, every cat except the faceless npc fighters is basically friendly, and none will attack you outright. I think there's room for a really solid plot here, but it seems to be going for a really kid-friendly bright and cheery atmosphere, after the touching opening sequence. I wish there was a plot that involved finding humans, whether or not they were your original humans, and/or dogs and cars to watch out for. The only combat is bats and cats (and in just one segment, ghosts), and I would like more enemies. Maybe even a Hardcore mode with permadeath.\n\nI know I've really only talked trash about it so far, and I think that's because I WANT it to be really good! Right now (and possibly forever?) it's cute and solid and a little grindy, but I've enjoyed my time with it.

There's enough to do that if you set your own goals, you'll enjoy the experience. It would be nice if the developers continue to add content, and I believe there may be some still to come (at least according to features in the Kickstart stretch goals, although they're mostly there from what I've experienced), so hopefully it gets a little more fleshed out.\n\nMy only real gripe so far is that during the Winter season, the game basically stagnates as there's very little to do. Thankfully, the seasons are quite short and if you're really struggling you can just sleep through it, but it is a little disappointing that your only option during winter is to hunt, as foraging becomes very limited and you're quite restricted in what you can do if you're not already prepared for it. There may be more to do once you're further into the game, but at least for the first winter, prepare to be bored.\n\nIt's a bit like playing Stardew Valley, except without farming, and also you're a cat. There's less to do and fewer NPCs to interact with, but it feels very much inspired by Stardew's style and play. That said, comparison aside, it stands on it's own two feet and if you're a fan of that casual \"do your own thing\" style game, with a cute pixel art presentation, relaxing music, and no real pressure on you to do more than what you want to do, you'll enjoy Cattails.", "timestamp_created": 1512357605, "timestamp_updated": 1512357605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38045996": {"recommendationid": "38045996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026903279", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 630, "last_played": 1514658830}, "language": "english", "review": "Waiting for the next update when they introduce claymore and sniper", "timestamp_created": 1512344688, "timestamp_updated": 1512344688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511017", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38045156": {"recommendationid": "38045156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131413153", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512923832}, "language": "english", "review": "It should be called StarMEW Valley!

Hunting is fun. You can catch big things like rabbits, or fish, or squrriels, or you can forage if you prefer to be vegetarian, though harder at first when your skills are low. (Yeah, skills!)\n\nTheres a big storyquest you can follow kind of behind the scenes, but theres no rush to it or limit.\nYou can also marry other people in your village, befriend the other villages (instead of war, give them gifts!) and have kittens too. I think all cats are datable if they have a friendship meter, and thats basically all of them in the village anyway. There doesnt appear to be gender specific ones either, with anything, coats/accessories/toys/cats etc., Everyone seems to be neutral, even my own cat - when I switch pelts I have to question 'Am I a boy cat? or a girl?' Somedays I guess I'm either! No one brings it up in the game, so you can naturally just marry anyone since nobody is specifically fem/masc. That's neat. I'm dating pebble, I have no idea if he's a boy or a girl, but hey, I've got me a mate!\n\nThere is weather and night/day cycles, and events. At the end of the very short month, there is a festival where all the cats get together to play games. The first month has turtle racing where you cheer on turtles to race. If you win, you get tokens which you can use to change your cat colour to something special or buy pets/accessories/etc\n\nThis game is stardew valley for cats.\n\n\n--------------\n[Pros] \n=============\n-Good music\n-Cute Graphics\n-Open world, can wander anywhere, anytime\n-Hunting/Gathering/Fighting and more!\n-Mining and marriagible npcs!\n\n[Cons]\n=============\n-Two areas on the map can be more laggy than others, for the most part I don't experience any lag, but the mines by default have a lighting system that you can turn off in options. That seems to stop that lag a bit, the second area is by the river that connects to the ocean. It's mostly okay to walk near, but in the rain it can get really awful.\n-More content is needed!

I gotta say I was pretty hyped for it; while I didn't know about the kickstarter and couldn't afford the Early Access, I thought the trailer was absolutely adorable. The art had a simple and colorful appeal to it, and the gameplay looked sound. Playing the game was about the experience I expected after seeing that trailer. You hunt down prey to stay full, and can forage for herbs which act as curatives for your health. I was surprised to discover that you could even mine and fish!\n\n I haven't gotten married or had a litter yet, but did score a mate, and that process is very Harvest Moon-esque, relying entirely on gifts. I romanced Scout as they seemed like the easiest, being really into hunting means they'd really like prey! I have no idea what any other character would like as gifts, or if it's just like real life cats, where they all like to be gifted prey.\n\nI've also started on the main storyline, completing two of the game's collection goals and puzzle dungeons. That's right, there are puzzle dungeons! From what I can tell, they are relatively small, and all underground and locked until you need to explore them; once you get the treasure inside, they lock again. It's a neat way of stopping the player from sequence breaking.\n\nOne criticism I do have is that if you die, you lose ALL your items, not just \"one or two\" like your local doctor cat might tell you, and that the doc only heals you halfway. But, once you get a storage unit in your den, this becomes less of a big issue.\n\nAnother criticism I have is that the seasons and the days themselves are very short. I blazed through my first year in about 7 and 1/2 hours because there are only 10 days per season, and I might be wrong but I think the time ratio is faster than 1 in-game hour per irl minute. Since you're a cat and they're aren't really time constraints anywhere, it's not that big a deal, it just makes the game seem smaller; I was genuinely shocked and saddened when my first winter was suddenly here, wondering if there might have been a better way to spend that lost time behind me.\n\nAll in all, I think it's a cute game that pretty much nails its theme.

The fact that I really like games like Stardew Valley (which this game takes some inspiration from) was a bonus. \n\nAlthough, having played a similar game from this developer, I was a little dissappointed when I began playing. I remember things like significant predator encounters, the chance of deadly cars on the roads, random npc encounters, quests to gain jobs and perks, the ability to build your own colony, and special perks unique to each colony in the previous project. Those things had a lot of charm which I found this game lacking a bit of. \n\nThats not to say this game doesn't do a lot of things right. The npcs are way more fleshed out, with full personalities and likes and dislikes that the player has to pay attention to, as opposed to just spamming them with \"shiny objects\" to gain affection. The music is beautiful, and the graphics and animations have a lot of heart. The game has a nice storyline so far, and although it is lacking the apprentice quest system, it has a very nice stardew-inspired quest system in it's place. Kits dont just sit there and do nothing. Overall, the gameplay is better. It's clear that a lot of hard work went into this project, and I wouldn't be surprised if some of the things I mentioned earlier were added in future updates.

In the first few days, I didn't like it at all, and actually wrote an unfavorable review. But, after the first season, I saw past the cons and discovered how much the game had to offer. (Some people say that the game gets repetitive, and sometimes it does, but you have to remember that it will be updated, and every time you repeat something, it usually takes you closer to your next goal.)\n\nPROS:\n+Beautiful graphics\n+Interesting gameplay\n+Diverse amount of characters\n+Lots of polish, clearly had much work put into it\n+Very pleasant soundtrack\n+Creative ideas and designs for characters and settings\n+Much better A.I. for the NPCs than in some other games.\n\nCONS:\n-You seem to have less purpose than you did in the developers' other, although less professional, great game called Warriors: Untold Tales. (Which this game draws from for its battle mechanics and foraging techniques.) Part of what made that game fun was the nostalgia it invoked in fans and the sense of duty and belonging in the clan. You would work hard to support your friends and family, giving you a reason to hunt and survive every day. Sadly, in this game, there's not much in the way of achieving rank and honor, or supporting anyone else. No one relies on you to feed them. This takes away some of the objective and motivation from the game.\n-Difficulty with the main story mode. The main story mode starts out easy. You must capture a few different types of prey, which are all common. But when you unlock the first pillar, the others demand you find vaguely rare prey like catfish, and with the really short days, trying to balance taking care of your mate, finding time to return to base and sleep, and foraging, the tasks become drawn out.\n\nOverall, this game is wonderful.

I've read a few other review and I have to agree that more structured clans/tribes would be a really good part of the game. Another feature from the old game that I really liked was becoming a rogue and having the ability to start your own clan. Those are two things that would be great to have in the game, and would make the already positive experience even better! \n\nOther things I think could be added would be things like, multiple different stories to continually progress the game(while keeping it an open game), small quests from the other clan cats that could help to boost rep, A few different dialogues for each relationship that could change out each day, and maybe even an aging system. Of course, these are all just reccomendations, and making a game is definitely not an easy feat. \n\nI definitely recommend this game for cat lovers, or warrior cat lovers!

It's not substantial. There really is not much to do. It plays fantasticaly, the graphics and music are great, but the gameplay is extremely lacking. Once you're past the tutorial, there's no direction, no guide, no goal. I understand the idea of an open ended game, but this isn't like Stardew Valley, where you know from the beginning you're supposed to be rebuilding a farm, and the game allows you to go about doing that however you want. In Cattails, there's just nothing. There is an optional story, I think, but it doesn't seem to have much of an impact on the game. You can ... hunt ... fight ... get ... married ? \n\nAnd don't get me wrong, all those mechanics are great. This game is just not worth fifteen dollars, and I was not prepared for the lack of content. If you're fine with super open-ended gameplay where you really just ... wander around ... and you think that's worth fifteen dollars, then by all means, get Cattails. If not - wait for a sale, or avoid altogether.\n\nAlso, a lot of people are comparing this game to Warrior Cats, and while I get it, don't come into this game expecting a Warrior Cats-like experience. You don't have a specific role or purpose in your colony - there's no sense of community. Conversations are repetitive and impersonal. So, if you're looking for the experience of being in an Erin Hunter book, don't look here.\n\n\n\nedit: relax everybody. i know i haven't played very long - and that playtime was even over the course of two days. either way, my main point was that this game is not worth 15.00. i have read and understand your criticism - take or leave this review.", "timestamp_created": 1512230302, "timestamp_updated": 1514127121, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 79, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585193", "comment_count": "23", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38004510": {"recommendationid": "38004510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220256017", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1513869415}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game with Kickstarter when it first was introduced and I am so happy I did.\n\nThe game has an amazing soundtrack, artstyle, and is very charming.

I am writing this in the beta period, and here are my thoughts..\n\nCattails is being developed by a two-person team, and what a wonderful game they have made! When you first start, a rather touching intro plays before leading you to the tutorial. A cat named Coco teaches you the basics before letting you choose a colony and taking you to your den. And from that point on, it's all you. Who will your cat be? Will they be a stealthy hunter, an athletic swimmer, maybe a strong fighter or even a forager? Will they be a plain, white run-of-the mill kitty or a diverse, colorful rainbow with a nightcap on their head? Will they start a family or live alone..? There will also be a story to follow in the full release, but it won't be that forced.\n\nBut enough with cats, let's look at the world. It's quite large, with secrets to find and caves to explore. Your colony can claim different squares on the map. The only squares they can't claim are a specific two squares of one colony's territory and The Sacred Temple, a place where festivals are held. In festivals, cats from every colony - Forest, Mountain and Mystic - gather together and celebrate the end of the season. Games are held, and you can talk to Coco in the middle to participate. The game is different every season.\n\nThe graphics are cute, and good for this type of game. The art can be a little misleading, but it's nice anyways. I haven't heard the music myself as my volume is always on mute, but I've heard positive response to it. The controls are good too, but maybe not as good for right handed people. The gameplay can either be fun or repetitive, depending on if you like these types of games. To put it simply, if you don't like Stardew Valley you probably won't like this game either.\n\nBut overall, Cattails is a great game and I definitely recommend it if you're interested!", "timestamp_created": 1512148082, "timestamp_updated": 1512148082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840696", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37980246": {"recommendationid": "37980246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071493077", "num_games_owned": 564, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512217489}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like Warrior Cats but with capitalism and a lack of universal health care.\n\nIt's basically the American Warrior Cats.", "timestamp_created": 1512145376, "timestamp_updated": 1512145376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 122, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603835", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37979543": {"recommendationid": "37979543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081257098", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509133603}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game, but be warned; It might get repetitive after a while.", "timestamp_created": 1512143522, "timestamp_updated": 1512143522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591740", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37979450": {"recommendationid": "37979450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348504982", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 436, "last_played": 1514430753}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this is an excellent game for all ages!

So, when I was purusing Steam for a game to use my gift card on, this game definitely piqued my curiosity right away. And, well, we all know about curiosity and cats... ;)\n\nIn addition to my love of cats, I also really love life simulation games. Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, Animal Crossing--you name a sim game, I have probably played and loved it. So, with my love of cats and my love of sim games, Cattails was bound to be the perfect game for me. And boy, is it ever! :D\n\nCattails is adorable, addictive, and so much fun to play! The hunting system takes a little getting used to, but once you start upgrading your abilities, the whole world opens up to you. From hunting, foraging, and exploring to fighting territorial battles, Cattails will make every trip out into the world an exciting adventure. Get to know your fellow cats, form alliances with other clans, and woo a special kitty to be your spouse. Attend season festivals complete with cute little mini-games to win rare prizes (my favorites are the decorations for your den!). And while you're busy doing all that, you can also work on completing your quest to bring balance back to the world. There's no shortage of things to do, but you get to take it all at your own pace.\n\nI appreciate Cattails because it offers many different experiences. Sometimes, it's gentle and relaxed; other times, it's tense and fast-paced. It can be easy or challenging, joyful or heart-breaking.

The game is about restoring the balance and bringing back the Forest Guardian, which is only the main quest. I believe there are sidequests aswell. This game is obviously inspired by Warrior Cats, as Falconstar's previous project was a warrior cats simulator called Warriors: Untold Tales. I know about this game because of that game, i have been looking forward to this game for ages and i love it. If you're not sure if you want to get this, download Untold Tales. Its basically a simpler version of this game with less things to do, no controller support, worse graphics etc. But the concept is the same. You have your cat character with different territories, you can collect herbs, fish, prey and more and you can have kits and make friends. If you play Untold Tales and think \"Hey, i like this concept but its missing alot.\" you will definitly enjoy this game. All things that are wrong, annoying and missing in Untold Tales are in this game, complete with extra features and things to do. However i can see this not being for everyone. I reccomend this game to anyone who liked Untold Tales or likes a cute rpg pixel game about cats. Here are my pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n- Improvement from Untold Tales\n- Better graphics\n- Adorable cats\n- Many things to collect and customize\n- Long main quest with many side quests (so more enjoyment)\n- The fact that you can date cats and have kits, which i find hilarious\n- Cat customization\n\nCons:\n- Keyboard controls are meh. I reccomend using a controller.\n- May get boring for people that do not like this genre or Warrior Cats\n- Missy is a bit of an annoying brat no matter how much you give her in the beginning.\n- Some items to buy are very expensive and will take a long time just hunting for a few hours.\n\nI really dont have more nitpicks, and these are very small and dont ruin anything for me (except the keyboard one i really reccomend a controller)\n\nAgain, if you're not sure. watch other people play it or download Untold Tales for free. :)\n\nLove this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1515195655, "timestamp_updated": 1515195655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39090216": {"recommendationid": "39090216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197232245", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 814, "last_played": 1515986642}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, I could play it for weeks on end.

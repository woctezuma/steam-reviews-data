C'est le style de jeu qui favorise grandement le r\u00e9flexe, la rapidit\u00e9 d'action et la jugeote, mais ne va t-il pas un peu loin ?[/h1]\n\n [url=https://cadeauxsteam.com/articles/read/97/on-a-pose-le-grappin-sur-remnants-of-naezith]Cette critique est plus simple \u00e0 lire depuis notre site internet, mais vous pouvez \u00e9galement la lire ici.[/url]\n\nIl est assez difficile de doser la duret\u00e9 et la difficult\u00e9 d'un jeu de plateforme : soit il se termine sans le moindre effort et l'on est d\u00e9\u00e7u, soit on s'arrache les cheveux dessus, et c'est pas forc\u00e9ment meilleur. Remnants of Naezith semble appartenir \u00e0 cette deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie : celle des jeux particuli\u00e8rement difficile. Il faut s'orienter dans une map basique 2D en se g\u00e9rant entre l'utilisation du grappin, du \" dash \", pouvoir de courir en Sonic, r\u00e9gl\u00e9 sous le syst\u00e8me d'endurance de la stamina. En jouant au jeu, et c'est peut-\u00eatre le plus grand probl\u00e8me, c'est qu'il faut \u00e0 la fois viser la destination au grappin, se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 ( \u00e9ventuellement ) utiliser un dash pour passer au-dessus de l'eau et bien \u00e9videmment sauter, tout en \u00e9vitant les pics, qui sont absolument partout ...\n\n \n\nEt c'est peut-\u00eatre le probl\u00e8me d'un jeu difficile : trop envahi par la volont\u00e9 de faire un jeu difficile, on oublie totalement le level design, plus de paysage ou de beaut\u00e9, on place juste de la terre entre des pi\u00e8ges : c'est dommage ! C'est la particularit\u00e9 toujours un peu d\u00e9cevante, bien que naturelle des jeux de plateforme. Quand on y pense, les jeux de plateforme les plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bres sont ceux qui combinent la beaut\u00e9 du level design, ainsi que la beaut\u00e9.\n\nUne grande volont\u00e9 nous pousse \u00e9galement \u00e0 nous surpasser en utilisant le terrible syst\u00e8me comp\u00e9titif du classement mondial. M\u00eame si l'on ne cherche pas r\u00e9ellement \u00e0 le savoir, \u00e7a peut \u00eatre des fois tr\u00e8s \u00e9logieux, comme un peu g\u00e9nant dans le cas ou l'on est fi\u00e8re de nous mais que l'on termine presque dans les derniers : \u00e0 noter que le classement mondial compte en moyenne 2000 \u00e0 1500 scores ( un score repr\u00e9sente le meilleur fait par le joueur ).\n\nLe fait de nous coller automatiquement avec un fant\u00f4me : c'est int\u00e9ressant, mais frustrant \u00e0 la longue. Il est beaucoup trop rapide pour nous, il est cens\u00e9 nous guider mais en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, on le croise juste \u00e0 la ligne de d\u00e9part et l'on sait que par la suite, on le verra plus. Dans l'id\u00e9al, il faudrait que le fant\u00f4me au m\u00eame chekcpoint. D'ailleurs les checkpoint, \u00e7a part d'une bonne intention, mais est-ce vraiment compatible avec la particularit\u00e9 de nous faire effectuer de bons score en temps ? Il faudrait nous proposer la particularit\u00e9 de recommencer tout le niveau, sans avoir \u00e0 retourner au menu de choix des niveaux.\n\nEn bilan, un jeu globalement int\u00e9ressant, cependant, il y'a du travail \u00e0 apporter afin de le rendre plus int\u00e9ressant. On en est fou, mais c'est sympa pour le d\u00e9fis que le jeu apporte.

But this game seems to mess up the only thing I want from it. Here, a list of all things that make movement bogged down:\n- There seems to be some extreme air resistance above a certain speed.\n- The jump is very low.\n- The double jump seems to just move you up a bit and then extreme vertical friction kicks in.\n- The same as above goes for the boost only horizontal.\n- The grapling hook throwing is on a static angle, while this probably improves challange, it reduces freedom.\n- Thouching the floor slows you down drasticly.\n- And the moving towards the hook is just the worst, it cancels nearly all your swing speed causing you to just go straight for the hook no matter that you were swing at high speed, screwing over your built up speed in the process.\n- To add insult to injury the movement towards the hook doesn't even stop when you let go of the corresponding button.\n\nOther than the issues with the movement the controls are quite uncanny. I just couldn't get the hang of the buttons somehow, not to mention that the pull to hook button is the same as the jump button.\n\nWhile playing this it felt more like I was playing against the game than with the game. It was mostly just frustrating. Perhaps it's more fun when you get good at it. But I have better things to do than mastering a game I do not enjoy.\n\nTL;DR\nmovement feels bogged down, controls are akward.", "timestamp_created": 1518826784, "timestamp_updated": 1518826784, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.408219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1518856066, "developer_response": "Hello, thanks for trying the game! I totally understand you, game has unusual controls and physics, so it requires time before you start enjoying it fully. I hear this a lot, it's pretty normal.\n\nTo be informative, I'd like to clarify some tech behind physics. Also the design choices we took together with the beta community with speedrunners. You can enable Speedometer in Gameplay Settings to verify these if you'd like.\n\n- There is no air resistance/drag. Nothing changes your speed if you are just flying in the air even at crazily high speeds. You keep your momentum.\n- Jump is low because it's a support mechanic, hook being the main one. However there is \"Dash-Jump\" which makes you jump a lot higher.\n- There is no air friction again, the thing which stops you vertically is the \"Variable Height\" tech which makes your jumps higher as you hold it longer, so you can control the height.\n- Dash boost speed is given for 0.5 seconds and then it's taken back, otherwise it makes you too fast too easily, becomes very unbalanced. So it's like temporary boost. But it works only horizontally so you can convert that horizontal speed to vertical speed by swinging with the hook and keep your momentum.\n- We tried every single hook angle and control schemes, this one provided the easiest and fastest gameplay because you need to think less when you get used to this angle. But I agree it's very unusual for beginners.\n- Touching to floor does not affect your horizontal speed in any way. Only water does this. \n- Pull works against the physics unfortunately yes, but it was the most balanced and controllable one. We tried lots of different things like pulling with your current speed or having gravity on while pulling. These didn't work satisfying enough. \n- Pull mechanic works with Hook + Jump buttons combined. I'd love to hear if there is a good alternative while keeping the button count low, that would be very helpful. If you release hook, it stops pulling. But it doesn't stop if you release hook, because hook is the \"hold\" button, jump button is for activation of the pull only. We also tried releasing jump button makes you keep swinging without releasing the hook. But it was very unnatural because there are is no cooldown and you can keep release and press jump button to activate pull on and off and swing a bit between those, looks incredibly weird.\n\nThanks again for the feedback, have a nice day!"}, "40110085": {"recommendationid": "40110085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069955825", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521398621}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Oynarken dark souls oynuyormu\u015f gibi hissettiriyor.M\u00fckemmel.", "timestamp_created": 1518730879, "timestamp_updated": 1518730879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458858", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40109883": {"recommendationid": "40109883", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993103487", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518575982}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este tipo de juegos me gusta jugarlo en compa\u00f1ia de familiares o amig@s. \nDespu\u00e9s de haberlo probado en compa\u00f1\u00eda debo decir que a todos nos a gustado, y te hechas unas risas con los fails :)\nLo recomiendo, sobre la dificultad digamos que no te dan nada hecho hay que aplicarse!\n\nBuen juego, saludos.", "timestamp_created": 1518730325, "timestamp_updated": 1518730325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500581", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40090435": {"recommendationid": "40090435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021003260", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518658681}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok. So after seeing this game posted incessantly all over r/speedrun, and on the recommendation of a couple of friends, I figured I'd try it out.\n\nThis game isn't fun to me. The controls are wonky, Kayra likes to eat shit into walls/spikes/death pits if you lose momentum, and why is there a ghost from the very beginning? I don't want to know how well other people are doing compared to me on my first time playing the game, I want to play and enjoy the game. I figured out you can turn off ghost replays in the menu, but seriously, why are they there the first time I ever play the level? I didn't feel like I was playing and learning, I was literally just copying what I saw the ghost do, which is boring. A couple of levels I literally just waited for the ghost to show me what to do before trying it.\n\nI understand that this is an indie game, but I literally just feel like I'm playing a Terraria mod or something with how...boring the graphics are. 90% of the levels I played were corridors leading me to the end. Also, a small nitpick - the graphics at the bottom right (your percentage and position) overlap when showing your rank at the level leaderboard.\n\nI've played a lot of Super Meat Boy and a bit of Dustforce. This game felt like neither of those. I enjoyed my time with those games. I tried to like this game, but ultimately just wanted to stop playing after a while because it was boring and frustrating. There didn't feel like many (or any) backup strats were available for levels if you failed because of the prevalence of insta-death pits, the lack of stuff to grapple and the general crappiness of how Kayra does while attached to walls.", "timestamp_created": 1518658720, "timestamp_updated": 1518658720, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447240", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1519255954, "developer_response": "Hello there, thanks for trying the game out!\n\nSpent years on controls and mechanics so it would be a nice feedback if you can expand the controls being wonky.\n\nGame has the ghost system as you noticed. It makes you race with the player one rank better than you. If it's your first play, you don't have a rank yet. At that point we thought a \"Mastery\" ghost would be nice as it does not depend on the rank. It's not a leaderboard ghost. It belongs to the level. So having that Mastery Ghost gives us couple benefits, \n\n- It introduces the Ghost System even for the people who plays every level once, otherwise they wouldn't see the Ghost System. And as you saw there is an option to disable it.\n- Even if it's not the purpose of the Mastery Ghost, it can guide the player a little bit if player is fast enough. \n- It shows how fast it is possible to play the game.\n- It encourages the casual players to play the level again, to beat the ghost. If player enjoys it, they can keep racing leaderboard ghosts at their own skill level. So many people who aren't competitive at this kind of stuff loved racing against the ghost to improve their time.\n- It is a goal time to beat like A+ in Super Meat Boy.\n- Lets the player figure out new strats or paths to beat the ghost.\n\nI understand you about the graphics, sorry about it, student budget issues.\n\nAlso released a patch recently, fixed some of the issues. \n\nBy the way I am a terrible platformer player myself. I also suck at speedrunning but I got used to playing this game while making it for 3.5 years. Here is a full game speedrun by me, a noob speedrunner. You can see how many times I save from failed attempts, if you call them backup strats. \n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/231432401\n\nI'd love to see you give one more chance to Kayra!"}, "40079304": {"recommendationid": "40079304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090985142", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518716848}, "language": "english", "review": "i just hate myself, when i watch a replay who good at this game. anyway what a good game.", "timestamp_created": 1518652136, "timestamp_updated": 1518652136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498470", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40076460": {"recommendationid": "40076460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037057889", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519693695}, "language": "english", "review": "Sweet graphics, sweet gameplay i cant recommend this game enough.

People have to learn how to play your video game on a basic level before they can speedrun it, ya know. And that's basically the root issue I have with the game it seems to assume you already know how to play it fairly well from like minute 0 when that's obviously physically impossible. It's like someone made a game based around the misunderstanding that people speedrun video games almost immediately on touching them. Unless your name is authorblues, people don't actually do that. You need to actually /play/ them first.\n\nThe lack of any sort of visual indicator for the grappling hook makes it exceptionally hard to gauge where anything is going to go since you can only fire the thing at 45 degree angles (yeah I know right I thought it was mouse aim too), you go from 100 - 0 in a really weird unnatural way when you change directions and all of this just makes the game kind of annoying to get to grips with as you grapple (HAH) with its weird unnaturally stiff handling. \n\nVisual indicators for what is grappleable as well are also totally inconsistent, I never figured out any pattern behind whether or not a particular green or yellow wall would let me grab it. There's one level with blocks that have edges, the sides were grabbale, the underside was not. A later level had those same green walls, the side of which was not grabbable? I seriously never got it.\n\nThe level design was also just a series of uninspiring blocks and spikes in the 30 or so minutes I was able to stand playing it before I was genuinely too annoyed to continue. I didn't even enjoy playing it normally let alone trying to speedrun it.\n\nIt's also another one of those \"speedrunner dream games\" where the misunderstanding of what that actually means results in levels with a lot of long empty straightaway to accrue a high speed down. Satisfaction in the speedrun doesn't come from the simple act of a player object moving quickly, it comes from so much more than that.\n\nalso the dev sockpuppets on r/speedrun\n\nplease just play Super Hook Girl instead.

The mechanics and controls are just solid, with a feel of momentum and speed tuned to perfection that you don't see in other games.

To explain further in detail, i would be running through the map having perfect fps and suddenly i have one frame freeze or a \"stutter\". Now in most games that would not be an issue, but since this game focuses on getting the fastest time and beating the level as fast as possible, a single stutter can not only ruin the momentum, but also potentially ruin the run. It's one thing to die because i can't get a trick down or i'm just not nailing it, and its completely frustrating to end up dying or having to restart because of a problem i can't either predict or fix. I'm gonna assume the devs are gonna give a look see and possibly touch up, but until then i'm gonna hold of playing this for a while.", "timestamp_created": 1518307836, "timestamp_updated": 1518307836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500581", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1518311753, "developer_response": "I was also experiencing stutters myself as a developer but it's not about the game code I can assure.

As someone who is very amused by grappling hook mechanics, I've been very pleased with it.  The feel of the hook and movement are really solid, there's a huge sense of speed, and the mechanics are deceptively simple, where nothing isn't intuitive, but you'll learn lots of cool tricks to control your character over time.\n\nBeyond the solid core gameplay, there's was a lot of work put in to make sure the replayability is high.  First and foremost is replays.  Every single persons best time on a level has a replay saved that you can watch.  From my experience with dustforce, another game with this feature, it adds a ton to the competitive aspect of the game, building the community, and pushing you to move a little further.  I'm not someone who plays for speed, but I still think every game that has a focus on speed should have leaderboard replays, and it still adds a lot to the game even if I'm not trying to get top times.\n\nThen there's framerate independence (using interpolation), fully mappable controls, tons of various options like hook color customization or the option to turn on stuff like a hook indicator that perfectly predicts where your hook would land if you threw it.  Basically if there was anything the developer knew was wanted and wouldn't detract from the game was added, and it makes this one of the most technically solid games I can think of.\n\nWere this game 20 bucks, I'd reccomend picking it up, at 10, if you're even moderately interested, you absolutely should grab it.", "timestamp_created": 1518255866, "timestamp_updated": 1518255866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500581", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39972288": {"recommendationid": "39972288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144111271", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1520966792}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Her ne kadar zorlayac\u0131da olsa oyun sizi i\u00e7ine \u00e7ekiyor ve b\u0131rakam\u0131yorsunuz.

I'm really enjoying myself, the game does a good job at encouraging the player to improve their times. Aside from the obvious mastery rank, there is a system very similar to Dustforce (another great platformer) where your score is automatically submitted to  a leaderboard with a replay. It's very easy for the player to finish a level, watch a replay of a faster score, and incorporate the techniques they see into their own gameplay. I was able to pick up on techniques before the game introduced them to me in order to improve my times through this replay system. Additionally, as you play, the phantoms of people close to you on the leadboard will run along side you, giving you live feedback on how you stack up with your immediate competition. It's a very good system (though I did have to turn down the visibility on the phantom runners). \n\nAnd of course, the way the character moves and controls is very fluid and nice. The grappling hook is going to be your main source of speed, and levels turn into impressive displays of weaving through obstacles between hooks. There are more advanced techniques, of course, to mix things up a bit, but it seems like a system that has a lot of potential. Air control feels responsive and natural. \n\nThe only gripes I can think of are that the soundtrack gets stale really fast and that the visuals aren't particularly inspired or memorable\n\nUPDATE: \nI've completed the second world with all masteries and am three levels into the third. The mastery requirements are getting really challenging at this point; even landing the mastery time gets you into the top 10 for the particular level I am on. This is definitely getting very challenging, assuming you want to truly complete this game. I've also discovered that the checkpoint system becomes kind of useless in the later levels. This game heavily relies on keeping your momentum, and respawning stationary doesn't prepare you for what a normal run of the level would be like. Still enjoying it, though, I am determined to at least master this level\n\nFINAL UPDATE: \nI've completed the third world with all masteries. Levels are beginning to have a much more distinct identity from one another at this point, moving beyond basic momentum building and swinging. I do kind of wish the game prepared you more for some of the challenges in the third world, for example how water drifting works and working around walls without traction, but thankfully replays taught me everything I needed to know to progress.

Good job! The game recognizes generic XInput controllers like Logitech F310 Gamepad without an issue. \n\nThe gameplay is easy to learn but seriously hard to master.

This game makes it look easy. While not comparable, this is absolutely the hardest platformer i've ever played. So if you're a hardcore bad dude, this games for you. For me i'll probably never finish the tutorial. \n\nNow that my frustration with the difficulty is over let me talk about the game itself from..the little I could progress. Imagine if Ninja Rope from Worms Armageddon was turned into a full game, awesome right? This is 100% that game. I would honestly recommend this game to people who need Ninja Rope practice. This dev did black magic and replicated it perfectly into a ranked skill-based platformer. This has by far the best speedrunning presentation i've seen. Ghosts, scoreboards, timer at the bottom left, showing how much time you're losing, etc. You can also turn all that stuff off if it fills you with despair when you see that what took you 30 minutes it took someone else 4 seconds.\n\nSo, to say overall: This is Worms Armageddon's Ninja Rope turned into a speedrunning platformer. A speedrunner and practicing dream. I would absolutely recommend this game, I couldn't tell you the length because I can't leap past the beginning hurdles, but if you're looking for an itch of having to \"git gud\" at a videogame, here you go! If not, I would honestly not recommend this game at all. there's no inbetween or easy. So for people like me, we're gated out.\n\nEDIT: I was trash talked a lot for this review, saying that I was too casual. Yet as of this current edit i'm one of 7.1% of all the players who've purchased who have even completed World 2.

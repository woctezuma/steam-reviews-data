Und davon gibt es eine ganze Menge. Unsere erspielten Waffen verbessern sich w\u00e4hrend der Runde, je nachdem, wie oft wir sie einsetzen. Die F\u00e4higkeiten gehen von mehr Munition, mehr Schaden/Krits bis hin zu mehr Leben, bessere/mehr Drops usw. \nZu Beginn stehen uns eine begrenzte Anzahl an Respawns zur Verf\u00fcgung, die wir aber auch im sp\u00e4teren Verlauf des Spiels erh\u00f6hen k\u00f6nnen. Nach jeder Welle haben wir kurz die M\u00f6glichkeit, Munition oder Waffen zu kaufen, unseren Charakter zu verbessern und Airdrops einzusammeln. \nDa w\u00e4re auch schon der erste Kritikpunkt zum Spiel. Die Wellen starten nach kurzer Zeit automatisch. Vor Allem f\u00fcr Neueinsteiger bleibt zwischendurch kaum Zeit, sich in Ruhe auf die n\u00e4chste Welle vorzubereiten.\nDas Waffenhandling ist sicher Geschmackssache. Realismus ist eher Nebensache, man kann z.B. in jeder Hand ein Maschinengewehr halten. Das Zielen selbst funktioniert sehr gut, nach erfolgreichem Combo (z.B. Headshotfolge) gibt es eine Bullettime. Sieht ganz gut aus und macht auch zwischenzeitlich Spa\u00df.\nAu\u00dferdem gibt es mittlerweile einen Mehrspielermodus, um gemeinsam mit Freunden oder Fremden \u00fcber die Lobby auf Zombiejagd zu gehen.\nAls Fortbewegung dienen sowohl Teleportation als auch freie Bewegung, \u00e4hnlich wie bei Raw Data k\u00f6nnen wir uns durch die Level bewegen, um etwas Abstand zu den Horden zu gewinnen.\nDie Grafik ist durchaus ansehnlich und das Spiel macht einen insgesammt guten Eindruck.\nF\u00fcr kurzweilen Spa\u00df zwischendurch durchaus zu Empfehlen, wenn man kein Spiel mit besonderer Tiefe erwartet.\nEs gibt auch eine Demo zum Testen\n\nGru\u00df Ziffi\n\nZiffi\u00b4s Spieletipps als Kurator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/5837414/", "timestamp_created": 1516100422, "timestamp_updated": 1516103036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39242512": {"recommendationid": "39242512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048981562", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 95, "last_played": 1516402819}, "language": "english", "review": "Dam I Love This Game!!!

High replay value.\nZomDay offers a wide selection of guns and various skills to invest in to make different builds to use which makes every level feel different. By builds I mean this, pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper ad melee. It took me about 12 hours (give or take) to max out my level being 100. Upon leveling and beating missions and challenges on various difficulties you get skill points which you can re-spec at a small cost of special tokens called snake coins. Snake coins are used to unlock new skills as well as purchase special strong weapons in a mission (which you can refund at the end of the game). So Let's say you buy a gold 1911 pistol for 6coins, you can refund it for 3. The drop rate on the coins is vey reasonable, considering you need about 100 to unlock good skills.\nAt level 100 I have about 300skill points (another 50 if I could beat 2 of the missions that are super hard) \nIts c0ol to invest them all in to one weapon type to make yourself feel like a tactical zombie killing beast. Kill hordes of zombies with just 2 strong as hell pistols, sweet. Blow zombies away with a semi-automatic shotgun, yeah!\nThe reload system is very basic, fits well for the \"fast\"paced frantic running youll be doing when getting away from 30 zombies. Push a button, place controller next to chest, shoot some more.\n\nLet's lay down the pros and cons\n\nPro\n-Wide varitey of weapons\n-Great perk selection system\n-Zombie hitboxes are great\n-Teleportation and free movement system\n-Co-op\n-Charcater and weapon leveling\n-Almost no game breaking bugs (Im considering one where a sandworm boss spawned from the ground and made me fall through the level... I was tight at that but that's it)\n\nCons\n-Not many people playing co-op (When someone does join they have no idea how to do anything...PLAY THE TUTORIAL IT TEACHES YOU HOW TO RELOAD!)\n-Difficulty levels are... not the best. Easy through the hardest difficulty just adds more health to zombies and more damage to you. so Hard doesnt feel so...\"hard\". Really if you keep moving and shooting you'll never die. (Me saying this at level 100 so this is kinda invalid)\n-No way to change levels or difficulty in the hub area. Not a bad problem but if youre playing with somebody, gotta kick em out and hope they rejoin when you make a new game.\n-No voice chatting with co-op partner. Would love to teach people how to reload by talking to them, not by charading the motions to them.\n-Needs more content. More levels and challenges which I hope come around in the future. \n\nPlease keep this game updated! <3\n\nALL IN ALL 9/10!", "timestamp_created": 1512244621, "timestamp_updated": 1512244621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38001995": {"recommendationid": "38001995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041322182", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1515588975}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lo poco que he jugado me ha causado una grata impresi\u00f3n.

You can try out different weapons and there's a nice variety of zombies.  At the end of the waves there's a boss zombie.  It really isn't all that difficult as long as you don't drop weapons by accident.  That will happen given that the button to drop weapon is very easy to do by accident.  Good luck picking it up after that if you are playing seated (yes, you can play this game comfortable with only front sensors and seated, but if you drop  a weapon you can't really pick it up)\n\nI think this game is meant to be played co-op.  It's a nice game, but I don't think it's all that good.  There's really not that much variety and there's limited maps.  And there's lots of graphical glitches and pathing issues.

I think it would be totally fantastic to see a single player campaign mode but given the amount of work that would require i totally wouldnt expect it nore would i be disapointed.\n\nA great VR game if you have VR buy it! its on par with robo recall if not better especially if you prefer the zombie scene", "timestamp_created": 1504214915, "timestamp_updated": 1504214915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34624759": {"recommendationid": "34624759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166882273", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503622709}, "language": "english", "review": "There are TONS of Zombie games out there Funky Bunch, and there are lots of shooters as well, and while this starts out fairly slow paced for a round or two in the first level, it starts kicking it up quickly.

You may have to try the 360 degree experimental setup for the oculus sensors as this game currently has no way to rotate via the controllers so you physically have to turn around sometimes (minor gripe imo, hopefully devs will eventually add this feature). The Boss fights are also very challenging and the game as a whole is fast paced even on the easiest difficulty setting.

Controls are teleport only and the arena is two stories with multiple rooms and different layouts in each level. You need to survive several waves/rounds until a boss appears and in between there are randomly some mini-bosses. Careful aiming and not wasting ammo by spraying around is key to survival. Between each round you can buy additional ammo and weapons. After each round some boxes with ammo, money and exp are dropped but they have to be opened until the next round starts otherwise they disappear. So you need to focus on what to do between the rounds (I usually first buy necessary ammo and weapons and the collect the loot drops). Like in real life, the more you practice a certain weapon, the better you are with it (increased damage and capacity). The game tracks your level for each weapon. For me key to defeating the boss of level 2 was to get better at my favorite guns and to figure out the weak spot of the boss. These twists (the game rewards practicing, ammo/money/weapon managment is necessary and figuring out the weak spots of enemies) are what makes this game really great!

If you play co-op and someone joins mid-way through your game, you need to buy them weapons or theyll probably just die straight away. If you can share/coordinate its not a problem, but if one player just eats up all the ammo drops and cash then the other will be in a tough spot. I can't tell if there's VOIP, if not there should be. And it would be nice if you could bank cash between maps/games, seems you either use it during that map and its gone.

You have to fight multiple waves and a boss at the end. At the end of every wave you can purchase new ammo, guns or unlock skills. A lot of guns need a higher level to unlock so you need a bit of time to unlock them all.\n\nThe game has some great features like the possibility to hit zombies with the stock of your gun. Also melee weapons will do more damage the harder you hit the zombies with your motion controller!\nWhen you manage to get some consecutive critical hits the game will be in slow motion for a while which is really satisfying as there is a lot of blood and splatter. I also have to mention the loud and powerful gun sounds.\n\nZomDay looks quite good (for a VR game) and also runs really smooth with 1.5x supersampling on high end hardware even when there's a lot of blood and splatter on the screen.\n\nThe only things I can complain about is that there is only teleport movement at the moment which also makes it quite easy to beat bosses. Also you can't manually reload guns which I always loved in other VR games.\n\nAll in all ZomDay is a satisfying wave shooter with quite a good amount of progression and content for the price!\nI can recommend it to all HMD owners who like games like Killing Floor or COD Zombies.", "timestamp_created": 1503086506, "timestamp_updated": 1503132341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0,

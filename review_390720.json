The game is rewarding not only in enjoyment, and aesthetic, but does a great job of keeping the player engaged with in game rewards; like constantly finding new animals to join your riot party, or being given coins as rewards to unlock new, and special abilities for your crowd to perform. Not the least of which is causing the evil cops to fall in love with you, and join your side!\n\nThese coin rewards specifically are cleverly held in a soda machine that one of your cutesy little creatures will throw his hard earned money into, and then unlock different tiers of rewards via soda cans. I could honestly sit and watch my little elephant put coins in a soda machine for hours.\n\nThe game can be mildy repetitive but not really in a bad way. Every level I\u2019ve played so far has had a mix of the similar, and an added twist. This is especially fun when you don\u2019t realize the new enemy might have a pretty powerful new ability, and he wrecks your crowd. Learn from it, rinse and repeat!\n\nThe overall level design is done really well. Finding all of your rioteers within the level can sometimes be a challenge, depending on how you start, or where you go from the beginning. Not having enough, could prevent you from having a riot ability later on in the mission. This can cause you to lose out on even finishing the mission at all. Being mindful of the puzzle mechanic to each level is imperative, if you want to get the best rating. Every stage I have played is really distinct and while the same elements apply to each level I felt like they really did a bang up job of creating a unique experience in each mission.\n\nThe difficulty level of this game is actually surprising. It\u2019s not a hard game. But it\u2019s not necessarily easy either. And the trick is...it tricks you into thinking that. I felt like the last 3 missions of the second stage kind of skyrocketed in difficulty in order to set you up for the Boss fight. Its hard to imagine a game with tiny adorable little animals blowing shit up, to be difficult, but it works!\n\n\nWhile the initial theme behind the game may be somewhat heavy, and violent, (which I 100% support) I find that the use of a kawaii aesthetic with Electro-pop style music, takes the violent and dark theme, and turns it around into something bright, and even hopeful. The animals are so cute, and even the cops are kind of adorable, right before you pummel them to death. \n\nI think this game could benefit from some sort of multiplayer option. Be it cops v rioters, PVP, or even a really fun custom level builder in game that you can share with the online community or your friends. I could imagine my own map now and it would be so fun to build one.\n\nIn the future I would love if the Anarteam would put out new maps and new animals, possible multiplayer options, or even an entire new game with a new gameplay style. Who knows, what I know is I really love this game. It\u2019s earned a solid 8/10 in my book and I hope this developer gets more recognition for its intensely creative, and unique game\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBXZvy3_3Kw", "timestamp_created": 1515304425, "timestamp_updated": 1515304459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38764486": {"recommendationid": "38764486", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995630147", "num_games_owned": 631, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514434179}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute little animals destroying cities that are overrun by a corrupt police force.

critter rioters against the Brainwash Patrol, who have dominated the world and rule through broadcasting propoganda and I guess sleep-signals (hence the sleeping rioters, and the ones who are attached to the side of buildings).  The game has a cute aesthetic based on chibi models, simplified yet interactive backgrounds, and catchy + cute electronica soundtracks.  It involves massing up rioters to gain abilities (which can also be lost if you lose rioters at certain thresholds), some of which you need to traverse, but the game works well in that you can find other routes and means to get through the level with what is given.  New abilities range from improving speed or stomping, to bouncing and endless projectles, as well as ludicrous ones like enamoring cops with cuteness or grabbing buildings and throwing them on your enemies.  Though I see the most usage out of the molotovs one.\n\nWhile the game itself is short, that is only if you intend to breeze through it without engaging it's ranking system.  Getting S ranks in cities can earn you cosmetics, from kimonos to tuxedos.  Also getting more critters unlocks special gliterry eyed exclusive animals that can only be gained if you gather all the critters of the city they are tied to.  But it takes alot of practice to get those S ranks, especially with how the crowd controls.  A bit wonky, seems to follow an invisible actor of sorts that they use to rally around judging by how they may crowd and circle at some times.  They also seem to be averse to bunching up to walls, so you may have difficulty trying to grab props to throw if they are in corners.  That said, it's not all that hard to get used to and once you get the hang of it the means to avoid danger is much easier than it initially seems, good reflexes help with reactionary stuff like mines and shock towers.\n\nSince this game runs in Unity, it could use a level designer function so people can make levels, and with steam workshop functionality they could effectively give this game more life.  But I can understand if that is off the table considering it's been out for a year.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game and I recommend it.

It combines a very cute art style that is minimalistic but very effective, almost completely destroyable levels, and a fresh take on crowd-based combat.\n\n[h1][Gameplay][/h1]\nEach level starts with just a couple of people but you quickly build up an horde of charming rioters who are then used to fight the corrupt police. There are four different countries to liberate and each of them is divided in five to eight levels and one boss. \n\nUnlock skills as you grow in numbers and tear down even buildings or collect cars and everything else around you to throw it at the enemy! You collect coins from completing levels to unlock and swap skills outside of missions. Free new animal species and customize your army to your heart\u2019s desire and pick only the animals you are interested in. You can even change their costume if you get an S on every level of a country.\n\nThe game can be pretty challenging at times, but you get used to it real quick. Stealth levels for example feel a bit overwhelming at times since you barely have any rioters, but it's manageable after you get the hang of it. Skipping difficult sections is also an option, if you simply don't care about the cosmetic unlocks. The controls and the camera movement feel a bit wacky at times, but it's not too bad.\n\n[h1][Music][/h1]\nThe soundtrack is definitely one of the strongest, if not the strongest point of this game and it's fitting the theme of the game so well; they just nailed it. Each song is bound to make you smile and feel good, and it even makes you care for these little critters. Especially within the main menu, the music is so awesome that I stayed in there for far longer than I was supposed to.\n\n[url=https://anarcute.bandcamp.com/album/anarcute-soundtrack]Checkout the bandcamp page for a preview![/url]\n\n[h1][Conclusion][/h1]\nThe game\u2019s length is about 5-10 hours which might be too little for the price asked. I recommend getting it with a discount of under $10 which I feel is just the right price.\n\nRegardless of the price, I recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Pikmin, Katamari, or just wants to have a good time with a very passionate and cute little game.\n\n[code]\nEnjoyed this review?

Add adorable 3D graphics, a catchy electronic soundtrack, and a host of unlockable skills and animal types and you\u2019ve got Anarcute.[/h1]\n\nAnarcute is one of those games that slipped through the cracks. I have very little to say about it negatively beyond wishing that there was more stages, but I\u2019ll address that in a bit.\n\nThe premise of the game is as follows: the world is under the boot of a gas-masked dictator and his riot-geared police force and it's up to /you/ to rally your own forces--never mind that you\u2019re all cutesy, big-eyed critters of the land and sea -- and fight back!\n\nYou begin every map with a base group and to fill out your ranks you simply need to walk into other groups of protesters, which can be found on the map. Some will require you to liberate them from cages by smashing \u201cA\u201d or and others can only be accessed by traversing laser and/or minefields. You get a bonus to your rating at the end of a map based on how large your remaining group is, so it would behoove you to take extra care with your riotous cuties.\n\nYou also get a bonus for completing your objectives quickly and for beating up the fuzz (haha, get it?)\n\nThese objectives includes sabotaging enemy communications, surviving waves of enemies, rallying at predetermined points, and whatever else a good riot committee does nowadays. There are a total of four major cities you\u2019ll rampage through - Tokyo, Paris, Miami, and Reykjavik- and each has its own aesthetic theme and soundtrack. The soundtrack is really, really good. Did I mention that?\n\nThroughout your rampage from node to node on the map, you\u2019ll also see dialogue-less cutscenes during which your masked oppressors will behave nefariously. You\u2019ll also encounter boss fights--one per city--which consist of mechanical giants. Like any good boss, these have attack patterns and stages, during which they\u2019ll change up those patterns. Taking down an entity that big and hulking is satisfying.\n\nAfter you complete a node, you are graded for your performance and rewarded with a single token. These token can be used on the customization screen to buy powers from the vending machine. There are three tiers of powers, each of which require a certain mob size before you can use them in combat. These powers are a mixture of passive stat increases and special attacks, so find the right combination to suit your play style and sometimes the stage.\n\nThere is a bonus to completing each stage with the highest rank (S) so that adds a bit of replayability. There are also different animal types to discover, meaning you\u2019ll need to play stages perfectly or play them twice - once to discover hidden animals and once to get through as quickly as possible - in order to reach 100%\n\n.Pros.\n[list][*] A fun mashup of Rampage-esque destruction and Pikmin-esque mob management.\n[*] The variety of places to riot through each with their own musical and aesthetic theme.\n[*] Cutesy animals\u2026 on a warpath. What is there not to like?\n[*] Destruction is satisfying.\n[*] Levels are quick to playthrough allowing you to tailor the length of your gameplay sessions.\n[*] Different powers give you a bit of leeway in how you play.\n[*] Buy the soundtrack. Do yourself a favour\u2026[/list]\n\n.Cons.\n[list][*] The game is short. Depending on skill level, you can finish it in six hours. Replayability also hinges on skill level\n[*]The difficulty spikes at random. The Diamond Tour stage in Miami has frustrated me time and again. Everything else has been very manageable\n[*]Gameplay can get repetitive. The stealth stage(s) are a nice touch, but mostly you\u2019ll be destroying targets\n[*]The horrifying feeling you get \u00a0from seeing those cute little bodies littered on the ground because you weren\u2019t careful enough--you monster[/list]\n\n.Bottom Line.\n\nThe game is a blast. It offers a healthy dose of challenge and a fun and hectic atmosphere, though gameplay can become repetitive\n\nIf you're a lover of music and cute things, you'll want to check this out. If you're a completionist who likes to get perfect scores and collect all possible collectables, there's something for you as well. If you want to break things and challenge The Man, buckle up and get your riot on.\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs-up.

This is what you want from a game. There are a lot of games on Steam. A lot of them are alike one another. This is not like them. \n\nMaybe it's just 'cause this game feels like a good night out on the town with your adorable friends fighting the hostile overlords that operate from the shadows and fund what overtly commercialist dreck millennials sobbingly think passes for musical \"art\". Maybe this game hits too close to home. Or maybe it's because somebody out there actually knows how to design a game. \n\nThe characters are compelling and believable, and above all, sympathetic and complex. There's no painstaking \"trying way too hard\" gimmick you get from indie developers or big-name companies to appeal to post-pubescent children. The stylistic choices extend into the very heart of the gameplay's core concept, sending a clear divide between you and them, with no unbelievable 1vs1000 do-everything stubble-chinned antihero. \n\nThe sound's upbeat, bouncy, which on the surface doesn't reflect what you'd expect given the game's overall themes. That's because you rarely get a perspective of hope from this storyline which has undergone all too many tried-and-tired bad ending gamuts in previous media. The song may come off as repetitive, but it's inspiring and defining. \n\nIf there're any flaws, it's that it looks to be too short, like [i]a lot of games coming out these days, cough cough.[/i] You might get a little overwhelmed by all the chaos roaming the street when the marshmallow hits the fan, but this isn't really so much a flaw as what you should expect from mass rioting. \n\nThe controls are wonky. Oh, not with controllers. They're a peach then. Keyboard and mouse are a no-go. Rotating and moving need to be simultaneous which gets awkward with pressing letters. Controllers are your best bet, but there's a hitch. You're stuck with the monopolistic Microsoft Xbox controller everybody seems to fap over despite getting the placement of BAXY backwards and basically feeling like a New Age retro hippie's meditative glassware collection--and almost as heavy, too. Ordinarily you'd rely on x360ce to circumvent this, but somehow things don't go as they do automatically for just about every other game I've ever tried outside of Kero Blaster thus far. You'll get controller input, but then things get strange, which I certainly can't explain. Can you? If so, you'd be doing the human race a favor by sharing with the class. Basically the controls are mismapped--left joystick won't move, right joystick has the axis wrong, and the face buttons do whatever. And if you leave x360ce in the folder, you may lose the function of your trigger buttons when you cave in and use the Xbox controller you picked up at Gamestop because you had company over that one time in a blue moon's tenth anniversary. \n\nAnd you will cave in. This game is cheeky and precocious. This game is flavorful and artful. This game is a video game. I've played over two decades of video games, with days upon hours of NES, SNES, Playstation, DS and so forth games under my belt, from back when Final Fantasy was compelling to the golden age of Castlevania which ended with Order of Ecclesia, from Animal Crossing to Smash Bros. Whatcha got there, buddy, if Anarcute's in your library, is a genuine video game. \n\nYou've played angsty marines shooting each other in the head and your 2D fighters with ludicrous button combinations a septillion times before. You've played your tiresomely edgy fantasy RPGs with twelve different flavors of humans and an Argonian, and you've played these things to death. \n\nYou might not be able to handle Anarcute.", "timestamp_created": 1494974013, "timestamp_updated": 1494979633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445409", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31794656": {"recommendationid": "31794656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366151458", "num_games_owned": 549, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495198014}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u4e4b\u524d\u5728\u6211\u613f\u671b\u5355\u91cc\u8eba\u4e86\u5f88\u4e45\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\u6211\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u662f\uff0cAnarcute\u539f\u4ef7\u5165\u5e93\u4e00\u70b9\u90fd\u4e0d\u4e8f\uff01\n\u8bf4\u4e0b\u611f\u53d7\uff1a\n1\uff0c\u753b\u98ce\u840c\u7684\u98de\u8d77\uff0c\u5c31\u8fde\u53cd\u6d3e\u90fd\u840c\u840c\u7684\uff01\n2\uff0c\u624b\u67c4\u64cd\u4f5c\u723d\u5feb\u5341\u8db3\uff01\n3\uff0c\u6218\u6597\u770b\u4f3c\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u60f3\u62ff\u9ad8\u5206\u7f3a\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u6253\u7ec6\u7b97\uff01\n4\uff0c\u56fd\u9645\u60ef\u4f8b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u6587\u672c\u4e0d\u592a\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e2d\u6587\uff01\n\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\u5c31\u8fd9\u4e9b\uff0c\u770b\u4ec0\u4e48\u8bc4\u8bba\uff01\u8fd9\u4e48\u53ef\u7231\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u4e0d\u8d76\u5feb\u653e\u5230\u5e93\u91cc\uff1f\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1494969294, "timestamp_updated": 1494969294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511111", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31781800": {"recommendationid": "31781800", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993890344", "num_games_owned": 650, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494911595}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of the most fun I've had in this type of game. Anarcute is a cuddly little animal game where you go against the establishment and take back your cute world. It's basically a top down shooter/fighter kinda game but you control a whole horde of cute animals on their rampage across the world as they take down a load of cops and helicopters with a load of weird futuristic weapons. There is a very big variety of enemies I have to admit and that definitely keeps it fresh, ontop of that there's loads of different traps all over each level that you have to watch out for. Luckily to help with all that you can pick up a few different enemy weapons which make all the difference, as well as unlockable abilites which you can use as long as you have picked up enough animals in the level so the game really makes you try your best to keep everyone alive.\n\nThere are also a bunch of unique and cool bosses that all require different strategies in order to beat them, they are definitely a highlight of the game. The game is kinda short though, took me just over 7 hours to beat all the levels and unlock all the animals, would of probably taken 5 or 6 hours if I didn't bother with extra stuff but I thought why not. Best to get the game on sale if you really want it to be worth it, however if you're a person who likes 100%ing games you'll definitely get a few more hours out of it. There is a bit of trial and error in the game but once you've figured out how everything works its not too hard, some levels can be frustrating at times but never has the game caused me to ragequit and I think that's great, the difficulty of this game is perfect. \n\nThe graphics and overall look of the game is great and really fits with the world and the characters. It's quite cartoony and basic but not too basic, the game could have done with a few more super dark levels (there's only one or two that are almost completely dark aside from a few street lamps and neon signs) because they make the game look a bit more pretty to look at. The sounds are pretty good too, they never get old or annoying. The music is also quite good but I think there should be a few more songs in there, I mean it says there's 22 tracks in the soundtrack but unless all the songs are similar I swear I've heard a bunch of them quite a few times.\n\nOn the bad side however the keyboard and mouse controls aren't great, and sure in the game it does say its best played with a controller but I doubt it'd be much better, the main problem is the camera and controlling the animals overall, I've played top down shooters that do it better so I know whats right but it isn't too much of a problem I guess. Aside from that I can't think of any problems I have with it, I mean personally I think there should be more content but that's just me. \n\nOverall I'd give this game a solid 8/10, if cute animals and beating up cops is what you're into then definitely try this one out.", "timestamp_created": 1494913208, "timestamp_updated": 1494913469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31518933": {"recommendationid": "31518933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330589159", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "last_played": 1515896787}, "language": "english", "review": "not only is it adorable but it's a great game, and i can play as a snake", "timestamp_created": 1493791900, "timestamp_updated": 1511769669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31329684": {"recommendationid": "31329684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175692591", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492986695}, "language": "english", "review": "impossible to get past last paris level, unbalanced health and crappy mechanics", "timestamp_created": 1492986798, "timestamp_updated": 1492986798, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.322788", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31127044": {"recommendationid": "31127044", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998955625", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492036705}, "language": "english", "review": "A gift because I had seen a friend play this and talk about how good it was, had it on my wishlist for a while but..

When I think of riots, I do NOT picture the cutest fuzziest animals alive, but there is a shit load of rioting going on.\n\nWhat\u2019s it about?\nYou are cute and fuzzy animals that have had it with the government oppression and squishing your desire to spread love. You are so filled with furry rage that you take to the streets and beat the crap out of anyone who gets in your way, taking down every building you can find to combat the evil overlords and bring peace and love back to your world.\n\nYou have to navigate your rioters through maze-like levels of buildings to avoid guards, lasers and mines while rescuing your friends to make your group larger. The larger the group, the harder they are to navigate and control. Keeping them from harm is a near impossible task. You move through the level trying to keep as many of your furry friends alive while trying to complete your level objective.\n\nWhat did I think?\nOMG, I LOVE THIS GAME. I have fun even during the most difficult levels. This game stresses me out even less than Flat Kingdom does. You go through different countries, liberating areas and freeing locked-up comrades. You can buy bonuses and earn them. You gain different abilities depending on how many rioters you have in your group. You can get anything: from stomps that throw your enemies, to abilities to knock down buildings and even a roman shield formation to project everyone.\n\nThis game is full of adorable visuals, a great soundtrack, a terrifying story line and continued complexity. However, this game isn\u2019t for kids (in my honest opinion). There are snipers and your rioters will die if they take too much damage. I don\u2019t know how well they will react to seeing a bunny sniped in the streets (even if there is no blood). The mechanics of the game continue to impress me and the boss battles are interesting and well thought out. I am also impressed at the animals that you save/unlock throughout the game. They aren\u2019t just your typical animals. They have snails, jellyfish and unicorns alongside the cats, pugs and horses.\n\nDo I recommend it?\nThis game is by far one of my favorites. I love every aspect of it and I think it\u2019s a steal for $14.99, available on Steam. If you love great music, cute fuzzy characters, a really good laugh and supporting indie developers, then this game is surely for you.\n\nHowever, if words aren\u2019t enough, please take a look at all the fun I\u2019m having in my [url=https://youtu.be/4IQWSF4-bA4?list=PLFCVXYi4F0A0sE56aWoA5jlnqwRSz12yK] Let\u2019s Play here [/url]\n\nMore on www.RealWomenofGaming.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbXuGfbZbN4&list=PLFCVXYi4F0A0sE56aWoA5jlnqwRSz12yK&index=1", "timestamp_created": 1480454462, "timestamp_updated": 1484256967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28068791": {"recommendationid": "28068791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057854178", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469130574}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely cute animals destroying the Eiffel Tower.

Its a brand new day under Overlord Lordman; \"the one who made gas masks fashionable for everyday wear\"\nA lone Elephant tucks into his apartment, nodding to other elephants not unlike himself. He gestures to the window; to the world just beyond the thin plate of glass that separates himself and the six other elephants now also inside his home; from the opressed world. They locked his friends up in cages, discluding the tusked ones with him of course, and are all too pleased to beat up whomever for any reason. He looks at the six other tusks in the room. Behind their bright eyes burns a flame unlike any other. The hills echo with the sounds of reckoning. The time has come, for the Overlord, who was oddly fond of towers; to eat many kinds of dirt. They're planning and fears are about to come to a head right now, and right away. The small mob of fellow fellows hit the pavement, and start randomly picking up traffic cones, stalls, cars, and other such; and hop right to it.\n\nThis is an army management game where you wake your fellows so they can take in the smell of fire and salesmen. They are a motley crew, but they are all you need to lay claim to the life you once knew once again.\n\nControls run rather smoothly, but your mob is very floaty. You move forward slightly and your entire ball of adorable animals with scurry headlong into the nearby mine, or what have you. The graphics are good, ways to take on the rank and file police are fairly numerous while, at the same time, remaining pretty straight-forward. The game spells out exactly what you must do, and kinda leaves you to it to do it.\n\nLooks can be deciving, and your army is awful unless you're in a pack.\nTutorial is good and if you follow it, you cannot fail; and that's the problem. You can keep doing the same thing over and over.\n\nPick up thing; throw thing, stomp them back, pick up thing again unless its a car of course, repeat until they die.\n\nIts super super fun and adorable, but once you find something that works, there is not much stopping you from hardline doing that said thing until you win.\n\nThe game rewards exploration through getting new animals, but that's all they are. Decals for your mob. Yeah its neat to see the many colors beat back the police, but its never been something that I never quite tried to achieve.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1480301492, "timestamp_updated": 1480301492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27874534": {"recommendationid": "27874534", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961129721", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1516056546}, "language": "english", "review": "This game brought my dream of having a tiny croc/alligator and elephant team rioting through a city making friends along the way.

Somehow I feel that doesn't really do it justice though?\n\nIt's kinda like katamari damacy in that you collect more things (rioters) to be better at breaking stuff and get better powers, but you can lose rioters (your cute creatures in matching t-shirts) which reduces your powers too which makes it kinda like Pikmin, except your rioters dont' have any individual powers on their own that help you solve the puzzle that is the levels.\n\nAnd I say puzzle, and it's really not right either? I mean I suppose it SORT of is, in that you navigate a city, overcome obstacles with your abilities, beat the stuffing out of the Brainwash Patrol (the mask wearing brainwashed badguys), try to prevent losing rioters (not exactly easy really, in the frantic melees that can occur), and generally cause an adorable little ruckus all over town, breaking buildings, throwing cars, throwing switches, dodging snipers... or any combination of those things.... yes including throwing buildings at one point if you unlock and choose that particular power.\n\nYou can find cages filled with rioters that have been captured and usually these will be a new type of rioter that joins you as a result, and sometimes these are hidden. It's pretty easy to find htem though as they're marked on your minimap (and full map), but the puzzle is GETTING to them a lot of the time. The fun mostly comes in how quick it is to blitz through a level and just watch your adorable little malcontents bring down the comically dastardly oppressive dictatorship and liberate countries. Do well enough, and you unlock new outfits to clothe your pugnatious protesting proletariat with.\n\nSo that probably neatly describes the gameplay. I suppose you wanna know about the rest of the gubbings? Well here we gooooooooo.\n\nMusic: Absolutely amazing, addictive to listen to, charming, adorable, energetic, lots of fun to listen to and well worth the \u00a32 or regional equivalent to buy alongside the game. Perfectly fits the theme, and it's a joy to hear the main theme start up when you begin the game!\n\nControls: No complaints here! They function well, I've not had any issues, guiding your rioters around can be a little like herding cats, but for the most part they aren't suicidal or overly stupid, and you're usually only likely to lose them when, uh-oh, you gotta go toe to toe with the popo. Targetting your foes is pretty intuitive and whilst I can't seem to find a specific way to change target,  y ou never really need to. just point yourself in the vague direction and go for it. It's pretty intelligent enough to work out you wanna smack seven adorable shades of sweet mary mother of christ out of that gasmask wearing mook barrelling towards you with reckless abandon and their body camera turned off.\n\nVisuals: As the name of the game and the screenshots imply, it's simplistic, and adorable, and deliberately low poly, but it's also surprisingly well detailed. Windows in buildings aren't just painted on, and interiors for each floor do exist. Not highly detailed, but they are rendered and it really adds some extra depth to the visuals.

I'm not certain how long this game will keep you engaged, as there's no multiplayer option that I can see, but really, there doesn't need to be, and the asking price isn't gigantic.

In Anarcute you control a riot of animals throguh 4 cities: [spoiler]Tokyo, Paris, Miami and Reykjavik[/spoiler]. This is in a mission to overthrow the evil Brainwash Patrol. The game does ramp up in difficulty at a rather quick rate, which makes this a very challenging game, especially late game. The enemies you face have a good mix of stationary defences (Lasers, tesla towers, mines and gates) and troops (Which range from standard guards to walking lasers and men with wrecking balls).\n\nIn Anarcute, you must take your riot and complete objectives in the level which vary from protecting a cart to taking a flag, while so levels have unique objectives [spoiler]such as blowing up the Eiffel tower to stopping a music festival (which I presumed was to boost the morale of the Brainwash Patrol troops)[/spoiler]. Anarcute has a good variety of levels, with a few stealth levels, some standard ones and some with where you must fight waves of enemies. The game's features come in at regular intervals. A good feature of the game is the dispenser, which is a vending machine for power ups. These powers can only be accessed if you have the right amount of people. For example, you can't take down a building with 5 people, but with 30. You purchase power ups, you need to use coins. However, coins can only be collected by completing.\n\nEach city has either a choice of which level(s) to pick or an optional level. However, if you are making a choice, you can do both. This makes the game flow as if you can't do a stealth level, you can try a standard riot. The game also has a good, comedic story. The Brainwash Patrol are in each city, so you must liberate the cities they are in. The story is told in drawn cutscenes. These are mainly told in the form of the news. However, the game has no voice acting, giving you room for imagination. Comedic moments include [spoiler]Blowing up the Moon befriending a shark-fish hybrid to take you across the world's oceans[/spoiler].\n\nAnarcute is very good on the performance front in addition to the gameplay and story.

The mob can be moved around, and they automatically pick up objects that can be thrown at adversaries. In addition, nearby enemies can be melee attacked, pushed away, or ran past. Continual attacks lead to super dashes or stomps, while powers are unlocked by increasing the crowd size. Enemies are typically too numerous to attack in a straightforward manner; instead, special abilities must be utilized.

Un syst\u00e8me de lock permet des tirs ajust\u00e9s sur les ennemis, tandis que la vis\u00e9e \"libre\" (lancer un truc sur une mine pour la faire p\u00e9ter par exemple) est plus approximative... Mais tout \u00e7a fonctionne impeccablement.\n-Malgr\u00e9 son th\u00e8me \"r\u00e9volutionnaire\", le jeu parvient \u00e0 ne jamais sombrer dans le glauque, le violent, ou la propagande politique malvenue. On ne parle pas de \"mort\", mais de \"K.O\". Je ne crois pas avoir vu de sang, les sbires du dictateur sont tellement parodiques et rigolos qu'on peut difficilement faire le moindre rapprochement s\u00e9rieux avec quoi que ce soit de \"r\u00e9el\"...\nBref, jouer ces petits agitateurs aux attitudes charmantes ne donne jamais l'impression d'incarner une sale crevure de casseur, m\u00eame si techniquement, c'est bel et bien ce qu'ils font \u00e0 longueur de temps. Ici, tout semble \u00eatre \u00e0 un \u00e9ni\u00e8me degr\u00e9 enfantin, dans un univers \u00e0 l'esth\u00e9tique aussi color\u00e9e qu'attachante, et heureusement tr\u00e8s engonc\u00e9 dans une sympathique innocence.\n-Les animaux sont (naturellement) mignons, et c'est un plaisir de s'\u00e9merveiller avec niaiserie chaque fois qu'on d\u00e9bloque le moindre renardeau (ou n'importe quel attendrissant b\u00e9b\u00e9 bestiole qui fait pousser un \"RHOOOO\u00d4\u00d4\u00d4\u00d4\u00d4OOOO\" un peu honteux)!\n-Pour 15\u20ac et m\u00eame moins sur les sites de cl\u00e9s, le jeu propose environ 4 mondes compos\u00e9s chacun de 8 niveaux avec un boss de fin assez retors. Il m'a personnellement fallu un peu plus de 11h pour le terminer en d\u00e9livrant tous les animaux - et pour ceux qui seraient int\u00e9ress\u00e9s de finir tous les niveaux en rang \"S\", \u00e7a prendra beaucoup plus de temps je pense...\n-J'ajoute que les textes sont dans un fran\u00e7ais aussi irr\u00e9prochable que le reste.\nComme tout \u00e7a me semble parfaitement honn\u00eate, et m\u00eame empreint d'un talent certain, je cautionne enti\u00e8rement cette mignonette r\u00e9volution animali\u00e8re.\nN'h\u00e9sitez plus, foncez.\n\n[i](Edit: apr\u00e8s avoir boucl\u00e9 le jeu, j'ai fini par d\u00e9gotter un souci assez p\u00e9nible, mais apparemment, tr\u00e8s peu de gens rencontrent ce probl\u00e8me : un des niveaux - \"manga bay\" - fait syst\u00e9matiquement (chez moi je pr\u00e9cise) planter les drivers de ma carte graphique Nvidia en quelques minutes. J'ai fini par terminer cette map avec les drivers en vrac & les glitchs d'affichage en mode kal\u00e9idoskopique. Heureusement, les niveaux suivants s'affichent normalement. Bizarre. J'ai \u00e9galement eu \u00e0 d\u00e9plorer 2 ou 3 \"fen\u00e9trages\" irr\u00e9cup\u00e9rables qui m'ont oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 relancer le jeu (sans doute encore li\u00e9 \u00e0 un souci de driver graphique). Bien que ce ne soit pas \"catastrophique\", c'est quand m\u00eame un peu dommage et g\u00eanant, et j'esp\u00e8re que \u00e7a sera patch\u00e9 assez vite.)[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1470071629, "timestamp_updated": 1470328907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657629", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24636680": {"recommendationid": "24636680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062412238", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471711102}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo bem divertido e engra\u00e7ado.

Keymailer, y no ha sido hasta ahora que he podido probarlo algo m\u00e1s a fondo.\n\nTengo que decir, que el juego al principio me hac\u00eda bastante gracia pero no esperaba demasiado m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de unos gr\u00e1ficos bastante monos y un poco de destrucci\u00f3n, sin embargo el juego me ha llevado a todo lo contrario, me ha acabado pareciendo una maravilla.\n\n[h1]Historia[/h1]\n\nEl juego tiene un prop\u00f3sito bastante simple. Unas grandes multinacionales se han hecho con el control de varias ciudades importantes y est\u00e1n lav\u00e1ndole el cerebro a la gente para que compren sus productos. El jugador tiene que hacer frente a estas multinacionales a base de protestas, ya sea por las buenas o por las malas hasta acabar echando a estos grupos de las ciudades.\n\nUn pretexto simple que a la vez hace una cr\u00edtica social bastante interesante, pues pese a estar todo camuflado con maravillosos animales y unos \u201ctipos malos\u201d, el trasfondo es bastante interesante.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nLlegamos al n\u00facleo del juego, del cual quiero hablar un poco m\u00e1s. Anarcute se centra bastante en la experiencia jugable, la cual est\u00e1 en constante evoluci\u00f3n nivel tras nivel.\n\nLo primero de todo es que el juego se introducir\u00e1 con un breve tutorial que nos explicar\u00e1 lo b\u00e1sico y necesario para ejecutar nuestras protestas. Principalmente tendremos que juntarnos con los dem\u00e1s protestantes de la zona y hacer una pi\u00f1a para poder avanzar, ya sea \u201cpac\u00edficamente\u201d en ocasiones, o arrasando con todo a nuestro paso.\n\nLos enemigos ser\u00e1n los soldados de estas multinacionales, los cuales podremos derribar a base de tortas, o bien recogiendo los objetos que hay por el nivel. Nuestro equipo de protesta se har\u00e1 con vallas, puestos de perritos, sombrillas, cubos e incluso coches para cumplir con el objetivo. Seg\u00fan vayamos avanzando en el juego desbloquearemos nuevos animales y lo m\u00e1s curioso, habilidades.\n\nS\u00ed s\u00ed, nuestro grupo de protesta tendr\u00e1 habilidades y no solo eso, sino que adem\u00e1s iremos mejor\u00e1ndolas con unas bebidas especiales que adquiriremos por completar los niveles, haciendo de nuestro grupo lo m\u00e1s especial para la revoluci\u00f3n.\n\nEn lo que respecta a la duraci\u00f3n y las fases, el dise\u00f1o de cada una est\u00e1 bien cuidado, adem\u00e1s de estar todo el juego divido en 4 ciudades diferentes con varias fases cada una, una duraci\u00f3n aproximada de 4-5h, aunque si vas con calma y quieres desbloquearlo absolutamente todo nos puede llevar unas cuantas m\u00e1s, por lo que en cuanto a duraci\u00f3n est\u00e1 bastante bien.\n\nHablando en t\u00e9rminos generales, tenemos un juego que no para de evolucionar en lo que respecta al gameplay, siempre vamos a tener algo nuevo, ya sean habilidades o enemigos, que nos va a mantener enganchados durante un buen tiempo.\n\n[h1]Aspecto gr\u00e1fico, sonoro y t\u00e9cnico.[/h1]\n\nOtro de los aspectos m\u00e1s interesantes del juego es el apartado gr\u00e1fico,  que es un poco estilo low-poly pero con texturas bastante \u201csimples\u201d que en conjunto hacen el aspecto tan mono por el que destaca el juego.\n\nEn lo sonoro, tiene un punto bueno y un punto malo. El punto bueno es que la banda sonora es bastante entretenida y en ocasiones cambia bastante dependiendo de la situaci\u00f3n, sin embargo se repite mucho la misma pista en el cap\u00edtulo entero, cosa que puede llegar a cansar un poco.\n\nRespecto a lo t\u00e9cnico, estamos hablando de un juego hecho en Unity, ese \u201cmaravilloso\u201d motor que tanto est\u00e1 ayudando a los desarrolladores. Si bien es cierto, que el rendimiento del juego es bueno y no me he topado con ning\u00fan bug importante, excepto un nivel en el que no sal\u00edan los enemigos, s\u00ed que he encontrado ciertas \u201cincompatibilidades\u201d con programas de terceros como OBS, donde activar el SSAO puede hacer bajar el rendimiento much\u00edsimo. Quitando eso, el juego por suerte parece que le han dado algunos mimos para que funcione como dios manda.\n\n[h1]Conclusiones[/h1]\n\nEstamos hablando de un t\u00edtulo que se sale de lo com\u00fan y que es perfecto para desconectar. Si lo jugamos con alguien cerca, es todav\u00eda m\u00e1s gracioso, ya que todo cuanto veamos nos provocar\u00e1 bastante diversi\u00f3n. Sin duda, es un juego por el que s\u00ed merece la pena pagar, ya que seguramente lo disfrutar\u00e1s.\n\n\n\n[b]NOTA: 8/10[/b]\n\nPod\u00e9is leer m\u00e1s analisis en mi web:

Having said that, I think that a longer game would also warrant new abilities, new upgrades, new enemies, and new traps to encounter. \n\nOne thing I definitely think that needs to be addressed are some tighter controls for keyboard users. A controller definitely allows for more smooth camera rotation, and the keyboard rotation can be a bit janky at times, especially when you need that quick rotation to see where the enemies and traps are. For those of us who can only use keyboard (Like me) it makes the game harder, but not in a good way.", "timestamp_created": 1468773753, "timestamp_updated": 1468774086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24373823": {"recommendationid": "24373823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065494962", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468767573}, "language": "english", "review": "I have to say this is actually a suprisingly good game.

It frees the native from his inferiority complex and from his despair and inaction; it makes him fearless and restores his self-respect.

From thence comes that type of aggressive reticence with regard to the machinery of protocol which young governments quickly show. When the people have taken violent part in the national liberation they will allow no one to set themselves up as \"liberators.\" They show themselves to be jealous of the results of their action and take good care not to place their future, their destiny, or the fate of their country in the hands of a living god. Yesterday they were completely irresponsible; today they mean to understand everything and make all decisions. Illuminated by violence, the consciousness of the people rebels against any pacification. From now on the demagogues, the opportunists, and the magicians have a difficult task.

You want to take down the man who has suppressed these cute little animals. The evil must be stopped and we must riot with these adorable animals all the while listening to cute tunes!\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n\nAs the name suggest the game features highly cute animals with a very cute art-style. The game looks very nice, not the best graphics in the world but it\u2019s not meant to have those realistic sort of graphics anyways. The game looks like it\u2019s made by Nintendo as it features those Nintendo Wii/Gamecube type art-style. The game ran over 100 FPS for me the almost all the time I played. I noticed some dips in FPS, though very rarely. The graphics menu has some customizations like resolution, SSAO, vsync, shadows quality, etc. \n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\n\nJust like the art-style the music is so cheery that It made my day just listening to the tune. Super cute and awesome music. I can listen to those tracks all day long. The audio effects and music have separate adjustable levels.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nYou\u2019re a bunch of cute animal rioters. You start off with a short group of 1-4 animals and throughout the map other rioters are sleeping (I think symbolism?). You just walk next to them and they\u2019ll join your party. Some rioters are trapped in cages and you must break these to have these rioters join you. If you get 10 or more rioters, you get the stomp ability which you can use to push some barriers. These can also be used to knockback enemies. Your animals can attack enemies, throw objects at them, even throw cars at them. Rioters can also knock down buildings once the number of rioters reaches high. You have a level bar indicating how many rioters you have and at certain points on that bar new powers get unlocked. The bigger the rioter crowd, the more powerful you\u2019ll be. You can kill enemies by clicking on them or by throwing cars and other things at them. Stomping also does damage and knocks them back.\n\nYou start off in Tokyo and there\u2019s a bunch of levels in it. Then there are 3 other cities like Paris, Miami etc. where you go to cause riots. Naturally, as you progress the missions get harder and harder. Missions include stuff like capture the flags throughout the map or take down certain brainwashing building (reference to media buildings I think), take down statues and structures etc. There are lasers, mines, snipers and many other traps. You must avoid these or you\u2019ll start losing rioters. Once all rioters are dead, it\u2019s game over.\n\nYou get coins when you complete levels and you can use these to get upgrades from the dispenser machine. Upgrades include stuff like walking faster, ability to double dash without having a cool down in between etc. You also unlock new animals when you free rioters from cages.\n\nEach countries\u2019 end stage features a boss battle where you have to beat it. These bosses have patterns and you must try to find their weakness and kill them. Once you beat the boss the evil capitalist dictator moves to the next country and that country gets unlocked to play in. All the countries have their own respective theme.\n\nA short gameplay video can be found below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=724733601\n\n[b][u]Graphics:8/10[/u][/b]\n[b][u]Sound:10/10[/u][/b]\n[b][u]Gameplay:8/10[/u][/b]\n[b][u]Overall:8/10[/u][/b]\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nYou want to wreak havoc with cute animals in large groups?

It puts my mind in a weird place. Somewhere between quirky Japanese titles like Katamari Damacy, and extremely well-polished shareware games of the '90s. I absolutely adore it. The controls are honed to perfection (especially the auto-aim mode, which I wish was the default for keyboard & mouse), the gameplay is genuinely fun and unencumbered, and it's just all very silly.\n\nIt's also very typically French, which is beautiful. It has that... air about it. It's like how Britain is obsessed with monolithic super-governments, nanny states that think for you and control people. That's come up in so many of our shows and games, from Blake's 7 to the upcoming We Happy Few.\n\nAnarcute is like that but more relevant to French culture and the concept of Anarchism and the revolution. So there's definitely something intelligent there behind all the colourful characters and the friendly, cartoony visuals.\n\nI don't know. It's hard to explain. It feels fun to play. Not fun in a 'mobile game' sense (I'm not a fan of mobile game design), but fun in a sense that video games were in the '90s and early '00s. It's like a love-letter to that era but with more modern considerations regarding the gameplay. Only slightly more modern, though, really. The UI is really bright and vibrant, and getting an S rank on everything is actually really difficult!\n\nBut there's something more modern about it that really makes it sit well in ways that sometimes playing games from the '90s doesn't always. It's a perfect fusion. And it's something that I really wish I'd see pop up more often. If Ori & the Blind Forest is a pure Castlevania but modernised to just the right amount.

The gameplay is simple yet has a keen eye for depth and just the right amount of difficulty. The aim is to roam around the world you are in, freeing captured companions who will join you in the game\u2019s main aim, to cause anarchy and riots. It took me a while to get the pun in the title, but its Anarchy, and cute combined, because have you seen these animals?! Cute as a button!!  Back to the gameplay; the rioters which join your party will raise your threat level, allowing you to use your special abilities. The more rioters you have in your party the more threatening your group is. I particularly like the ability to knock down buildings to save potentially captured companions which are precariously stuck on the side of it! The missions that you carry out take place in various different countries around the world, but the idea is still the same regardless.  The combat is simple; you just hover your mouse around the general area of an enemy and your rioters will wreck them (or not?) depending on how much you outnumber them. \n\nWhilst Anarcute may not look the most graphically impressive style game, but it just screams character. It looks just like a game from Nintendo and I love it! The cute animal companions you find scattered around the world are so cute. All of the character models are nicely designed as well as some nice smooth animations across the board. The soundtrack is completely on point as well, with some top of the range sound effects too. \n\nThe difficulty does increase as you would expect as you progress further into the game; but you can negate a little bit of this buy purchasing upgrades for your squad of rioters which will assist you such as being able to run on infinite amount of ammo and projectiles bouncing between enemies more often. Some levels will also require retrying multiple times in order to find the best route throughout it without losing half your squad to silly mistakes. \n\nThe game won\u2019t take a huge amount of time to complete, there are 4 or 5 countries to fight in, and each country has about 10 levels in each, and these levels will have different objectives which can range from capturing flags, or playing a mission completely solo and having to avoid enemies line of sights. This game however screams for a co-op/multiplayer mode, it would just add a whole new level of content and replayability, hopefully the developers will find time to add it in a future patch. \n\nI was a little disappointed to find that even though the game suggests at the start, that you use a controller, but I couldn\u2019t get mine to work, this was with two separate xbox controllers, whilst the game is playable with mouse and keyboard, I can\u2019t help but wonder how much easier the experience would have been if I got to use the prefered controller option. \n\nOverall Anarcute is a hugely fun game to play, it was more fun than what I expected and I was expecting a lot just from the screenshots and info which was available. The cute character models and soundtrack are awesome, and fit perfectly well into the game\u2019s addictive gameplay. \n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n[b][u]5) Highly recommended[/u][/b]\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

With a nice soundtrack and some great initial gameplay, you'll run around causing havoc with a goofy smile on your face. But then the game gets into a groove that turns into its main problem overall. When the game does change the pace, it does it rather well, with stealth sections or bomb escorts that force you to play a little differently. But it doesn't do it often enough, as you are forced in yet in what seems yet another level that you feel like you've played before. And while it can punish you for being reckless, the game's difficulty is really where the game doesn't deliver for veterans of the action strategy genre. For those looking for their first experience in the genre or looking for a game for kids, Anarcute does a great job as an introductory game in the genre. It just doesn't have the mechanics to keep you interested if you've played games like it in the past, and the KISS principle only goes so far. For me, it's a target sale title, as it has a relaxing feel to it. Well, as relaxing as anarchy can be.\n\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QDLBJcKm3A\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The artwork is lovely. The use of color not only is appealing, but it's able to do it for the most part without interfering with gameplay whatsoever. Child-like, but with a draw for all ages.\n[*] The cutscenes do a great job of presenting story without having to say a word. Love the presentation here, it's just fun to watch.\n[*] Has that goofy fun factor that brings a smile to the face. It's always fun to just swarm an enemy and take them down. \n[*] Teaching mechanics early in levels work rather well in problem solving. This is done specifically by forcing the player to choose the best path to get as many rioters as possible while facing minimal resistance. \n[*] The game is ridiculous in the right ways, creating that feeling of \u201cwait, what?\u201d while still working within the world created here. \n[*] Game does punish recklessness in terms of charging in without any sort of restraint. Forces you to pay attention to its environment. \n[*] The crab boss battle. One of best challenges in the game and a bunch of fun....as soon as you figure out how it works. \n[*] Music is upbeat and does the job. Catchy. \n[*] When the game does do a change of pace, like asking you to do a stealth section, it works rather well in offering a new challenge (but see the negatives for the counter to that!)\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Too easy. While the game does have some more difficult sections, when getting enough rioters, things become way too easy. Granted, there is a score chasing mechanic, but it just doesn't do enough to overshadow the feeling that you're breezing through the game.\n[*] There's hiccups in the performance here. You'll notice it every so often, with 5-10 fps drops. Even when recording I saw it, and the big issue in my mind here is that there's seemingly no easily identifiable cause for it. It just seems random. \n[*] The games variety will need a shot in the arm at certain points. There is variety in enemies and levels in the game, but the rate of implementation is where the big problem here is, as there are sections that you are desperately needing something new to mix things up. It's about the overall pace here.\n[*] The game doesn't do a good job of teaching some of its mechanics, and forces you to figure it out without giving you a good set of clues in order to do it.\n[*] If you plan on playing with a keyboard and mouse: don't. The controls \u201cwork\u201d, but compared to the controller, it's inferior. Camera controls in particular are the issue here. It just works so much better with a control stick. \n[*] Something the sound design just is off here. There's sound in appropriate places, but I can't help but be underwhelmed by what's implemented. Turning off the sound didn't have an effect AT ALL in combat, which usually indicates to me that it doesn't do a good job of complementing/helping the player. \n[*] Bosses in general are underwhelming. They rely on specific mechanics that just don't fit here.\n[*] I never saw the use of the super dodge. Your main dodge is too useful, and given the compact spaces for battle most of the time, super dodge just doesn't really serve a purpose.\n[*] If you're looking for the reason why you're rioting, you're in the wrong place. Game doesn't really do a good job of telling you what caused the riots in question.\n[*] Certain mechanics in the level design end up clashing with each other. In particular with very tight corridors, as not know which of your entourage is actually going to throw an item can make lining up a shot very difficult. \n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1468508448, "timestamp_updated": 1468508448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540456", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24314533": {"recommendationid": "24314533", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983496069", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494648766}, "language": "english", "review": "What an adorable game!

I may be biased because I adore the concept of small cute animals running around, wreaking havoc around them, but I really just honestly enjoy playing it.  The only complaint I have with it are the sometimes finnicky controls and feel of the crowd once it grows huge, and especially when you're trying to perfect stages.  I think it may be on part of my rustiness as well, for as I keep playing I'm managing to predict how situations will work out.  I managed to achieve victory of the main game through incompetence fairly easily within five hours, but stopped before the post game to go back and begin getting S rank in all the earlier levels, and the jump from just kinda haphazardly blowing the level's face off to actually putting the effort into completing the levels with any sort of respectable score is definitely a significant one.

They gave me the key yesterday and I decided to play it as soon as I could and I wasn't disappointed. I know from the email response I got back that these indie devs do not want to sell a broken or incomplete game, unlike many other devs do these days. I've finished the Tokyo levels already and as far as I've come this game feels like it's one of the best cute games of 2016 so far, the other one that I know of and have played being Paws: A Shelter 2 game.\n\nIt's very rare to find a gem like this and as a Youtuber these games make my life a lot easier. Every day I have to go through numerous websites and mile long lists to find games that wish they were like this one. I get keys for many games and I usually do enjoy all of them but it might also be the anticipation that's making me so crazy about this particular game. I love when devs pay attention to the emails that Youtubers send to them, this means that even their social/advertizing department is excellent.\n\nNow for the game. The style is adorable, there are many characters that you can (and will want to) unlock. The artwork, buildings, layout and boss fights are amazing. I had a lot of fun playing this game and I'm [b]really[/b] looking forward to playing again.\n\nPlus, trading cards and achievements. This game is the whole package for a reasonable price.

I am not a fan of dwarves (sorry, I am an elf at heart) and I adore pixel art games thanks to growing up with games such as Monkey Island. Despite my bias on dwarves I found this game to be (in it's current Early Access state) quite enjoyable in it's raw function and form. That is to say the premise of the game has promise.\n\nThe controls are a little akward in their default stage, but can be altered to fit your personal comfort. The User Interface is refined in some areas and lacking in others. (White on light colors can be hard to read.) The game play itself is fairly simple and strait forward. Even so it leaves room for a sense of self in terms of what you build/upgrade and when. There is no linear path (that I could tell) that you are forced to travel and you are free to explore at your own pace.\n\nIt turned out to be a fairly relaxing game.

The enemy have a tendency to zerg you and if you kite then you kill 90%. \n- Some decisions, let me explain: There's a tavern, you can play a \"game in this place... it's a completely time waster mouse clicking game, why is it a con? because you actually upgadre important stuff in your camp if you play it so get ready to spend a lot of time clicking (or download a fast clicker)\n- tutorial and some keybinds. This one is minor, the game is not that complicated and you can rebind your controls.\n\nPro\n- Great idea, there is exploration and sense of discovery\n\n- Upgrading your character and camp feels very satisfying\n\n- Combat (i know, pro and con at the same time), reflect a fireball was just epic! the stealth mechanic is not half bad.\n\n- Not only a great concept the execution is going very well.

New content usually arrives at a weekly pace, including new locations to explore, additional enemies to slay and interesting items to slay with / help with the slaying.

Combat requires a little bit of strategy, which is great, and the game is extremely difficult early on but it pays off. I enjoyed the town building and resource gathering elements, however it becomes clear pretty quickly which resources you end up using the most and some times those can be hard to get a hold of, especially in the case of the food resource which is scarce and gets used up quickly trying to uncover parts of the map. it is a little frustrating to use the food resource to uncover new levels only to find the levels hadn't been added into the game yet, although since it's under development I'm mostly grumpy about having to wait. Overall I'd say the game is a lot of fun and easy to get sucked into, but resource management needs a bit of work and difficulty levels fluctuate very heavily between levels, some are much too easy and some take multiple retries.

The further the town the more it costs (kind of obvious). Once you unlock that part of the map it is free to travel to the nodes at any time.

So far i've only played a melee character where i am using a shield and a melee weapon. Cutting down enemies left and center. Though the games difficulty increases dramatically as the more damage you take the less you can sustain. If you take no major injury (text on screen) it means you can regenerate your health to perfect health.\nMeaning Magic attacks even though brutal damage it doesn't cause permanent damage.\n\nBosses are just named enemies with a higher health pool, hits harder and has a few unique tactics.\n\nAs for building up your town. After you explore for abit you'll see dwarves trapped in cages (Only release them after you've dispatched all the enemies) these can be used to automatically gather resources from completed zones. Each dwarf is 1 resource per 5 seconds. Until that resource pool has been used up. \n\nNot going to say more about the game as I'd like you to experience the game yourself.

The game is a well balanced mix of exploration, rpg, strategy, citybuilding and crafting. This game however doesn't fall into the trap of oversimplifying combat - which while seeming deceptively simple actually has a fair amount strategy and complexities below the simplistic surface and  well demand more of you than you would imagine from a game of this type - but don't be fooled on higher difficulties it has enough challenge to make you rage. It is a ton of fun to build/improve your colony through adventures, rescues and crafting and while many of the features are still being implemented/completed  its easy to see where the game is going and I suspect i'll end up doing  a lot of complete playthroughs - this is the kind of game you can enjoy over and over.

The game is not finished.  There are many places you cannot go and get a message that the area isn't in yet.  Items and abilities have numbers attached to them, but none of those numbers have actually been balanced yet.\n\nThat being said, core mechanics are in place and feel well thought out.  Given only the broad outlines of a goal to gather dwarves together to stand against the goblin king, it feels fun to explore locations to see what I'll find.  As you explore locations, you rescue dwarves that will help you gather resources to grow your town.  The little mini quests in areas I explore are varied enough that exploration is its own reward; I don't feel like I'm just clearing identical areas in some sort of resource grind.\n\nWhat makes the casual exploration gameplay really work is the art syle.  How you feel about this game is going to depend largely on how you feel about pixel art.  Personally, I am amazed how expressive the low pixel count characters are.  It takes a particular talent to create features by altering the color of individual pixels.

development\n\nI know I'm being rough on the game but my opinion still stands. The dev(s) are doing great work on progressing the game with the help of an active community and have progreesed the game by a fair margin since last time I've played yet its still quite tedious to play. Pleese keep in mind that I've only played as a dedicated swift melee build.\n\nThe combat has been made more diverse yet its still the same projectile spam its previusly been which just makes it annoying rather than difficult. Oh and the melee figheters love to just line up and let you kill them orderly and systematically.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6th Oct 2017 Reveiw\n\nThe combat is more bothersome than entertaining with next to no variation, at first youll have difficulities killing even the basic grunts, and basically have to really on trowing axes and kiteing. Then once youve visited one of the story areas (just gather apples and you can go there instantly, though I wont spesify where) you'll be a one-hit wonder, and nothing stands a chance. \n\nThe exploration is also annoying, you have to gather obscene abount of food just to progress the game and mercy be upon you if accidentaly unlock and area youve already discoverd...\n\nFor combat all you need is sheildbreak and you're unnstopable, just spend all your skills in the first tree and you're done.", "timestamp_created": 1507318938, "timestamp_updated": 1510768937, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480819", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35525158": {"recommendationid": "35525158", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986270756", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513389922}, "language": "english", "review": "Dwarfs, Goblins, Axes..AWESOME SOUNDTRACK..\nI build a Tavern and killed some Gobs near my Town..just Dwarf Life.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1507315552, "timestamp_updated": 1507315552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35516237": {"recommendationid": "35516237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124759191", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508406442}, "language": "english", "review": "\nMy opinions are based on the current state of this game. \npros:\n-I really like the scope of the game so far. It contains rpg, base building, and fighting elements. I hope all of these will be fine tuned and expanded upon in the future.\n-The creators clearly care about the lore of the land, even if it is your run of the mill fantasy so far. I like the dwarf theme.\n-The art stile is solid, and the animations are smooth. \n-I haven't met with any big, game breaking bugs so far\n-I think it already has ton of content that makes it whort buying even at this state\ncons:\n-It is early acces, so a lot of things are missing. For me the music quickly became repetitive.\n-Goblins find it hard to climb laders unfortunatelly. \n-The beggining is hard and somewhat slow ,until you can impove your stats somewhat, and you can become quickly overpowered.

In the future I will probably change my review.\nI have extremely high hopes for this game! It's fun and quick, but not without fault. I'll split this into positives and negatives.\n\nPros:\n+ Extremely easy to pick up\n+ Pretty neat aesthetic\n+ Most if not all of the promised features in the game already work (I feel like this is important to note with Early Access titles in 2017)\n+ Devs are definitely devoted\n+ Love the health system. There's something great there! It's not a simple health bar, but instead an immersive and in-depth overview of how screwed you are. Not enough RPGs take that into consideration!\n+ Every dwarf has personality!\n\nCons:\n- Changing controls doesn't seem to work. I've tried three times to change my controls and have been unable to.\n- The attacking/counterattacking system doesn't feel very satisfying, as combat usually is 1v3-1v6, not allowing for any sort of attack other than spam left clicks and kite. Throwing is extremely useful in this regard, though.\n- The sound is all over the place from quiet to explosively loud\n- Compared to Kingdom too much, the game is way different than Kingdom. I totally see where the comparison is from the aesthetic, but gameplay-wise it's very unique.\n- Pacing is very poor as of right now, you can play 30 minutes and already have a great deal of buildings built. As a result, it doesn't feel very rewarding to build the next one.\n- The resolution of the game itself feels too low, and could be a little zoomed out.\n- Any problem your character has from battle is instantly cured by a little apothecary dwarf for a few coins. It kinda removes the intensity of the health system they have in place\n\nThe cons will probably will be worked out with a little polish. I don't often say that, but I get a good vibe from these guys. All in all, this game is shaping up quickly.

Enough available content alrady in the Early Access version, lots of unique areas to visit, enemies to fight, quests to do, loot and resources to collect in order to gear up fight bosses, level up and unlock more skills to complete quests and build your dwarven kingdom.\n\nIf Kingdom and Elder Scrolls had a baby, that would be called Regions of Ruin. RoR is hevily inspired by Kingdom but it's a completely different game at the same time, it's a side-scrolling RPG where you explore, fight, level up, and build your town. The world has a ton of unique areas, quests, loot and resources waiting for you. You will die a lot or you can change the difficulty if you are not into fighting signigicantly better than you enemies, you can visit and complete each area in the order you chose and you can recruit mercenaries to assist you in combat and workers to farm resources for you.\n\nThe combat is trickier the higher the difficulty you chose, you can dash to avoid enemies, or sneak to sneak attack them, you have a power hit and the ability to throw axes in your enemies face. When you level up, you unlock abilities that will make your job easier. The skill tree has 4 categories: melee attacks, ranged attacks, shield and power hits and you can chose the path that fits to your playstyle. There is a good variety in the enemies already in the Early Access version and bosses that you can find the more you explore the map in the further away areas.\n\nYou \"build\" your town by spending resources for buildings that automaticaly get build there for you. Some of them offer you different things for example a tavern to hire recruits to assist you in combat, or a forge to make your own equipment and an apothecary to make bandages. There are 8 buildings currently available that can also be upgrated to provide more perks.\n\nThere is an open world, you visit new in the order you want and all of them are handcrafted not procedurally generated. That means that everything is placed there for a reason. There isn't an infinite world but it has almost 60 areas already in the Early Access version for you to explore. The areas can be forests, deserts, caves, farms, ruins, strongholds but each one of them is different from the previous ones. You always have new stuff to do and find.\n \nThere is a good variety of npcs (50+?), most of them with unique dialoque. Some of them offer you quests to help them in one way or an other, some of them come and stay in your settlement to be used (medic, blacksmith, vendors etc) and some others you can used as workers to farm resources for you.\n\nThe lore is a mystery you have to figure out by talking to people and collecting some book pages. Currently not finished in the EA version but there are some good amount of text already written. You can also notice a subtle sense of humor in some area's signs or in the gameplay itself, for example your injuries names or that you can apply your skill points by pressing P (peeing) in the campfire etc.\n\nThe art style you either love or hate, it's a decent pixelart with some nice scenery and lots and lots of different hand drawn areas, buildings, enemies, npcs, items and biomes.\n\nThe music is fantastic, gotta love it when a game has a good soundtrack that fits the games universe and hypes you. \n\nControls offer you a variety of options, i use keyboard but as far as i know the controllers will be fully supported too. I tested it in windows but also as far as i know the game runs smoothly on Linux and Mac too. Performace is great in my 5+ year old laptop with an i5@1.80ghz and a gtx970m, it will probably run smoothly in any pc.\n\nThe game still needs a lot of work to extend the content, new areas to visit, new quests and maybe more weapons, armor types and buildings for your settlement and of course the lore, the ending and everything story-related but i'm sure everything will be there in the full version.\n\nThe developer is a solo-dev, very passionate about this game since the day i met him he is fixing bugs left and right and adds new content in regular basis. The current version of the game offers you at least 12-15 hours of play time that can be easily reach the 20 depending on your playstyle and difficulty (edit: apparently some people after the EA launch are finishing it in 5-10 hours so it's totaly up to you how much it will take to you for now). They plan to make the content triple during the early access, the map is huge and only 1/3-1/4 of it is available currently so i expect it will need 40-60 hours to complete it after EA. The game is fun, unique and if it seems interesting/promising for you i would highly recommend it to you to check it out and give it a chanse.\n\nI hope this review was useful to you as i tried to cover as many things as possible. I was one of the testers of the game and had a blast testing it so far.

Discovering the secrets of your ancestor\u2019s ruined homes is especially delightful. They really nailed the wonder of discovery and exploration. The story is felt and experienced, not forced.\n- Seeing your town come to life as you make progress is extremely satisfying\n- The pixel art is beautiful. From the adorable kobold dwellings, to the malevolent, grimacing lightning wizards, this game oozes charm.\n- Companions can be quite helpful when you don\u2019t need to be sneaky. It can be really fun to bring two or three companions and face a whole fort full of goblins or orcs head on.\n- The skill trees are pretty well done as far as I can tell. If you choose wisely you really feel the increase in power as you improve certain skills.\n- When stealth is not employed, battles become appropriately chaotic. I could see some people getting frustrated with being overwhelmed by enemies, but that\u2019s often a sign that you need to take a different approach, i.e. sneak, hire companions, return when you\u2019re stronger etc.\n\n[b][u]What would be nice to see:[/u][/b]\n- Flesh the world out even more. The devs are clearly working hard on this, but the more full and alive the world feels the better. More rumors. More stories. More secrets.\n- Perhaps add more flavor to the companions. Maybe some unique ones could be found/rescued. Also, if companions become more permanent, perhaps you could opt to leave them at your base if you want to go it alone for a bit.\n- It might be fun if some areas were larger. Sneaking about in a huge orc fortress would be pretty epic.\n- Magic, possibly. If it doesn\u2019t thematically fit for the player to get to use magic then that\u2019s okay. Some of the enemies have really cool magic abilities though. It would be fun to get use them (If it wouldn\u2019t completely unbalance the game. Balance is more important)\n- Town events could be cool. Maybe dwarves could come to town from a region you liberated to ask you to go back there and deal with a problem. Maybe your town could be attacked. On that note, maybe you could build town defenses to deter raids. Maybe you could hire/train/equip militia to defend your town. Maybe if you cause trouble for powerful enemies before your defenses are strong, you get sacked hard.\n\n[b][u]What needs to be fixed:[/u][/b]\n- Sometimes the quest-giver dudes get killed in battle, and the quest remains with no way to finish it. I\u2019d say either make the quest-giver invulnerable, like the caravan guy, or make the quest disappear if they die.\n- Oftentimes I\u2019ll complete the objective of a quest, but have no idea where I have to go to finish it. The journal entry only includes the quest objective, not the quest origin.\n- No clue what to do with the runeforge. I\u2019ve dissolved a bunch of stuff, but I don\u2019t see an \u201cimbue\u201d option for any of my items.\n- There seems to be a bit of imbalance in resources. In my current game, I\u2019ve been through dozens of areas since I found one where I can harvest hides. Nearly every forest seems to yield only lumber.\n\nKeep up the good work devs!", "timestamp_created": 1515625248, "timestamp_updated": 1515793266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39163404": {"recommendationid": "39163404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121752988", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514430737}, "language": "english", "review": "This a lot of fun and I've really gotten into building up my little town.

There was probably a time when I was younger where I would've liked this game as-is. All the mechanics are functional enough, the graphics work, and the idea? It's a frickin' side-scrolling Castlevania-exploration Dwarf Fortress! What could possibly go wrong?\n\nThe tragic answer is that the game is completely soulless, and I couldn't get through a single hour of it.\n\n1. The plot is given to you immediately upon the start of your game through a massive text-dump giving setting, backstory, and purpose, telling you everything about what you're going to be doing and exploring before you even start and thus killing any chance of interesting new discovery on the spot.\n2. The NPCs are the most generically-written blobs I've ever seen. \"I am a healer! Come to me if you've been wounded and I'll heal you for a price!\" \"I'm a farmer! Get these kobolds off my lands and I'll join your cause!\" It's all dry and utilitarian. You're not making a colony of dwarves- you're making a colony of robots.\n3. You sustain wounds via the same sort of anatomical injury deal that games like DF give you, but the wound types, you quickly learn, are basically meaningless. If it's a puncture to the neck or a sprain to the foot, it's just straight HP damage regardless, and there is no difference between the injuries or their effect on your fighting.\n4. Alright, because I never got through the first hour of it, I'll admit that this criticism probably isn't explored enough to be valid, but after killing several camps of mute, personality-void goblins and then experiencing several camps of almost identically mute, personality-void kobolds, I was done. Aside from their appearances and the poison damage kobolds used, the two were practically interchangable, and the thought of fighting emotionless drones like these for hours turned me off this game completely.\n\nI'm sorry to give a game with this much work in it a negative review, because I think the spritework is legitimately praiseworthy, but the first impressions this game leave a lot to be desired.

Inna bajka to interface, kt\u00f3ry na pocz\u0105tku wydaje si\u0119 bardzo przejrzysty i prosty w obs\u0142udze, ale w miar\u0119 jak gra si\u0119 rozwija, nasz bohater ro\u015bnie w si\u0142\u0119 i przybywa mikrozarz\u0105dzania osad\u0105, zaczyna brakowa\u0107 kilku opcji, takich jak np. przydzielenie 5 lub 10 pracownik\u00f3w do jednej lokacji, masowego przydzielenia pracownik\u00f3w do r\u00f3\u017cnych stref wydobycia, usuni\u0119cia wszystkich krasnolud\u00f3w z pustych kopalnii, albo zwyk\u0142ego szybkiego zestawienia obok siebie statystyk dw\u00f3ch przedmiot\u00f3w.

Za ka\u017cdym razem, kiedy klikam na kolejne miejsce oczekuj\u0119 nowej przygody i prawie nigdy nie jestem zawiedziony tym, co otrzymuj\u0119! Poziomy s\u0105 bardzo kr\u00f3tkie, ale niesamowicie zr\u00f3\u017cnicowane. Podbijamy naje\u017cone wrogami twierdze, odwiedzamy osady innych krasnoludzkich plemion, walczymy z bestiami w le\u015bnych ost\u0119pach, podejmujemy si\u0119 zada\u0144 i zlece\u0144, odkrywamy staro\u017cytne ruiny (i rozwi\u0105zujemy staroszkolne \u0142amig\u0142\u00f3wki!), zapuszczamy si\u0119 w g\u0142\u0105b kopalni\u2026 A ponadto wiele z odwiedzanych lokacji wykorzystujemy (po oczyszczeniu z potwor\u00f3w), jako \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142o surowc\u00f3w naturalnych, co czasem jest w naturalny spos\u00f3b powi\u0105zane z misjami, kt\u00f3re tam wykonujemy. Jak m\u00f3wi\u0105 tw\u00f3rcy: \u201eno randomized maps or levels, everything you see has been made with care\u201d \u2013 i poniewa\u017c to jest prawda, to jest to jedna z najbardziej wyj\u0105tkowych gier po\u015br\u00f3d proceduralnie generowanego ka\u0142u, jaki nas dzisiaj zalewa.\n\n[*]Balans\nBez owijania w bawe\u0142n\u0119 \u2013 bywa r\u00f3\u017cnie. Dobrze rozwini\u0119te rzucanie toporami pozwala nam wybija\u0107 nawet najmocniejsze potwory z bezpiecznego dystansu, cho\u0107 na szcz\u0119\u015bcie zdarza si\u0119, \u017ce nasze tomahawki nie przebij\u0105 si\u0119 przez co lepiej opancerzonych przeciwnik\u00f3w. W ku\u017ani wykujemy przedmioty zdecydowanie zbyt pot\u0119\u017cne na nasz poziom, by po kilku godzinach uzna\u0107, \u017ce s\u0105 ju\u017c za s\u0142abe, a nie mo\u017cemy jeszcze wytwarza\u0107 lepszych. Mo\u017cemy przypadkiem trafi\u0107 do ruin i rozwi\u0105za\u0107 zagadk\u0119, kt\u00f3ra odblokuje dla nas endgameow\u0105 bro\u0144 (a mo\u017cemy jej u\u017cywa\u0107, bo nie ma \u017cadnych ogranicze\u0144). Tak, ta gra ma problemy z balansem \u2013 mniej wi\u0119cej takie, jak Skyrim. Przy tej ilo\u015bci zaz\u0119biaj\u0105cych si\u0119 system\u00f3w unikni\u0119cie tego jest niemal niemo\u017cliwe i w\u0142a\u015bciwie w niczym nie przeszkadza.\n\n[*]Endgame\nW recenzjach czasem przewija si\u0119 stwierdzenie, \u017ce gra szybko robi si\u0119 powtarzalna, a na p\u00f3\u017aniejszych etapach nie oferuje ju\u017c nic nowego. To prawda, ale problem nie le\u017cy w braku contentu, tylko w z\u0142ym jego skalowaniu. \u015awietne gameplayowe pomys\u0142y szybko rosn\u0105 do rozmiar\u00f3w, kt\u00f3re staj\u0105 si\u0119 zwyczajnie uci\u0105\u017cliwe dla gracza i odblokowuj\u0105 si\u0119 zbyt szybko. A jednak nawet po wyczyszczeniu wi\u0119kszej cz\u0119\u015bci mapy nadal chcia\u0142em odkrywa\u0107 nowe tereny i szuka\u0107 kolejnych sekret\u00f3w. Magia.\n\n[*]Bugi\nJest dobrze. Zdarzaj\u0105 si\u0119 drobne b\u0142\u0119dy, jak np. to, \u017ce jaka\u015b posta\u0107 umrze, zanim oddamy jej questa, albo jaki\u015b znacznik nie pojawi si\u0119 na mapie, ale nie jest to nic, co uniemo\u017cliwia gr\u0119, ale powoduje, \u017ce siadam w k\u0105cie i p\u0142acz\u0119. Wida\u0107, \u017ce zakodowano to z g\u0142ow\u0105. Czasem tylko przeszkadzaj\u0105 niechlujne ramki na tekst, kt\u00f3re nie do\u015b\u0107 dobrze dopasowuj\u0105 si\u0119 do d\u0142ugich wypowiedzi NPC\u00f3w. Tak, czepiam si\u0119.\n[/olist]\n\nPodsumowuj\u0105c, jest to jeden z najlepszych ma\u0142ych/indie RPG\u00f3w ostatnich lat. Mo\u017ce i nie jest idealny, ale nic lepszego nie znajdziecie.

No.\nIs Regions of Ruins going to keep you enthralled for hours? Yes!\n\nLike most indie games, Regions of Ruins does little to take you by the hand and guide you through the game basics. \nUnlike most indie games you'll learn quickly and you will like it, because succeeding means being richly rewarded: magic items, coins, resources to be gathered, workers for your settlement... you have every incentive to pay attention, and grasping the basics isn't hard by any mean. \nThese rewards will help make your character noticeably stronger. For example the new magic weapon you took from an enemy camp will really make a difference during the next fight, or the new resources unlocked will allow you to improve your apothecary and manufacture healing potions, which can truly make a difference in many fights. \nAll is done well and without needless frills. \n\nYes, the quests are linear: go there and kill the goblins, come back and pick up your reward. But honestly who cares? You are supposed to play the part of a hard fighting and (presumably) hard drinking dwarf, not of a Venetian diplomat trying to build and destroy alliances in the XVI century. \nSpeaking of hard drinking, here's a little tip: your tavern is more than just a place were adventures flock to have a drink and you can recruit them. Far more: it can actually open the way to very powerful upgrades if you look hard enough.\nAnd here's one of the strong points: you are incentivated to look everywhere and explore every location. It may be for mere greed or because you just need more coal to smelt more metal ingots but exploration is always rewarded. \n\nThe game has some negatives. As said it will do little to teach you anything, from settlement development to magic item creation. There are a few broken quests (report them on the discussion board so they can be fixed).

The issue with the game is it often does not provide guidance on how certain mechanics work, for instance, how you 'Explore' and then 'Travel' are not really taught, and I had to trawl the internet for a while to find an answer to this issue (F.Y.I you click on the map, not the locations and so long as you have enough food you 'explore' that area and can travel to the locations within). \n\nAs you can expect you are provided a limited storage capacity which you can increase, you'll have a few workers to source finite materials from areas you have cleared. Added to this when you enter certain areas there are ample resources literally lying around that you can collect SO LONG as you can store them at home, so naturally you come across stockpiles you can't just take with you. Irritatingly they VANISH if you don't collect them there and then (and i can assure you, you WON'T be able to collect them all): a return trip will leave you dissappointed as they won't be there if you miss them first time around. \n\nOne concern regarding the game are the followers. Now these fellows I'd say are very important when it comes to conquering the game at harder levels: the enemy will give you no quarter. Goblins swarm you, whilst Orcs are powerful and well armoured (never fight them in tight spaces unless you fight like Geralt of Rivia), there is a plethora of other enemies that'll make securing your Kingdom even harder. Followers seem to be the way forward, but issues arise when you're having to fight in Caves or anywhere that isn't flat: they get stuck and you're left to fight alone (and die alone). \n\nAside from these aspects I think this is a good game overall, the combination of constructing a town combined with exploration and fighting/conquering new grounds to help expand create a solid foundation that could well be expanded into something more in future. The game is not easy much to its benefit and it doesn't always give you warning as to what to expect in each area so you need to be cautious and not barrell through everything.

The price made it 'risk worthy' so I went in blind.\n\nThe first few hours were a combination of addictive and confusing. There is not much in the way of instruction or help in the game, and dealing with some of the game mechanics can be daunting at first. Some things are not labelled well or at all. Even after finishing it, some questions linger.\n\nIt was however, very fun and satisfying. I played with the keyboard and definitely recommend customizing the layout. I used the mouse when dealing with menus and the main world map, and that turned out to be a good combination of controls.\n\nThe gameplay is simple at its core. Explore, hack, slash, loot. Collect workers to gather resources and build your town. As you explore, side quests become available, and an overarching story begins to tie locations together. Some clues found at certain locations can be used at others, so it is a good idea to keep your eyes open. I ended up using the screen cap feature on OSX quite a bit to 'take pictures' of ancient writings in case I needed them later.\n\nThere is a huge variety of weapons, armor and enchantments. It is a lot of fun discovering a new enchantment and seeing how you can use it to mow down your enemies. I became a throwing axe sniper, picking off enemies before they even knew I was there. The action looks, feels and sounds very satisfying. Throwing an axe through a row of enemies that is charging you is a joy.\n\nAs the game progresses, the enemies will force you to learn new strategies and fighting styles. For the first 30% of the game I ignored my shield entirely, but it became much more important in order to defeat foes later on.\n\nCharacter progression is a mixed bag. It is a lot of fun to make a level and get a new skill. You can choose from a range of melee, axe, shield or power hitting skills. You also get one (1!) attribute point, which seems kind of anemic when I can regularly find weapons and armor that add attribute points in multiples of 10. I'm not sure if base values are more important than values added by equipment, as that isn't made clear.\n\nWith all its charm and early progression, it is very addictive at the beginning. Eventually, however, there is some flaws that make themselves evident. \n\nResources seem to be strewn about in a very unblanced way. You will definitely be desperate for some, while drowning in others. There is eventually a market that helps solve that problem, but at great expense.\n\nSelling items is a very time intensive process because there is only a few places on the entire map that will buy them, and they have very little gold to spend. You will find yourself trading item for item moreso, and these dwarves are not generous with their prices! It's not really a problem early on, but as the game progresses you will be running out of places to keep all the items you collect but want to sell. The buyers resupply gold every time you visit their map location but it could mean a lot of travelling in order to sell your items, which is tedious.\n\nThe difficulty level does seem to follow a particular path through exploration, and if you head too early into an area, you will get smashed. It is not a problem as saves are free and auto save is frequent. However, eventually your character will be so powerful, not much will challenge him. I cleared the whole map before visiting the final boss and I killed him with axes from a distance. He never even knew I was there. Obviously I was overpowered for that particular battle.\n\nAll in all, this game is very well done, but while it is addictive and challenging at the beginning, the wheels fall off as it nears the end and it becomes a cakewalk. Perhaps some auto difficulty scaling and some better enemy AI could keep it challenging?\n\nOverall I recommend it because I enjoyed it immensely from start to finish, even with its flaws.

Tactical options basically  include A) smash the shit out of everything relentlessly or B) chuck axes while you run away and try not to get hit by anything.

Gameplay is solid -- smashing boxes and monsters with your weapon of choice is great.  The leveling system is pretty neat.  Wish it had a better soundtrack, though the current one is not bad (any 8-bit, chiptune, or synth would've done! hotline miami, hyperlight drifter, and kingdom all have enviable soundtracks for this kind of game).  The game does manage to capture a bit of that 'kingdom' feel, and for a few hours it scratches the itch of those who have been asking: \"Why isn't there a pixel-graphic rpg where I explore a big world while building a base and fighting monsters?\"\n\nSadly, while it has a ton of great features and little side-quests/mini games, it all falls short after that first 5-7 hours.  Gameplay becomes repetitive as hell.  The town building system reveals itself to be fairly shallow, linear, and somewhat pointless.  (Yes, your upgraded buildings serve their respective function better, but for the most part they feel pointless.  E.g. an upgraded blacksmith lets you make better weapons and armor, but by the time you get it upgraded you've probably found better gear.)  Every goblin/kobold/orc camp starts to look the same.  The game's sub-systems start to lose their edge; it matters less that a new bounty or a new companion is available because after an hour or two you know exactly how it's all going to work out.\n\nOffhand, I'm not sure what could've made this game principally better.  The possible addition of a storyline to give the game some cohesion after you've explored 1/3rd of the map?  More activities and ways to develop your town?  Perhaps greater quest diversity; every quest or map node that didn't result in dwarves sending me to kill more of the same monster was a treat.  I guess I expected a richer world -- there are so many possible map nodes that not every one of them can hold some interesting little thing, but after a while one tends to know exactly what's going to happen in  this game.

Kiting is a valid and important strategy. There is alot of loot. Each short map will drop anywhere from 5 to 10+ pieces of loot of varying quality. You can quick attack, strong attack, throw axes, shield, dash, jump, and unlock special abilities. All of which use a stamina bar to prevent you from spamming attacks.\n\nThe skill tree is more about play style than it is raw power.  For increasing power there is both a \"find all the pages of a book and unlock buff\" element and a forge element that allows you to buff your equipment.\n\nCity management is a meta game. You harvest resources from area's you've cleared of enemies, then use those resources to upgrade your city. Upgrading the forge for example will allow you to forge new types of ore blocks, upgrading the tavern gives you more daily income. There are roughly 8 buildings to build, and you will end up building all of them, city management is not strategic beyond priortizing your play style.\n\nIf you enjoy pixel graphics, this game is beautiful. The music and sounds are well done too but don't add much. \n\nOver all great game.

There are weird lagging moments after actions that create HUGE problems when you are fighting enemies. After a dash there is a few frames where your actions just do NOT register, same thing happens when you quick attack and heavy attack as well as block. You need to be able to IMMEDIATELY block with your shield because the enemies are both swarming you up close and raining a hail of arrows on you from afar, but you constantly find yourself open to enemies due to the clunky nature of the \"controls\" (note that I am not implying that the keybindings are bad, I am saying that the inherent character actions feel laggy and not snappy or tight at all). You can set up any keybinding you want but the problem persists, your character just will not react as quickly as you can input commands. The dev suggests sneaking to counter the problem of enemies having the upperhand, but honestly you have to be SO CLOSE TO THE ENEMY in order to reach them by the time your sneak meter runs out that they notice you anyway. Clean up the responsiveness and adjust the sneak feature and I think this would be a positive review, but as the game stands right now, I would stay away or wait until it goes 50%-75% off because 20% off is not even worth it.

Combine this with a significant basis in 2D platforming and you have something inherently fun to play.\n\n [*]+ A solid RPG layered in between a location-based exploration overmap, with a base building mechanic in between that complete with resource mechanics and tiering makes this a meal for both number crunchers and base builders alike. Its always worth exploring, for both personal gear and resources. Its always worth progressing through the map, for legendary gear locked behind world-spanning puzzles and similar.\n\n [*]+ *Multiple* quests and other such puzzles that run across the land as well as over time as you progress gives you something to do as you go through each location.\n[/list]\n\n======\n\n[b][i][u]NEGATIVES[/u][/i][/b]\n[list]\n [*]- Pixel-style art direction and execution makes this game not stand out as much unlike previous generations' offerings, which does not help it stand out. Upon first glance, it, by its very design, looks like a melee combat platform RPG.\n\n [*]- As solid as its mechanics interplay between character RPG, base building, resource gathering, and exploration, one can end up in a situation where the scaling is haphazardly sharp. You can end up being very overpowered with a full team of 10 highly powerful companions to go with enemies that can just as easily severely wound you through your tough overpowered armor for no evident reason, whist in most other situations, attacks can just as much No-Sell.\n\n [*]- Said haphazard scaling also applies to the resource collection and base building, wherein one can pretty much have everything after 10-15 hours and have little more to progress on that front. Beyond this point, resources are collected just to feed personally crafted gear, which can have weird balance ranges, leading you to have either vastly underpowered, or vastly overpowered gear.\n\n [*]- Exploration loop can easily become samey after similar number of hours, with locations becoming samey to one another. This does not help the puzzle mechanics as well, as it is difficult to find locations where the solution or clues to one puzzle can be across the map full of locations, with little to no indications where which is what and where. Combine this with a journal system that is decisively several generations ago obsolete (anyone remember Morrowind's journal? yeah...) makes it difficult to track quests you're on, puzzles you're trying to solve, and the like.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1518183197, "timestamp_updated": 1518184438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39948832": {"recommendationid": "39948832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112950636", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518210931}, "language": "german", "review": "Better than Fallout 4", "timestamp_created": 1518166686, "timestamp_updated": 1518166686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39948804": {"recommendationid": "39948804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038829622", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518250179}, "language": "english", "review": "On the surface is a pretty simple game. It's a side scroller ARPG where you essentially kill all the enemies and loot the rewards and then repeat the process probably a hundred or more so times. It sounds tedious, but there was always something that intrigued me to continue. \n\nPerhaps it was the gathering resources to upgrade my settlement. Perhaps it was the very thoughtful amount of book pages to collect that not only serve as lore for the game but also give good bonuses as well. Perhaps it was solving all the runes and see what type of unique item I got. Or maybe it was something just as simple as playing an idle game within the game. Whatever it was it got me addicted, I beat the game in 2 whole sittings. \n\n13 hours is pretty standard I'd say. Didn't complete everything. Personally though I don't know if I want to.\n As much as I enjoyed the inital playthrough of the game, by the time you beat it, there's not much else you'd want to achieve. I could clear out all the Runes and get purple tiered adamantite armor to match my flame sword. I could max out the remaining 2-3 buildings in my settlement. But again I don't see much point to. It was when you were playing through and realized that there was a much broader scope of enemies to fight. That you needed to craft better weapons, armor and shields. To do that you needed to upgrade your town. The game got harder the further away you got from your settlment. Heck it took me 10 hours before I can finally rob the dwarf for his book page. But once you beat it, what else can you do? By that point you are already at God-level. There's not much else to achieve past that point. I feel like a more dedicated post-game is something this game needs. I am not saying that don't feel like I deserve my  accomplishments or the game didn't give me a challenge. The final boss took me many tries before I could finally beat him. But unless I am wrong, I don't think anyone can get much tougher than that. \n\nThis isn't to scare away anyone from buying this game. Trust there's loads to do to keep you pre-occupied. This game definitely had a lot of love and care put into it. I ate up whatever new thing it threw at me. Also, despite beating the game I still haven't unlocked a single achievement.\n\nEdit: I did go back just out of sheer curiosity of review.

I disagree with many of the similarities drawn to other games as Regions of Ruin does a good job of being unique.

There's plenty of goodies left scattered around like scattered journals and dwarven survivors to tell a story of this ruined world.\n+ The action aspect is simple but well done.  The rock-paper-scissors formula of force attack beats block beats quick attack beats force attack is satisfying to use against the enemy and avoid falling victim to.\n+ You can recruit your very own throng of dwarves from the tavern who will faithfully attempt to follow you around and murder things.\n= The hired dwarves will end up doing most of the work and turn maps into massive smash and grabs.\n= Stealth is an interesting idea but is mostly useless besides the early levels introducing it before you get an army.  The free thrown axe critical is what stealth boils down to later.\n= Difficulty spikes.  You will grow complacent fighting green goblins and kobolds.  But when the orcs, trolls, or the red variants are encountered, life immediately becomes much harder.\n= Stats and skills exist.  Some of them offer a drastic change in playstyle, others are a small boost only selected to unlock better things.  \n- The dwarven AI can't pathfind at all like the other AI.  They will fall down a hole with a ladder and just run into the wall instead of using the ladder\n- The city simulator aspect of this game is extremely weak.

Sound is good, graphics are exactly what the pictures show, and the story is interesting.

The story is interesting, the game-play is smooth and fun, and I also enjoy the settlement building.  I believe that the added responsibility of collecting resources to build settlement buildings adds an extra layer of purpose to these games, other than just go here, kill that.\n\nApart from game play, the music is good and catchy and the sound effects work well.  Not sure what to say about the graphics, other than they are the basic retro-pixel style that you see a lot in steam indie games nowadays.  Look at the store page screenshots, that's what you'll get in the visual department.\n\nThe story and quests feel meaningful, as you are trying to rebuild a Dwarven community.  NPS's give you quests which are not just \"go here and do that\", but impact how your settlement grows and the resources you can gather.  Once you recruit some workers, you can send them off to collect resources from cleared areas you've already explored.  I enjoy that mechanic, as it adds and extra layer of usefulness to previously cleared areas.\n\nCombat can be tricky and I still haven't fully gotten the hang of it.  The control scheme feels a bit off, but again I don't usually play these types of games.  Keys can be remapped, so it's not really an issue.\n\nOverall, the game is fun and enjoyable, and I think it is priced fairly at $10.  Even if the game goes off sale to the regular price of $12, I'd recommend picking it up for fans of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1517889986, "timestamp_updated": 1517889986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39877724": {"recommendationid": "39877724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013870632", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518378252}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun", "timestamp_created": 1517877131, "timestamp_updated": 1517877131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.367995", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39876744": {"recommendationid": "39876744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108940993", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517476117}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute, Fun and Addictive.

Well, it's a genuinely solid little game that I recommend, there's that. \n\nIf you want details? well, okay, we can do that. What do I usually talk about in a big review... graphics I guess? It's got a nice retro style to the game, it looks like a throwback to the days of the old NES, but crucially it doesn't have that entire 'I made the graphics all pixelly so they look old and now it's impossible to tell what anything is' problem some games that try to look retro have. Full marks there.\n\nThe gameplay is solid as well, the platforming sections are all challenging without being too easy or too difficult and that's a genuinely hard balance to achieve. It can get hectic when enemies are shooting you off tiny little ledges, but the individual areas aren't ever massive enough that this becomes a problem or frustrating or outright makes it impossible to progress. I'll mention the skill trees as well, while we are talking about gameplay - they are, like the rest of the game, very solid. Stealth feels a little weak, but then again I didn't spec for it so I have no idea how it plays out in the late game - it could become incredibly overpowered for all I know. I never used the ranged tree either, I sort of wandered between the defence tree and the basic melee tree, and it worked. It worked very, very well and that's another thing this game has going for it, since a lot of the time when a skill tree is there you need to fully dedicate yourself to it or you gimp your character. Bonus points for this not happening.\n\nCombat. You can block, use power attacks to break through enemies who are trying to block, and you have normal melee attacks. The various weapons are different enough and the skills change things up enough that this makes combat fun and it stays fun right to the end of that game. I went with a build focused on super rapid but weak melee strikes and a weapon with a massively high crit rating. I was a blender until I ran into enemies who had tower shields, when things suddenly became much trickier. Good fun all around.\n\nThe world. Okay, this is the bit I loved most, and this is where the game shines. There are at my count ...uh... yeah, not actually gonna count all the locations, because as it happens there are a LOT of them, and all of them are unique. Rather than just using a generic random terrain generator to make locations the guy developing the game built them all by hand, and I suspect he play tested them all personally as well. Every location is different and it makes the world feel really alive and gives you a reason to explore because you'll find a new quest or item or challenging little encounter, and they are all really nicely laid out.\n\nHad to come back and add this bit in, because I totally forgot about it, but you get to build your own settlement and give all the dwarven refugee's you find and captives you rescue a home. They go out to gather resources from areas you clear and you can use those to improve the settlement and so on and so on. You go from using a rusty sword and a dead rat as a shield (one of those might be a slight exaggeration) to being able to forge and enchant your own Adamantine weapons and armour, and you can recruit a variety of little beardy followers to go merrily charging into combat with you. Up to ten of them in fact. If the Skeleton Butler ever makes it in, you can thank me in the comments below.\n\nWhat else? The developer. Okay, I don't usually put this bit in a review, but seriously. I found a bug with a quest, posted it on the Steam forums and not only did I get a personal apology from the guy but the bug was squashed four days later in the weekly hotfix.\n\nYeah.\n\nWeekly.\n\nI'm not kidding. If you happen to find a bug you can basically watch it get fixed in realtime right now. That's insane.\n\n\nDo I have any issues with the game at all? well, I'm not completely sure, but I think the guy might have made his own dwarven rune language and if I'd learned to translate the messages I found I would have gotten a fair bit of extra stuff in the form of treasures and secrets. That's it. The closest thing to a problem with the game was 'the developer might have invented a dwarven language and I couldn't be arsed to translate it'.\n\nIf I'd have typed this review up a week or so earlier then I'd have a bit here complaining about how the quest system doesn't tell you where you got quests from or where you need to go, and with the journal being a bit vague it made finishing quests quite hard, but guess what was added in a hotfix this week?\n\n\n\nLastly, I'll say that I won this game for free on a stream by my favourite Youtuber, Nookrium. if you love games like this or strategy type stuff in general, especially if it's indie then get you to Youtube and go take a look at his channel.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwX8RD5ivBjTm1QHIv7fm_Q", "timestamp_created": 1517073178, "timestamp_updated": 1517073734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609849", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}}}

(which is finally becoming a top 10)\n\nThe polish is almost at the level of The Lab imo. Not quite as detailed textures but the game looks and feels great (running perfectly on 970)\n\nWhile I enjoy GravLab - if you were excited about its premise but let down by the execution - this game is going to fill that void.. (and while GravLab is similar they are also very different.. its kinda like comparing Street Fighter with Mortal Kombat..or k'nex and legos)\n\n\nThe physics are great.The levels (so far, at level 20 i think) are progressing well enough - but I'm worried that 50 lvls may not be enough as they start out quite easy. The first 10-15ish were a breeze..\n\nI hope that someday we'll get a level editor with workshop capability, that would be amazing.\n\nJust get the demo. \nIf you like it at all then the full game is absolutely worth the price\n\n\n\nedit: It gets much more challenging lvl 20+. Also, I didn't realize there was a 2nd game mode so I'm excited for that.

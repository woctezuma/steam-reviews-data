It does a lot of justice for Treasure Planet which I feel was cut down in its prime.  Battles are just slow enough to be tactical in nature, but still satisfying to take part in.  Every weapon sounds powerful, and impacts are satisfying.  Watching a ship burst into splinters after landing every shot from a broadside will feel and sound fantastic!  Each of the 3 factions have drastically different ships and the different types of ships play and handle differently. \n\nBAD:\nThe soundtrack is loud and unfortunetly repetative.  I find the main menu theme to be very plesant personally, but can totally understand if it drives others crazy.  Certain multiplayer maps force you to play a certain faction, and which faction you play is determained by your spot in the player list which is more than a little dumb.  The game doesn't have many players these days so not much going on in the multiplayer department.   Not the best time for players who don't enjoy fighting bots.\n\nBULLSH*T\nThe biggest bullsh*t of this game is the fact that the 2nd movie got cancled!  There's no context at all for anything going on involving the Procyons because it was all going to be explained IN THE SECOND BLOODY MOVIE!\n\nIn the end this is easily one of the best tactical-naval warfare games in existance!

I was skeptical at first, as I hadn't really ever played any text-based adventures (odd, since i I am an aspiring author), but this little epic left me pleasantly surprised. I remained enthralled for hours, enjoying every moment of this steampunk world with its unique yet familiar historical elements, and characters you could really feel like you have gotten to know. The only issue I had was the end. NO, not the ENDING, which was as masterfully constructed as the rest of the story, I mean the fact that, like any story, it had to come to an end. I could have easily spent hours, if not DAYS more with this story.

The story of the former battlefield surgeon who works for the goverment of a technology-based society which struggles with a magic using enemy is shaped by the choices you make.\n\nThe game often gives your the freedom to define the motivation of your character, asks you why to story progessed in certain directions and gives you choices that not only are quite different, but sometimes make the decision which path to follow quite tough. So it creates tension even if all you have to do is clicking a button. \n\nIt's well written in an gracceful style that fits the theme of Steampunk. The action scenes are quick and suspenseful, the game gives you more ways to handle them then just firing a gun. The romance scenes - at least the gay one I played - were  neat, sweet and well crafted. I actually was invested in the ups and downs of that part of the story, because the game doesn't shy away from the fact that in this fictional victorian-based era this kind of love had to be a secret one. That strengthened my ambition to find a way for a happy ending.\n\nAt the end the story worked for me and gave me goosebumps in its final chapter when all my character did and did not had a share on the outcome of the story.\n\nOne minor flaw is that theere is no recap after a finished chapter like in other Choice by- or Choice of- games.

An interactive novel, as with all Choice of Games titles, Choice by Gaslight revolves around you and the choices you make. The story changes heavily depending on your decisions, and especially so once you have to make a choice between three (technically four, later on) factions.\n\nChoice by Gaslight does a wonderful job at immersing you in a steampunk world. With giant mechs, passenger zeppelins, a bit of magic (which is prohibited to an extent, and can be used by you either for good, evil, or not at all), and a Victorian-esque setting, fans of the steampunk genre will likely find themsevles right at home. While I feel as though the earlier chapters do a better job at provoking imagery, the game still manages to immerse you later on as well.\n\nWhilst I have only, at the time of this review, played the game once, I can still say that your choices do indeed affect the story, so fans of RPGs will also find a lot to love in this game, which could even be described as a text-based RPG.\n\nAdditionally, a main advantage this title has over other Choice of Games titles is that this one has deeper character relationships than even Choice of Robots, in my opinion. While I personally found the romantic relationships rather limited (as far as I could tell, siding with the faction that I did means you cannot have a romantic relationship at all), the friendships- or, perhaps, rivalries- with other characters are deep and make you care about your in-game friends.\n\nAltogether, Choice by Gaslight is an immersive steampunk RPG, that, despite being (almost) entirely text-based, will likely not soon be forgotten, especially for steampunk fans.

Your relationships with all these people develop, deepen and evolve over time depending, of course, on how you interact with them and where your allegiances lie... And without spoiling anything the story is full of exciting twists and turns. You're never sure quite where it'll take you next but there are enough hints and clues that you can come up with your own theories; making it very satisfying to follow along with your character's moments of dawning realization. Something rare and delightful in stories of mystery and intrigue.\nAs I've yet to do more than the one playthrough I can't speak to the branching paths though it seems like the story will make many quite drastic changes depending on how and what you do.

Like with the rest of the games from this series, there lies an complex interplay of character relationships and political factions that provides a wide array of responses and skillsets to help create your persona.  For example, on my first playthrough I played the part of a pacifist medical specialist that chose to partake in the Resistance's efforts to create a more balanced government, but retaining my humanity by saving all my former allies and those that required help.  It felt like all my choices matter, and that there were multiple strengths to build your character across is a plus.  However, it would have been great for an option to choose the gender of your character, as the game automatically assumes that you are playing as a man, which can take people out of the narratice if using a female persona.\n\nOther than that, the story world of this game is great and encompasses many different morally grey areas. A central focus on the game's lore revolves around a group of people known as \"the sun-touched\", who possess the ability to drain or give life force to other people.  Through this ability, the sun-touched and the vampiric \"light-eaters\" have created a feudal society at the expense of treating commoners as nothing more than cattle and serfs.  On the other hand, your country Mercia has broken away from such worship and have ushered a technological revolution, with all the pros and cons that they entail, with constant pleas for labor reform and unions.  In fact, the situation can be viewed as so abhorrent that a Resistance has formed to express the discontent of the working class which amounts to a lot of vigilante justice, sabotage, and outright terrorism.

I would recommend this for a first time VN-reader.\n\nMy route order: Lance > Yuri > Yeonho > Tei > Red > Secret endings. Yuri and Tei were my favourites.\n\nNameless is a Korean otome game that took me about 38 hours to complete. There are five routes and two secret endings in total. Each route branches off of a fairly short common route; the bulk of the game is definitely in the character-specific portions. The game is mostly lighthearted with touches of dark subject matter. Most of the issues it points out can be fairly poignant and hit close to home, such as being accepted by friends, and being true to yourself and your own interests. Naturally, this is all set in a high school setting.\n\nThe game is translated, and it\u2019s obvious. The grammar is often spotty, though never incomprehensible. There are a few occasionally amusing misspellings such as \u201cfiends\u201d instead of \u201cfriends\u201d. I can\u2019t speak for the Korean to English translation as I don\u2019t know Korean; however, I had no problem whatsoever grasping the story and felt emotionally moved during some parts.\n\nNameless\u2019 art is a mixed bag. The highest quality artwork would definitely be the sprites (which for the most part are very good, especially Soi and Shinbi) and the CG art in the common route. The backgrounds are, mostly, lacklustre, and some are very simple. The most disappointing aspect of the artwork is that the CGs for the individual character routes are lower quality than those in the common route. It ends up being awkward and not as clean-looking. For a game with this price tag, that is rather annoying. It feels like a letdown for the common route art to be so pretty whilst the character-specific art is not as good.\n\nThe soundtrack is probably Nameless\u2019 best technical feature. There are several different vocal themes for the endings depending on which character route you\u2019re playing through. In addition, the music played throughout the game was mostly enjoyable. There were a few tracks I didn\u2019t like; however, overall, I was never bored, and the soundtrack itself is something I don\u2019t regret purchasing. The music fit the scenes they were in and some were delightfully creepy. I enjoyed the voice actors in the game and thought they fit their characters pretty well.\n\nThe writing is, for the most part, decent. The game treats restarting and choosing a new route in a rather interesting way, and occasionally breaks the fourth wall. The characters themselves (arguably the most important part) are generally likable. Tei, Yuri, and Yujin (not dateable) were my favourites. The characters I liked least were Yeonho and, by far, Red. I simply don\u2019t like characters such as him and it was somewhat irritating that I was forced to do his route last. However, it\u2019s understandable, given that the most plot-heavy material is left for his route. In addition, I did manage to warm up to him a bit by the end, though not enough to LIKE him. In that sense, I actually felt rather relieved when his route ended. Preferences notwithstanding, the characters were written competently and most of them had believable issues and personalities, though some did stray into the melodramatic. Each character has one good ending and at least two bad endings.\n\nThe plot moves along at a passable pace, though some events do repeat through routes (such as the school festival and visiting the amusement park), which makes the game feel a little repetitive at times. The heroine, Eri, is adequate, though there are multiple misunderstandings that occur through different routes that basically rely on her denseness or stupidity to work. It\u2019s rather exasperating watching two characters fumble about with ridiculous issues that could be resolved if they simply communicated, but, such is the game and many VN protagonists. The secret endings, only available after reading all the routes, were\u2026disappointing. I wish that, combined, they had at least been as long as an individual character route. However, there is a drama CD that supposedly takes place after the secret endings, so perhaps that will quell my annoyance.\n\nOverall, Nameless was an enjoyable game, though plagued by some repetitiveness. I suppose that can\u2019t be helped given the setting, however. Either way, I had a fun time with it, and I\u2019d recommend it to those who enjoy otome or romance.\n\nP.S. Fun (?) fact: \"Yuri\" is the name I use for unnamed otome heroines.

I've played Yuri and Lance's routes only but I know what happens in the other routes since I read about them rather than taking the time to play them.\n\nYuri's route moves very awkwardly, it somehow goes from moving too fast to moving too slow to moving too fast. I didn't find him particularly interesting, although his \"type\" of character is usually my favorite. In my opinion by the end of Yuri's route not enough of the story was made clear. I want to avoid spoilers but there were some aspects of the route that were confusing that weren't made clear in the end.\n\nLance's route I found enjoyable for the most part, I don't have any specific complaints about it.\n\nTei and Yeonho are both very, I don't know if 'morbid' is the right way to describe their characters but that's the only thing I can think of. I was warned by a friend about content in both of their routes so I read about both before hand before deciding I didn't feel comfortable playing them. I know some people may be into their kinds of characters but just as a fair warning, if yandere types make you uncomfortable they both enroach on yandere territory.\n\nRed I don't have any interest in because I just find him to be an annoying character.\n\nI, again, love Cheritz as a company but this game is just a lot of reading but I didn't really get much enjoyment for the amount there was to read.", "timestamp_created": 1515892031, "timestamp_updated": 1515892031, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39314551": {"recommendationid": "39314551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239809234", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 256, "last_played": 1515946981}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc2a4\ud300\uc73c\ub85c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc62e\uae30\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uccb4\ub9ac\uce20\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc6b4\ubc1b\uc544\uc11c \ud560\ub54c\ubd80\ud130 \ud588\uace0 \n\uc804 \ub8e8\ud2b8 \ub2e4 \uacf5\ub7b5\ud588\uace0 \uc560\ub4e4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc9c0 \ub2e4 \uc678\uc6b4 \uc0c8\ub7fc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4....\n\n\uc804\ud604\uc9c1 \ud55c\uad6d\uc131\uc6b0\uc624\ub530\uafb8\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc131\uc6b0\ub2d8\ub35c \ubaa9\uc18c\ub9ac \ub4e3\ub294 \ub9db\uc5d0 \ud588\uc9c0\uc694. . . \n\ud6c4\ub35c\ub35c\ud558\uac8c \uc624\uc9c0\ub294 \uc131\uc6b0\ub2d8\ub35c \ubcf4\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc774\uc815\ub3c4\uba74 \uac1c\ucd94 \uac15\ucd94 \ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4,.\n\ub0a8\ub3c4\ud615 ... \uc815\uc7ac\ud5cc ... \ubc15\uc131\ud0dc ... \ud64d\ubc94\uae30 ... \uc774\ub3d9\ud6c8 ... \ub05d\uc7a5 \uc751 \uc774\uc815\ub3c4\uba74 \uce90\uc2a4\ud305 \ub05d\uc7a5!!!\n\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uccb4\ub9ac\uce20\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc2e4\uc464\ub294 \ucd94\uc7a5\ub2d8\uc758 \uc720\ub9ac\uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8\uacfc \uc728\ub2d8\uc758 \uc2e0\ube44\ub8e8\ud2b8\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.\n\uc6b0 \uac00 \uc6b0 \uac00 ! \uc8fc\uae34\ub2e4 ! \ub8e8\ud2b8 \uc548\ub9cc\ub4e0 \uc0ac\ub78c \uc8fc\uae34\ub2e4 !

MysMes is an excellent game (believe me or not, this app is now part of my life, if I don't open it at least once everyday I feel bad, because MM is my favorite game), but when I found out that Cheritz made other games, I felt that they would be just as great.\nAnd I was right.\nI loved Nameless from the start to the end. My favorite aspects:\n- An incredible design: seriously, the characters are just so beautiful that's unfair (and yeah, I'm talking to you, Yuri. Who gave you permission to steal my heart the first moment you appeared?)\n- The OST is breathtaking: I particullary liked Yuri's theme the most, of course, after the opening song, 'If I Could'. But all the songs are great.\n- The relationships are well-made: a lot of otome games just hurry and kind of force the relationship between the MC and the pursued character, but Nameless isn't like that. The routes focus on healing the scars from the dolls before they can really start a romantic relationship. This shows that, for Eri, being a girlfriend is less important than being a good friend and owner. It's heartwarming.\n- The backstory is wonderful and made me cry: the dolls' backstory and ???'s too. Cheritz, you've made me cry so much until now!\n- MC is great: Eri is my favorite MC from all otome games I've played so far. She is always ready to take action, care about her dolls, is kind but strong at the same time. She runs away from the stereotype of 'the dumb and confused girl in love'. Well, Cheritz's MCs are like this, but I don't know why Eri caught my attention the most.\n- The characters are so loveable: gahh, why are they not real? I'm seriously in love with them, when will the law allow marriage with fictional characters?\nThank you very much for this wonderful game, Cheritz!", "timestamp_created": 1515278415, "timestamp_updated": 1515278415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39113756": {"recommendationid": "39113756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171884857", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 214, "last_played": 1515198425}, "language": "german", "review": "I finished the game last night and the story was really interesting and frustrating at the same time.

I tried various otome games in the past, but this is I think one of my top games for the following reasons:\n\n1. This is the first game that ever smoothly explained why a protagonist can date so many guys in one overarching story.\n\n2. Great story for all the characters (even the side characters!). They all had their unique personality and background. The main characters all had their flaws that they eventually overcome with the protagonist. The protagonist also grows and learns crucial components in life throughout your playing. It was nice to see that and not just resetting the game to clear another character.\n\n3. Perfect voice acting. Even the side characters. \n\n4. Beautiful graphics. I couldn't help myself from screenshotting while playing. They are all saved in my Steam cloud private profile muhaha\n\n5. Nice music. I loved the sound effects as well.\n\n\nHowever, I didn't like the game in parts where:\n\n1. Kinda cheesy/corny parts in the story. Perhaps because the setting is in high school? Gosh. the HOT5? Ugh. But I was the person who hated Boys Over Flowers manga and drama, so idk. Some people may like the corny parts.\n\n2. The proportions of the CGs looked a little funny in some of the characters. I wonder if there was some favoritism going on with the graphic team...\n\n3. The story was kinda dark for my taste, but hey it's also just a personal preference. I could see how some people would really love this type of story.\n\nI would still definitely recommend this game, though.\n\nI think I bought this when it was on sale, so maybe $30 can shy some people away. \n\nIf you have time, money, and interests in characters with unique story, I would highly recommend this game to you.", "timestamp_created": 1512885636, "timestamp_updated": 1512885717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38069502": {"recommendationid": "38069502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366127332", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512422065}, "language": "english", "review": "I found the general idea of the game to be intriguing, and enjoyed playing it a lot!

The stroylines are great and the details amongst the chapters are very adequate, plus with 5 boys to play from with long routes, you should not get bored by the rpg itself. The artwork is very beautiful with it's detailed colorings and shadings. Yet, going back into the game itself, it's something that surprised me. I mean, I would've never expected what I did from an otome harem game. Each boy's backstories are extremely emotional, and it pulled so many of my nerves making me into a complete mess with the game's capacity to share so many emotons with it's players. You may think of just wanting to get straight into the best ending as possible into an otome game, yet this game reveals so many more things about these characters in the bad endings as well. Getting deeper into the stories, it just fascinated me with how beautifully scripted this otome game was. I would've never expected as much as I gotten into one rpg itself.

De entrada no tiene stats, ni planificaciones ni cosas que distraigan de la historia. Y es una que merece la pena jugar. Lo recomiendo 100%.\n\n[u]Personajes y rutas [/u]: OMG LANCE... Ten\u00eda que empezar por ah\u00ed, lo siento. Sigamos, los personajes son incre\u00edbles. De entrada hay tres historias para iniciar: Lance (!!!), Yuri y Yeon-ho. Tienen una ruta conjunta hasta cierto punto (4-5 cap\u00edtulos aprox.) y despu\u00e9s ya se dividen. Las otras dos van despu\u00e9s y ya no comparten la misma ruta com\u00fan. Se puede jugar la de Tei y Red sin hacer hecho las primeras tres, s\u00ed, se puede. Por historia quiz\u00e1s tendr\u00eda m\u00e1s sentido hacer las otras tres primero, pero sois am@s de vuestros destinos as\u00ed que a vuestra elecci\u00f3n.\n\n[u]Gr\u00e1ficos y CG[/u]: Los cg's con una calidad y dibujo muy buenos. Buenos fondos, los personajes son preciosos, pesta\u00f1ean, hay efectos graciosos (fijaros en Soi cuando est\u00e1 enamorada, muy divertido), se sonrojan. Y seguro que me dejo m\u00e1s cosas. No dan una sensaci\u00f3n muy est\u00e1tica, no s\u00f3lo por los parpadeos sino que tienen varias poses diferentes (no aparecen siempre igual). La calidad en este apartado es magn\u00edfica y la paletas de colores que utiliza resulta agradable. Si quieres conseguir todos los CG's es posible que tengas que consultar alguna gu\u00eda para encontrar alguno en concreto sin volverte loc@.\n\n[u]Voces y sonido[/u]: Tiene (en coreano) y se pueden desactivar por personajes quien no las quiera. Adem\u00e1s se puede regular desde dentro del juego el volumen de las voces, efectos de sonido y m\u00fasica. La m\u00fasica va cambiando y va acorde a la situaci\u00f3n.\n\n[u]Historia[/u]: Las historias son muy buenas y todas ellas tienen recuerdos m\u00e1s o menos diferentes de la infancia de Eri (o el nombre que os pong\u00e1is, porque se puede cambiar). Todas ellas son importantes y est\u00e1n ligadas a los personajes de la ruta. Y es dif\u00edcil decir m\u00e1s sin hacer spoilers. Tiene momentos enternecedores y c\u00e1lidos, y otros un poco m\u00e1s dram\u00e1ticos e impactantes. En resumen, est\u00e1 bastante bien y as\u00ed como en Dandelion quedaba un poco m\u00e1s forzado todo el hilo argumental, en este no da esa impresi\u00f3n de una forma tan directa.\n\n[u]Men\u00fas del juego y guardado[/u]: Muchas p\u00e1ginas y espacios de guardado, lo que pueda llegar a ser un l\u00edo en manos de alguien ca\u00f3tico pero bien llevado te permite guardar todas las rutas sin sobreescribir. Lo que s\u00ed encuentro a faltar es alguna clase de indicaci\u00f3n que te diga el estado de la relaci\u00f3n. Aunque cuando te sale GAME OVER tras una respuesta, es f\u00e1cil deducir que no era buena. Recomiendo que si no us\u00e1is una gu\u00eda (y no hace falta seguirla), guard\u00e9is y prob\u00e9is con algunas segundas o terceras respuestas para tener todos los CG's.\n\nSi me dejo algo, espero darme cuenta y rehacerlo. Espero que l@s que os decid\u00e1is a jugar este juego, lo disfrut\u00e9is mucho. Para m\u00ed es el mejor otome que he jugado y \u00e9l \u00fanico que tras jugar una historia en concreto hace a\u00f1os, me hizo no querer jugar las otras despu\u00e9s.

The CGs are sparse and I feel like only the 3 CGs in the common route have the same quality of the sprites. Most of the CGs of the routes felt weird, be it perspective, be it anatomy... what even are necks :thinking:\nThe music was OK, I guess? I kept it very low because I wanted to put my own. The only memorable track is what seems to be Yuri's theme, as it's as buttery and cheesy as he is. The dub was very good, I mostly had issues with some of Hobin's lines (could hear the echo from the studio) and the voicelines after an ending (really quiet).\n\nThe high school setting was painful to read through, as it provided a cheap villain in otomes: a bunch of obsessed fangirls who harrass/kidnap/hurt MC because she is close to hot guys.

He's a bit more deep than just a flirt, which made me warm up to him fast. Loved the bad ending in which [spoiler]he leaves to become a prostitute LOL[/spoiler]. MC learns a valuable lesson in this rote: how to brush her own hair!\n    [*]Tei's nickname is [i]momma[/i] as he basically is the glue that keeps the household a functioning one, on top of having a part time job, on top of being a yandere. IDK I was expecting more from him but nothing in his route really scared me... the setting is high school so you can imagine how deep the abuse can go. BL games spoilt me rotten, some [spoiler]spiked tea[/spoiler] is nothing tragic especially when in the good end [spoiler]he repents and doesn't need to hurt MC anymore[/spoiler]. \n    [*]Red's raison d'\u00eatre is being a super hero, and he's cutely dumb and energetic. Maybe it's because I come from Amnesia and Ozmafia, but [spoiler]I'm sick and tired of amnesia being used as plot device. Didn't fully enjoy his route because of it[/spoiler]. Long route full of misunderstandings and suprise bad endings.\n [*]The secret character appears in the endings of all the boys, and starts popping up during the routes of Tei and Red. [spoiler]I made the mistake of naming him Dolly, my first teddy's name. His character design insults my eyes and his two secret endings are predictable, long and made me feel annoyed at his shallowness, which I guess is not the intended outcome. But the fact that [i]they're just dolls[/i] and the message is [i]don't forget old toys[/i] is really not worth my 30 hours investment, especially when my romances with the other guys vanished in thin air like that[/spoiler].\n[*] I wish there was a route for Soi and Shinbi, as they're great friends and Soi positively impressed me [spoiler]in Tei's route. Hoes before bros! QUEEN[/spoiler]. Yujin felt very... shocking for the sake of it. Zion and Hobin were ok.\n[/list]\nMC was not as terrible as I expected; she had a good troll face, could [i]selectively[/i] snap back and had a life. Also, she didn't have amnesia [spoiler]mostly[/spoiler] and had social awareness! But the game downplays the romances for the sake of the overarching plot, which is really not that great. It's almost like they forcibly stuck to the theme and sabotaged themselves in the process.\n\nThere's a lot of criticism in this review despite the thumbs up because ultimately I found it entertaning.

This ??? keeps distarcting me from the story with a fairly high frequency. It feels like I've been cheated by the game(also the boys will feel the same, I suppose), not only emotionaly but also physically (my money, let's be real this game is REALLY not cheap). \n\n-\"Be pretty for me.\"\"You don't know that I've been watching you all the time?\"\"I will lock her up.(or something similar)\"\"I don't like that (when MC is busy talking to her friends)\"etc. I mean, really? Leave me alone.\n\n-I think half of the game is just advertesiment.\n\n-The personality of the charactor changes too fast to a point that it is not realistic. I mean, who can solve a life problem just by chatting with someone with several lines? Yeah maybe she is someone he likes but unless something meaningful/symbolic happens to him for him to realize the problem and fix it HIMSELF or with others' help, I can't see otherwise.\n\n-About the main charactor(MC), I understand how she feels about losing her grandfather(thust me, I really do), but it is not like the world is going to make things easier for you just because of that. Normally you will overcome the tragic lose and continue moving on with your life without being pathetic evey time you think about it or recieving overloaded sympathy from others (I don't think she is pathetic but this game just put her in that way. I don't even).\n\n-Again, the MC...I don't quite know how to put this into words..she never(or at least very rarely) says things straight forward. She tends to be ambiguous and let others misunderstanding. You can't really expect any progress/satisfaction from her. Sometimes I feel very impatient by reading the conversations she has with others. In addition, the crush she has on the boy appears too early, I don't even see why/how she likes him at that point.\n\n-Last but not least, BUGS. I was thinking about reporting them but there are too many: \n1.  MC's head portrait is wrongly changed sometimes (eg: The MC was in in her normal clothes in the last textbox, in the next one she is in her school uniform magically, and then in the further one she changes back to her normal clothes again).\n2. Mc's name is not showing correctly in the name bar sometimes-it is showing a code instead.\n3. Typos.\n4. Sometimes when you load, there is no respond no matter how long you wait. You need to quit Steam completely and try again.\n\nIn conclusoion I feel nothing good/worth to remember (Ironically it is thw title is \"The one thing you must recall\") towards this game.

There are no god forsaken stat building in Nameless like in Dandelion. \n\nPros:\n1. Unlike Dandelion there is an in depth story rather than the majority of it being stat building like in Dandelion.\n2. I guess the artwork is good. I definitely cannot draw this well, but when Yuri closes his eyes...what the heck is that?!\n3. I am not sure IF it is a better story or not. There is MORE story, which is good, but I feel less silliness in dandelion...if you can believe that. I am not sure if that is really accurate though, if Dandelion had more story, would it be as silly?! Who knows? They are both pretty silly if you think about it. \n4. I like how they kept up the mystery of the nameless doll the MC had forgotten about until the end. \n5. Funny moments...[spoiler] Yuri is funny in that he is an extreme flirt to the point that even though he is a teacher he has no shame in flirting anyway. So, yeah, that was sort of funny. Lance does the play with Red in the good end of his route. Red being all jealous in thinking the MC liked someone else was sort of cute and funny when he splutters nonsense for a second and everyone thinks he has the hots for another guy. \"sigh\" Yeah as far as I remember these were the only moments that stood out. [/spoiler]\n6. You have dialogue options...unfortunately not many as several other otome games I played. =/\n\nCons:\n1. I often feel like this story was written by a 12-year-old (actually I felt that way about Dandelion too, but stat building hides it better). Some of the concepts are so ridiculous, but I suppose it is entertainingly funny in how some of the concepts are so ridiculous. [spoiler] I cannot, nor will not, ever enjoy the idea that a. dolls came to life. b. become nicknamed the hot5. c. apparently so \"breathtakingly gorgeous\" the MC can barely talk to them without all the other girls wanting to threaten her for being so lucky to hang out with them. \"gag!\" I think with all this combined I had often sat there wondering about my own life choices in playing this game, as well as wonder if the MC, in truth, has mental issues. I do not say this to make fun of those that truly have issues, but I have a hard time understanding how I can relate to these fictional people to real people. All the girls at the school freak out when they see these characters. You might as well put a cow bell around their necks and imagine them as dogs drooling over their loved ones. I have never seen girls act so shameless and pathetic in real life. Especially not so many girls all at once comprising an entire school. Since people DO NOT NORMALLY ACT THIS WAY...I wonder if the MC is just imagining seeing these dolls alive and human. Yeah, I am sorry for this rant, but this was hard to choke down. They need to step up with better conflict than this headache.  [/spoiler]\n\n2. The end is abrupt I suppose it was meant that way. [spoiler] The MC wins the love of her chosen doll and the wizard takes her to another alternate reality so she can try to win another piece aka another doll's love of these five. They all get together for the finale - all the dolls remember loving and giving their love to the MC, but apparently, none remember not having her love in the other routes. My guess? There are alternate non-loved dolls that just disappear to who knows where. If it sounds weird. It kind of is. Sorry, this is pretty much how this story goes. [/spoiler]\n\n3. The MC is not totally bad as far as some go for otome games (whyyyy??! do they do this???!), but so far the MC from dandelion is actually the best. \n\n4. I hate that one character that keeps calling the MC 'master'. What kind of weird fantasies do these writers think normal people like?! Okay, okay. I get it is his character and that the MC is apparently owner of the dolls and that is where it is coming from...but gees. I dunno. \n\n5. These dolls all have personal issues, but resolving those issues with the thing they needed (learning to trust, learning to love, being honest, etc.,) seem to fall short.  I ask myself...did they really resolve them? I think it falls short because they combined the MC earning their love at the SAME time as these characters resolving their personal issues. As a result, it sort of downplays how they actually and truly resolve their issues.  Future reference: save the acknowledgement of love for a bit later in the story instead of rushing it at the same time these characters overcome their personal issues. \n\n6. The whole point of the story? [spoiler] Some dolls have souls (or all of them? This was never clear) and they are important so you should not forget them and remember to love them or they might get upset and have issues. I suppose as a side note there is a wizard who needs memories to retain his powers, but this time the wizard stands in the background in comparison to Dandelion. This is the w h o l e point of this story. [/spoiler]\n\n7. Dialogue options are few and the few choices you have can so easily lead to a terrible end or a boring bad end. The terrible ends are not so bad per say, but the boring ones end so abruptly and with little explanation. They might as well, in those ends, immediately bring up the \"bad end\" sign and add a \"you suck\" to it. \n\nI guess I could go on, but getting tired of writing. I just hope I wrote this well enough to make an honest review. I do not hate this game, but I do not love it.

The \"shocking\" and \"dark\" storyline doesn't even compare to the stuff you'd see on Netflix, so I'm confused about why people think it's so intense.\nI guess for me the big disappointment was that unlike in Mystic Messenger, where the characters are rational adults, here you play exactly what you're given: a meek highschooler.

I've honestly never felt so moved and emotional by a game before. I fell in love with all of the characters, especially the five main boys.

This game helped me when I was feeling lonely or sad, it cheered me up and put love in my heart and a smile on my face, and it felt like I was there in the game, and I could escape with romantic cute boys for a while~ This game also shouldn't be taken that lightly, yes, it looks like a very cute and romantic VN, and it is, but be careful of some of the bad endings, I swear they are nightmare fuel. some of the bad endings contain violence, and extreme obsession so if you are sensitive to that, I'd recommend you stay away from the bad endings and follow the guide for the good ending. Though just remember the bad endings also contibute to the storyline as well, so you should play every ending possible. To be more specific, the violence and extreme obsession is really only showed in Tei's and Yeon-ho's routes (which were personally my favourite because that's what I enjoy) and the rest are pretty much just adorable. The route for \"???\" made me cry a waterfall, and I'm not going to say more cause I don't want to spoil anything. I can't express enough how much I recommend this game, it's worth every penny.

My grasp on the English language is very limited, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ll try my best to express how much this visual novel means to me.\n\nThis game will break your heart. It will break you in pieces, make you cry, and make you wish that things could\u2019ve been different. But it will also make you smile, it will take all your broken pieces and put them together. This is without a doubt, one of the best visual novels I\u2019ve ever played. The story is somewhat similar to Dandelion, but \u201cdarker\u201d and most fitting to my personal taste. There\u2019s a lot of touchy subjects such as fear of being abandoned/replaced, physical/mental abuse, obsession, etc. But nothing here is just thrown in the air, everything has an explanation, and you actually feel bad for the characters. \n\nMy favorite route was Tei\u2019s. My heart really ached for him, and I cried. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve cried because of an otome visual novel, but his past is just too much to handle.

Its depth and complexity took me by surprise, romance aside the plot is not at all what is expected and very well done. Emotive and full of heart, the core messages of this game are beautiful. I could go on and on and on but, the short version is simply that this game is truly beautiful. \n\nWriting aside, the art is really nice, the voice acting adds a lot to the game (yes, even though it's in Korean) and as mentioned by many other players, there are typos, but they are sparse and don't really take away from the game. It's well scored; music, art and writing working together to create a story that will undoubtedly surprise you.\n\n The characters all feel (ironically) quite human, and for the first time in any otome-type game I enjoyed every single character route immensely. The best part, the crowning achievement of Nameless for me, is the way the character arcs were handled. Every character had their flaws, and these flaws were not ignored or brushed over, or highlighted yet left unconfronted, or worse, glorified (EG AMNESIA). They were handled exceptionally well. Everyone deserves to be loved. Certain characters rang alarm bells for me after bad experiences with previous otome games but nothing was as it seemed. Whoops, I said I wouldn't ramble so I'll wrap it up.\n\nThis is an otome game, and thusly it is definitely directed at women but honestly, I would reccomend this game to any fan of visual novels or interactive stories, regardless of gender or sexual preference. You'll get more out of it if you like romance games, of course, but all round it's a lovingly crafted story about so much more than love.

Not a common case, right? Most otome-games are published for PS Vita, so Cheritz immediately got my loyalty.\nOne of the strongest points of this game is its setting. Have you ever pitied your old abandoned toys when you started to grow up? Have you ever thought that virtual persons (dolls, fiction characters, idols of all sorts) are more reliable and safe for close relationships than real people? Have you thought that those abandoned by us still remember everything? The game will give you time to think over this stuff.\n'Nameless' protagonist has her precious ball-joint dolls suddenly turned into people. Every doll has its initial program, the number of features created by a puppet-maker. When turned into human every doll is doomed to strong character development. It's quite interesting to watch how the circumstances make everyone widen their horizon. \nSo, the obvious pros of the game are:\n- Interesting setting.\n- Visible character development.\n- Strong protagonist. Eri is not a typical otome heroine, what a relief. \n- Interesting characters. BTW, the cast has two yanderes. It's up to you if you like it or not but they are well written. Side characters are also attractive. \n- Tons of various bad endings. \n- Beautiful artwork. There are many CGs, rather detailed and nice. The art is much better than you find in average otome game. The backgrounds are rather poor though. The characters are animated. \n- All routes are connected with a common plot. In the end you will unlock a heartrending story of a secret character. \n- Gorgeous voice acting. \n- The price is rather affordable. \n\nTalking of cons...\n- I'd say that the group interaction is rather poor. Well, Tei doesn't get along with Yuri and Lance dislikes Red... It could be more complicated. It could be better. \n- Sometimes it's all too melodramatic but we're talking about South Korea here. Wouldn't expect less from a country that makes doramas =) \n\nAll in all, 'Nameless' is incredible. It's a high-quality otome game with interesting setting and captivating characters.

There are two characters with yandere-like tendencies hiding amongst a cute 'little brother', a caring 'big brother', an aloof ice prince, a playful 'best friend', and a careless playboy. \n\nRomances: The priority is on the emotional connection you build. This is interesting because as your dolls they already \"like\" you, but this is more or less a shallow reflection of what they think you want to see.

That pretty much sums the game up without revealing too much. It also has fantasy elements to it, but the game is much more than that. The plot is interesting enough with just the mystery, fantasy and romance itself. However, the story is much deeper than that. It deals with issues that anyone of us could have, has had or might be having right now. That is what makes things game impactful. It might make you think. It might make you laugh. It might make you uncomfortable. And it might make you cry. But it's all worth it, when you finally finish that last ending.\n\nOthers have noted the same thing that I'm about to say now; even if one of them wasn't your type, most likely you'll like them all at the end. They're a nice set of characters fit for different tastes. All of them grow so much mentally and yet they still can keep that one thing that first drew me to them. They all have issues and they overcome them, not just the romanceable characters but also the heroine herself. The side characters were awesome too, so even if your chosen bishie isn't on the screen, you're most likely to enjoy your time anyway.\n\nWhile I do like the art, it's not the prettiest one I've seen. Game graphics and art are what first draw me to a game. This game's art is indeed really nice, but CGs looked a bit... awkward at some points. But I'm picky when it comes to game art, so don't let it push you away from this game. It still looks really nice.\n\nVoice acting was great. Really great. I don't understand Korean, so when one word ends and another begins put me off a bit at first. Especially if I'm trying to hear whether the voice ended or just pausing for an effect. But for me, who always keeps voices on (even the annoying ones), it's part of the appeal.\n\nNow, that one minus part. This game has quite a few typos. It's not noticeable all the time, but you might laugh at a bit inappropriate time. But consindering it's only a one minus part, I learned to ignore it.\n\nWith only that one minus part, I can definitely recommend the game. The story is deep on the long run, the characters (hopefully) can stir your heart and it leaves an impression on you. The price might be a bit high, but there's always a game that costs even more. I got in on a sale but I saved only a few euros, so it doesn't make much difference. The game is worth the money.

I first became interested in Nameless after playing Mystic Messenger and experiencing how much care, detail, and extensive work Chertiz put into a free mobile app. I thought, surely since they put this much content and love into an app, their Steam games are worth looking into.\n\nThough the $30 price tag may deter many from bothering to pick this game up, I can assure you it's worth every penny and urge you to reconsider.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Incredibly well written and complex (though not confusing) plot\n[*]Well developed and written characters, even side characters (such as Mr. Yujin and Zion)\n[*]Beautiful and expansive soundtrack\n[*]High quality opening music video for the beginning of the game and ending music videos for each good ending and secret ending\n[*]Fully voiced cast - from everything to side characters, flashbacks, nameless classmates, etc\n[*]6 extensive routes, each with at least 3 bad endings and 5 CGs\n[*]Bonuses that include diary entries expanding on characters thoughts during the game and clips of the voice actors talking about their work on the game\n[*]Lots of content - a guaranteed 30+ hours of gameplay to complete all routes, collect all the bonus content, and finish the story\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Occasional typos or missing words (though not nearly as bad as I've seen for other VNs) - very rarely would it ruin the immersion of the game for me, but I could see how it could be frustring, especially during climatic and emotional scenes\n[*]While a great, well written story, there were some route endings and the final ending itself that left me really aching for more. The final ending was conslusive, but I would have like to see an after ending for even that. Perhaps that's just me being greedy for more of Cheritz's writing, however.\n[*]I felt as though the MC herself was given the short end of the stick when it came to character development and dialogue. Though this is a common thing to do in otome games (airhead, flustered, clumsy girl), Nameless' MC plays such an important role for the overarching story that I felt she should have been given more consideration and development when making the game\n[/list]\n\nOverall, I 100% recommend Namless ~The one thing you must recall~ to anyone looking for a high quality and doki doki inducing otome game with a deep and intriguing plot most dating sims don't bother with.

I thought this game would be worse than MM, actually, since MM is their newest project, but this is at least just as good. (It's hard for me to say better because MM is close to my heart, but Nameless is just as close at this point.)  Using a traditional visual novel format gives Cheritz a lot of room to work, and they make the absolute best use of it.\n\nA lot of people are saying \"this is not your average visual novel, there's an overarching plot,\" and I just want to emphasize this 100%. I've been playing VNs for years, and I've never played one like this. While each individual route is fantastic, the air of mystery behind all of them really motivates you to play, and this game is magnificently creepy at times. I don't want to spoil anything, but the way this story is done is such a creative and effective use of the visual novel format that I was completely blown away. The overarching story here is a lot deeper than in MM, and it is fantastically executed.\n\nOn the whole ball-jointed doll concept: I honestly thought it was the most ridiculous fantasy in the world, but the story is [i]better[/i] for it. Like, it's not a weird thing you overlook because the game is so good; it [i]makes[/i] the game good. A lot of the things that are utterly unique about the characterizations and the overall story would simply not be possible if not for the fact that they're ball-jointed dolls.\n\nCharacters and individual routes are amazing. Of course, as with all games, some are better than others (I personally found Yuri's to be the blandest, though I did enjoy his), but even the ones where you're not interested because you want to marry the character or something are still page-turners. The characters are all subversions of standard character types: the kuudere, the shota, the ladykiller, the gentle mom-type, the silly boyish type (I recognize the last one isn't a standard type, but please work with me), and as you delve deeper into their true characters, you start needing to realize why they are the way they are. It's really well-executed; only once does their reasoning behind characterization seem to fall flat, but you let it go because the characterization is just that interesting. \n\nSpeaking of individual routes, by the way, I heavily advise you stick to the order the game wants you play the routes in: Lance > Yuri or Yeonho > Tei > Red. Lance is honestly one of my favorite routes and I don't really like to tell you to play it first, but in terms of mystery, Lance's route really reveals nothing. It's just a very good route. Also, make sure to play with the Steam Guide and get every bad end. They're super creepy and super enjoyable, and they also reveal stuff about the overarching plot.\n\nOn the technical aspect: amazing voice acting and you can look at the character art for yourself. As well as that, the main character is really sweet and not a pushover. Even if she's a little slow at times, she's cute and nice so it's okay. The rest of the side characters also have really strong personalities, and the minigames are pretty easy.\n\nI know the price is pretty steep, but I assure you that if you can pay it, it's worth it.

But with this game it has a nice mechanic that when you start the game, you kind of get to choose who you want to pursue. You have the choice of picking the Lance, Yeon-Ho, Yuri route (which begins with the same first few chapters despite small difference depending on the choices you choose, and then branching off with the guy you have the highest affection with.) and then you have the option for Tei and Red's route - which starts off completely different and the whole game plays out with your character pursing that one from the start. It's a similar mechanic to the Norn9 stuff, and it's up to preference. I know a lot of people like playing the game blind and then depending on the character's looks/personality/traits etc. they decide who they want to go for in the moment, but me, being a lazy person, I usually just pull up a walkthrough and go through it without much thought. \nSo I personally don't find that mechanic to be bad, but it's up to you.\n\nNow, for the actual review!!\n\nNameless has a solid story that addresses many deeper topics such as abuse, abandonment, and loss. It handles these topics quite nicely, and leaves you with a better understanding of said topics.\nIt's not as 'metophoric' as some other games, but I personally think it's better because it really hits home how these situations affect others and even yourself. \n\nTo be bluntly honest, at around my second/third route I was beginning to get a little irritated with a few things, but the two secret endings overshadowed any of that left me in tears, which I think is enough.\n\nPros\n\n- At first, each character seems to fit into each different archtype (cold silent type, loli, big brother, romatic, etc...) which seemed kind of lazy to me, but once you go down the paths you can see how much personality they actually have.\n\n- The art is pleasing to the eye, and the character designs are unique and lovely.\n\n- The story puts you on an emotional roller coaster. You will be laughing and having a grand old time one minute, and then crying the next.\n\n- Each character is different. They have different flaws and different likes/dislikes. No character is 'perfect' which leaves them feeling human.\n\n- In my case, I actually felt jealous and a little upset depending on different factors, which is another way that the game plays with your emotions - keeping you constantly enthralled in the story.\n\n- The voice acting, especially for ??? is some of the best I've heard. Whenever ??? speaks I feel like I am feeling exactly what he is. The anguish, the sorrow, the anger... It is all perfectly conveyed through the voice actor. \n\nCons\n\n- The protagonist, Eri, is a little 'too' innocent for me. Problems with simple solutions can take her chapters to fix. She always seems clueless and that kind of took me out of the story. In most situations she is fine and relateable, but in others I would find myself hitting my head against my desk because she was too innocent. (Incoming rant) I have dealt with clueless/innocent characters before, but they were different. Cardia (from Code: Realize) spent her entire life locked up in a mansion, so when she finally leaves it she doesn't know much of anything. The story made it so that there was a reason why she didn't know much of anything, so that kept it from being annoying. Another example is the Heroine from Amnesia Memories - she starts off the game with Amnesia so she doesn't know anything. Meanwhile, in Nameless, even though at some points Eri does experience amnesia, from the start she is very innocent without much reason to be. This might not be a problem for everyone, but it was just annoying for me. You don't notice it all the time, but when it did happen it was aggrivating. \n\n- Like many different VNs translated to English, there are typos. Now, I've kind of grown used to this after years of playing different Visual Novels, so it doesn't bother me too much. It's not too often and even if it does break imersion for a few moments you can still understand what is going on.\n\n\nAll and all, I think this is a great Visual Novel for anyone who likes Otome or Cheritz. So if you have a passion for Visual Novels I really think you'll like it. A unique story, fun characters, great music and voice acting...

My only complaint is that the female protagonist can be a bit cringey at times with how \"slow\" she is (as the boys put it), but it was easy to get over. All of the boys have very different personalities from each other which makes every route interesting. Personally, Red's route was my favorite. The prologue can seem long and the common routes (Yuri, Yeonho, Lance) can be a bit tedious in the beginning, but they're well worth it. I played in the order of Yuri - Lance - Yeonho - Tei - Red; I believe this order will allow for you to unveil parts of the story more naturally, and I think I had a fantastic experience by following this order.

That being said, I'd like to give a small round of applause for Cheritz' brilliant move of having a character from Dandelion (one of their other Otome games), be integral to Nameless' plot. The MC, Eri, is also quite relatable. She's quirky, sassy and down to earth, making for some hilarious moments. \n\nThe art and music are very soothing to look at and listen to, with purplish hues and tones adding to the atmosphere. The graphics and interface are great, and the localization is also well done, with proper English grammar and spelling mostly consistent throughout the game. The plot itself is intriguing and mysteriously sinister, with dark themes scattered throughout. Don't expect this to be a light-hearted read; interacting with the boys and learning about the true plot behind the scenes, you may very well end up shedding a tear or two. \n\nThat being said, there ARE trigger warnings, such as abuse and abandonment.

Le prix peut \u00eatre g\u00eanant pour certains mais sachez que la somme que vous mettrez sera tout simplement bien investie :D Mais si ce jeu fait partie de votre biblioth\u00e8que je vous garantie que  c\u2019est un ticket direct pour Feeladelphia !\n", "timestamp_created": 1467547236, "timestamp_updated": 1467547236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24018646": {"recommendationid": "24018646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046223007", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468343110}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Welcome, princess.

Later I found out that they had it release on steam, so I thought, ah what the hell, might as well. Since I suspect Cheritz was merely promoting their games, I kinda doubt they had added any extra content to it. And I was right. Not that its a bad thing.\n \nArtwork: 9/10\nSo I played through the game like normal, from Lance to the 'first doll you received'. First things first though. Lemme just squeel on the beautiful artwork. I mean, how could you not!? I'm talking about BEAUTIFUL. I'd rush to the nearest store if I ever find out they are selling Nameless posters and wallpaper. So there you go, superbly beautiful artwork.\n\nStory: 3.5/10\nWell, about this part, I have to say that it was kind of a let down. For almost half of the time, I think I nearly slept through some of the characters path (I'm looking at you, Red and Yeon Ho). And the main character's awfully bland personality didn't help spice up the story either. I mean sure, you got beautiful drawn characters and CG, but at the end of the day, its the story that counts. Look at Higurashi, Umineko and erm, Touhou? They both had crap artwork, but at the very least, story was fascinating enough for people to overlook that 'art'.\n\nSoundtrack: 6/10\nThe soundtrack was comforting and relaxing, too bad the music is not my kind of taste. Still, I know beautiful music when I hear one, so hats off to Shinjou Hanabi for creating music that matched the game's atmosphere and 'school' theme.\n\nCharacter: 5/10\nI wasn't expecting much the moment I saw the female MC. At that instant I knew she is definitely going to be bland. Boy I was right. Not to mention she was SUPER DUPER dense. Holy Jesus and blessed Mary. I can't count the number of times I was screaming at the screen yelling \"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU SENPAI NOTICED YOU STOP PLAYING DUMB\". Being dense makes the situation hilarious, but TOO dense is the ultimate (okay, maybe not ultimate, but close enough) recipe for character disaster. Its a huge relieft to find out at least the boys have unique personalities from kuu-tsundere clingy playboy yandere naive yangire (I think?). Gotta admit that even Soi's dramatic comments made me laugh more than the boys did. Seriously, that's even the reason why the ratings are like bare-minimum pass.\n\nTranslation: 8/10\nI've certainly seen better translated games in my life, but that's not to say Nameless isn't good. In fact I think they did a good job translating it, with a few minor hiccups here and there which can easily be overlooked since its mainly grammar problems. Language is easy to grasp so I doubt anyone would have even a single problem understanding any of the scripts.\n\nOverall: 6/10\nSince its only my opinion and I'm a little extremely biased AGAINST bland female MC, so there might be prejudice here and there. However, if you don't mind the female MC being of plain character, then you might enjoy the game more than I did.

This is one of the most funniest otome games I have ever played in a while. Every character in this game is very well voice acted and I feel easily attached to each one of them. I seriouesly would love to be BFFs with Soi. There is never a moment in this game where I feel bored. The artwork is beautiful and the story is interesting so far. There is  this huge mystery that you are trying to solve while going through each route pursing all the love interests which makes you want to keep playing to figure out WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON! From the other reviews that I read I do not understand why some people find this game to be difficult. So far I have only gotten 2 bad endings and one of them I did on purpose lol.  Compared to Amensia Memories this game is a freaking cake walk. So far my only main complaint is the ton of spelling and grammer mistakes.\n\n\nPros;\n-Beautiful art work\n-A mystery plot mixed in with the various romance plot lines\n-Serious issues dealing with loneliness in plot lines\n-Great voice acting \n-Humour\n-The boys are good looking which is super important for me \n-Well balanced difficulty\n-Music \n\nCons\n-Spelling and grammer mistakes\n-contains yanderes  )this can be good or bad depending on you) \n-sometimes the writing at times is repetitive like, for example = *He is strange.

I must say that thus far, this is the best one in terms of character development, individual character stories, and overarching plot. Each playthrough of a route gives the game a different feeling while still reminding you of the overall undertone. One tip that I must mention is that after you finish a character, start a new game. I am one of those people who usually start from where the common route branches (because I keep a save from that point), but you will experience the story more fully if you play from the start again; even if you have to skip the already read text.\n\nAlso, a big recommendation would be to play the characters in the suggested route order (and of course to play all the characters). The order is as follows: Lance, Yeonho, Yuri, Tei, and then Red. It is already suggested in the way that the routes are locked anyway, but I highly recommend it.\n\nNameless is really fantastic! I would say that the game is near perfect. The reason I say \u2018near\u2019 is because the downfall to Nameless is its translation/proofreading. As I played, I saw quite a few typos or slight grammatical errors. It\u2019s a bit disappointing to see that they had people proofread the translations but they had still missed so many errors. It\u2019s a bit distracting, but overall, I would say that it doesn\u2019t take away from the story at all. \n\nAll in all, I would say that if you are a otoge fan (or are interested in it), this is a must-read.

I personally love how each storyline intertwines with others, and has influences on other characters you aren't with.  The world feels solid and real, and not like a random mess of stories. \nGame Mechanics: Doesn't have any of the junk tactics used in mobile (Ie: nothing based on luck or ingame purchases).  There are also aren't any \"plan your day\" activities, which I also find annoying.  It would be nice to have some sort of guide for players who just start the game, as it was intially confusing for me.\nCharacter Development:  All of the characters seem to have distinct personalities, although Tei and Yeonho blend a bit to me.\nSound & Voice Acting:  Done incredibly well.  Yuri and Lance's voice in particular fit very well.\nArt:  The character designs are solid.  My initial gripe with the art is that the boys do not look incredibly similar to their doll counterparts.  Especially for me, Yeonho hardly looks the same, except from one angle ingame that is hardly used.

Non mi metter\u00f2 a parlare della trama: mi limito a dire che \u00e8 abbastanza interessante da lasciarsi seguire tranquillamente fino alla fine. Come in tutte le opere coreane che si rispettino, ci sono dosi uguali di tutto: momenti allegri, malinconici, drammatici o anche inquietanti riescono a rendere la storia molto ricca. Ci sono degli stereotipi evidenti sparsi qua e l\u00e0 e questo sicuramente \u00e8 un punto a sfavore, ma ci\u00f2 non mi ha impedito di godermi la visual novel per quello che \u00e8.\nSconsiglio caldamente l'acquisto a chiunque non ami leggere o non ami la scarsa interazione nel corso del gioco; in questa visual novel le parti di sola narrazione possono arrivare ad essere davvero molto lunghe e qua e l\u00e0 ci sono interi capitoli dove non \u00e8 possibile effettuare neanche una scelta. I momenti in cui ci si ritrova davanti a un bivio sono estremamente pochi, quindi \u00e8 l'ideale per chi preferisce assaporare una bella trama e non essere tartassato di scelte da prendere.\n\nCi sono cinque ragazzi da conquistare in questo gioco, ma non \u00e8 possibile scegliere a piacere il percorso da seguire.\nLe bambole sono Lance, Yeonho, Yuri, Tei e Red, pi\u00f9 una sesta storia che si potr\u00e0 sbloccare solo una volta completate le prime cinque. All'inizio del gioco si potr\u00e0 scegliere solo un ragazzo tra Lance, Yeonho e Yuri; dopo aver completato questi tre si sblocca la storia di Tei, poi quella di Red e infine quella di ???. All'inizio questa struttura non mi andava a genio, perch\u00e9 preferisco scegliere da sola l'ordine in cui completare le storie, ma andando avanti mi sono resa conto che c'\u00e8 un motivo di fondo legato alla trama che impone questa struttura, quindi ho finito per accettarlo.\n\nHo trovato tutti i personaggi molto carini e anche le voci (doppiaggio coreano) a mio parere sono azzeccate. La traduzione in inglese non \u00e8 delle migliori - ci sono tempi verbali che passano a intermittenza dal presente al passato, errori di punteggiatura e di ortografia, eccetera - ma \u00e8 quello che basta per potersi godere il gioco. Anche i character design sono molto belli, probabilmente basati sulle bambole originali della Crobidoll (infatti ogni personaggio di Nameless, fatta eccezione per la protagonista, \u00e8 una bambola esistente). Non mi hanno fatto impazzire le immagini CG, dove secondo me i personaggi maschili sembrano assomigliarsi troppo tra loro e a volte mi sono parsi del tutto inespressivi, ma nel complesso non sono male.\n\nPer quanto riguarda la difficolt\u00e0... beh, l'ho trovato incredibilmente facile. Tenendo a mente che i ragazzi vanno conquistati e non allontanati, le scelte da prendere sono estremamente semplici: in genere la decisione giusta da prendere per andare verso il lieto fine \u00e8 ovvia, mentre se si sceglie l'alternativa sbagliata non bisogna fare altro che ricaricare l'ultimo salvataggio. Non ci sono statistiche o altro, quindi \u00e8 sufficiente individuare il percorso giusto e arrivare al finale diventa una passeggiata.\n\nConsiglio questo gioco a chiunque apprezzi le storie romantiche con una buona dose di dramma.", "timestamp_created": 1463408212, "timestamp_updated": 1463408212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22946295": {"recommendationid": "22946295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046327948", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463101682}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a fan of these type of game and I didn't get into it at all.

This game was released shortly after. For a new company, they have done excellently on both games. I have yet to pay Dandelion but I plan to in the upcoming future. As for this game, it already has so many noticeable improvements in such a short period of time. Before playing this game, I do recommend playing Dandelion since I feel like the games are somehow connected. Both even feature the \"Wizard.\" That won't be much of a spoiler. Anyway, this game doesn't have many features as it does in Dandelion, but for me that is a good thing. You go along with the story easily, listening to mostly just dialogue. The artwork is wonderful, the story is so well put together. I love how every guy's path connects with one another. It's so wonderfully pieced together that I can say that I am definitely impressed. Your choices mean everything, but luckily there is a walk through to help you earn every ending, good and bad. Trust me when I say that you will want the bad endings as well. However, some of the characters are a little too similar. Like Yeonho, Tei, and ???. I just find their characters all to be quite alike with a few differences. Still, I love the game. I plan to replay it again just for the fun of it. As this is Cheritz second game, I can't wait to see what will be to come in the future. They're already working on a new game called \"Mystic Messenger\" which will be released to mobile devices making it their first mobile game. You can find out more about it on their official website, they already released a video of it as well as the game's system. The release date still hasn't been released for any specific day, but it was postponed to sometime this June. \n\nDLC's for this game include the Black & White Christmas along with a few others. The B&W Christmas DLC is something that I recommend to purchase as it let's you continue the story even after the ending. The other DLC's are just for fun to listen to, but B&W Christmas is the only one that really relates to the game itself.\n\nIf you're a fan of otome games, or if you want to get into otome games, I definitely would try out both of Cheritz games as they are definitely a trustworthy company. You get what you pay for when you purchase one of their games. I will admit that there are a few typos in the translations, sometimes the servers will be down, or sometimes the game will freeze (as I said, this is only their second game so they still have to improve on a lot.) but other than that there's really no reason you shouldn't give this game a chance.

It's good and worth getting, but don't expect it to be like Dandelion. \n\nAs similar as the two games are, they are also quite different. The stat leveling was a fun grind in Dandelion, and at first I was bored with Nameless because actual gameplay/choices don't really affect or change anything in the game.

I love the opening theme of Dandelion and it gets stuck in my head, but none of the other songs really stood out. Nameless? The vocal songs I wasn't really a fan of, but everything else? Beautiful! \n\nThe main thing I do dislike about Nameless is that the female lead character doesn't have a voice or clear identity like in Dandelion. Sometimes I would have trouble distinguishing if she was having a thought/narration or actually talking and interacting with another character. I also just think giving her a voice gives her more character. Another gripe I have about the female lead is that it really isn't her fault that she's slow sometimes or a tool of the game's circumstances to move the plot or make a situation work.

Sobre todo, aprecio que se hayan salido del molde personajes de forma completamente inesperada. Adem\u00e1s, los personajes secundarios me han parecido influyentes, agradables y muy, muy bien llevados.\n\nEl argumento: Maravilloso. Ha habido rutas m\u00e1s adorables, las ha habido intrigantes, las ha habido tristes, y todas y cada una de ellas han estado bien llevadas de inicio a fin. No s\u00f3lo eso: transmiten de forma efectiva un mensaje precioso y necesario.\n\nLa protagonista: muy, muy bien llevada. Bravo. Es una protagonista que no se inclina ni al extremo pasivo (hablo cansada de todas esas protagonistas que dejan que les hagan lo que sea sin responder, que simplemente se dedican a ser adorables y quedarse plantadas, dependiendo \u00fanicamente de lo que haga su inter\u00e9s rom\u00e1ntico para seguir viviendo), ni al excesivamente activo (protagonistas demasiado \"geniales\" como para resultar cre\u00edbles, en mi opini\u00f3n). Est\u00e1 claro que a veces es un poco lenta en el terreno sentimental, y sin duda se equivoca en ocasiones (por ejemplo, en la ruta de Tei no me gust\u00f3 nada como actu\u00f3, pero puedo comprenderla) y que tiene otros problemas m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de su relaci\u00f3n con X, y eso es algo que realmente aprecio.\n\nLas voces: personalmente me ha costado acostumbrarme a ellas. Estoy acostumbrada al doblaje japon\u00e9s, y esas voces novedosas y... \u00bftal vez m\u00e1s graves de lo esperado? Me chocaron enormemente al principio. Adem\u00e1s, el idioma me resultaba extra\u00f1o tambi\u00e9n, lo cual no me ayudaba a sentirme c\u00f3moda con la actuaci\u00f3n de voz. Pero ha llegado un punto en el que he dejado de fruncir el ce\u00f1o cuando hablaban y me he ido enamorando gradualmente de sus voces. \n\nLos finales: cada uno de ellos me ha encantado, especialmente los finales malos me han parecido fant\u00e1sticos.

Ever since she was little, her grandfather has been taking care of her because her parents are too busy with research and are often out of the country. Eri's grandfather does his best to raise her but eventually, he passes away (about a year before the game starts). To combat her loneliness, Eri starts to collect ball-jointed-dolls of different types, talking to them as if they're really alive. It helps her deal with the sad reality that she's lost her beloved grandfather and that her parents rarely have time for her. But then one day... Eri wakes up to five strange, bickering boys in her living room -- her dolls have suddenly come alive!\n\n[i]Nameless[/i] deals with heavy themes, from abandonment and loneliness to obsession and identity. Eri herself struggles with her lonely life, but her five now-human-dolls also struggle with their own existence -- some have to deal with issues left by their previous owners, others are unsure about their own self-worth and identity. Through each doll's romance path, Eri helps her dolls deal with these issues. There are also a few bad endings that are definitely 100% creepy, occasionally violent, and very dark.\n\n[h1][b]Pros[/b][/h1]\n+ A tremendous amount of character development for both Eri and the five guys\n+ A deep & profound psychological background for all characters\n+ Fully voiced with high quality voice acting\n+ Gorgeous art and CG\n+ A mysterious, dark overarching storyline\n+ The \"game\" is aware of how far you have progressed and changes accordingly\n+ Nice soundtrack with custom songs for every doll/guy\n+ Lots of save slots and a skip option (though you won't need it often)\n+ Two close female friends who play a role in every part of the game & are very supportive of Eri!\n\n[h1][b]Cons[/b][/h1]\n- A few grammar mistakes & typos, but not many\n- In order to finish the game, you will have to play through ALL the romance routes\n- Some of the CG pieces are a tiny bit awkward proportion-wise (especially Tei's)\n- More of an actual visual novel; lots & lots of reading with not too many choices\n- Some of the bad endings might be too disturbing for some (though nothing is explicitly shown)\n\nThis is just a really, REALLY good game.

The art work in this game is amazing and of course like most visual novels they re-use quite a few backgrounds but tha is to be expected. The CGs are also beautiful, there are a few atomical errors here and there - sometimes hands or face shapes don't look just right but those are very tiny flaws that you won't even notice at a glance. \n\nPlot - The plot to this VN is interesting and I for one will never be able to look at my old Dolls the same way. Ever. That is the sort of VN that I enjoy. The story will stick with you once you close the game and it will leave enough of a lasting impression. I don't want to go into too much detail on the plot but I'll just say it's well written, well paced and the ending ties most things together. There are some small things left up in the air but those are really my personal nitpicks. (I'll leave those at the end for people who have played the game but as a spoiler. DO NOT READ IT UNLESS YOU'VE PLAYED THE ENTIRE GAME.)\n\nVoice Acting - I love VN's that are fully voiced. It just helps to emerse you in the game so much more and the VA's do such an amazing job at conveying emotion and just being plain amazing. \n\nThe Side Characters Fit - Heres something that most VA's seem to lack. Usually the M/C and her/his romantic interests are the ones that get the most screen time and the side characters are sometimes thrown in for some contrived conflict. in Namless the side characters actually matter. You can read and realize the importance of the MC's friendships and her relationships with the side characters. You see the side characters in every route and they're always important to the plot,  be it ACTUAL moral support or conflict that is surprisingly real and heartfelt.\n\nNow for the bad stuff:\n\nCONS - \n\nTranslation errors - This isn't a big deal but it's noticable enough at certain points. Sometimes the grammer of a sentence doesnt quite fit however, understanding what is being said isn't difficult it's just a bit of a concentration breaker, as well as the occational typo.\n\nA few Holes - There's a few plot holes in the game. They're not noticable at first, it's possible you won't even find them until after you've had your exsitential crisis once you've completed the entire game. However, if you're a die-hard fan like me, you'll really that these holes steal some of the luster from the story.\n\n( Couldn't find anymore cons honestly)\n\nNow, to the overall package: \n\nThe game is worth the 30 bucks and the DLC too (( Only its harder for those that don't speak Korean since there isn't exactly an easy translation for the DLC )). \n\nJust remember to keep your Dolls happy. \n\n-- \n\nThis game compared to Dandelion: \n\nLoads better, Dandelion is much too repetitive. This game actually CHANGES after you play it multiple times in each route, so this way you aren't repeating everything all over again. For one thing it keeps your attention and each change adds another layer to the story and characters and you quite simply can't help but be interested. \n\nDon't want to ramble anymore, so that's it. Have fun. \n\n\nSPOILERSSSS DON'T LOOK DOWN HERE UNLESS YOU FINISHEDDD ALL OF THE GAME\n\n[spoiler] If at the end all of the guys end up in the same world, what happens then? I mean, they all dated the Heroine and now the only one who gets her is Red, since he's the last one she dated. How does that work? Lance is suicidal, Birdie is a yandere, Yuri is.. Well he makes me the saddest, hes just a ball of angst, and Tei is just.. He's also a crazy Yandere who'll kill you just as bad as Birdie. HOW IS THIS THE HAPPY END?

Each story arc - and the completion of it all - hit me insanely hard.

It flows naturally and makes it easy to lose yourself in the sotrytelling. \n\nThe characters aren't really anything new. You have your love interest archetypes as you always do (the mature one, the flirty one, the brash one, the cute/younger one, and the cold one). Not to say that they're bad, it's just stuff that's been done before. However most of the characters are enjoyable, easily distinguished in appearance, personality, and dialogue (even the side characters). \n\nThe music... I've heard better, I've heard worse. It's no Ori of the Blind Forest but it's nice enough and it gets the job done.\n\nNone of this might sound like I'm especially enthusiastic beyong it being a nice visual novel but there was one thing so far that really stood out to me and made me love the game so quickly... the heroine.\nShe displays the typical traits (though they are less played up than a lot of other games) of being somewhat naiive, clumsy, and \"plain\". But she is also kind and so far realistic. The way she talks and reacts during the story feels natural and real and I often find myself agreeing with her or sharing her thoughts. It really helps pull you into the story that is unravelling when there's that connection. \n\nI'd definitely recommend this game for otome/visual novel lovers!", "timestamp_created": 1451311835, "timestamp_updated": 1451311835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574821", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19983130": {"recommendationid": "19983130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257033320", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461955203}, "language": "english", "review": "For some reason everytime i get to the pick your name route , after i put in my name and select the piece i want it just goes to a white screen.

It is also hard to read and try not to fall asleep because of how calm it is. \n\nIf you're looking for a game that will leave you /feels/, /cute guys/, and bitterness(? if you decided to get a bad ending) this is definitely the game for you. \nHighly recommended, 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1450947779, "timestamp_updated": 1450947779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19718121": {"recommendationid": "19718121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095100857", "num_games_owned": 905, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450209684}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a romance visual novel, sure, but through the course of this game you will have your heart ripped apart and put back together a million times. I loved this game. I can say it leaves me wanting, but for all the right reasons. I was hesitant to finish it because the last character you unlock was my least favorite personality wise. I am glad I stuck through it, though. It is so rewarding, your first impression of the guys will be, wow what a typical dating sim type of guy... but your first impressions will be wrong for pretty much all of them. The fact that there is an overarching story, that goes across all the characters, also makes it very good. Most dating sim games you simply choose who you like best and just play their route blindly. With this, you will quickly see that is not the case. \n\nI recommend this for people who want a truly touching and deep story that you will be thinking about a lot, and that you will be staying up too late to finish just one more chapter. I do not recommend this if you want a \"typical\" dating sim (like they have on mobile) where you just pick random answers that you'd never choose in real life just so you can get the ending where you bang. All the choices in this make sense once you know the characters. I got many of the good endings just by playing on instinct. I only had to use a guide to get the bad endings, because those are actually difficult to get (which is how it should be imo). Even if you choose a \"wrong\" answer occasionally, it is written into the game and does not ruin anything for you. \n\nIn the end I find it hard to call this just a dating sim. I find it hard to spend much money on anything primarily text based. I am really glad I did, however. The ONLY con if I had to pick one, is that the voice acting is Korean, but it is a Korean game, and I think english voice actors would probably ham it up and sound cartoony anyways. So although I understood almost nothing of what was spoken it was still pretty nice, and I was able to clearly distinguish one voice from another pretty quickly. The actors got really into character so when its an emotionally tough place they actually sound distressed and when they are mad they actually yell... really nice from what I can discern, I just dont speak Korean so thats the only con.

It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.\u201d \u2015 Jane Austen, [i]Pride And Prejudice[/i][/b]\n\nThis \"review\" that I will be trying to write shall be a genuine blabber gathered from my jumbled up thoughts and still strained heart, as this astonishing visual novel left me stranded and stole all and any coherent words that I may use in an alternative situation. For a girl who grew up as a wise loner with working parents and only a kindly grandmother to attend to her, [i]Nameless[/i] was a game too close to home for me.\n\nOur protagonist is a young girl named Eri - It's MC's default name, but you can give her any name that you wish. As our story opens its curtains for the first time, we learn that she's been living with her grandfather for a long while since her parents have been working abroad constantly. She isn't extraordinary, or even bright; but she is very kind and patient as any generic sob story anime heroine - remember [i]Clannad[/i]? Seeing her parents once or twice in a year, Eri grew up as a lonesome child and picked up an odd hobby of collecting ball jointed dolls to relieve her from the burden of the deafening silence in her home after the passing of her grandpa. Her silent, routine and unremarkable little life was the same each and every day. She wakes up, goes to school, cleans and washes, talks to her dolls and bring the end of another day... until one morning she wakes up to find all her dolls magically turned into young boys! With this absurd event, the surreal becomes the new real for Eri as she tries to adapt to a new life of living with her new family.\n\n[i]Nameless[/i] is a visual novel at its core: an incredibly well-written psychoanalytical + mystical sob story with fable-ish character and environment design. Yes it is also a dating simulation, but you really shouldn't expect common cheesiness of a casual otome. The game carries a definite undertone with themes such as abandonment, innocence, self-image, memory, the otherness and personal growth. None of these themes are taken light heartedly. If you are to pick this one, you really should be warned:\n\n1. You are in for a possibly heart and mind wrecking experience if you complete the game.\n2. It is required for you to complete game more than once to accomplish different character paths, and all stories come together to paint the grand picture little by little.\n3. There is a TRUCKLOAD of reading for a really slow pacing story and some well put choice options in dialogue or action now and then. So be ready to read big time.\n\nAs a personal note: I am genuinely speechless. The narration, the storyline, the atmosphere, thematic choices, the soundtrack, the character design, the in-depth character analysis and progression + background are the best that I've ever seen in this genre. As if the actual game wasn't overwhelming enough - with at least 4 different endings for each character - we are given the option of collecting diaries of different characters in game to have some insight on their personal train of thoughts. I've just completed the game and noticed that I have 61 hours of playtime. Sixty - fucking - one! And this is me using skip option for some dialogue that I've already seen in different game progressions.\n\nThis was my first VN from Cheritz. Thank you Cheritz. You are an asshole.

The character illustrations are beautiful, and all the backgrounds (apart from one) were also drawn to a very high standard. They certainly contributed to how much I enjoyed the game. The music is also enjoyable, if a bit repetative, it serves to enhance the mood of each scene. I wouldn't spend money on the OST though.\n\n[First Playthrough: Lance's Story]\n\nI managed to finish Lance's story with one good ending and the two bad endings. Actually, the good ending was lovely and the bad endings were really disappointing. I just felt 'meh' about them. I will be playing Yeonho's story next. It's nice that with each ending (good or bad) you get little glimpses of the over-arching plot. That's a nice touch and increases replay value.\n\n[Update: Yeonho's Story]\n\nI actually really disliked this one. Yeah I get it, he's cute, abused and vulnerable. Except those last two really aren't attractive traits and here they have been greatly romanticised. The way the heroine acts towards him isn't right at all. She isn't helping him no matter what she does. And the bad endings... Well. What the hell? It made me extremely uncomfortable. And didn't make sense at all, actually. Messed up.\n\n[Update: Yuri's Story]\n\nI only just started this one but I already like it a lot better. The character is a pervert and seemingly in control of this emotions, so that's makes his deviousness more fun for me. It's the most enjoyable route so far for my preferences! After advancing through his story, I have to say it's my favorite playthough so far. Yuri has my vote for top boy (so far)!\n\nAnd... I stopped there.

Wait, don't be scared, it's only because they love you [i]so[/i] much!\n\n[b]But seriously, I do recommend this game.[/b] It's not a short or particularly easy ride, but I think it's worth it, even if you don't find the romance aspect particularly interesting. I'm not great at writing detailed, lengthy reviews, so here's a quick positives and negatives list from my perspective:\n\n\n+ The story is far more complex than you might at first suspect and is compelling enough to keep you reading through the slightly slower parts. It also covers quite a number of heavy themes such as loss, abandonment and identity, which make it a lot deeper than the premise would imply. The best, and at times most frustrating, aspect of the story however is that in order to get the full experience and reach complete understanding you do have to play all of the routes. This means there's always a certain amount of mystery and intrigue until the very end.\n\n+ By the end of the gameI found myself at least sympathizing with the characters I was sure I would forever dislike. This is largely due to the impressive amount of character development across all the story arcs, though there were a couple that really stood out. While some of the characters do at times fall into the stereotypical tropes common to otome VNs, they usually find a way of making it work for them rather than against them. Overall, I found the characters to actually be the most interesting and memorable aspect.\n\n+ The choices are meaningful and game-altering. Your decisions always have an impact, though it may not always be immediately obvious. This greatly adds to overall immersion and the feeling that you're in charge of the MC's fate.\n\n+ If you're a fan of line-art, anime or pretty things in general then you'll likely find the visuals to be delightful. The lack of noses or nipples can be disconcerting at times but overall this game is very pleasing to the eye. \n\n+ Length. I've spent nearly 50 hours on this game, most of which while using guides, and I still don't have every single bad ending yet. That being said, it could go quite a bit faster depending on how much you use the skip function.\n\n\n- There are quite a number of grammatical errors in the translation. Most of the time it's fairly easy to ignore and it doesn't impede comprehension but it can be a bit jarring. \n- An odd thing I found was that the characters can look quite different in the CG art sometimes. Certainly not a game-breaking issue, but it did make me a little sad.\n\n\nTL;DR: I was drugged and I loved it.", "timestamp_created": 1444457281, "timestamp_updated": 1444457727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506532", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18375598": {"recommendationid": "18375598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166166679", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508987520}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely recommend.

Dopo la morte di suo nonno non poteva fare a meno di iniziare a collezionarne di pi\u00f9 per far fronte alla solitudine (dopo la morte del nonno \u00e8 costretta infatti a vivere in una grande casa da sola), dunque ha collezionato in totale 5 bambole della collezione Crobidoll. Un giorno, Eri si sveglia e trova tutte le sue cinque bambole in carne ed ossa, nella forma di 5 ragazzi molto affascinanti ed attraenti. \n\nInizia cos\u00ec, Nameless ~The One Thing You Must Recall~.\n\nLa maggior parte delle visual novel localizzate in Occidente tendono a concentrarsi sui concetti di gameplay, come puzzle o i classici punta e clicca. Nameless non \u00e8 uno di questi giochi. C'\u00e8 un forte aspetto di gioco che ti coinvolge molto, ed \u00e8 fare delle scelte, che poi influenzeranno la trama e ti porteranno ad avere diversi finali (sia positivi che negativi).\n\nSono cinque le bambole in casa e dunque sono cinque anche i percorsi principali da perseguire, ciascuno con almeno tre finali. Gran parte del divertimento viene dal guardare la storia svolgersi ma alcuni avviene anche attraverso il tentativo di ottenere un buon finale di ogni tipo. Non \u00e8 cos\u00ec difficile come sembra, ma alcuni finali \"negativi\" sono abbastanza forti e trattano il tema dell'abbandono, della violenza, della gelosia, ecc.\n\nE' consigliabile giocare tutti e 5 i personaggi per capire la trama il meglio possibile. Anche giocare i bad endings \u00e8 consigliato, per completezza e perch\u00e8 aggiungono un po' alla trama. \n\nL'ordine preferibile di giocabilit\u00e0 \u00e8:\n\n[olist]\n    [*]Lance (il quale ha 8 immagini da collezionare + 2 di bad ending)\n    [*]Yeonho (il quale ha 7 immagini da collezionare + 3 di bad ending)\n    [*]Yuri (il quale ha 8 immagini da collezionare + 4 di bad ending)\n    [*]Tei (il quale ha 11 immagini da collezionare + 4 di bad ending)\n    [*] Red (il quale ha 10 immagini da collezionare + 5 di bad ending)\n[/olist]\n\nDopo che Eri ha collezionato tutti i pezzi,  c'\u00e8 la possibilit\u00e0 di giocare un nuovo gioco e cliccare sul cuore per giocare la storia di ???.\nNon si possono effettuare alcune scelte in questa storia. Ed \u00e8 la storia forse pi\u00f9 particolare di tutte, poich\u00e8 si possono sbloccare altre immagini e dei finali segreti, ma non posso soffermarmi troppo su questo punto altrimenti finirei con il fare degli spoiler. \n\nOgnuno di questi stupendi uomini ha anche molto da offrire per quanto riguarda la caratterizzazione. Certo, i personaggi iniziano tutti come uno [b]stereotipo[/b] (es: pervertito seducente, figura paterna, timido e simpatico, innocente, ecc..) ma seguendo la storia hanno tutti un lato oscuro. Alcune delle rivelazioni sono dolci, mentre altri sono tristi - o addirittura decisamente spaventosi. \n\nUn aspetto [u]negativo[/u] che ho riscontrato \u00e8 la traduzione in inglese (si, non \u00e8 giocabile in italiano). Infatti, questa traduzione contiene degli errori grammaticali qua e l\u00e0. La struttura della frase a volte non \u00e8 corretta, e a volta viene utilizzata la parola sbagliata per esprimere un concetto.

The lonely MC (who you can name whatever you want) lives alone, and has collected 5 BJDs (Red, Tei, Yuri, Lance, and Yeonho. Magically one day they have come to life, but not all is as it seems.\n\nI do not want to get too much into the plot to avoid spoilers, and partially I just think the plot is amazing. I collect BJDs so some parts sorta creeped me out, but overall the game was very enjoyable. Nameles was made by a Korean company called Cheritz, who also made another otome game called Dandelion ~Wishes Brought to you~. Cheritz worked with a BJD company called Crobidoll, and based the characters after actual Crobidoll BJDs.  In some ways Nameless is surperior to Dandelion, and in others it isn't. \n\nFirst off, Nameless is a pure visual novel, with choices and no stat rasising. The storyline is fantastic, and is some parts it gets much darker than Dandelion ever did. There are 5 full routes, and then 2 mini epilogue routes that are fairly short. The 5 full routes are for each of the BJDs, and all of the routes are connected. Each route had at least 1-2 bad ends based on choices, and some had up to 4 bad ends. The only downside was that you had to play some of the routes in a certain order; for example you had to play Red after Tei's route. This works really well for the storyline, but you lose some of that freedom to seek after whoever you want like in other otome games. It didn't bother me that much, and the story definitely made up for it. This game is long. On Dandelion a lot of the time is spent ont he stat raising part with events happenning every now and again. With Nameless, the routes withour stat raising easily took over three hours each; the Dandelion routes took me about an hour each, and I just played longer trying to unlock the trading cards.\n\nAs much as I love Nameless, I preferred the art in Dandelion especially the CG art, but Hatoful Boyfriend has proven that as long as the storyline is amazing, the art is not as important.

Good thing I wrote a review right when I finished the game, I needed to refresh my memories! Haha see what I did there? No? Well I tried to be clever and... uh moving on. \n\nNameless addresses many themes such as self-worth, acceptance, identity, honesty with one\u2019s self and more. Each doll represents a theme in a way and that really makes each route heart warming. Cheritz handled these themes with utmost care and it delivers to the audience. I\u2019m sure anyone can relate to at least one thing in this game and feel touched.\n\nWriting:\nThe story was well written. There were many hilarious scenes that I had to take breaks simply from laughing too hard. There were also many feel-inducing moments that were characteristic of Cheritz, which I also absolutely love. However, I must say that there were quite a few typos throughout the game. Though they did not take away from my enjoyment of the game, they were a bit jarring at times.\n\nArt: \nThe art is definitely great as a whole. The sprites of each character were really nice. However, the art for the CGs were not consistent and while some were gorgeous, a few of them looked a bit strange. From the ending credits, I could tell that the CGs were made by more than one person, which sort of explains it. To be honest, it would have been nice if only one person did all the CGs as this would have allowed for more consistency. I also didn\u2019t like how in a couple of CGs, Eri\u2019s eyes were cut off or covered intentionally. While I prefer Dandelion\u2019s art style a bit more, the soft pastel colouring suited the atmosphere of Nameless. \n\nVoice Acting:\nAll the voice actors portrayed each character well. They displayed a wide variety of emotions for every scene. I really felt the character\u2019s personalities shone through their voices as well. But I wish Eri was voiced too. Heejung was voiced in Dandelion and I wish the same was done here.\n\nMusic:\nAgain, I really have to praise Cheritz on their music. The OST is just gorgeous and every time I listen to a certain track, I get Nameless feels all over again. If I had to say one thing though, I must say I wasn\u2019t a fan of the OP song. Regardless, I really liked the music in this game. \n\nCharacters:\nI loved every single character in this game. They all had their own quirks that were so unique to them. Each doll needed Eri in order to grow as a person. It also makes sense as to why each doll had twisted views. I mean, their world is so small as they were originally dolls after all. At the same time though, I liked to see that Eri also needed them as much as they needed her. It was a nice balance and seeing them grow together was really sweet. \n\nOverall, Nameless is a great visual novel.

(Yeon-ho in particular.)\n- No stat raising!!\n- Various extras that add to the flavor of the game. You can view texts your character sends and receives through out the game, read diary entries written by her, there is a CG album gallery you unlock through playing the game, diary entries from the boys points of views as well as several side characters unlocked through out the game, and also a way to review any parts of the game you want to experience again via a \"memories\" section.\n\nCons:\n- Some typos and grammar mistakes that can take you out of the experience.\n- Korean only voice acting. This wasn't really a con for me personally, but I can see how maybe for others it could be.\n- Each character's story is important to the over-arching storyline of the game, so it's highly recommended to play each character. I did find this to be a con at first, because I wanted to jump right to Tei and Red, but you do have to play with Yeon-ho, Lance, or Yuri first and get their good ending before you can unlock Tei. And you must get Tei's good ending to unlock Red.\n- Lots of bad endings that are easy to get from making one bad decision. Some people might find several of the bad endings pretty disturbing, also there are a couple of character's routes that get somewhat disturbing as well. Personally, I didn't find this to be a con for me, but again I could see how this might be a bad thing for other people so that's why I'm mentioning it here.\n\nOverall:\nThis game is a very enjoyable experience with interesting and lovable characters. One of the best romance visual novels I've played. Like I said above, characters who I didn't really care all that much about were as lovable as the characters I did expect to care about. I actually have a hard time picking a favorite!\n\nThe story also deals with some dark subject matter... Abuse, jealousy, loneliness, social isolation, fear of rejection, and it really hits you right in your heart. I've seen media related products deal with these subjects before and sometimes they aren't done well. Instead of feeling moved in the end, you just feel beaten down and bitter about the entire affair. Nameless, while it does get disturbing at points, doesn't leave you with those sorts of feelings and that is because the characters are so well written and charming. I feel like that's one of the most important points for these types of games. If the characters aren't strongly written, it's difficult to continue playing and that's ESPECIALLY so when the game deals with dark/depressing subject matter.\n\nThis game is well worth your time and money.", "timestamp_created": 1434107590, "timestamp_updated": 1434107590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16324091": {"recommendationid": "16324091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014746952", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435821563}, "language": "english", "review": "your dolls are horrible. your friends are horrible. you are horrible. cant date the doctor is horrible. this game is horrible.\n\n0/10 would recommend", "timestamp_created": 1434098447, "timestamp_updated": 1434098575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501431", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16268886": {"recommendationid": "16268886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147935348", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459620603}, "language": "english", "review": "This game...... I'll be honest I played Dandelion and thought I knew what to expect from Cheritz. I was wrong on so many levels. This game will make you laugh, make you cry, make you love it again and again.

I have seen all five good endings, plus the special two for Nameless. They all broke me yet left me smiling and wanting to see more.... well.... Let me rephrase that.\n\nIf you like loud jock types that everyone loves you will adore Red, the warrior of justice.... I did not like him. Period. His line wasn't as touching to me. Tei's felt a little off too but it made up for it with how touching and heartbreaking his arc was. Yuri's arc actually humanized him for me and made me feel much better for giggling everytime he hit on the main character. And no matter how much I wanted to feel wrong for playing Yeonho's line {cause he reminds me of a kid} I adored that little chick so much. Lance's was the first to break me, and I admit I cried a lot during it. Nameless..... there isn't much I can say about Nameless, your first \"doll\", except to say he factors majorly into the story and even helps break your heart.\n\nAll that being said there were some minor translation/spelling errors {Lance says something about being your first doll and the line says fist, ect.} However if you can read past the minor stuff it is a wonderful game, though not one I would recommend for those who have dealt with abuse or extreme possessiveness as this game could be considered triggering for some. The characters are all well written {weeeeeeelll you already know I am biased against Red but I suppose you could say he is well written for an airhead}, the story is entertaining, and each time you start up someone's arc you feel yourself being pulled in and wanting to cry for both your character and the dolls.", "timestamp_created": 1433811186, "timestamp_updated": 1433813389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16234503": {"recommendationid": "16234503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217700664", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483932730}, "language": "english", "review": "Cheritz has definitely gained a serious fangirl with this game and dandelion.

There are some seriously deep and sometimes dark themes in this game and while there are many sweet moments there are also some seriously creepy ones. The writing in this game is superb. The depth of each character and the way that each one gets their own amazing storyline that causes you to fall in love with them (seriously). In many otome style visual novels I tend to feel like their are one or two toss away story arcs. I was really surprised at how much I liked each arc in this game, even characters I didn't think I would originally like. In addition, there are some strong and well developed female friendships in this game that I really appreciated.

Cheritz did add some nice touches to personalize the story and break down the fourth wall, which added to my sense of immersion. \n\nThere is no english voice acting in the game, but the Korean voice actors are really good, and even if you don't understand the language it is worth leaving the voices on.

They get into the very marrow of the human condition. \n\nI played this after loving every minute of Dandelion - a game I didn't think could be topped. Dandelion was full on stat raising, meticulous work that really paid off with super emotional endings (but the really bad endings were even better!). Nameless is similar, continuing the basic premise while stripping away everything but the story and your choices. A fluffy little love story this is not. The dolls-turned-boys each have their own backstories and issues, and so do you! There's a growth and maturity that occurs in each storyline, but it's equally as easy to make a choice that will lead to death, violence, and a special cup of ZZZ tea. \n\nI loved the fact that you can name your main character anything, and I also think she's an improvement over the doormat of a protagonist in Dandelion. Her best friends are great additions to the plot. There's more of a sense of momentum, too, because of the insane workings of Nameless and a certain wizard that grow increasingly crazy with each timeline. Oh, and the voice acting! I don't speak Korean, but it blew me away. It really adds a depth to these characters, bringing them to life. And the artwork! I felt like taking a screenshot every 5 minutes, haha. It's gorgeous.\n\nThe cons? A little bit of engrish text here and there, nothing too distracting. There could be some more sexy scenes, probably... but would that ruin the romance? Not sure. The worst part was how this took over my life for a few days! I absolutely had to finish it. And after 20+ hours and a secret ending, I can definitely say this is a must-buy for any visual novel fan.

This was my favorite of the two. The story is, at first, beautifully entertaining, exciting, and fun, but as you delve deeper into the available routes, and unlock more... you encounter a chilling realization. This story is FAR deeper than it first appears. I spent 25 hours getting to know each and every characters and fell deeply in love with all of them. \n\nNameless is heavily story driven, where more than anything this is a NOVEL and not necessarily a game beyond the fact that you can make your own decisions. It truly is one of the most story packed Otome's I have played in quite a while. Below I will detail what I liked and did not like (because yes, even a gem such as this has its imperfections).\n\n[h1]PROs:[/h1]\n[*] Absolutely amazing and engrossing story, you'll find it difficult to pull away from this one.\n[*] Ever evolving story. Text will not always be the same in common routes as well, but in the actual character routes it is almost entirely different. You will not be pressing \"Skip\" much at all except some instances in the common route section. As you unlock more routes, the story continues to evolve.\n[*] Characters are well fleshed out, and totally voice acted (in Korean, not English, but it's still great!).\n[*] No \"dating sim\" click this, click that, raise this stat and that stat! Though stat raising does have it's charms at some point, I commend Cheritz for leaving it out of this particular title. You get to learn so much more about the story and characters this way (and without the monotony of those \"daily\" chores). It's much more relaxed.\n[*] Gorgeous art (with some exceptions, will list in CONs as well)\n\n[h1]CONs:[/h1]\n[*] Some of the CG art just didn't seem of the same caliber as others, or didn't seem to match the character art that you see throughout the game.\n[*] There are some vexing typos, misspellings, and grammatical errors (as well as using one of the character's names when they meant someone else). These can be ignored unless you're quite OCD about it. It's easy to understand what they had meant. Basically, it's not unreadable in any way, shape, or form.

Quality in otome games is very important for me, as a useless romance story just existing for the attractive guys doesn't interest me. That's why I was hesitant to take a chance on this game - especially considering its price as compared to some of the other otome games on Steam. \nBut man, I'll tell you now - I'm glad I took the chance. \n\n\"Nameless\" is not only the best otome game I've ever played but also one of the top in terms of visual novel style game play with choices to affect your path. Nameless goes above and beyond the typical otome game genre, involving a mix of diverse characters, great music, many hours of gameplay with replay quality, surprising twists and turns, multiple endings, and a story that you just won't expect. \n\nSTORY:\nThis game is beyond a 'typical' romance game play. The story is intense and even unnerving at times, keeping me wanting to play continuously to figure out what was going on. As an important note, this game does have some quite violent and mildly disturbing moments, so brace yourself for those. I'd recommend following a guide to make sure you get all the endings - good AND bad. If you're looking at this game because you have a specific boy you want to get the protagonist with, it won't be worth it. To get the most of it, you need to experience every path - all the way to the \"???\" at the end. \nMost people suggest playing through the game in Lance > Yeonho > Yuri > Tei > Red order. Personally I think you can choose your order of the first three, but make sure you do Tei & Red last, and if anything experience Yuri's route before Tei's and Red's at the very end.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nI actually wasn't fond of many of the characters when I first started the game. Well crap, I thought, I bought this game and I don't even like the characters. But that changed as I went through the game. The characters start off very ... 'flat', I suppose. They are dolls after all; you don't see their personality much until they truly grow into human three-dimensional people. The build up is infinitely worth it. Even the character I liked the least ended up growing on me. \nThe characters do follow a bit of a stereotypical otome fashion. The blunt cold type; the womanizer; the innocent childish character; the perfect man who might not actually be so perfect; the clueless idiot. I'd say not to judge them based on this, but it is a bit hard not to. At the very least though, don't write them off as their stereotypes. Character development throughout this game is huge, with some of the development being immensely surprising, shocking, and disturbing. \nAgain, beware of the violent turns at some points in the story. \n\nART & MUSIC:\nThe artwork in this game is good quality. I can't say it is the best I've seen in a game but in the mid-top range at least. The music is what really stands out in terms of art quality. I'm unsure if the music in \"Nameless\" was composed specifically for the game but it is stunning, and does an excellent job in setting the tone, giving a romantic atmosphere when needed, eerie & creepy feeling when called for, and vocals in the opening and ending sequences are well-done. The voice actors did a great job of their parts, with even the side/extra characters being well done.\n\nOVERALL QUALITY & MECHANICS: \nThe characters, story, and everything else aside, the overall quality of the game itself does need a bit of criticism. There are many spelling and grammar mistakes through the game, but if you can get past that they won't subtract from your experience I'm sure. Some of them are actually rather amusing though, and I found myself snorting at them when they appeared in dramatic moments.

I didn't run into any glitches throughout the game aside from the broken text boxes in some places. \n\nIn the end, \"Nameless\" - despite the flaws it has - is one of the most spectacular stories I've ever experiences.

Finally I finished Nameless~\n\nPhew... this game was a roller coaster.... I never had so many mixed feelings in one game...\n\nCheritz did a really great job creating all those characters with different feelings. I also liked the supporting characters very much. It's just sad, that Zion doesn't has a route. He was really cute and I wanted to tease him like Mr. Hobin did. A side story of Zion and Soi becoming a couple would be cool.\n \nAnyway I really enjoyed the game and I need to salute to the voice actors. They were really awesome. Especially Tei's voice actor.The way they spoke, made me laugh, sad, mad and weird. The creepy moments made the game really interesting. I loved it. (Am I weird? haha) I was surprised to hear that Lance's voice actor, acts for the grandpa too. lol\nThe music was beautiful and suits all the characters so well. The character design and the backgrounds are so lovely. I love the pastel color of the game very much.\n\n\n\n***SPOILER***\nMy thoughts of each character:\n\nLance: Cold, ice prince, but a kind and warm-hearted doll. I really love him from the beginning till the end of his story-line. I also love his character design a lot. The funny moments when he get flustered or embarrassed was the best. But the most parts I liked about him was his caring and the way he loves the heroine. Oh, and the part when he said that you can call my name all night.....haha\n\nRed: Super Hero, cute, stupid and a really caring doll. I like his route, but I got a little annoyed at some parts. I think its because he was being too protective. At least it turned out well. The best thing I liked was him acting slow. That made the story really funny, when Lance attacked him.\n\nTei: Lovely, caring, creepy, yandere.....Tei, he is my favourite of all characters. Many people would disagree, but I really think without him the bond between the dolls doesn't exist. I know that he creeps out many player and everyone doesn't like him for being in all the bad endings, especially on Yeonhos. But this is how he is. A heart-broken doll who loves the heroine very much. I really love how he cares about the heroine and I understand his behavior. He supports her. He loves her. He would do everything for her for not getting hurt. He wants her happiness, even thought he knows that he will never get the chance to get the love back. It makes me sad to see him like this....Out of all the characters, I want to heal his broken heart the most.  PS: The voice actor was really really awesome and I love his deep manly, kind voice. I also love the way he spokes on the ZZZ dairy.\n\nYuri: Perverted teacher, my honey, annoying, good looking sexy doll. I love his look, but I always wanted to hit him on the face. lol He flirts to much. But he is mature, kind and manly when the situation changed...I love to see a teacher, student relationship in the game. haha\n\nYeonho: The lil chick, cute, awakening the momma feelings. adorable doll. You want to protect him , but at the same time you want to tease him. He's really cute, but he's more like a little brother than a BF.....\n\nNameless: Mad, insane, creepy, forgotten teddy bear. Going through all the stories makes me feel so bad for him. He was forgotten by the heroine. He tried to find a way to come back to her arms....I really love him in the game, because the way he talks was creepy, but at the same time funny and teasing. I like the way he talks to me, the gamer. He teased me and makes me want to talk with him. At some parts i was getting mad at him for teasing me lol....\n\nWizard: Woho, I love to see him here on Nameless. He was entertaining, haha. His love for the heroin still remains here. I hope to see him on the further games of cheritz.\n\nSoi: Best friend, pretty, loves hot boys. I love her. Her friendship with the heroine will remain till they die. Sometimes she was annoying for, but this is what I loved about her. I wish she would get together with Zoin\n\nShinbi: Model, pretty, tall, strawberry milk. That girl, I understand her fandom. I wanna join! She is quiet, but she understands the situation and supports you.\n\nYujin: Weird school doctor who loves Beatrice, a skeleton model. If he has a route, I would play it with joy. lol\n\nHobin: He is a really kind man. I like the way he teases Zion and the way he cares for him. He is so calm~~\n\nZion: I want to tease him, more than Yeonho! He's so cute, like a little lost black cat. Why isn't there a route for him! I think everyone wants it. haha\n\n\nCheritz, thank you for creating this beautiful game.

I cannot thumbs up this enough, wall of text below if you're wondering why.\n\n-----\n\nI don't even know where to begin with this game.\n\nYou play as the heroine of the story, Eri as she falls in love with her dolls to reveal two bonus endings at the very end of the game. This game is deep, dark, heartwrenching, funny, sad, and makes you think about material possessions in a different light, as it thorougly draws you into the mystery and intrigue of the plot line.\n\nFirst off, the artwork is amazing in this game, bright colors, very painted shading, the backgrounds in the game are mediocre but the character art and the CG's are phenomenally good. Much like Cheritz' other game, Dandelion, all of the characters are broad and deep with good and bad in them. The bad endings are disturbing at times and can be very dark even bordering on violent, but - overall this will keep you interested all the way through. The greatest thing about this visual novel is that you really get a different experience when you're playing all of the paths because while even the first three revolve around a common path, there are still little blurbs that don't just involve the skip button which add depth and a bit of confusion for the first time playthrough anyways.\n\nOnce the steam-keys were added, I finished completing the game for the second time (Literally finished 5 minutes ago) and after months of not playing I could still remember the depth of the characters and how amazing they were. What I love about this VN, is that some of the bad endings are so disturbing yet alluring that I would save and choose the right options for the bad ends anyways, and that's phenomenal. All i wanna say is \"Oma Tei\" is pretty funny in a disturbing way and I had to go through and literally go \"Tei, oh my god stop.\" because he makes an appearance in a bunch of the bad ends. Sorry for any potential spoilers there. Someone should really count the amounts of times Tei shows up unexpectedly.\n\nMy favorite path on the first playthrough was Tei, because at first glance his concept was so interesting and I usually play for the princely, usually blonde character first. He's such a broad character however once you get into it, that it is downright scary at times once you realise just how disturbed the character is under the mask he plays most of the time. My second playthrough of it however, I think Lance takes my favorite spot. The reason being is after you've gotten the whole story, Lance really is a deep character. The journal entries are really intense, and it makes me think after playing through it that Lance really doesn't want to give up on the MC with the other characters routes.\n\nThe only thing I would actually wish for would be a fully playable path with the bonus character, as after you get the second bonus ending with him, it's heartwrenching and makes me want to actually play a full path with the character. He's so disturbed and depressed that my heart was practically exploding with pain, and the bonus cg. Oh my god. way to tear my heart out Cheritz! hahaha. Seriously though, phenomenal Visual novel. I cannot say that enough. \n\nThis VN. It's amazing. If you want a tear jerking, deep, visceral, heart wrenching story with enough content to keep you reading through it for at least a few days, get this. It's well worth the price. The game's voicing is in Korean but all of the text can be read in english, if like me you cannot actually -read- korean. There are a few bugs here and there but honestly they don't break the game, they just could take a little fixing.\n\nBugs I can remember: MC's name being listed as %$ Or some symbol, during certain cutscenes, or Young %$ due to a scripting error.\n\nSpelling/grammar errors as well: Lance refers to himself as MC's \"fist\" doll, which made me laugh but I don't think was the intended message. And I believe there were a few typos on Yeon-ho's route as well.\n\nThere were also a few issues with grammar/translation Tei-ahjumma is better meant as \"Old lady Tei\" instead of momma-tei, so it's not exactly accurate, but then again Korean isn't exactly straight-forward interpretation wise... Also there were some down-right difficult to read sentences in the bonus ending that required some re-reading due to how they were worded.\n\nThat said for me, overall this game is a serious 9.8/10. If you're into visual novels, and or are looking for a good romantic visual novel as a female character, this one is hands down amazing. Unlike Dandelion, this game does not rely on stat building and is entirely dependent on choices made through reading, as such it's more like this deep heartwrenching story with pretty pictures and pretty characters. MC does act a little stupid/ditsy at times/ignorant, but aside from that all of the characters are fantastic.

Luckily, with Nameless, your incredibly emotional experience will be worth every penny.  \n\nIt took me 22 hours to get all of the endings (using a spoiler-free guide - if not, it would take a lot longer, of course): there are 5 main pursuable characters, each with one good ending and 3-5 bad endings, plus a secret route.  Unlike many visual novels, each character's route has a wealth of unique content, so you are not just playing the exact same thing over and over again to get one or two extra scenes.  \n\nI also found it to be one of the best-written games I have ever played --  I genuinely laughed and cried at the appropriate times.  Although many of the characters initially appear to conform to VN tropes, the game will consistently surprise you by revealing hidden depths to the characters and by tying their backstories very well into their personalities.  The voice acting is absolutely top-notch -- I don't understand a word of Korean, but I could still feel the emotion in each line.  The art is also pretty gorgeous, especially compared to some of the incredibly hideous stuff that has somehow made its way to Steam.\n\nFor those of you who played Dandelion (Cheritz's other Steam release), Nameless does away with all of the stat-raising from that game but still manages to be a similar length, meaning there is (I think) a lot more dialogue and actual story content in this one.  As I mentioned above, I found these characters to be generally more interesting than the ones in that game, and each route has more unique content, so playing through all of the routes doesn't feel like a slog at all.  Basically, if you enjoyed Dandelion, pick this up without a second thought.  If you didn't enjoy it, though, you may still end up loving Nameless.  \n\nIn short: I, too, held off on buying this game for a while due to the price point, but I am ever-so-glad that I finally got it.

Why is that so, I have no idea, since \"Nameless\" has almost all problems that \"Dandelion\" had with little improvement in terms of story (basically tiring and pointless stat-raising is gone, hurray!), and much more unpolished overall feeling.\n\nI tried to finish every route, I gave up after fourth one and I didn't feel like I've missed anything important. The concept is very similar to \"Dandelion\". If you like dating your pets, maybe you will like dating dolls too. Good luck, enjoy, oh and backstory is also, almost the same, with extra \"dramatic\" character from protagonist's past.\n\n[h1]Good things[/h1]\n\n[b]The game is long. [/b]And no stat-raising here, so it's actually all story. Bland, boring and not interesting, but story nonetheless.\n\n[b]Good graphic.[/b]\n\n[b]Extras.[/b] Gallery, diary, phone, that seems pretty pointless most of the time, but it's there.\n\n[h1]Bad things[/h1]\n\n[b]Music.[/b] Once again, it's not fitting what's going on and it adds absolutely nothing to the atmosphere.\n\n[b]Very low number of CGs.[/b] This is a pricey game, that almost never have any discount, yet there is so little going on in terms of graphic. Sure, it looks great, but CGs seems lacking, there are few scenes when it was obvious that CG was intended to be there, but apparently ended up not being created.\n\n[b]Price.[/b] Low resolution. Don't even get me started. Unless your game is an old-time classic, there is absolutely no justification for 20$+ price tag with this quality. This is outrageous. Whether you like the story or not is always a subjective thing, but this sort of practice is a pure laziness. Add bugs to that and you'll come to the conclusion that there are many better games out there for much lower price.\n\n[b]Bugs.[/b] Yupp. Player's name isn't always showing correctly, for example, issues with phone, and so on.\n\n[b]Idea isn't original anymore.[/b] It's Dandelion 2.0, just without stat raising and with dolls. \n\n[b]Very cliche characters.[/b] You have your flirty type, your caring guy that [spoiler] turnes out to be a bit of a creep [/spoiler], you have your energetic eats-a-lot character, your cold but with golden heart and your child-looking one. Nothing I haven't seen. And as much as some aspects of their routes were touching, again, it's nothing I haven't seen or expect.\n\n[b]Unlikable protagonist (again).[/b] She's a victim. Again. Because her grandfather died, which is tragic and I know that very well, but she really isn't the most suffering girl in the entire world and this game paints her that way.\n\n[b]Drama.[/b] Besides the thing I will mention right below, there is way too much drama regarding protagonist and her constant being a victim and when you don't buy that and you don't get attached to her, it gets pretty much meaningless. There are no stakes really.\n\n[b]Humor[/b]. Dramatic tension is gone, when this game tries to introduce a little bit of humor. Mixing humor with drama can have great effect or can be poor and ruin the mood. In \"Nameless\" it's the second thing. Humor it typically absurd and anime-ish. I don't remember smiling even once.\n\n[b]Bad endings.[/b] Wait. How did I end up with this weird love triangle? Or as this... doll-slave? How did that happen? How is that possible? When we established that this may happen to me or at least hinted at it? Are those purely for shock-value?

Unlike Dandelion, however, Nameless is a straight visual novel with very little game play outside of making decisions at key points in the story.  There is a LOT of reading, so anyone expecting a similar experience to Dandelion may want to do a little more research before purchasing.  For those who enjoy well crafted visual novels, this is just the title for you.\n\nOur story begins with the protagonist, 16 year-old Eri, living alone since her grandfather passed away nearly a year ago.  Her parents have worked abroad her entire life, and even now at this critical time of loss, they leave her to manage alone save for the benevolent, although slightly oblivious, school principal who keeps casual watch over her as he resides in the same building.  But life goes on... until Eri wakes one morning to find her treasured ball-joint dolls, the only beings who have kept her company these many lonely months, have magically come to life.  Now she must figure out how to work her new \"family\" into her daily life without drawing suspicion from those who know her best.\n\nAt its heart, Nameless is a tale of loss and abandonment, but it's also one of hope and renewal. And despite it's very romantic narrative, the underlying themes elevate it to something more than your standard \"feel-filled\" dating sim. The premise may seem a bit odd, but it works, albeit slowly.  The novel's greatest strength is in how every thread ties together the fabric of the overall story, but in a sense it is also its greatest weakness.  It is only through reading and experiencing everything the novel has to offer, including the multitude of bad endings, that one can fully grasp the scope of the story and realize just how closely every event is intertwined and how damaged each character truly is.  And it's only by reading the final hidden chapters that it's revealed how deeply our protagonist is scarred by the neglect she's dealt with her entire life.  These revelations breathe new life and meaning into the characters and will have you examining the story long after you've closed it for the final time. Unfortunately, some may lose interest well before those threads begin coming together, especially considering how slow the reveals prove to be.  \n\nDespite the absurdity of the situation, by outward appearances this is a slice of life tale.  As such, the narrative pace is slow but nuanced with details that build upon another painting a portrait of Eri and the world she lives in which is explored through each additional story route. It takes well over half of the game to see the inklings of an overarching narrative, however, but patience is handsomely rewarded.  Your second and third readings of the common route will reveal new dialogues with characters whose routes you've previously finished, further developing their personalities now that we understand them a bit better.  And once you unlock the final two characters, things get quite a bit more interesting when darker undertones surface as you piece together just what has been going on all along.  I found it incredibly intriguing how precarious the entire situation is, with tragedy often arising from the most innocent of decisions. Make no mistake these darker aspects of the story will hook you like nothing else.  \n\nNameless is indeed much darker than it first appears.  Themes of abuse, obsession and abandonment play prominently throughout the character routes and are most apparent in the numerous bad endings.  Some scenes made me incredibly uncomfortable while others had me close to tears.  There's also quite a bit of sexual innuendo and suggestive language as well as some mature situations.  Although nothing explicit takes place on screen, I feel at times the narrative may be inappropriate for younger readers.\n\nFor the romantics, there is no shortage of romance here.  The story will play at your heart, twist it into knots, break it in two, and when the final confession of feelings plays out, race faster than it ever has as you wait with bated breath for that first lovely kiss between Eri and her chosen beau.  By the time the credits roll, you'll have fallen in love with each of the boys along with her, even the ones you couldn't stand from the start.  \n\nThe presentation is phenomenal with artwork that is both detailed and emotive.  Each character is creatively designed and drawn over beautiful backgrounds.  Gorgeous CG's highlight important story points while  the pastel palette paints a soft picture of youth and innocence with sepia undertones lending a nostalgic lens to the scenery.  Delicately crafted acoustic music selections complement the imagery with romantic, yet somber, melodies.  Most themes have multiple versions that intensify at key moments enhancing the emotional resonance of the story to great effect.\n\nAs one who normally turns voices off in these types of games, I found myself spellbound by the incredible performances.  After turning them briefly on to get a feel for the quality, I couldn't bring myself to shut them off again.  The actors do an incredible job of bringing each character to life with top notch performances that fit their personalities perfectly.  Every piece of dialogue is Korean voiced including all minor characters, something that is altogether uncommon for non-Japanese visual novels.\n\nIf I had to complain about one thing it would be the typos and awkward phrasings that are sprinkled throughout.  Most are rather minor and do not disrupt the narrative flow much, if at all, but they can be a bit jarring when they pop up during important emotional scenes, briefly pulling you out of the experience.  Odd phrasings (most likely due to sticking to the original Korean meanings a little too closely) can take a bit of getting used to as well, but everything is coherent and understandable, even if in a slightly roundabout way.\n\nAnd now the nitty gritty, the price.  $33 is a hefty sum for any game, and considering Cheritz has never been known to offer a discount on their titles, you're unlikely to pick up it up for less than that.  So then, is it truly worth it?  In my opinion, having played at least a good 10-15 visual novels on Steam, and pretty much all of the otome available here (and elsewhere), you're not going to find better value for your dollar when it comes to the genre, at least not unless we start getting official Japanese localizations.  Fast readers generally log around 30 hours to completion while slower ones may take upwards of 50, assuming they're letting the voice actors play out their dialogue. Given the high quality of every aspect from the artwork to the voice acting and music, Cheritz probably could have asked for more and I would maintain it's still worth the price.  There are some who feel that no matter how high the quality, visual novels should never ask as much due to the nature of the genre itself.  In that case, perhaps this game isn't for you. But for anyone else, do yourself a favor, save up that $30 and buy this gem.  Every penny is worth it as long as you allow Nameless the time it needs to win you over.\n\nBottom Line: Highly recommended for both otoge and visal novel fans as well as anyone who enjoys a complex and well-written narrative.", "timestamp_created": 1423057120, "timestamp_updated": 1437218696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 294, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926232", "comment_count": "22", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14320220": {"recommendationid": "14320220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177348109", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512703212}, "language": "english", "review": "I\u2019m quite sad that I missed the review event \u2013 I mistook the ending date, but I decided to post the review anyways. Cheritz deserves all the positive reviews it can get. I\u2019m glad that I can contact the makers through this way.\n\n[b]Introduction:[/b]\nNameless is an otome game made by a Korean indie company called Cheritz. The clear-time for me was about 45 hours, trying to get all the endings for each of the characters. Nameless is a visual novel style game, and doesn\u2019t require any sort of levelling up to progress through the story. You have five main characters to choose from, and unlike other games, each route is a part of the final plot after clearing all of the main characters. This slightly restricts the order in which you can choose a character \u2013 Lance, Yeonho, Yuri, Tei (only after clearing at least one of the previous three) -> Red. The entire game is voice-acted, and supports full Korean audio. I played the game in Korean, so some errors might be made with some of the romanization in this review. I also cannot comment about the quality of the English translation. I may add it later on if I play the game through English.\n\nMy recommended clear route is: Yuri -> Yeonho -> Lance -> Tei -> Red\n\n[b]Storyline/ characters:[/b]\nPrepare to laugh, cry, and be frightened. I\u2019m not kidding about being frightened. There were moments in this game that I was re-checking the genre the game was tagged under. \n\n[u]*Major spoiler alert from here \u2013 if you haven\u2019t played the game, skip this bit and read the Pros/ Cons*[/u]\n\nMy order of disturbing characters: ??? -> Tei -> Yeonho(!!) -> Lance, Yuri, Red. I guess it\u2019s all a part of the charms of the game though \u2013 and it does add to the character\u2019s depth. It shows the players the seriousness of the dolls\u2019 hurts and scars (some quite literal). Most of the disturbed scenes in the game are bad-endings, so you can avoid them if you\u2019re careful. You\u2019ll grow to fear Tei as you work through the initial three characters and encounter their bad endings. I was suspicious of every smile and kind gesture from the gentle-looking barista by the end of Lance, Yuri, and Yeonho\u2019s routes. Yeonho\u2019s blank looks with his crazed murmurs were pretty darn horrifying too. Even more so because you don\u2019t expect it. However, there is a reason for Tei\u2019s and Yeonho\u2019s behaviour \u2013 they were both second-hand dolls. Both abandoned, and both previous owned by psychotic owners that could both feature in thrillers of their own. \n\nAll five dolls have different insecurities. All quite severe and all very different. \u2018I want to be special\u2019, \u2018I want to love truly\u2019, \u2018I want a purpose\u2019, \u2018I want to be clean\u2019, and \u2018I want to be good\u2019. All of course, desiring your love and attention as their owner. It\u2019s pretty adorable how they all look to the player for those two things.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, each routes must be cleared for the final ending. Only the first three playable characters have common routes at the beginning. Tei and Red is specialised from the start. Since Red\u2019s route was the last, I found it to be a lot more detailed than the other routes. This is also reflected by the amount of cutscenes he has in comparison to the other characters. I won\u2019t go into too much detail, but Red made me cry. His character is truly unique, special, and very believable. Lance was quite special too \u2013 I could emphasise with his insecurities well. Yeonho\u2019s and Yuri\u2019s route disappointed me a little. Especially Yuri\u2019s \u2013 it just seemed a little shallow and lacking in comparison to the other routes. His personality was a bit off-putting too, but I guess that\u2019s personal preference. Tei\u2019s route was disturbing and well-written. Completely worth the shudders I got from all his bad-ending appearances. ??? was unexpected and his scenes with the merry-go-round was pretty disturbing. But the last cutscene with him (was quite lucky stumbling into it. I won\u2019t spoil, but nothing to do with clicking options.) was quite sweet, so I forgave him of all his creepiness. \n\nI realise that I\u2019ve mostly been talking about the stranger aspects of the characters. Do note that I am writing a massive review, and I loved the game enough to spend the time doing so. All the characters are endearing; some are very hot; some are unexpectedly perverted (yes, I\u2019m looking at you, Lance.); some are adorable; and most of them will make you squeal and blush at least once.\n\nThe other NPCs were pretty cool. I was quite surprised at how deep Soi\u2019s character was. Initially, I imagined her to be the main character\u2019s stereotypical rival in love, but she was much, much more than that. Her friendship with the player was an additional depth to the storyline. I was a little sad that Zion wasn\u2019t a playable character. Loved his design and voice (and his crobidoll form is so adorable). Oh, and welcome back, magician! He was quite a nice touch by Cheritz to include in Nameless.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nThe graphics of the characters were amazing. The different poses, the blinks, and moving mouths \u2013 all were perfect. Natural and convincing. The one big downside was the quality of some of the cutscenes\u2026 You\u2019re meant to want to come looking for them again, but I found that I didn\u2019t really look back for any except one or two (mostly lance\u2019s). I actually found some of it damaging to the story development because I found the playable character quite ugly in the scene. It was especially disappointing because everything else was stunning.\n\n[b]Soundtrack/ Voice acting:[/b]\nThe soundtrack was what really pulled me into the story. I loved it. Each of the character\u2019s themes are perfect to the character\u2019s personality, and what I especially loved was that the sountracks weren\u2019t\u2026 cheap-sounding. If that makes sense. The voice acting was fantastic. Tei\u2019s voice was by-far superior to any. The emotional aspects of his story was partly only achievable through the amazing voice acting. The other voice actors were very good too, of course.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nThe difficulty of the game wasn\u2019t high. I cleared most of the game without the need of searching through walkthroughs. There are some tricky options though, so make sure to keep quick saving. The ending was a little disappointing for me \u2013 but this is definitely due to my tastes. I didn\u2019t like how suddenly every route combined with each other and yees. You end up with the five characters you\u2019ve cleared the game with. I wish at the end, there was an option to who saves you, so the ending with that character becomes the true ending. \n\nSo my opinions in a nutshell:\n[b]Pros:[/b] \n+ Stunning character graphics\n+ Awesome voice acting\n+ Unbelievably in-depth, immersive storyline with hours over hours of gameplay\n+ Hot and endearing characters\n+ Excellent play-back value\n+ Beautiful OSTs\n+ No need to grind for silly stats\n+ You will most definitely cry, laugh, and be quite frightened\n+ Cheap for what you\u2019re getting in the package\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Some bad quality cutscenes. \n- What\u2019s up with the ending?\n- Some disappointing routes\n- Sold out drama CD. PLEASE GIVE ME DUMMYHEAD DRAMA CD (of Red) DLC!!! It\u2019s pretty mean of Cheritz to release the teasers on YouTube and release it only for a short while (cries). I don\u2019t care how expensive it is, or if it\u2019s only in Korean (I\u2019ll translate it all for free!!!); please release it as a DLC/ re-release the CDs!! I\u2019ll be a slave to your company for life!!\n\nAnyways, all I can say to you is: if you\u2019re interested enough to dig around for reviews, just play it. Do it.

I swear.\nAnyway, if you've never played an otome before, I strongly recommend this one. It's got some pretty solid characters and an intersting storyline to follow, though it may be confusing at times.\nThere's alot to take in with this game, most of the character's routes feel fleshed out, and since it's entirely visual novel based, it's quite a read. The music and the sprites are gorgeous and the atmosphere really does suck you in. The Voice acting is a lovely touch and each character was well voiced and boiling with emotion. I even liked that each of them greets you on the main screen, it would always make my heart sing~\nIf I had any complaints it would be about length. While I do like long stories, some routes seemed to drag on in places and I would get bored in the middle and find myself abandoning the game for a while, but I'd always ome back for more. The typos are far and few but they are there, mostly in the diary entries. I felt as though some of the CG's looked a bit too different from the character's sprites (espcially Yuri and Tei?) as if the artist couldn't slim them down properly, but regardless, most of the art work is phenomonal.\nAll in all, I really did enjoy this game. Some parts were fairly creepy and some were kind of... adult so I would recomend this to someone at least older than 14...\nIf you want to try a dating sim, or a visual novel this is a great start, but if youre a veteran of the genre it's a must have for your library. The art and the stories are beautiful and just look at these boys they're friggin adorable I just want to put them in my pocket.

The art, music, and voice acting are all top-notch. The translation is a little awkward in places, with frequent typos, which I found extremely distracting. The fact that the game ties in with real-world locations and companies was kind of cool - knowing that I could own the same dolls that are in the game or get a cup of coffee at Banjul gave the story a greater feeling of depth and realism.

From my understanding there are no changes of written content between versions, so my review should still remain relevant.\n\nNameless is easily one of the most impressive otome games I've played in recent times. For those of you who enjoyed Dandelion, wait no further. Produced by the same company that created Dandelion, Nameless is much like a spiritual successor to the popular stat-raiser, even moving on to become something much greater that keeps you at attention the whole ride through.\n\nSo, what's the deal with Nameless? It's a dating sim that was created in collaboration with Crobidoll, a manufacturer of ball-jointed dolls. And relax, even if you're not familiar with that particular type of doll, you can follow the story with ease. The story retains the Cheritz touch, now adorned with beautiful pastel art and character portraits that blink smoothly.\n\nNameless features a plot that spans the entirety of the routes, following the tale of a girl and her doll. You'll be surprised to learn the intricacies that each of the (formerly ball-jointed) love interests hide within their heart; normally this fact alone would be sufficient for an intriguing story, but everything adds up to a fantastic and impressive finale that will milk your tear ducts dry. \n\n---\n\n[b]Lovely Art[/b]\n\nThe art composition is simply fantastic. The character sprites mesh well with the backgrounds and they complement each other to the point one may wonder if it was a happy coincidence or done purposely. The anatomy isn't much of a problem (though consistency can be a problem when comparing CGs), and the art accomplishes what it seeks to. The game establishes a wonderful atmosphere of its own through the attention put into the visuals.\n\n[b]Atmospheric Music[/b]\n\nDiscarding the hip and stylish music of Dandelion, Cheritz aims for a softer, gentle feel with the background audio for Nameless and it works without becoming dull. And of course, the BGM can easily boost up the tension when the scene calls for it (and boy, do some scenes call for it). \n\nBesides the opening music for Nameless, there are also four ending songs (Lance&Yeonho, Red&Tei, Yuri&Yujin, \"What's Your Name?\").\n\n[b]Characters with Depth[/b]\n\nI feel that the true strength of Nameless is in the depth of the characters and the interactions between them. Some characters hide more beneath their surface than others. But all of them are brilliantly written and have problems that need solving; the fact that they are dolls is not ignored, and adds a lot to their character that wouldn't otherwise be there.\n\n[b]Touching Story... with some small rough edges.[/b]\n\nI had heard before purchasing Nameless that there was inescapable Fangirl Mobs, as it is, that surround every single member of the romanceable cast. And it's true! I do not recommend this game to those who cannot stand such things. The thing is, though I despise such things, how they interact with the Fangirl Mob shows, and causes, character growth. Because of this, I was able to overlook it.\n\nBesides this plot device the story was, as I said before, probably the most enjoyable otome game I have had the pleasure of playing in recent time. It would be spoiling to explain its brilliance in detail, but the characters and how they all come together was executed fabulously. The story is more about developing the relationship so things end quite quickly after the couple gets together, which may be disappointing for some audiences.\n\nThere were bad ends where things felt too sudden, and/or even anticlimatic. On the other hand, there were also bad ends that added quite a bit of depth that wouldn't have otherwise been there (yay, worst-case scenarios!).\n\n[b]Convenient System[/b]\n\nA straight VN not too different from a choose-your-adventure novel where you read the story and are faced with options that will lead you to different endings (to tell you ahead of time, there are several bad endings and one good ending per character route). All the characters are voiced except Eri, the heroine.\n\nThere is a diary feature in the right-click menu that conveniently summarizes and occasionally, adds depth to the events in the game for you. You can even flip through the pages. It's very useful for those who play erratically and must recall their stopping point, but this feature also plays a part in the plot itself.\n\nThere is an auto-save and even a whole page for your quick saves on the load screen, so you have little to fear in case your game crashes and you lose your spot. This was very convenient!\n\nIn the \"Extras\" menu, you may go over the content you've covered in the \"Memory\" and \"Album\" section. This is quite the handy feature for whenever you want to view a scene again, but remember you can't use the right-click menu (and thus, cannot view texts nor the diary) as you would be able to in-game.\n\nAs an added bonus, this game is trilingual, allowing you to flip between Japanese, Korean, and English (you have to return to the menu when you switch, though).\n\n[b]A Bit Picky, But...[/b]\n\nIn terms of prose, the game was a bit lacking. I cannot be a judge of the translation as I don't understand Korean, but the writing could definitely improve. Especially for visual novels where the writing is one of the most important parts, I believe that fluid English is important. Most importantly, I think this game would benefit from an editor who is proficient in what they do; there was the occasional typo when I played the non-Steam version. I even noticed they would mention things that never happened since I chose a different choice.\n\nAs for SFX, well... there were times when it was a bit strange, but nothing too out of order. \n\n[b]Conclusion/Thoughts[/b]\n\nNice game with nice music and visuals and even nicer story.

Throughout the story, there is much intrigue over how her dolls have taken on human forms, and with each route you play you come closer and closer to finding the truth. \n \nThere is no stat-building in [i]Nameless[/i], and the Status page on the main menu only provides a short bio of the five main characters, so it may be a tad difficult to know if you have made the correct decisions to reach the \"true\" ending of any given path; however, this also makes it a bit easier to get all of the possible endings a path may have, as it usually only requires only one or two \"incorrect\" choices to be made to trigger a bad ending. This, combined with the time-saving Skip feature, makes replaying for the sake of getting all the endings convenient. [i]Nameless[/i] also features a Memory section on the main menu, where you can view any scene you have viewed before--a great addition for those who want to experience a specific section of the story again. \n \nThe characters in [i]Nameless[/i] are very well-developed, each with very unique personalities and conflicts. The five main characters each have their own route in which the protagonist watches them confront their flaws and grow from it--and the protagonist herself shows some character growth, as well. Even the secondary characters, such as the protagonist's friends, Soi and Shinbi, are surprisingly developed and enjoyable--a rare sight in otome games, where the focus is almost exclusively placed on the dateable characters. The characters you meet are easy to get attached to, even if they are not one of your dateable dolls, which ultimately adds to the charm of the game; regardless of whose route I was on, I would always enjoy when Soi and Shinbi were around, and I would be happy to visit Banjul to see Mr. Hobin and Zion. I would genuinely look forward to seeing how they grew and reacted to the situations around them. \n \nThe visuals of the game are beautiful, and the music is fun and fitting. The voice acting is top-notch, and adds even more enjoyability to the characters. There is a massive amount of content, as I have not completed every route even after playing for over 27 hours. Each path is lengthy, with a lot of different events and CG's. Some bad endings can be surprisingly dark, but still add to the overall tone of the game, which becomes almost tragic as you try to piece together the identities of the two unknown figures who seem to be involved in bringing your dolls to life (if you have played Cheritz's previous game, [i]Dandelion[/i], which I also recommend, you may be able to recognize a certain voice and see some overlapping themes, but it is not required to fully enjoy this game). The game is usually light-hearted, but prepare to feel a myriad of emotions throughout each route. \n \n[i]Nameless[/i] is a thoughtful and emotionally provoking game, with very strong characters and mysteries that keep the reader hooked.

A few months earlier, I had just purchased Dandelion and had the most pleasant experience playing a dating sim game in a long time. And seeing as Cheritz released another game, I decided to get it, being interested in a darker storyline.\n\nLet me just say, this game is absolutely enchanting. It is another game from Cheritz, the makers of Dandelion Wishes Brought to You. (If you haven\u2019t played it, I definitely recommend doing so as well!) Unlike its predecessor, the storyline is dark and chilling, and gets rid of a stat raising system that I missed a little bit. Also, at times, some of the character\u2019s thoughts frightened me.  I didn\u2019t expect to get a game over so quickly, especially in a dating sim. But it don\u2019t let that get to you! It is a truly beautiful game. I\u2019ve cried a multitude of times playing it. \n\nI was expecting a pretty magical storyline from Cheritz, and one I received. The story follows a girl named Eri, who is left alone in Korea as her parents work abroad. She purchases five ball jointed dolls, in hopes of reducing her loneliness. Miraculously, one day, her dolls become human. At this point the story begins to unfold. You are able to choose which character\u2019s route you would like to go on. In the beginning you can choose to pursue Lance, Yeonho, or Yuri. Eventually you will be able to pursue Tei and Red. The reasoning for that is the storyline which will unfold itself in each of the character\u2019s storylines despite how little information is given. I found myself surprised by all the foreshadowing. \n\nLike I said previously, the storyline of Nameless is very dark at times. While lighthearted at times, the story delves into darker thoughts of obsession and past scars. Each of the dolls have different personalities developed from how they are supposed to be doll wise. For example, Tei is supposed to be an exclusive premium doll nicknamed Prince Sunshine due to his kind and caring nature he was given as a doll. As a doll, they have a fixed set of talents and personalities that affect them as they become humans. Plus, their personalities are shaped by their pasts as any human. Some of the dolls become twisted due to how they were treated in the past. I feel like that Cheritz deals with the issue well, and it is definitely something that made me love the storyline. Each of the characters grow from their pasts. \n\nMoving on, the first thing that drew me to this game was its art. The art is absolutely beautiful, just as Dandelion is. It will most likely be the first thing you notice in this game. The color of the characters and settings complement the dark storyline. It is easy on the eyes, and is quite pretty. Another thing I really liked was, there was little difference between the doll\u2019s human forms and doll forms. Seeing as they are ball jointed dolls, I suppose there would be little a difference. The dolls are from an actual company named Crobidoll. Let me just say, ball jointed dolls by Crobidoll are very beautiful and intricate. I would buy several Tei dolls and Zion dolls in a heartbeat if they weren\u2019t all out of stock. *cries.\n\nWhile the art was beautiful there was some small inconsistencies in the art. Some CG\u2019s were drawn by different people at times. But it isn\u2019t too big an issue. The inconsistencies are not huge, and you might not even realize it\u2019s there.\n\nNext is voice acting! I\u2019m a huge fan of voice actors, and I believe that voice acting is something that contributes to a game greatly. I for one, will most likely put down a game or turn off the voices if the voice acting is poor or I think the voice acting doesn\u2019t fit the character. Let me just say, if you are like me, the voice acting will not let you down. Each of the character\u2019s personalities are brought out wonderfully by each of the voice actors, from Red\u2019s cheerful enthusiasm to Yuri\u2019s flirtatious nature. I will admit to crying a whole lot while I played it, and I also giggled at some of the character\u2019s argue.  I hope I don\u2019t sound pretty creepy for saying this\u2026 but I actually felt flattered by Yuri constantly calling the MC \u2018My Honey\u2019 and \u2018My Darling\u2019. That is how skillful the voice actors felt to me.\n\nA concern for many players seem to have is misspellings. Is it that bad? No. It\u2019s usually just a few words missing a letter. There are not that many, but I think having an English editor would fix this issue. I\u2019m pretty sure many would vie for the job if they were offering.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Absolutely. It has a whole lot of replay value, it\u2019s worth the money in that aspect. Plus, you will find yourself falling in love with each and every one of the characters as you play each route. My opinion changed for several characters positively. I can definitely say that for Yuri and Tei.", "timestamp_created": 1421564488, "timestamp_updated": 1421628985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642867", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14043737": {"recommendationid": "14043737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141772612", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433045167}, "language": "english", "review": "I was very much excited for Nameless when the game was first announced.

The hours displayed is not a good indicator of my playtime of this game (which isn\u2019t any different from the original version) or how much I love this game.\n\nNameless ~ The One Thing You Must Recall is a compelling and somewhat complex story about a young woman (Eri) and her ball-joint dolls (BJD) who have mysteriously gained a human body. Chertiz brings back a familiar (and very welcome) face as one of the two mysterious males who appear to be the antagonists of this story.  Unlike its predecessor, Nameless is a pure visual novel with a few mini-games to break up the hours of story content (which is a welcome relief for some).  If potential players are looking at buying the typical otome game where everything is happy and angst is completely off the table then I would like you to turn around and walk away this instant\u2026 and come back when you\u2019ve decided to explore the otome genre a bit more.  Nameless is not going to be good for everyone; it has some pretty dark and potentially triggering themes but I believe for this very reason, Nameless at it\u2019s core, is an amazing story that begs to be explored.  \n\nAt first glance, Nameless appears to be a very linear and somewhat predictable story, supported by a very attractive male cast that takes the form of the typical; Tsundere, handsome-and-knows-it, energetic-innocent, the cute one and team dad/mom, that otome games are notorious for. And sure, if you\u2019re going to just give it an hour of playing then yes, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ll l see.  Unlike a lot of mainstream (english) otome games, Chertiz brings a real depth to their characters. None of their characters are to be taken at face value; especially the ones that you think are going to be a certain type of person. I was blown away at how much effort went into the characters; especially how they went beyond being just their stereotypes. Chertiz brought us interesting characters with Dandelion but with Nameless they brought us complex and damaged characters. \n\nPlaying Nameless will give you a warm fuzzy feeling but it will also make you feel completely and utterly guilty for ever leaving your childhood toys in that box in the attic. So if you\u2019re ready to embark on a beautiful journey of self-acceptance and love then press that purchase button and play until you cry. <3", "timestamp_created": 1421553556, "timestamp_updated": 1421639055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532206", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14042490": {"recommendationid": "14042490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042034516", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419896218}, "language": "english", "review": "I never played that many visual novels or otome games until I stumbled upon Dandelion on steam and bought it on a whim. I ended up doing nothing but playing that game for the next few days, this is the second game from the same company so when it finally got greenlit I bought it instantly. I haven't finished all routes but so far I'm really enjoying this game. If you've played Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - then you will most likely enjoy this game as well. The characters are lovable and the story is interesting. The price might look expensive for a visual novel/otome game but you get what you pay for. This is the second game from this company yet it's so well done. But enough talk let's just dive right into my pros and cons.\n\nPros\n- A MC with her own personality and friends outside of the \"boys\", this makes her seem more believable and fleshed out as a character.\n- Lovely side characters, they have fleshed out personalities and are interesting in their own way\n- Lovely Art\n- Sounds, the music is good and there's sound effects for things going on in the story to help flesh out what's going on around you.\n- Great Voice Acting, I love the voices although they are in Korean. If you don't like this you can turn them off, you can also choose to just disable a certain persons voices in the settings if you only dislike that one voice.\n- They got rid of the stat system from Dandelion, so unlike Dandelion there's no time in the game where you will just go around clicking random objects without progressing the story at all. While this might make it feel like less of a game and more of a visual novel it  really helps the flow of the story imo.\n- Different endings, each character have different endings that you can unlock. One happy ending and a few bad ones.\n- And last but not least, an interesting story. The story itself ties together through all the different routes you play. This keeps the game interesting. Each character also have their own story so it feels fresh when you play a new route and the overlapping story makes you want to play them all.\n\nNeutral things (cons to some and pros to others)\n- The MC is not voiced in this game unlike Dandelion, I personally liked the silent MC but I can see some that might have wished for a voice option.\n- Can have a bit of a slow start where you only click through text, don't worry you'll get plenty of opportunities to make choices as the prologue is over.\n\nCons\n- There's a few translation errors or typos, I can't say I've seen that many but there's a couple in there. The ones I did see didn't bother me personally since I understood what they meant and they were few and far between, so it's not a big deal.\n- No lip movement when talking, Dandelion had this but this game don't. That's something I personally missed.\n\nThe game might no be perfect but it's a good game, each character have their own worries and problems and acts human. It's a very good Otome game and if you enjoy these kind of games then you will most likely enjoy Nameless as well and if you like Nameless don't forget to check out their older title called Dandelion which is also available on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1421548592, "timestamp_updated": 1421548592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14042104": {"recommendationid": "14042104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059694183", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421539507}, "language": "english", "review": "Well I found this game while I was glancing at steam.  Nameless: The one thing you must recall, I should be remembering about this game\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\nOh! Right! This is the Crobi doll game. XD \n\n\nSome backstory, I first found about Crobi when I entered a charity raffle at Anime North a few years ago. I ended up winning a Lance doll in the charity raffle. I went to the website and saw my lance didn\u2019t look like any of them on the site. I found out that the doll had been given away at an event. I have to admit I like mine with his eyes open better. I found on the website that they were making a visual novel based on the dolls but I never seen the site update about the game so I forgot about it until I saw it on steam. I must admit I am not the kind of person who plays these kind of games, so take anything I am about to say with that knowledge in mind. \n\nOnto the game itself,\n\nIf people are unaware of what a visual novel is then allow me to tell you it\u2019s more of reading a book then playing a game. Get ready to click the mouse for 99% of the game. The two little mini games are two far and in-between to really break up the continual clicking. This brings me to a little thing about the quiz game that I feel might be a culture difference from Korea. You must answer questions and you have a O for true and an X for no but when you hover over them the O is red and the X is blue. This could make you think that X is true O is false.  There are little problems with the translation, spelling errors, slight programing mishaps when suddenly names are not translated or the main characters name being replaced with %. There could have been more polish to the translation especially when something is trying to be funny like shouldn\u2019t Johnson be Willy?\n\n In this game there are \u201croutes\u201d or parts of the story that focus on each of the boys with two final parts that bring everything together. This gives the game some sort of replay value but on each route you will find a lot of things repeating. Like how many times the main character\u2019s friend has to put twitter on main character\u2019s phone in a slightly different way with you getting no new information out of it. \n\nI find the story to be well done but not without faults. It made me laugh a few times and cried a bit on the final ending but some points I was struggling to pay attention. If I had to but the story simply I would have to say it was a 20 hour darker bits of Toy Story game. I found myself wanting the story to be darker to keep my attention.  Don\u2019t take it like this will be a gore fest. Lance seems to get the most realistically fleshed out. Owners bias maybe. We have the three different stopping playing with you toys is abuse stories that are all slightly different but it adds to themes repeating.  The ending seems incomplete as I find it didn\u2019t give us any look into the consequences of the ending. I must admit things like this, Toy Story and The Brave Little Toaster is why I cannot throw anything away.\n\nThe character art in the game is absolutely gorgeous that I would like them to be my desktops but some of the backgrounds just look off. The soft character art style sometime clashes with the harder art of the backgrounds it can be distracting. The art matches the characters well but there is colour coded personalities at work here. You can understand their personalities and their problems just by looking at them. I really didn\u2019t find any surprises but at least I got lances personality down perfectly just by looking at his doll, so take from that what you will.\n\nIn conclusion, in no way do I find this a bad visual novel; if you like this fall in love with the boy and fix the problems kind of story you will like this. If you like that and are a fan of Toy Story you will like it but it\u2019s not my kind of story. I like to congratulate the writers for making me care about the side characters and making the main character more than a plank of wood that never does anything and waits for everyone else do save them. I like how only a few times it peeked though that this was an advertisement for Crobi dolls and some other caf\u00e9. I am disappointed that there isn\u2019t a route for Sinbi; regardless of the fact she\u2019s female. Overall not a bad visual novel but considering the price I would have waited for the sale if I didn\u2019t own Lance and wasn\u2019t a general fan of Crobi dolls. If this review ever does get back to Crobi I just like to thank them for their support if Doll North and I hope they continue to do so as I wouldn\u2019t have got my Lance any other way. \n", "timestamp_created": 1421546603, "timestamp_updated": 1421546603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14041850": {"recommendationid": "14041850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024736203", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498803270}, "language": "english", "review": "*This review is based off of the version of Nameless directly from nl.cheritz.com. I have hardly played the Steam version, but I have played the game.*\n\nEri (name changeable) lives alone (of course) in the house that her and her now deceased grandfather used to share. Ever since she was a child, Eri has been collecting expensive ball-jointed dolls. Her parents are always away on business, so Eri was closer to her grandfather than her own parents. This also caused Eri to form strong attachments to her ball-jointed dolls and treat them as if they were people. One day, Eri\u2019s dolls come to life and now her house is full of unnaturally attractive men.\n\nUnlike Dandelion, the first game Cheritz made, Nameless has no stat raising elements. This allows there to be more focus on the side characters. Where as in Dandelion there was only one side character, Nameless has five side characters, each with their own distinct yet believable personalities and relations to the main character. Eri may be living alone, but she does not progress through the story alone. Her two best friends Shinbi and Soi are always trying to help Eri through hard times. There is also Hobin, the owner of Caf\u00e9 Banjul where you will be spending a lot of playtime, and Zion, one of the waiters. It would have been interesting to see a short side route for Hobin or perhaps even a full route for Zion. Of course, the most entertaining character in the entire game is by far Yujin, the school doctor. He is in love with his skeleton model named Beatrice and often makes Eri go on errands for him. His comments and overall personality adds some humor to the game.\n\nAs opposed to most otome games where the suitors do not know the main protagonist or one is her stereotypical best friend, all of the suitors in Nameless know and love Eri and understand her loneliness. Their relationship starts out awkward since they were dolls who came to life, but this is quickly replaced with a feeling of family. Eri has lived alone for 3 years, having only the dolls as her company. Now she can actually talk to them and have them talk back. Each of the suitors also has their own unique \u2018problem\u2019. Most problems stem from the suitors trying to break free or follow the design guidelines that the doll company made. For example, Red was created as a \u2018Super Hero\u2019 style of doll and Yeonho was bought online and had a previous owner. You can speculate on your own how this might influence the doll\u2019s actions and personalities. Living without almost any family influenced Eri\u2019s personality as well, but she still reacts to situations much like anyone else would. She accepts that the dolls came to life, yet starts to panic when she realizes that five attractive guys will be living with her. Her expressions are on par with the protagonist of Dandelion and it is refreshing to have a strong protagonist in an otome game. The player can easily relate to each of Eri\u2019s actions. This makes it somewhat difficult to pick the \u2018correct\u2019 dialogue option since many are realistic reactions to the situation.\n\nThe routes of the games have to be played in partial order. Lance, Yeonho, and Yuri must be played first, then Tei, then Red. Lance\u2019s, Yeonho\u2019s, and Yuri\u2019s routes start out almost the same until you actually get onto their path. Even then, some moments are a little similar. Tei\u2019s and Red\u2019s routes are overall completely different than the other routes. The \u2018hidden\u2019 route has almost no similarities whatsoever and must be played last. Having the \u2018hidden\u2019character be last makes sense, but the order of play felt odd. I felt that Lance made the most sense as the person to end up with Eri, but apparently Yuri and Yeonho are just as likely. Never once did I think Eri should end up with Red, and yet he is the last main route played. As for what order you should play in, there is no real reason to play any of the first three in a particular order. I would recommend Yuri first since Yuri seemed the least connected to Eri out of the three. I played, Lance, then Yeonho, then Yuri, but that was probably not the best way to play. Recommended play order: Yuri \u2013 Yeonho \u2013 Lance.\n\nMany of the choices in the game once on a characters\u2019 route have unforeseen consequences. Otome games always have right and wrong choices, but the consequences are often almost immediate or close to immediate. Most of the time, you will not know if you picked a bad choice until much later in the game. One seemingly trivial decision can cause a bad ending solely on its own. I remember one such instance in Lances\u2019 route in particular. Several of the bad ends involved one particular character and completely changed my opinion of him; I did not even want to play his route.\n\nYou can unlock diary entries for each of the characters, including the side characters. You can also unlock voice clips of the different characters. These are often unlocked by getting the endings, bad endings included, and beating the two mini games. There is a card matching game and a quiz over facts about Nameless, Dandelion, Cheritz, and just random facts. You can quick-save right before each mini game to ensure A+\u2019s on each. For the quiz, most answers can be found on the games\u2019 websites but simple memorization can allow you to pass without actually hunting down the information.\n\nThe music in the game added to the slightly dreary mood and the characters. Yujin\u2019s and Yuri\u2019s themes were my personal favorite themes. Red\u2019s theme matches his \u2018ready for action\u2019 personality and Yeonho\u2019s theme had an innocent feel to it. Sadly, the opening video did not have a translation for the theme. Only a translation for the ending theme is available and that is only in the separate drama CD.\n\nThe voice acting was well done. All of the voices matched what you would picture for the characters. Soi\u2019s and Yeonho\u2019s voice actors in particular did a good job at executing different emotions. Yujin\u2019s voice actor also did an excellent job at really sounding in love with Beatrice so I suppose that is a good thing.\n\nIf you have played Dandelion, then you know how the game is going to end. None of the endings felt very happy, even the \u2018true end\u2019 with the hidden character. The routes end abruptly and they are not open ended. The endings still felt less depressing than Dandelions\u2019 endings.\n\nThe CG\u2019s in the game held less emotion than the Dandelion CG\u2019s did. The CG\u2019s were often just someone sitting or standing, not really doing anything. Also, the CG art really reminds me of the CG art from Dandelion. The pastel art style of the game did not transfer to the CG\u2019s. I enjoyed both art styles, but the pastel art really set the melancholy mood of the game.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player must name their first doll. The game does not give you any clue as to what this is so people may just put their names in. Unfortunately, after naming the first doll, it then asks for the protagonist\u2019s name. Do not make the same mistake; name the first doll something other than your own name. \n\nOverall, Nameless is a strong otome title. The storylines all interlock well yet still retain distinct differences. Each character is different and truly loves the protagonist. The supporting cast has almost as much screen time as do the suitors. Even on a character\u2019s route, the other suitors are still integral parts of the game.

At the same time, the fantastical elements of the plot (a.k.a. world building) inform the characterization. So, for the most part, they are one and the same. This is not in any way a bad thing. I would say the characterization strong and deep enough that I\u2019m still finding motivations and subtleties for the varied cast even a year later. The Bad Ends, especially, have been a point of discovery \u2014 while some, at first, can appear to be \u201crandom\u201d or added simply for shock value, over time I\u2019ve recently discovered even the most bizarre of these has a satisfying explanation by digging deeper into the plot\u2019s world building characterization. \n\nWhile most of the game will be understandable at the shallowest level, there are enough elements implied to provide satisfaction for those who enjoy a narrative that rewards thinking about the world and the characters that live in it. \n\n>>blahblah) What I love ) Playing with tropes and archetypes, starting out familiar and branching out to make its own story from basic concepts.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n\nThis will be a bit more of a mixed bag, simply because there are a few elements of this visual novel\u2019s interface I have a bone to pick with; however, let\u2019s start with the positive elements\u2026which is nearly everything! This game is super lovely.\n\nSo let\u2019s get negative instead. \n\n[b]The Text Box[/b]. I despise it.\n\nIt is pretty, yes, BUT. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=377103927]See here[/url]. Not only is it the width of the screen, but it also is leaves just enough space at the bottom for a pixel-high transparent distraction. Ah!! Visual claustrophobia!\n\nDecreasing the box\u2019s opacity in the options menu [b]will[/b] lessen the transparent line\u2019s impact; alas, doing so means the name tag and text box will darken wherever they touch, which is nearly as distracting.\n\nLike it or not, the text box is inescapable.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\n\nWhile the controls for the most part are simply point-and-click, there are a number of things that cannot be accessed simply through a left-click of the mouse. \n\nUnfortunately, there is no indication within the game what the controls are; you have to either stumble across them by accident or surf the internet for hopes of a guide \u2014 and IMO essentials such as a menu and script should be obvious for even a first timer.\n\nThis weakness could be rectified a number of ways.\n\n- a tutorial \n- a list of (keyboard or mouse) control shortcuts \n- a help button, either on the title menu or on the interface to access a page explaining how the auto text works, skip etc.\n- or, if such cannot all be contained or too awkward to insert, a notice [i]within the game itself[/i] on where to find such information \u2014 perhaps Online or in a readme.txt\n\nThis is especially important for Steam customers considering most won't have a Cheritz account.\n\n[h1]Translation/Localization[/h1]\n\nWhile the translation from Korean to English appears to be competent, having an educated grasp on the English language and idioms, it is also incredibly clunky in places; filled with typos, grammatical errors, and awkward lines of phrasing. \n\nWhile the voice acting can compensate for this weakness somewhat, this cannot be done if the player is Deaf, or for any of the Main Character\u2019s unvoiced dialogue, thoughts, or narration. There were a few too many times I was frustrated by a confusing line I needed to interpret, or a joke that was simply unfunny due to a dully worded dialogue.\n\nThis issue could easily be remedied by hiring another person to help in the translation process, perhaps someone both capable of running through the translated text in order to help achieve a more natural feel on top of QA\u2019ing for typos and errors.\n\nHere are some specific examples (confined to the Prologue and Common Route)\n\n[b]Inconsistencies & Contradictions[/b]. Yeonho vs. Yeon-ho in the story vs. menus. Years the grandfather passed away; was it 1 year or 3? (Especially noticeable when separated by only 15 minutes of reading)\n\n[b]Repetitious dialogue[/b]. An abundance of repetitious lines can become irritating to read. Perhaps spicing these up or cutting parts of lines when the repetition is unnecessary.\n\n<Sample A> \n[spoiler]Yuri snatched my fried egg and ate it.\nYeonho: \"Ah... \"\nYuri took away the fried egg Yeonho made.[/spoiler] \n\n<Sample B>\n[spoiler]MC: \"I don't really feel the need to change it\u2026 I only call and text anyways.\"\nIt's exactly as I said.\nI'll only be calling and texting so I don't need other fancy applications.[/spoiler] \n\n<Sample C>\n[spoiler]MC: \"Don't you have to take off that mask now? You've had it on for too long\u2026\"\nI'm slowly getting worried he's having it on for too long.[/spoiler] \n\nA very similar issue with [b]overstating[/b]. There are many times in the text where an action, subject, word, or situation is already implied from earlier text, and it is not only unnecessary but obnoxious to repeat this. \n\n<Sample D>\n[spoiler]Oops, I got caught up in Red's prank without knowing. \nI never realize time passing by when I'm with Red.[/spoiler]  \n\nIn the above case, repeating Red\u2019s name as the subject when \u2018him\u2019 would have been a better pick.\n\n[b]\u2019Chick\u2019[/b] I\u2019m not sure where to put this, but this decision to literally translate Yeonho\u2019s nickname impacted my impression of the character from beginning to end. Chick is slang for 'young woman'. It was as if he was being emasculated each time it was used. A nickname less loaded, such as Duckling would have been a better choice.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, 980000/10, 50+ hours of \"\u2665!!!\". \n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=367328968]Praise the egg[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1421542097, "timestamp_updated": 1421695769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591409", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14038143": {"recommendationid": "14038143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105815193", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501541476}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a romance sim with a wonderful story that keeps you wanting to know what happens next. I have played and watched other people play romance games like this before, but most of them are different in that they have a mechanic where you raise a stat (Like intelligence or beauty) in order to progress with your love interest. Even though I liked these games too, that mechanic felt repetitive and tedious at times, because I just wanted to find out what would happen next in the story. Nameless, however, does not use this mechanic. The game progresses based entirely on your dialogue choices. How you choose to speak and act towards the other characters will affect how the story unfolds. \n\nI have only one real negative critique of the game, which is that it could use a patch to fix the spelling and grammatical errors in the translation. If you are someone who absolutely cannot stand misspellings and typos, then you may not want to pick up the game until those are fixed. However, if you can look past the errors (which probably occurred during translation), then you will find a really great story, which is the main reason why I recommend this game. \n\nThe story and characters are very strong. The voice acting is done well, and it gives you a sense of each character's personality. The characters feel three-dimensional, and they are very likeable across the board. I was especially happy that the main character has a real personality and sense of humor, unlike some romance sim main characters, who feel rather flat and colorless. The romantic interests also have very interesting personalities, motivations, and stories of their own, which has kept me wanting to play through until I have seen every piece of the story. I have not played through every path yet. However, the stories and characters in Nameless are so intriguing that I plan to try to get every ending, good and bad.

Honestly. \n\n~It has alot of replay value. \n~The music is Suberb. \n~Voice Acting is Perfect. \n~The art....My god the art. Simply love the art style. \n\nSure it has some flaws.

I've read that the subtitles have alot of errors from other reviews. But they didn't bother me. I didn't notice any errors too major. The story had me intrigued from the moment I began reading. Unlike a couple other visual novels where i lose interest very quickly no matter how hard I try to wait it out. (I get distracted and lose interest very easily sometimes.) This game touches on themes of loneliness, abandonment, self worth, self hate, and acceptance. These topics resonate, and they create an experience that is sure to stay with the player long after the game is finished. Just click, read, and enjoy.

If you've played Dandelion these characters are definitely darker. However they're not just like that as flavor. Their problems and pasts, and the way it's affect them, flow very well with each of the characters. They're all very distinct.\n- The MC's friends actually matter. Her friends Soi and Shinbi actually have their own personalities and matter throughout the course of each route. They plays active roles in helping the MC out, as well as receiving help.\n- Compelling story that gets progressively darker the further you get.\n- The Art. The character designs, sprites, were all lovely. The backgrounds were nice, but in general I don't pay too much attention to the background art. (Unless it's Cinders, so pretty. *_*).\n- I'm in the camp of those that enjoyed the audio, especially the music when things were going wrong. XD\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Typos/Grammar Issues. Honestly my brain tends to auto-correct things to the point I don't always notice small grammar issues or typos when I'm not reading to edit and I'm incapable of editing whatever I'm reading, but I did spot some. I never felt like it ruined the game for me though. I've spotted typos in published books. It happens. It sounds like others have had bigger issues with this in the game than I did, but given the enjoyment I got out of this VN it feels like nitpicking.\n- Some of the CGs were admittedly pretty awkward, especially those belonging to Tei.\n\n[b]The Price:[/b]\nI understand a lot of people look at the price and wonder WTF? This is one of the higher quality games on the market with 20-40+ hours of gameplay depending on your reading speed. I played this when Cheritz first released the game. I don't know how many hours beating it the first time took, but second gameplays are always faster and it still took me 33.3 hours to complete.\nThat's not just it though. This game is fully voiced, has many CGs, audio, and has been translated. For its cost you get a lot out of it. Games like this run $60+ in Japan. In America, high quality VNs tend to be around this cost. Hakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi, Backstage Pass, Phoenix Wright.\n\n[b]But it doesn't have trading cards or achievements!![/b]\nDoes that matter? You have a CG gallery, memory gallery, and diary entries all sitting there to collect. Good achievements are one you get for hitting points in the story (Dragon Age: Origins does this) or actual gameplay achievements (like for less story oriented games). Collecting all the CGs, memories, and diary entries are achievements. Yeah they're nice to have, but if the lack of them stops you from buying any game (unless you have already played the game) then you probably weren't very interested in the game to begin with. Having them or not having them has zero impact on the game itself, and to treat the game like it's worse because it doesn't have them doesn't make sense.\n\nFinally, I want to address Voxit's review since it's one of the first reviews you'll come across.\n\n[b]** Spoilers Beyond This Point **[/b]\n\nVoxit had a huge issue with the story. Yes, if you're attentive and enjoy figuring endings out before they happen you'll be able to do so. Does that make it any less touching? It did for him. It didn't for me. Unlike him I don't believe the necessarly game runs on trying to surprise you, leaving you unimpressed if it doesn't. If it did it doesn't make sense for the game to be litered with hints about what's going on. The story tries to warn the player. Honestly progressively understanding what's going on makes it as a whole creepier for me because I'm aware of how messed up the situation is. So there's another side to consider.\n\nAnd then there's Voxit's main complaint. I finished the game twice and I never found Red to be the 'true pairing'. He states this but at no point in the English translation does it support this. (I don't know Korean, and thus haven't played the original.) This is assumed. Due to the personality of the characters and the situation, Red has to come last, but just because he's the game's last route doesn't mean she necessarily ended up with him.\n\n[b]The ending is open ended.[/b] Therefore if you like open endings, it's great. If you don't you're going to have more of a problem with it.\n\nFrom what I got out of the game, I think the 'true ending' is actually when you meet the secret character. What does this mean for her romantic life for those who read spoilers or already played the game? Open ended. Yes all the dolls end up in the same dimension and in love with the Heroine, but [i]she never ultimately chooses one[/i]. Therefore the other endings do matter. It never denies the existence of any of the relationship, [i]it awknowledges them all[/i]. At the end of the game she regains the memories of all the timelines, therefore she'd most likely be in love with all of them.\n\nMaybe she started a harem and dated them all. Maybe she ultimately did decide on one, or two! Maybe she dated the secret character instead!\n\nDo I think the dolls would have fought for her? Of course. The dolls always fight with each other regardless, but do I really think that it's that much of an issue? Nope. We see endings where dolls share her between them even in their most messed up states. At multiple times do they back down to let another doll pursue her, or even help the doll to this end! To a point they respect the others, even in their fighting, and ultimately they want the MC to be happy. It's even stated at the end by Tei that it required [i]all[/i] of them to fill her heart, and they all understand and agree with this. So no, I don't think, whichever ending you decide to go with, that it would have been a problem.\n\nI think it's of use to point out that the dolls are just that: dolls. [i]Her[/i] dolls. It's shown that dolls pretty much love their owners unconditionally to the point of madness. Even when they become human they're still connected to their doll bodies, shown by the fact that if something happens to the dolls the same thing happens to their human bodies. \n\nAs for how the Wizard continued to make new dimensions I have no idea. Lawl. That's a flaw I'll tip my hat to Voxit. \n\n[b]** End of Spoilers **[/b]\n\nI'll leave off with my impression of the game. Maybe the game is actually more about how the relationships between characters can change people for the better and help all invovled heal. It's about obsession and scars, how they fester, and how they hurt. It's about growing up and how people change in theat process. It about the fight between the private and public self. And it's about real friendships and the unconditional support they bring.", "timestamp_created": 1421149759, "timestamp_updated": 1421149843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738895", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13963982": {"recommendationid": "13963982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106014093", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420419933}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, I have played quite a few otome games and Nameless~ The one thing you must recall~ has easily became number one on that lengthy list.  This game is filled with plot twists that you don't expect, beautiful artwork, passionate voice acting, in-depth dialogue, and amazing character development.  If you have played through Cheritz's previous game, Dandelion Wishes Brought to You, then you also had to deal with the whole \"bring up the love points until they're human\"-bit and while it's fun the first time, it gets old quickly when all you want to do is get to the individual character's story.  Well, that is no longer an issue as you only have to play through the prologue for three out of five of the characters and even though that may still seem tedious, it changes each time and you are given the option to skip through the parts that you have been previously exposed to, so no worries for those of you who are as impatient as me!  Similar to Dandelion, there is a secret character's story that intertwines with each of the main guys' stories...and it gets intense!  When you finally get through every one of the main character's stories, the anticipation you feel will be so incredible that by the time you actually get to playing through that part of the story, your eyes will be glued to the computer screen in suspense!\n\nTo briefly summarize the actual background behind this game, main character (player) Eri collects dolls and one day, they come to life.  The first thing that came to mind when I learned of this was that that's actually kind of terrifying (dolls freak me out ^^0).  However, if you put yourself Eri's shoes, you'll realize that this is actually a dream come true for her due to her feelings of extreme loneliness ever since her grandfather passed away.  From the moment that she made each one's purchase, she fell in love with them even if they were simply inanimate objects.  Now it is the player's choice to go with one of the dolls Yeonho, Lance, or Yuri at first and later Tei or Red.  Each character has it's own charm, although my personal favorite was Lance ^^.  When the player encounters all of the boys at the beginning and learns about their personalities, the first impression that the player may get is that these are just your run-of-the-mill, stereotypical otome game guys.  The silent type, the flirty playboy, the cutesy shota boy, the kind and sweet boy, and lastly the innocent/happy-go-lucky boy.  However, the player soon learns that each one is so much more detailed than the orignal first impression that they were given.  Honestly, one of the things that I like most about this game is that all of the characters are so complex, it's so interesting to learn about each one that you just want to keep playing.  Not only are the characters of the boys so interesting, but the art for them is so beautiful that you may even find yourself getting caught up in the beauty of the character's appearance.  The CGs that you get when you pick correct choices are stunning, so much so that I'm sure that we as players are not even able to grasp just how much work and care was put into each individual drawing.  The artwork truly enhances the overall experience of the gameplay just as much as the interesting dialogue and overall story keep you wanting more.  Another enhancer to the game was the voice acting and I can personally tell you that it was amazing because you just want to take your time and listen to the voice actors speak each line.  There is so much passion and emotion within their voices, giving the game a new dimension and making it really come to life.  \n\nThis game had me laughing outloud, smiling weirdly to myself, making me want to punch a pillow (the bullies >n<), and cry for over an hour.  While all of that may seem a bit exaggerated, trust me when I say that I'm not overdramatizing the emotions I felt when playing this game (espeically when it came to the secret character's story *cries*).  I absolutley adored this game to no end.  Thanks to all of the beautiful artwork, intriguing dialogue, amazing plot-devlopment, and passionate voice acting, this game is easily one of the best otome games I've played in a long time.  Would I recommend this game?  Yes yes and yes.  I have already recommended it to friends who like otome games and will continue to bother them until they buy it >:3.  Was it worth the full price of $33?  Yes, it is worth that and more, without a doubt.

Is this game worth buying? Yes! Does it have issues? ... also yes. Normally I'd recommend this one on sale, except it never seems to be on sale. The game has some very strong points, and as many a reviewer prior to me has pointed out: it has ALL THE FEELS. But for something this pricy, one would think it would be more polished than it is.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, the interface functionality is a step up from Dandelion, and the background music is not intrusive. This is a plus given how often one has to listen to it on a loop. The characters are also very engaging, and for anyone interested in the subject of transhumanism, this game provides some good thought fodder. Some of the routes are hilarious, others are downright disturbing, so buyer beware if you're expecting nothing more than a light hearted wish fullfillment.\n\nAs for gameplay itself: the emphasis this time is definitely on the 'novel' end rather than the 'game' end. No stat management, although there are decisions to be made regarding how you respond to the characters that determines how things go.\n\nAlthough I'm no believer in a \"perfect\" game, I do think a game should be polished, and there are some issues here that really should've been caught before the release, and haven't been fixed nearly a year later. They really needed someone to check the spelling, grammar, and punctuation for the translation. Sometimes the love interest's names aren't capitalized, things are misspelled, and there's frequent confusion between \"you / your / you're.\" \n\nThe skip button sometimes does not work, and this is an important function in a game where the opening sequence is nearly an hour long on its own, and you'll be revisiting it at least three times, or more if you're like me and have an impulse to be nice to everyone and keep getting an accidental game over. It also occasionally forgets what the main character's name is, even if you left said name on default.\n\nConclusion: It feels a bit odd to say this, since normally I have the opposite problem. But I love the game's characterization and art and plot. I don't have issues with the story. I wish they'd taken more care with the functionality or had at least released fixes for what was wrong.

This visual novel will take you in many different directions.

I have thoroughly enjoyed the game and despite the seeminlgly high price, you kinda understand why this game costs this much when you consider the content and hours of gameplay you get out of it. I feel that there is more character development and hours of gameplay in Nameless than Dandelion, hence the higher price.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the characters from Dandelion more but Nameless is one of those games that you really grow to like the characters more as you proceed in the game. I also feel that Nameless has exceeded its predecessor in its plot by miles, which is incredible since the plot of Dandelion was already exceptional. I have to praise Cheritz for having such original and creative storylines that are so gripping and keep you up for nights just so that you can go through the whole game and see how they form a big picture together! \n\nOne criticisim is the english translation. I can certainly see improvements of the English translation since Dandelion but there are still, from time to time, some errors in both the grammer and spelling (tenses, difference between its and it's etc, typo like 'Soi' instead of 'so'). I am of course not by anyway saying that I am a master of the English language but if Cheritz wants to step up the game, I will highly recommend they have more people to do the proof reading (I saw the credit and understand that there are one translator and two proof readers already) and perhaps seek alternatives. I think it is something that Cheritz should honestly look into as the errors were, in my opinion, really distracting and make the game seem less professional, which is a great shame. \n\nSame as Dandelion, there is a section that was not translated in English (the Christmas card messages in Dandelion and the bonus in Nameless). I know that for Dandelion, Cheritz has already said that they would not offer any translations. I think it's ridiculous as it surely would not take them that much effort to do so, plus we all paid for the game so shouldn't we all get what we ought to get? Even just post a translation on the website or something... If Cheritz is willing to just put in that extra effort then it will make us players more satisfied with the game and I hope Cheriz will consider that. Another small thing I would mention is that the female lead in this case doesn't have a voice-over, which I found a bit of a shame and I would recommend Cheritz to add it back on for the next game.\n\nOverall, Nameless is a great game and it's great that Cheritz has taken players' comments into account when making it. I think it's great that there are multiple bad ends for each characters, increasing the hours of gameplay. Oh and how can I forget the references to Dandelion every now and then (I want that mug of all the Dandelion anaimals!!!) in the game and the end songs (sung by the characers) were awesome! Massive thumbs up to Cheritz---well done and keep up with the work and I look forward to what story twist you will think of to link all the characters' stories together (better not be by the wizard again as that will get old)!

Bugs which previously existed for some users were quickly fixed by Cheritz. As for the content of the actual game:\n\nStory: The plot follows Eri, a girl who has been living alone due to the fact that her parents work abroad, and her only other family, her grandfather, passed away. To ease her loneliness, Eri has collected 5 ball-jointed dolls. They all come from a company that\u2019s known for having dolls \u201cwith a soul.\u201d Surprisingly, one day she wakes up to find all five of her dolls have turned into human boys. Through a series of misunderstandings, they begin attending school with her in addition to living together. The game follows Eri\u2019s life as she becomes closer to the boys, and of course, the player makes choices to romance one of their choosing.\n\nNameless may have a very bright exterior and be filled with lots of jokes and fun, but it also isn\u2019t afraid to address darker themes, such as abandonment, the fear of not being accepted for who you are, abuse, and having parents who don\u2019t understand or connect with you. And while I can\u2019t get too far into this without spoiling, Nameless is interesting in that it provides a canon and plot-related reason as to why you can start your game over and over again to romance different characters. This gives extra incentive to keep on playing the game, as even if you\u2019ve finished the route of the boy you are the most interested in, you never know what the next route might reveal about the overarching plot. All this adds up to make the story a fun, engaging, and rewarding experience.\n\nCharacters: As far as the five datable boys go, I have no complaints at all. Each boy has a very distinct and unique personality, and Cheritz certainly isn\u2019t afraid to get creative with their character set-ups. Everyone is very well developed throughout their route, and I always ended a route with a much better understanding and appreciation for the character I had finished pursuing. There is nobody who I find dislikable among the boys, as even the one I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to like I had become completely empathetic to over the course of playing his route.\nEri herself is also well developed. She does have enough character of her own to be a well-rounded lead while still being easy to identify with. I appreciate the fact that through the routes she comes to terms with her problems with her own will and effort, and while the boys certainly do help her, none of them magically make everything better just with love. It makes for a more realistic story and character development.\n\nThe most notable side characters include Soi and Shinbi. They\u2019re an absolute pleasure to have around. It\u2019s actually somewhat uncommon to see an otome where the heroine has pre-existing female friends who play a large role in the story, but that\u2019s exactly what Cheritz included with Soi and Shinbi. Both are hilarious characters in their own way, while also being wonderful friends who are fiercely protective and supportive of Eri. As well, Soi and Shinbi aren\u2019t lacking their own development, and it was great to see that the two aren\u2019t neglected just for being side characters. All the characters of Nameless are interesting in their own ways, and that just helps the game to shine.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay of Nameless is really quite straight-forward, as it plays out as a fairly typical visual novel. As the play you will read through character dialogue and descriptions of events, and every now and then be prompted to make a choice for Eri, which can possibly lead you to a bad ending if you are not careful. This takes up the vast majority of the gameplay, and while not done badly at all, it is just fairly standard of otomes. There is one \u201cexam\u201d minigame where you simply answer trivia about the game and character under a time limit, but it only occurs once per character route. If you enjoy visual novels, you\u2019re probably not going to have any issues at all with it and enjoy it quite a bit, but if you\u2019re not, this probably isn\u2019t going to offer much in terms of gameplay that\u2019s different enough for you.\nOne thing that does stand out is that you are not allowed to pursue any boy of your choice straight from the beginning. Instead, you must pick from \u201cgems\u201d on a menu screen, each of which representing a different boy, and you cannot access certain boys\u2019 routes until you\u2019ve completed other characters\u2019 routes. This is done very purposefully, as each route is written in a certain so as that it adds up to slowly the overall plot and story, so you do not accidentally reveal big plot details early into your playthrough.\n\nIn comparison to Dandelion the quality of translation has improved. While Dandelion did not have a bad translation, there were still some distracting typos and grammar mistakes scattered throughout the game. Nameless still has a few, but there are far fewer ones than in Dandelion, and all of the dialogue flows quite nicely in my opinion. I mentioned this in my Dandelion review, but I do think perhaps having a native English-speaker do a \u201ctest reading\u201d of the script just to sweep for any simple spelling or grammar mistakes may be beneficial to improving the overall translation quality if it is a viable option for Cheritz.\n\nArt: The art of Nameless is very nice. Pretty well everything in the game is original art, and it\u2019s all very well done. One of the first things that got me excited about Nameless after its announcement was the color palette. The colors of Nameless are rather pastel, almost a little washed out, but it still manages to feel very bright and warm at the same time. It\u2019s very pleasant to look at. The character sprites are all also very nice, and I really don\u2019t have any complaints with the art style they chose to go with. Each character looks very individual and unique, and you can tell each part of their design was chosen to help emphasize their personality.\nThe CGs are all very nice too. The background are also very nice in my opinion, featuring those same soft colors I enjoy while seeming to be done well from what I can tell. Overall, I find Nameless to be a very visually pleasing game.\n\nSound: I very much enjoyed the voice-acting. Though I know due to the fact that I do not speak Korean I will not be able to pick up on certain intricacies of the acting, from what I can tell everyone does an amazing job. Each character\u2019s voice suits them very well, and I can easily sense the emotions they are trying to convey.\n\nThe music is very enjoyable. Each track has a unique identity, and every character receives their own theme. Other than one track carried over from Dandelion, all of the music is completely original. A nice mix of instruments are used and they complement the overall feeling of the game very well. The opening theme is also very nice, and it\u2019s cute how the lyrics are very specific to the actual plot and is obviously about all of the boys\u2019 feelings towards Eri. Perhaps my favorite track though, is \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Name\u201d which is a beautiful, melancholic song only for completing the secret character\u2019s ending, and it reflects the entire game quite well. I own the OST, as I find this game\u2019s soundtrack to be a delight and something worth having around.\n\nOverall: Cheritz has created yet another top-quality Otome game with the addition of Nameless to their lineup. It is an enjoyable and memorable experience from beginning to end, and chances are if you\u2019re interested at all in it, you will end up enjoying it thoroughly. I would highly recommend this game as it is worth every dollar, and I excitedly await the arrival of Cheritz\u2019s future games as well.", "timestamp_created": 1420874639, "timestamp_updated": 1420874639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13896158": {"recommendationid": "13896158", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997817336", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431607217}, "language": "english", "review": "I've spent over 26 hours in this game in three days, and have completed all of the routes except secret 2 and a couple of game overs/bad ends. I am a very, very fast reader, so results are probably not typical and most will spend a bit more time in the game.\n\nI downloaded the demo at first. I've only (pretty) recently gotten into the visual novel scene so the price seemed pretty high to me. But I realized quickly that you don't see many otome games and I've never seen one with VAs. The demo was enough to pull me into the storyline and take a chance on the full game.\n\nAll I can say is: holy crap. The storyline is absolutely addictive. I really enjoyed the music and the art is also quite lovely. While I can't understand Korean one bit, the VAs seemed wonderful. Soi and Red's VAs really stood out for me - the tones of their voices seemed to go perfectly with the characters.\n\nThe gameplay was a bit different than what I was used to: no stat grinding/leveling up/etc. The stat stuff is OK at first but then it just becomes a hassle whenever you get into the storyline. Instead, this is just decision based, so it is easy to focus on just the story itself. I much, much prefer this, even though it seems easier to get to the bad ends/game overs sometimes for one \"wrong\" decision you made early in the storyline.\n\nThe character development and storylines are great. There aren't any heroes (well, maybe one!) or \"perfect\" boyfriends here.  I'm all for characters with psychological issues and this sure the hell delivers. A few \"bad\" answers and the love interest's psyche shatters. And sometimes, the MC's psyche shatters. I love it! The MC also is not a perfect lady and has a great personality. It's fairly easy to relate to her.\n\nI also really liked how the storyline slowly began to clear up, different things were revealed... I was quite surprised on my third storyline.\n\nThe game does have a few issues with typos, grammar, and sometimes the formatting. I saw elipses being \"centered\" in a couple of storylines, while they were all normal [...] in the others. There were also some inconsistencies such as... \"Young Me\" and \"Young %n (broken - MC's name did not transfer properly)\" \"Girl [Korean Character]\" instead of \"Girl #\" and I think a few gender inconsistencies (Maybe they were not inconsistencies but it definitely stood out to me.). It wasn't enough to break it for me but I couldn't help but to snicker at some of the issues.\n\nPutting the menu on right-click was a different choice and I quicksaved for about an hour or two until I accidentally figured it out.\n\nOverall, this game was definitely worth my $30 and I have no regrets. It was a wonderful story with beautiful art and great VAs.

IIRC you can go in any route order but a few of the characters are only unlocked if you clear the game 1-3x and not before. Art is nice and reminds me of water colors along w/CGs. VA is very good too for the different scenes.  Story can be a bit confusing but makes more sense after you clear the game and gain info.

I was a fan of Dandelion and I thought, \"Oh man, this game is going to be so great!!\" Sadly, I was left with disappointment. I know there are many people who will disagree with me, but hey, I disagree with their opinions, so whatever.\n\nThere are SPOILERS below so if you have not played the game, you may not understand why I cannot recommend this game.\nI will not cut this game slack just because it is one of the few translated visual novels or because it's one of the better ones. I will judge this game as I would any other professionally made game.\n\nIf you are reading this, this probably means you have already played the game and so it's not necessary to explain it.\n\nOne of the big issues with this game that I've had is probably the the typos and translations (I am Korean so I can understand what they're saying). The typos are abundant and sadly there are quite a few typos even in very serious moments which ruins the immersion of the game. I understand if there were a couple of typos here and there, but this game is just filled to the rim with them and for a game that's supposed to be professionally done and so painstakingly advertised, I would have expected better. The translations aren't terrible, it's just some lines are awkwardly translated into English. Almost as if they were put into google translate, and were translated literally from Korean to English. \n\nAnother problem I had was the art. The sprites were great but many of the CGs were honestly pretty lackluster. The characters faces would look distorted or strange, as well as their proportions. The background art was also pretty mediocre at times, it may not be too noticeable but if you give it a second glance, you can see how awkward it was. But I guess most people don't really care about that, unfortunately I still do.\n\nNow the biggest issue I had with the game is definitely the story. They tried to imitate what they did in Dandelion by having a surprise character like the Wizard, except in the game, he was always there giving us knowledge of his plans and when everything was revealed, we were expected to be surprised. If we weren't expected to be surprised, then probably unimpressed. The ending isn't as touching when you know exactly what is going to happen. I guess the true surprise plot twist was the ending where the Heroine always disappears at the end of every route except for Red.... This is where I got mad. The ending, I'm sorry, was nonsense. The game completely disregarded the fact that it's an otome game by telling you that the other endings you got with the characters literally do not matter. It made all the characters seem like side characters and all the routes you played were irrelevant.\n\nThe true pairing is supposed to be Red and all the guys from the different \"dimensions\" appear in the same world and let's not forget, they believe they are in love with our Heroine and she loves them, too. Wouldn't that create conflict and mass confusion between the characters? Apparently not because the game just ends! Did anyone think this through? WHY DID ANYONE THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA!? \n\nSimilar things happened in Dandelion but the thing with Dandelion is that they don't deny that the characters got together. Each ending belongs in a different dimension so it did happen, it still exists somewhere. However, in Nameless, that's impossible because the Heroine and all the characters are transported into one world and therefore denies the existence of their relationship. \n\nSo yeah, every route played beforehand didn't really matter. Red is the only one that matters. Don't get me wrong, I still like Red, but it's still disappointing to find out that everything was meaningless. \n\nAlso, how the fuck did the Wizard continue to make new dimensions when in Dandelion he said it took a shit ton of effort and I doubt that one doll or one person had enough memories to restart everything five times......... >_> But I'm just nitpicking....\n\n(I don't have many hours on Steam because I got it before it was on Steam)\nSo is it worth $32.99?

This game isn\u2019t just happy times and fluff; the guys in this game all have issues. Nameless can be very cute but I don\u2019t think there has ever been a time I have ever been so suspicious of tea.\nTo start off, I love all of the characters in the game; every single one, which doesn\u2019t happen often in visual novels. The main character is cute and funny and is overall very likeable. The five main guys each bring something different to their routes to not make the game seem repetitive. My favorite quality about the guys is that the conditions and concepts of the dolls are incorporated into their humanized forms. The dolls that were bought used have scars from being damaged, Yuri knows how to play the drums, and Red acts like a warrior of justice. The personalities the dolls have from their concept play a major part in each of their routes which makes each route worth playing. To be honest, the side characters might be my favorite part of the game; they are just as great as the main characters, especially Soi and Shinbi. It\u2019s refreshing to find a visual novel where the main character has friends that are legitimately good friends and care about the main character. \nThe plot of Nameless is just as interesting: beautiful dolls that come to life and live with the main character? It\u2019s definitely an appealing setup. There is a nice mixture of content in each route. Most of the routes have their cute moments, but every route has a turning point where things get emotional, or frustrating, or just intense. The greatest part about the plot is that throughout the game there are hints of an over arcing plot that you see at the end of every route and whenever you start a new route which ties all the routes together and since Nameless is not a stat raising game like Dandelion, replaying to get all the routes is less of a hassle and you can focus on just enjoying the story. \nAlthough Nameless is great in a lot of ways, there were still a few things that I could pick out that were not so favorable. There were a few grammar issues here and there, but that was to be expected from a game that wasn\u2019t originally in English and there weren\u2019t enough to be bothersome. What really bothered me was that while the backgrounds, character sprites, and most of the CGs were beautiful, some of the CGs were a little awkward looking. For most of the routes it wasn\u2019t really a problem, but for Tei\u2019s route especially I found that most of the CGs in his route weren\u2019t as pleasing as the some of the others, which was a little disappointing, but still not enough to take away from his route.\nOverall, Nameless is a wonderful game. $33 dollars may seem like a lot to pay for a visual novel, but for a game that is easily 30+ hours of constant entertainment, it is one of the rare visual novels where I feel it\u2019s actually worth spending the money. It\u2019s easily in the tops of my favorite visual novels.\n", "timestamp_created": 1420579705, "timestamp_updated": 1420579705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701405", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13862137": {"recommendationid": "13862137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113339809", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485952355}, "language": "english", "review": "Definately not my usual choice of game, but i enjoyed it none the less.

Do you happen to be an avid collector of ball-jointed dolls? Do you want to never look at dolls the same way again? If yes, then Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~ may be the game for you.\n\nThere is an overall plot throughout the game which does a wonderful job tying all the routes together. As you complete routes, Eri is fleshed out more and you slowly find the answers to the mysteries surrounding the game. Unlike Dandelion's stat-raising mechanics, Nameless does away with that in favor of a traditional visual novel format with two mandatory mini-games per route (True/False segment & Memory Cards).\n\nNot going to be able to list everything due to character limits, but...\n\nParts I liked:\n* Voice acting. Not familiar with the Korean language, but I felt you could get a good sense of the cast's personalities and emotions through the voices. Also, I enjoyed Soi's voice actress whom I felt did a wonderful job bringing out the best out of Soi's quirky, outgoing character; her voice was one of the reasons I loved Soi when playing the game.\n* Art. Though some of it were some awkward parts (e.g. Yuri's long neck in the CG of the dolls first appearing as human) was beautifully colored and the sprites did well portraying the characters. The artist did a good job adapting Crobidoll's characters into the game.\n* Nameless/???. For someone behind entire the plot and acting as an antagonist, I feel the writers did a great job with him. He did a lot of things that sometimes makes you want to scream \"STOP\" (e.g. Ripping out parts of Eri's memories, etc), but at the same time, you could almost feel sympathy for him. If you have fond memories for the toys you had when you were little, then you may almost tear up when you learn more about Nameless/???'s story in the secret character routes. Also, like Soi, I felt his voice actor did a wonderful job bringing out the creepiness within him.\n* Eri and the dolls' issues. The game touches on various themes such as abandonment, self-worth, identity, how one presents themselves to society vs their true character and hobbies, etc. throughout the story as it explores the characters of the love interests and Eri herself. Eri and each guy have an issue either dealing with abandonment by their loved ones (Yeonho, Tei, Nameless/???), their own sense of identity and self-worth (Lance, Red), loneliness (Eri, Nameless/???), love (Yuri), and various other issues which the game does a wonderful job presenting to the players. Each character has developed their own attitudes and personas in order to deal with their inner conflicts, but as you dig deeper into their routes, you slowly learn not everything is as it seems it is. \n\nParts I feel could be improved on:\n* Though this is common practice for VN protagonists, I was disappointed Eri didn't get her own voice actress unlike Dandelion's protagonist, Heejung Kim. In Dandelion, I felt the player could better sense Heejung's conflict with dealing the high expectations of her mother and during critical plot moments when you heard her speak. In Nameless, I had a much more difficult time being able to relate to Eri because of her lack of voice. Also, I noticed Eri's face/body in most CGs was either obscured or out of focus unlike the guys. Again common practice, but still disappointing since I liked how Heejung had a visible face and presence just as much as the guys in CGs in Dandelion.\n* Editing. I feel the editing job could use more work. There are a lot of noticeable typos especially in diary entries, and also awkward phrasing (e.g. Spirits and Mystery Club & Discipline Guide vs Occult Club & Disciplinary Committee Member). Also, I've noticed that stuttering has been translated with commas instead of dashes (e.g. Wha, What vs Wha-What), which looks out-of-place. The translation is actually pretty decent for something done in-house, however.\n* I feel the guys' popularity is too overblown and doesn't do much to serve the story. Also, the fact that Eri gets bullied in certain routes, especially Red's, for being associated with the guys doesn't serve the story much beyond the need for convenient drama and reenforcing the negative stereotype of women being so single-minded for men that someone so much as saying hi to their crush becomes an enemy in their eyes.\n* Handling of the more unstable characters' issues. The game does a wonderful setting up characters such as Yeonho and Tei as unhinged, but does a poor job handling them in the endings. You've got Yeonho who reveals himself to be obsessed with Eri as he bombards her with texts, clings onto her to the point of ignoring everyone else to be with her, sets up plans to make her come back to him and even going as far as to attempt to strangle her to be \"together forever\" with her in one bad ending due to his abandonment issues. Then you've got Tei who has bouts of insanity that he tries to keep under control and is involved in many of the game's bad endings. However, despite the great set up, these behaviors magically go away in the good ending of their routes. In real life, these sort behaviors Yeonho and Tei display and the issues associated with them normally take years to change and cope with provided they get professional help. I'm fine with emotionally unstable love interests in unhealthy relationships. Hell, I'm fine if the good end is them admitting they have issues and taking the first step to change, but it's not even that. The minute they hook up with Eri, whatever emotional instability they displayed before just... disappears as if those issues were never there before.\n\nDespite the wordiness of my criticism for Nameless (and when I like something, I get wordy about what I feel could be improved on), I definitely do recommend getting the game since the overall story is definitely worth it.\n\nAnd a final note: For a professionally done & fully voiced game, I feel it was right for Cheritz to price it $32.99. If you're still unsure if the game is worth it, I recommend trying out the demo available on [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/339750/]Steam[/url] or on [url=http://nl.cheritz.com/en/download]Chertiz's site[/url] before buying.", "timestamp_created": 1420526059, "timestamp_updated": 1420929877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13859349": {"recommendationid": "13859349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028691387", "num_games_owned": 410, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437539148}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't gotten very far in Nameless, but if it\u2019s as good as Dandelion then I don't mind throwing down the cash.

Nameless, like it's predecessor Dandelion, shoves the idea of that in your face, using it to tell a masterful story. \nGameplay is different than Dandelion. Instead of stat raising, you just read and pick certain path choices. I personally enjoy the challenge of Stat Raising versions of Otome Games, but Nameless had such good story and gripping writing I was never bored with the wall of text I was faced with. \nI didn't connect with the boys as much as I did in Dandelion, personally I felt the majority of them were too possessive, however the game does a good job weaving dark story plots in with the light hearted \"My dolls became real!\" narrative and the boys insecurities and phobias become relatable through the writing. \nCheritz is a wonderful company doing wonderful things and if you want to support the Otome/Visual Novel industry making it's way to English speaking markets, these are MUST HAVE games.", "timestamp_created": 1420446050, "timestamp_updated": 1420446142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13838723": {"recommendationid": "13838723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036444099", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437354460}, "language": "english", "review": "I know some people were complaining about the price but it worth every penny.

Simular to the previus game, it can get a little dark for some of the bad endings but it's such a rare expereience in these games that I actively seeked out each and every end. I really enjoyed how this game was tied in with the previous as I really do like Wizard's character. Each boy has a real-life problem that you have to help them overcome and as you do so, you become closer. I really enjoyed seeing these and how the slightest thing could offset the balance. As you unlock more of the boys routes to play through, the story does change so you aren't playing the same thing over and over so the reply value is pretty good. After completeing everything I invested nearly 50 hours into this game and it was well worth it. A great experience.

Character driven stories are the best part of the gaming experience, and while the routes in Nameless are too dark to be my favourite dating game, it's still been worth every penny for other reasons.\n\nThe art is beautiful, and greatly improved from Dandelion. There are interesting side characters in addition to the date-able males, my favourite of which are the best friend duo Soi and Shibi. I loved it every time those two were on the screen. Female friendships are often left out of dating games to focus on the males, and this was a refreshing change. The main character Eri has a fleshed out personality, unlike some other eyeless MCs that are meant to be a stand-in for the player. In Nameless, the player is identified in some fourth-wall breaking.\n\nAs an owner of a ball-jointed doll there were definitely some moments I could relate to, like being nervous about taking the head cap off to change the doll's eyes, and talking to the dolls yet being too embarrassed to tell my IRL friends I own one. Cheritz really did their research in partnering with a real BJD company. The CG of the dolls on her shelf is perfect, they looked like real BJDs and not just a drawing.\n\nThe music, voice acting, and extras like the mini-games, Eri's diary, and her phone texts, all add to the atmosphere. There is a depth to Nameless that you don't get with Voltage or other pay-per-route otome games. \n\nMy only criticism is that the dialogue options feel random, and don't necessarily reflect what the male needs to hear directly. How did I get Lance's bad ending when choosing between \"I'm fine\" and \"stand up to look at him\"? That's way too generic when I wanted to say \"I won't abandon you\" to reassure him. I went back to choose again and the dialogue immediatly afterwards did not change. There should be a direct indication you chose correctly, like the bomb animation in Sweet Fuse or the flower animation in Hakkouki. \n\nThis game has one surprise after another, and I fully recommend it to anyone who enjoys visual novels. I fell in love with each character, and my wish is that I could all of them the happiest dolls together. Bringing a dating game to the English market is a risky move, and I'm so glad to have the opportunity to play Nameless.\n\nChertiz interacts with the fans, and has answered my questions directly, and posts new art sometimes on Facebook.

Bonus points for having a likable main character, often I find otome main characters to be far too meek but Eri stuck me as fairly realistic for her age. Her friends were awesome as well. \n\nThere are some translation errors, I kept noticing words without spaces between them in the diary and some dropped letters. Gender is also confused several times when in conversation with minor NPCs. This wasn't enough to detract from my understanding or enjoyment. I would really enjoy it if Cheritz would translate the bonus messages that you can unlock as you play, I really loved reading the unlockable diaries which are in English.  I know people think the price is high but this is really quite reasonable for a fully voiced game otome game of this quality.  If enjoy these kinds of games or it looks intruiging to you, I would highly reccomend you give it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1420327955, "timestamp_updated": 1420327955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13817274": {"recommendationid": "13817274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119030177", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471710393}, "language": "english", "review": "Cheritz certainly knows how to make a good game.  :)\n\nI finally recieved my first ball jointed doll after waiting six months for his arrival. His name is Hibiki and though he hasn't been here long, I can understand a lot of the feelings the heroine felt about her dolls. \nShe really treasures all her dolls both new and second hand. Seeing how their doll selves were seamlessly integrated into actual human characters was really great to me. Not to mention those EYES. The doll forms of the characters' eyes truly look like those of a BJD. Even their human selves resemble those doll like characteristics, though obviously in a more human fashion. \nNow enough about dolls (for now~) let's talk about the game. \n\nI'm certainly pleased with the array of characters there were. And as we've learned from Dandelion, nothing is quite as it seems when it comes to personalities. I won't give too much away though...what would the fun of that be? ;) But using their pasts and their 'types' of dolls as a foundation for personality was really clever and lended to interesting characters with more depth than is seen in many of the visual novel games currently in English.  I won't give any details, so as not to spoil any routes, but there is a cast of characters who will make you want to be a part of their world. \n\nThe story itself is presented in four segments. One includes three of the characters, which must be played before the second. The same goes for all but one of our five doll's routes to be finished before the third phase happens. Each phase is intertwined in the story. And it's obvious that a few of them can sense it in the little things...Just goes to show how intricate and neat the story itself is. The final phase of story is a post-route 'treat' that explains things a bit better. \n\nI will give this little warning though. You might want a tissue or five. All of the routes have their roller coasters of emotions, but a couple of them in particular were enough to send me crying and reaching up to hold the hand of my BJD who looked at me with concerned eyes the whole time. The routes have plenty of laughter, happiness and warmth in them as well though! I can say with confidence that there is never a dull moment. \n\nAs is the Cheritz way, the endings leave you with a feeling of longing, like you wish you (aka the heroine) could just be happy already. You might be strong and just feel a bit sad. Or like me during a few, you can cry like a baby. \n\nFor someone who also liked Dandelion, it was cute seeing things like the poster on the wall in her living room (the dandelion painting) and the heroine's mug (Which had three rabbits and two cats all of very familiar looks). The homeage to them was adorable. There's another major homeage, that you'll be able to tell right away if you remember the music. ;) But I'll leave that for you to discover as well! \n\nAs someone who has played over 40 Visual Novel games, this has to be one of the best I've ever played. As well as having been the one that left me the most emotionally exhausted in every way possible. I'm so happy I played and I sincerely hope more people out there will try it and love it as well. <3", "timestamp_created": 1420323841, "timestamp_updated": 1420323841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13813965": {"recommendationid": "13813965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023216972", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434053953}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't really played any dating sims before, but this was a pretty interesting game.  I bought it because I like text-heavy games, anime, and dolls.  Like most games of this type, there isn't much gameplay other than reading text and making extremely occasional choices to make the story go in a different direction.  The choices you make determine which guy the main character, Eri, decides to get together with.  Without spoiling too much, it's about the emotional issues that dolls might have if they were alive.  Yeah.  If you're creeped out by dolls, you probably don't want to play this.\n\nI've finished two endings so far.  The first time I played I just picked the choices that I would normally pick and I'm guessing I got the \"you failed\" ending because it came up really quickly, there wasn't anything romantic, and it didn't make any sense.  The second time I got the ending where you get together with Yeonho, which was rather sweet and a bit sad as well.  It seems that there is a \"deeper layer\" to the story based on [spoiler]the weirdness of the bad ending, the question about the name of your first doll/memories about the doll in the closet, the weird dialogue on the black screens, etc.[/spoiler], but I haven't figured out what it is yet.  I'll probably play all the routes just to see what the explanation for all that is.\n\nOne of the things that stood out to me about Nameless is that it's really polished (besides a few spelling errors, but I'm guessing there aren't as many in the original Korean version).  The art and the music is well done, and everybody besides Eri is voice-acted in Korean.  Even random characters like classmates who have like one line, and Eri's parents who you meet for five minutes.  The intro and ending animations were really cool to see since the rest of the game is not really animated.  Things like the diaries and the phone were nice touches.  One of the best features is a \"skip\" option that, when replaying for a different ending, lets you skip past dialogue you've read already really quickly.\n\nOf course, in a game like this, the most important thing is the writing and characterization.  It's pretty good, from what I've played so far.  The translation feels natural-- there was definitely a lot of work put into localizing it in a way that makes sense to English speakers, rather than just a straight translation (which can be stiff sometimes).  The guys in the \"dating pool\" all have distinct personalities, and so does Eri.  I especially liked the characterization of the Eri's two best friends.  The bits of mystery scattered throughout are subtle enough not to be annoying, and do their job of making me want to replay the game.\n\nThere were only a few things that bothered me about the game.  Clicking twice with my trackpad causes the game to minimize-- luckily it doesn't happen with my mouse.  You can't hit spacebar or any other keyboard key to advance the text.  Also, this isn't a real complaint, but I couldn't help but wonder why nobody at the school thinks it's weird that these guys look just like and have the same names as these dolls (especially Lance, who's apparently the most popular model and is mass produced)?  I mean, there has to be at least [i]one[/i] other Crobidoll fan at Eri's school.\n\nAll in all, this is a good game with an interesting story, and a great first dating sim to try.", "timestamp_created": 1420313408, "timestamp_updated": 1420313408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13799516": {"recommendationid": "13799516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008821594", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481432186}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow....I'm almost at a loss for words.

Well my friend, you can put your fears to rest. Nameless is different enough in gameplay, art style and character to make the game new and exciting but with all the humour and developed plot that made us love Dandelion. If you haven't played Dandelion it doesn't matter, this game is beautiful regardless!\n\nThis game is more obviously in a visual novel format, so far I haven't seen any of the stat changing/ affection raising bars that you might normally expect in a dating sim. It's quite nice though because the story is written in a way that you don't really mind the lack of autonomy in where you go/ what you do. It makes the relationships you form in the game feel more natural and fluid, as sometimes the decisions you get to make aren't obviously leading towards any specific character. It's less superficial than stalking the one you think is the prettiest and doing whatever actions you know will get their heartscore up. Don't get me wrong there are those obvious decisions too, but it's nice to get a mix! Every so often theres a lil' game thrown in there too, just to spice up the VN feel.\n\nI think what I love most about this game though is that it genuinely makes me laugh due to it's content, not because of any mistakes or bugs. The script is witty and has translated well (John the cat is a beautiful example of this ;D) which is important for a game that focuses on a visual novel format. The characters are wonderful too, I don't really play many dating sims and I feared that they would be too similar to the character types in Dandelion. Admittedly they do adhere to a few stereotypes of the personality they are given (the small one is cute, likes sweet things, is adoring etc.)  but I think that the creators have injected enough variation that they aren't just the stereotype, they have a few more facets to their personality.\n\nI've really been enjoying this game, just as much, if not more, than Dandelion. And I played Dandelion A LOT. I would definitely recommend Nameless to anyone on the fence about spending their hard earned cash!\n\n(Also, if you end up loving Nameless you should totally go play Dandelion. Serious.

Your story will be about creating memories and understanding who and what your now-human dolls are as you go to school with them. Will they be your hero? Or your prince?

While I love the zero stat-raising, I love the added mini-games which tie to the plot even more!\n\nThe game is divided into 3 'gem' type of routes. Only Lance, YeonHo and Yuri have a Common Route while Tei and Red do not. You have to finish Tei's route to get to Red's route but the trio (Lance, YeonHo, Yuri) can be played by any order. \n\nI recommend that you play Yuri first. Followed by Lance, then YeonHo, Tei and Red. This order creates a marvelous linear storyline.\n\n[b]Writing:[/b] \nThe writing is strong. The main concept and underlying plotline of memories (much like Dandelion) is well executed. You will not get tired of the story even with the multiple playthroughs you have to do for Yuri, YeonHo and Lance.\n\nThe interaction between characters really do show their personality. I for one was able to relate to Eri easily as she REALLY reacts like a typical teenage girl. That being said, her friends, Soi and Shinbi and other side-characters were given a good dose of character that is believable.\n\nThe way the story was written and that ending twist shows me how strong their storytelling are.\n\n[b]Art:[/b]\nAll the art were pastel coloured with that deep purple coloured UI as a foil really made everything pop to me. The care and effort that went into the art really showed! Though some CGs still suffer from the funny angles they are in, overall they have created a world which BJDs really did come alive.

Dunno why they chose to use an edited picture but I'm sure they had their reasons.\n\n[b]Music:[/b] \nThe music is soothing and yet haunting at the same time. It suits the art to a T. I love how it changes to create the desired atmosphere at the correct times in the game. I REALLY, really want their OST.\n\n[b]Voice Acting:[/b]\nI LOVE THEIR VOICE-ACTING! It is refreshing to hear Korean voices in an otome instead of the usual Japanese. The emotions and personality really came through in the voice acting. My favourite was Yujin, believe it or not. Probably because his obsession for Beatrice really sounds believeable.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts:[/b]\nThereis so much that I enjoy about this game and there is so little I could put it in words. The themes of loneliness, abandonment, self-discovery, confidence and many more makes this game a visual novel that is on par if not better than most visual novels I have played before. Though it being a Cheritz game do not expect it to be all sunshine and roses for the happy end.

It's a unique intermingling of two seemingly different communities, and it's fantastic.\n\nThe game features beautiful graphics and a talented voice cast, but what truly elevates this game are its characters.

This allows for much more focus on story progression and character development which, evidently, plays to Cheritz's strong points and results in a solid otome game. Additionally, the pacing is much smoother and more even in Nameless, thanks to the early character introductions and purely visual novel format.\n\nOverall, Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~ is a remarkable visual novel experience and is well worth checking out.", "timestamp_created": 1420179401, "timestamp_updated": 1420179401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479815", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13770535": {"recommendationid": "13770535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090627668", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439024874}, "language": "english", "review": "After learning of the existance of Cheritz a few months ago and playing Dandelion, Nameless' predecessor, I found out about this game, Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~, and I knew once I had the opportunity, I would definitely buy this game. And so I did, after Christmas, when I had the money, I bought Nameless , and since, I have been playing it when I have the opportunity. I'd only wished I had found this game sooner - I am a huge otome fan, and it was one of the best experiences I've had with an otome game, and one of the best investments of my money in a video game, by far. Thank you Cheritz, you have made one customer very happy.\n\nNameless is a very interesting story, which begins with Eri (the main character, name changeable) and her dolls, living a normal life, until her world turns upside down and she finds her dolls ALIVE, as [b]humans[/b]. From this an intricate story unfolds which changes depending on which character route you are on. The full story itself akin to a puzzle - you only know the entire story and the truth when you have collected all the pieces (or in this case, finished all the routes). Some routes are even locked or unreachable until others have been completed, which you will understand once you start said routes, and I was glad they were locked before I headed onto them. There are even two secret endings only reachable after completing all the character routes. Each route is quite long, approximately 4 or 5 hours per route. Be warned, Cheritz is a company which jokes around sometimes, but definitely does not sugar coat stories; there will be times the story will force you into tears or make you shiver in terror. Anyone who has played Dandelion knows this, but even Dandelion fans should note that this is an even darker story than Dandelion. And there are many ways this game can end badly, which vary from mildly saddening to [i]absolutely terrifying[/i]. You will experience a rainbow of emotions as you proceed through the game, and you will probably need to stock up on your tissues. I know I had to.\n\nPeople who have played Dandelion will notice one thing definitely different in Nameless in terms of gameplay, that this is a choice based game instead of a stat-raising based game, which may or may not affect your personal opinion on the game. Your choices are critical to the story, one wrong choice could mean a bad ending. Choices vary from extremely easy to pick what's \"correct\" to extremely subtle or misleading choices which will easily stray you onto a bad ending. There are also little minigames, such as the inevitable quiz, and a card matching game. The quiz was extremely interesting for me, and I found some of the questions easy and ridiculously funny (I had one question pop up asking if the people who work at Cheritz are aliens XD), while others were actual facts, or regarded how much you paid attention to the game. These little minigames, luckily, are not extremely difficult. You will never find them a huge hinderance unless you are just skimming through the game without paying attention.\n\nNow, onto characters; the characters were one of my favourite factors of the game. Each one of them I developed a personal opinion to, depending on my experience with them, varying from absolute love to not wanting to approach them at all. Each of the datable characters is one of her dolls and has a distinct personality, with their own strengths and flaws. None of them are \"perfect\". They all have their own issues which are personal, and exclusive to their route. And as the boys change, Eri changes too, in some way or another. Eri herself was a very relatable character for me, she's a high school student, conforming to social pressure whilst having a secret hobby which goes against \"norms\" which she fears to reveal to anyone. She's a very average teenage girl when it comes down to it, the only thing not normal is her friends and acquaintances, even prior to her dolls becoming humans. And doesn't everyone have something that they want to hide from the world as it is considered \"not normal\"? \nThe side characters were also good, each had their own little quirks, and were all unique in their own little ways. My favourite thing was how each side character was characterised, specifically her friends. Her best friends were not exactly like her, and this is what I enjoyed. They both had their own personality different to her own but \"clicked\" in well. It felt like a real friendship, they didn't always agree on everything BUT they were supportive of each other. My only little rant with this is that in certain routes these side characters are very unimportant, and sometimes just seem like they were used as filler.\n\nThe graphics deserve praise; as soon as I started the game and saw the title screen, I saw how beautiful this game is. The shading, the design, the colours are all stunning and mix together really well. Nothing in design appears \"out of place\". And the CGs in this game are [i]gorgeous[/i].\n\nAs you stare at graphics, you may also notice one more thing; references! This game is a cache of references, to Dandelion, company mascots and popular culture. They range from subtle to explicit, both in script and in visuals. It's a nice and amusing touch to the game for myself, having played Dandelion and absolutely LOVING it before this one. It should also be noted that although it is set in the same universe as Dandelion, it is not a sequel to said game; both newcomers who have never touched an otome game and experts who have played Dandelion and many other otomes will be able to enjoy this game without hassle. (Even so, I recommend playing Dandelion prior to or after playing this one as it is just a really good game!) \n\nThe music is also amazing, from the opening song to the background music. The music was well composed and pleasant to listen to. The backgound music for areas always suits the environment around them, and each of the main characters has a 'theme song' which entirely suits them. I also have to give praise where it's due for the fact that the opening and ending songs for the main character routes are sung by the actual characters' voice actors, in amazing duets. \n\nSpeaking of voice actors, they are very well done. Each character has their own voice tailored personally to them which really does suit them. It is expressed well and the actors sound devoted to the story and the character. It is in Korean only though. If this upsets you, you do have the option to turn off voices for the characters in options, so it should not be a disastrous problem so much.\n\nEven with a game as good as this one though, it is not flawless. As an English translation of a Korean game, this first issue is to be expected. There are typos and spelling errors in the game, you have no idea how many times I snickered when first was spelt as fist, or window sill window seal. These errors are, luckily, easy to ignore and only rarely break your sense of immersion in the game. There are also a few glitches and bugs, however, these are not game breaking, but they may mildly annoy you. \n\nOverall, Nameless was a spectacular success that I can definitely recommend to any otome fan. The game really shows how much the company has improved after releasing Dandelion, and I am eagerly awaiting their next game, but for now, I shall continue playing this one!

The characters looked odd in some of them and there wasn't a great sense of accomplishment in unlocking them. Some bad ends felt forced and out-of-character.\n*I recommend this game purely because I thought the story was good but I honestly feel gypped by the lack of nice CGs. This game is also a lot darker than Dandelion so proceed with caution if you are buying Nameless because you enjoyed Dandelion.\n\nFULL REVIEW:\nSince this is a visual novel rather than a game, it is definitely not for everyone. Having been a fan of Dandelion (the company's first game) I bought this one full of expectations. Compared to Dandelion, Nameless was a lot darker and much more drama-filled. There are many twists and turns in the story and bad ends strike when you least expect. Though bad ends do make for interesting stories, a few of the bad ends in Nameless felt forced. Drama for the sake of drama and completely out of character. In fact, one character who shall not be named has so many bad ends (~8-10?) that his good end felt out of character for me.\n\nI felt fairly disappointed at the CGs. There was a lot of potential in the story to have interesting scenes but for some reason, the majority were fairly ordinary and not very noteworthy. When characters have outfit changes, rather than illustrate it, we are just left with no picture while the dialogue is still going.\n\nAside from these cons, the story was really well written and woven so that all the characters' stories combined to tell a whole story. The characters were well fleshed out and each one had their own distinct personality that really shined through.\n\nIn summary, this game is good for those who enjoy a really well written dark drama. For those who are more like me and prefer light hearted with cute moments this game is definitely not for you.", "timestamp_created": 1420019222, "timestamp_updated": 1420019222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13714282": {"recommendationid": "13714282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105018058", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472915004}, "language": "koreana", "review": "Best Game Ever!\n\ud544\uc790\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub54c\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud574 \ubcf8 \uac8c\uc784 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4, \uad6d\uc0b0 \uc624\ud1a0\uba54 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc774 '\ub124\uc784\ub9ac\uc2a4'\ub97c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc88b\uc544\ud55c\ub2e4.\n\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \ubbf8\ub2c8\uac8c\uc784, \uc131\uc6b0\ub4e4\uc758 \uc5f4\uc5f0 \ub4f1\ub4f1... \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac83 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\ub294 \ub2e8\uc5f0 \uccb4\ub9ac\uce20\uac00 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\ub0b8 \uc774 '\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0'\ub97c \ub192\uac8c \uc0b0\ub2e4.\n\uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4, \ub124\uc784\ub9ac\uc2a4\ub294 \ubb34\uc5b8\uac00\uc758 '\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0'\ub97c \ud655\uace0\ud558\uac8c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.\n\uadf8\ub7f4 \uc218 \ubc16\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc774, \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubcf4\uba74 \uc870\uae08 \uc704\ud5d8\ud588\uc744, \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc5b4 \ube60\uc838\ub4e4 \uc218 \ubc16\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub294 '\uc580\ub370\ub808 \uc694\uc18c'\ub97c \ub4ec\ubfcd \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.\n\uac70\uae30\ub2e4 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub294 \ubcf4\ub77c\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uace0\ub515\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud1b5\uc77c\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8 '\uc580\ub370\ub808 \uc801\uc784'\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uace0\uc870\uc2dc\ucf1c\uc900\ub2e4.\n\uc624\ud1a0\uba54\uacc4\uc758 \ubd88\ubaa8\uc9c0\uc778 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5d0\uc11c, \uadf8\uac83\ub3c4 \uc774\ub7f0 \uc0ac\uc2ec\uc774 \uac00\ub4dd\ub2f4\uae34 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\ub0c8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc6a9\uae30\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c, \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc774\uc5c8\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc131\uacf5\ud55c \uac83\uc740, '\uac8c\uc784\ub514\ub809\ud130\uac00 \uc774 \ub124\uc784\ub9ac\uc2a4\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc5d0\uac8c \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub824 \ud588\ub294\uac00'\uac00 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uac8c \ud655\uc2e4\ud788 \uc640\ub2ff\uc558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774 \uc544\ub2d0\uae4c?\n\ub2e4\uc2dc\ud55c \ubc88 \uccb4\ub9ac\uce20\uc758 \uac8c\uc784 \ucca0\ud559\uc744 \ubcf8\ubc1b\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4.\n\n\uc774\ubc88 \uc2a4\ud300 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \ud6e8\uc52c \uae54\ub054\ud574\uc9c0\uace0, \ubc84\uadf8\uac00 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc88b\uc558\ub2e4.\n\uadf8\ub9b0\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc815\ubc1b\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2c8\ub9cc\ud07c, \uc55e\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \ub124\uc784\ub9ac\uc2a4\ub97c \uc54c\uace0 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud574\ubd24\uc73c\uba74 \ud558\ub294 \ubc14\ub78c\uc774\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1419951297, "timestamp_updated": 1419951297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13711191": {"recommendationid": "13711191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048930500", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467882197}, "language": "english", "review": "My original review was too long it didn't fit, so I've cut parts.\n\nConsidering that \na) not many English translated otomes have been released (small target audience)\nb) many otome prices regularly spike up to $60 \nc) you\u2019re in for at least 25-30 hours of gameplay & \nd) the effort put into this game by a small indie company as well as the efforts the company puts into listening to its fans & improving their products is amazing...the money spent on this is well worth the buy. Dandelion will forever be in my heart, but Nameless was an incredibly fun & thoughtful journey.\n\nUnlike Dandelion, Nameless doesn't rely on interactive simulation stat-raising and instead is a traditional visual novel where the choices you make determine which ending you get. The prologue is long, don't worry over not getting to the OP right away. Most scenes appear in Eri's school, house, and the caf\u00e9 Tei works at. The recommended playing order is Lance>Yeonho>Yuri>Tei>Red. Routes average 3-6 hours each. \n\n[h1]Story/Characters [/h1] (THE MEAT. THE TURKEY. THE LETTUCE TO YOUR SALAD)\nWhat\u2019d happen if your dolls suddenly became human & lived with you in everyday life? I\u2019m pretty sure they've done this already (coughLife-Sizecough) but now as a dating sim by Cheritz bounds are, things are going to be\u2026interesting. Each of the dolls can, for the most part, function normally due to their doll concepts (interesting thing, as someone who is picky about typical tropes/illogics I found that any appearing worked well for the game because the guys were actually limited dolls with unconditional love). However, two have come from previous owners & ALL of them, being dolls-recently-become-human, are VERY MENTALLY FRAGILE/INSECURE. Every guy was fleshed out enough to be understandable and loveable. They all developed very nicely & EACH surprised me despite first impressions. I loved how character \u201copposites\u201d ended up complementing each other in each other\u2019s routes.\nThe routes are also tied to a deeper plot. It made playing them have meaning, which overall is a very smart thing, making the game end feel more complete & satisfying (well, it\u2019s Cheritz, so...semi-satisfying & partly angry).\n\nIronically enough, in comparison, the actual human characters end up not being as human. The bonus diaries help, but I would\u2019ve liked a little bit more meat (heh) with some of the side characters, ex. Shinbi. The ones worse off hands down, however, is Eri\u2019s \u2013incredibly shallow- schoolmates-cough-sheep. Oh my gosh. I get why they appear like this, but WHY. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE SO SUPERFICIAL\nAnother of the issues I have is with some of the bad endings. A few, though creepy, were unclear/unbelievable on how they might\u2019ve unfolded. They also kinda overdid it with one of the characters & led me into believing that he knew more than he did, & it was really unclear what he was trying to do with some of the things he did in his route. The last problem is more of a nitpick, but is just questioning why the MC is many times described as \u201cplain\u201d when she\u2019s friends with the 2 most beautiful girls in school. I know it\u2019s a thing regularly used but\u2026gah.\n\nAlthough the cast is younger, the script is more...perverted...heh...\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nPress CTRL to skip unread text, right-click to access menu. It'd be nice to have a little picture of a keyboard & mouse on the options screen showing keys you can press to do things. Would\u2019ve LOVED to be able to go through text by pressing arrow buttons instead of clicking only. Changing the screen to the minimized \u201cwindow\u201d version also made it difficult to access the quick save/load buttons at the bottom of the screen.\n\nA few minor spelling errors (the diary has a bit, also at some instances they mention a girl speaking when a male voice is used & I still can\u2019t get over the phrase \u201cHe is my fist doll\u201d), but these appear significantly less often than Dandelion\u2019s. Yay for improvement! :D\nA few other things:\n - Texts on Eri\u2019s phone that pop out on-screen during scenes have to be clicked again after in order to be recognized as being read.\n - After some Bad End titles appear, & midway through the transition to the title screen, the bad end\u2019s music plays again for a couple seconds.\n - Some awkward white transitions\nEDIT: Major issues have been fixed and I've removed them. Still some small spelling errors but not so many that the ones left are more of a nitpick. THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING QUICKLY <3\n\nExtra features included Eri's texts and diary being readable in-game, and in the Special section being able to read other character diaries as well, which was great and added some more depth. Unfortunately there was no translation for the audio clips in the Bonus section, so I didn't look into this that much.\n\nThe gameplay expects you to start a new game completely after finishing one route in order to grab a few more tidbits. The problem with this setup, though, is that most people are tempted to just start over at a common route save file instead, because going through the entire thing again with not much new content is really t e d i o u s\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, this is what many people are raving about. Lovely cell-shaded character designs, & soft hues of purples, reds, & greys. The character animation is done very well \u2013 I notice a lot more movement while characters talk to one another & it\u2019s not sudden or awkward at all. A good variety of facial expressions & they blink, too!\nThe rain & snow animation is excellent, maybe a little too good, because the feather animation looks a little too cartoon-y in comparison. Backgrounds are nicely detailed. CGs are well-drawn. Personally I didn\u2019t like the MC\u2019s non-uniform outfits, but that is my own preference. Other people might find them very nice.\nOpening & ending videos, for some reason, didn\u2019t appear as high-def as the rest of the game. They were nice but a little grainy.\n(also, there are VERY SUBTLE references to Dandelion, both in background, plot, & even once in casual script\u2026\u201dan orange, an apple, &\u2026cat.\u201d)\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n[b]Soundtrack[/b]\nI am someone who is a huge fan of game OSTS. This one did not disappoint, it's wonderful. Being someone who\u2019s listened to quite a few drama/video game/anime OSTs, however, I was hard-pressed to find one that really stood out to me. Regardless I am still heavily considering buying the soundtrack.\nIn contrast to the mellow OST, the opening & ending songs are pop-py & upbeat. Like Dandelion's, the lyrics relate, something that I always look for. There are 3 regular end songs shared among the dolls, & all the songs are sung by the dolls\u2019 voice actors which was A REALLY NEAT IDEA.\n[b]NOTE:[/b] The opening song is sung by Red\u2019s & Tei\u2019s voice actors. They also sing their shared ending song. Same goes for Yeonho & Lance, & Yuri's is with him &...the creepy doctor Yujin both\u2026\n\n[b]Voice Acting[/b]\nI became highly invested in Dandelion & its characters in large part due to its EXCELLENT voice acting, Nameless proves superb as well. It is very WELL. DONE. DO NOT TURN OFF THE VOICE ACTING. THIS IS THE THING THAT MAKES YOUR PURCHASE WORTH. SO WORTH. (I think one evilly laughing voice actor had way too much fun)\nI also liked how the MC\u2019s name appears in the script, & therefore \u2013seemingly- appears in the voice acting, although it\u2019s not actually mentioned. \nThe one problem I have with the voice acting, however, is that the MC has none. It also made it difficult sometimes to discern whether she was talking in her head or out loud. I guess this is to get players to \u201cbecome\u201d the MC themselves, but emotional voice acting on their part actually helps me identify with them more because then I can get how they feel in a situation. They feel more humane & realistic this way.\n\nDue to a cut review I am pointing out issues/opinions more, but aside from these, this game is great. I cried a bit.\nPlay it. \nEnjoy the ride.", "timestamp_created": 1419939235, "timestamp_updated": 1420197883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839855", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13706761": {"recommendationid": "13706761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160391932", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466876263}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright...  Where do I even begin?\n\nOkay, so I started off by accidentally stumbling onto the game Dandelion thanks to Youtube.  I've played otome games before so that was one thing that wasn't new for me.  But the stat-raising thing was definitely something.  When I first went through that game I thought it was another silly game that I would just laugh through.  Haha, boy was I TERRIBLY WRONG!  The characters crawled their way into my hearts while my guard was down and made me CARE!  And the story...  Going through all of it made my heart break several different times again and again.  Going through the stat-raising, which I was neither fond or disliking towards, felt so worth it at the very end.\n\nSo when I magically found out that the same company came out with this game, you wouldn't believe my excitement.  I immediately went to find the demo and played through it.  First off, the artwork is absolutely GORGEOUS!  I was blown away by the different settings and how all the characters looked.  Then the voice acting... music to my ears.  Then of course there was the actual music which was great.  Then the fact that they got rid of the stat-raising completely and replaced it with your standard (at least what I am used to) option-clicking in order to get the happy end with your man of choice.  There was a lot more to read and absorb from than Dandelion which was impressive and something I could appreciate.  I also felt that the main female protagonist was more relatable in certain ways and that it was alright to connect with her.  There were things that I could just GET, you know?  And the guys?  So diverse!\n\nThe demo was so good that I had to buy the full version.  So far, the money spent is totes worth it.  Seeing the scenes that were in the demo in the actual game was a great joy to see 'cause 1) things made more sense in scene and 2) it was just super exciting to recognize the stuff.  \n\nCheritz has SERIOUSLY upped it's game since Dandelion and I am so happy that they are doing great.  I hope they continue to improve and grow as they make more games.  I'm seriously looking forward to whatever it is that they come up with next.  I only completed Yuri's good-end route (with the help of a guide), but I am already greatly excited to complete ever single route (yes, the bad ones as well) so that more of the plot will unravel (like I know it will). :)\n\nIf anyone is still on the fence about it, just try out the demo.

He just wasn't as crazy as everyone else It would have been awesome if he was. Anyway I highly recommend getting this game I legit screamed when it was downloading.

The MC had this personality that just resonated at times with the player.

I just finished all the paths in Dandelion, so this was a nice after Christmas surprise. I thought I was going to have to wait much longer for this one to pop up on Steam ^_^\n\nThough not a cheap VN, the amount of time you'll spend on it and how much story is available (and the fact that there are so many voice actors) is worth it in my opinon. The artwork is lovely and the soundtrack is very nice. Though be prepared, the main character is NOT voiced like Heejung was in Dandelion. A silent MC... \n\nOverall I love Cheritz stories, and that's what I'm here for. I *am* a bit disappointed that I can't use my spacebar to move the dialogue along like I could in Dandelion, but instead actually have to click. I'm lazy like that lol. I'm just used to using the spacebar in my VN's, so it's a bit different, but I'll get used to it (though you CAN use the Enter key). And I was also a bit thrown off because of the save feature in Dandelion being the ESC key, and was a bit confused at first that it wasn't the same for Nameless. After some digging (and I'm sure people who are smarter than me already figured this out on their own) you use the right mouse button to open up the Save/Load screen in game. \n\nI'm excited to play through all these new paths and storylines though. And I hear that for this one, the boys will still be a part of the story and not so off to the side like they had to be in Dandelion. So far it's a beautiful Prologue and I'm very excited to see where their stories will take me :)\n\nAs with all translations, there are a few mistakes here and there, but nothing that is worth brushing off the entire VN. I get that this is pricy for some people though. So if it's your first \"major\" VN, I would recommend choosing something else (like Dandelion). But you will get your money's worth because of the amount of time you can spend playing it (over 40 hours with all paths and endings and bonus content). So if it's not an immediate buy, it's still worth adding to your Wishlist and saving up for. \n\nI'm only adding in my personal opinions since most of the reviews so far explain the actual great qualities of the VN better, so read up on those too!\n\nI give it a 9/10 and definitely a story worth adding to your collection if you're either a Dandelion/Cheritz fan or someone who enjoys a great VN. And if you're still on the fence, check out the other reviews, look around the store page, do some searches online and whatnot :)", "timestamp_created": 1419725378, "timestamp_updated": 1419725378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13629786": {"recommendationid": "13629786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028937787", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466006181}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a very well made otome game\nThe graphic... story line is good... recommended to people who like to play otome game\nI have already replay quite a few times since the game came out as well as the other game dandelion the same cheritz company made.. and I heard news that there is going to be a new game coming out... \nCan't wait for it....", "timestamp_created": 1419659565, "timestamp_updated": 1419659565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13621210": {"recommendationid": "13621210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070986110", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479055935}, "language": "english", "review": "Cheritz's second game, and semi-sequel to their first (Dandelion: Wishes Brought To You), Nameless: The One Thing You Must Recall is another gorgeous (stat-free) otome game.

I also like the story and the characters. Does it sound too fangirl-y If i start rumbling about how I love everyone ?\n\nSo I'll begin with a short overview over the story. The Heroine - her start name is Eri, but you can change the name - lives alone in the house, which her late grandfather left her. Her Parents work overseas (or just far away) and she's always lived with her grandfather, till the day he died - a bit over one year. The only reason she doesn't feel alone are her dolls. Then One Day her five dolls turn into humans over night. So the Game is mainly about her life with these five - very good looking men/dolls - and her Relationship with them. After 3 Chapters (+Prologue) you will lock onto a Route. At first you can only choose between three of the guys (Lance, Yeonho and Yuri), but after the first playtrough you'll unlock Tei's Route and after that Red's. \n\nThe Menu of the Game consists not only of the usual Buttons (like start, continue etc) but has a big extra menu too. During the Game you will find diary pages of the Characters, wich you can then read (and are also read by the Voice Actors). You can also see all the CGs that you've unlocked, and all the Chapters + Endings (which you can view again). There's also a Section where the Characters tell you something, but it's not translated. \n\nThe Art looks utterly gorgeous, and the characters are interessting, funny - albeit sometimes eccentric. The Dialogue, as well as the story can be amusing (I just love the scenes when they're all together), but also serious/sad. Every Character (except of the Heroine (lol Red would like that one)) is voiced. And I really like the voices. I think they match the characters well. I also like the Character Design, as well as the UI. Altough I really hate, that the game always puts you on the first page of your saves - even If you saved/loaded the Game from a different Page. But I'm used to that now - Dandelion was the same. \n\nI can recommend this game to everybody who likes Otome. I'd say it's one of the best Otomes that I've played on Steam. It's really well made, and I've only seen a few spelling mistakes so far.\n\nI've finished the Game, and I have to say the story is both dramatic, funny and captivating. It's even better than I thought. The Routes themselves are connected, and after finishing the Game once, new Scenes were addded. It feels like a big Puzzle and with every finished Route it'll add a piece. I really like the story and how you'll find out more about each character, as you play all the routes. The Game has a great Cast of Characters. Not only the main Characters but also the secondary Characters are worth mentioning, which are also fully voiced. As for the Price, I think it's ok - it's totally worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1419566261, "timestamp_updated": 1459967565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553111", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13603428": {"recommendationid": "13603428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032044525", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430328549}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]WARNING[/b]: If you suffer from an intense fear of dolls, Nameless will justify [i]every single one[/i] of your fears and manage to create many, many more.\n\nHow to review a game without a name? A game in which you [i]read extensively[/i] rather than running around smacking things with a giant sword or building stuff out of blocks that definitely aren\u2019t arranged in a way to suggest inappropriate aspects of human anatomy? By saying IT\u2019S TOTALLY AWESOME, that\u2019s how. You\u2019d think I\u2019d have far more sophisticated vocabulary after so many hours of visual novels, but no.\n\nYes, Nameless (if that is, in fact, its real name) is a visual novel, and unlike its predecessor, Dandelion, there\u2019s absolutely no stat-raising at all. Some people weren\u2019t fond of the excessive, sometimes tedious stat-raising in that game, but here there aren\u2019t any stats to raise, part-time jobs to do, or gifts/power-ups to buy. That may be a plus (if you\u2019re like me) or a minus if you enjoy some sort of \u201creal\u201d gameplay in your visual novels (and/or are a masochist\u2014kidding!). Still, I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend playing Dandelion before Nameless if you can afford both, not just because it\u2019s also awesome but because there are some lovely references sprinkled throughout Nameless\u2014but they each can be enjoyed completely separately. There's a certain character you'll appreciate a LOT more if you've played Dandelion first, however.\n\nYou might have noticed the distinct lack of giant\u2026bosoms featured in the art on the store page for this game. Yes, those are all guys, even if some of them are exceptionally pretty. No, this is NOT boy\u2019s love/yaoi/dudesquared or whatever the proper term is. You play a lonely, secretly grieving high school girl, Eri (or whatever you choose to name her), who takes solace in her collection of ball-jointed dolls. (Google \"Crobidolls\" if you want to gaze upon their beautifully creepy splendor.) Thankfully, Eri's not your typical crybaby doormat \u201cn-no it\u2019s embarrassing\u201d otome protagonist. Her \u201cseriously unimpressed face\u201d (you\u2019ll know it when you see it\u2014and you will see it often) alone has endeared her to me forever. Though, like many otome game protagonists, she does seem to have issues identifying basic human emotions and physical responses sometimes. Yes, why [i]does[/i] one's heart beat faster when an especially hot guy is nearby?\n\nThose pretty boys in the pictures--Eri's ball-jointed dolls who ~somehow~ turn into hot human guys and end up living in a house with her (potential band name: Dolls II Men)--are her romantic interests, and they all have interesting and varied personalities. The doll-guys aren't your usual one-note, wish-fulfilling otome game love interests, either, with some of them having serious psychological trauma that needs to be worked through in their specific routes--but they can all be extremely entertaining and heartwarming too. If you\u2019re familiar with Dandelion, you may already be prepared for them to make you laugh, cry, and possibly curl up under your desk until the pain goes away.\n\nWhat\u2019s a visual novel without choices? Probably something along the lines of a moving picture book. Luckily, that\u2019s not the case in Nameless. To replace the stat-raising, dates, and stuff-buying of Dandelion, Nameless offers a lot of choices for the player to make. Sometimes it\u2019s not entirely clear which choice leads to which outcome, which is exacerbated by the absence of some sort of \u201clove meter\u201d common in similar games\u2014like Dandelion. I\u2019d recommend Googling something along the lines of \u201cnameless [doll dude\u2019s name] walkthrough\u201d if you want to make sure you\u2019re on the right track the first time around. \n\nEach character has a \u201chappy\u201d ending (relatively\u2014the developer, Cheritz, is deliciously evil, as you will soon discover) as well as MULTIPLE bad endings. Yes. Multiple. Bad. Endings. ENJOY. They\u2019re still worth seeing, however\u2014the story and universe are fascinating and elaborate and it\u2019s worth digging deeper, even if you have to spend a few hours crying under your desk afterward. If you encountered Jisoo's \"bad end\" in Dandelion...you ain't seen nothin' yet.\n\nOthers have mentioned the top-notch voice acting (in Korean), the gorgeous art and CGs, the lovely music, and the fleshed-out supporting cast of characters. One of my main criticisms of Dandelion (and various other otome games) was that once you choose your guy and start down his path (which doesn\u2019t begin until after you finish the prologue and a small number of \u201ccommon route\u201d chapters in Nameless for the first three available routes), everyone else sort of fades into the background or disappears entirely. It\u2019s just you and your man. Okay, looking at these men, that may be nice, but still. It's definitely not a problem in Nameless at all, since the story will keep the other guys and supporting cast around. Other people live in this world too, and they\u2019re worth getting to know!\n\nOne last thing: please go easy on the super-enthusiastic reviews from people with very little playtime\u2014as mentioned elsewhere, Nameless originally came out in November 2013 on Cheritz\u2019s website, and is one of the VERY, VERY few (excuse me while I wipe away a tear) otome games made outside of English-speaking countries to have an English translation provided right off the bat. It was released on Steam on Christmas Eve, 2014. (A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE!)

favorite visual novels. The art is simply beautiful. I love how pretty every character and CG is. The opening and ending video has great songs and visuals. Nameless and Dandelion are the first games I've ever played in Korean so it took me awhile to get used to the language, but now I really like the sound of Korean. The MC is not as simple as other Visual Novel MCs and I love it. She has her own charm and she's pretty. Nameless has a great plot, just like Dandelion. It's deep and intriguing. I love the emotions it makes me go through. All of the endings, including the bad ones, are really fascinating that the player wants to see every ending possible. The only thing I would have preferred to have in Nameless would have been a stat bar and going on dates just like in Dandelion. It would have made the game more involving and challenging. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys seeing beautiful art and reading a really interesting plot.", "timestamp_created": 1419503635, "timestamp_updated": 1419503635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602105", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40882394": {"recommendationid": "40882394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152455942", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 808, "last_played": 1521337138}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played Nameless twice.

You've got the character's  that every Cheritz game has and I'll tell you how I felt about them \n[Spoilers]\n\nBoring But Beautiful- Lance was nice and enjoyable. I liked him a lot though I would have liked if the moral of his story was that he learned to be his own person rather than giving in to you and literally letting you control his new life as a human. Other than that a good character and a fun route anyway.\n\nUgu Baby Slight Yandere- I think his name is Yoon Boom? It's been... A while since I've played this so let's call him beta Yoosung. A cute guy I enjoyed his route and how he goes from sweety to a possesive brat. Pretty typical though. (Except he can talk to animals and ghosts for some reason???) If you like characters like him it's nice otherwise just follow a walkthrough and just enjoy the character interaction.\n\n\"Sexy\" One- I forgot his name I'm not gonna check. He's ultimately a boring character but I enjoy his route. He's nothing special in design or personality in my opinion but his route like shows the protagonist's learning to do makeup and stuff and it doesn't demonize makeup use. The protag ends up enjoying makeup while feeling comfortable with herself and her lover.\n\nActual Yandere- Tei is a good route esp his good ending. But if you hate yanderes may be uncomfy for you. Interesting character dealing with trauma in an interesting way.\n\nThe Unique One- Red is the best character in any otome game I have ever played... His route starts out seeming a bit cliche and boring but it becomes The Best. This game is worth the 30 dollars just to see this guy... He started as my least fav and he's not my favorite but he is objectivly the best boy ever...\n\nExtra Boy/SUPER YANDERE- He's fine or whatever but his route leaves me asking questions like do all the boys who fell in love with you end up together in the same universe?? Like how awkward is that they've all had consensual loving relationships with you but now they're back to square one surrounded by their friends who love and want to be love as much as eachother like what the HECK. That has to suck and like are Lance and Sexy just gonna step back and let the possessive ones duke it out? And how fast will Beta Yoosung get oblitered by Tei and Teddy Bear? Like WHAT HAPPENS THIS IS A HORRIBLE THING TO LEAVE US AT IS PROTAG OK ARE THEY ALL JUST DOLLS AGAIN WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU???\n\nExtra: You can't date you're super cute gay classmates and it sucks cause I love them more than any of these clowns.\n\nAnyway good otome game if you love the genre and love anime boys throw yo money on this baby.", "timestamp_created": 1520304256, "timestamp_updated":

it's one of the best otome games out there. I've had trouble enjoying otomes that have been translated; either because the translation is almost unintelligible or feeling like its missing some kind of spark that may have been there in the original language. I decided to give it a try, and the translation to English seems technically fine. But I just couldn't get in to the game. I realize that it's a longer game, so it will take longer to really kick off. I appreciate that, and it may really have an awesome story. But if I wasn't enjoying the first hour, I just don't think I would have enjoyed continuing. The relationships I got a peek at didn't feel \"real\" to me. I don't mind a far fetched story at all, but I want the relationships to feel organic and real. It was just missing something for me. One character kept referring to the MC as \"Master\", and she would pet his hair even though they've just \"met\". Another one constantly calls her \"My honey\", which felt forced. One reprimanded her on her table manners. I just wasn't liking any of the characters, and I felt like this game wasn't for me. \n\nI suggest trying the demo before buying, to see if you like the writing style. Personally for me, I did not.

Her parents work overseas and have a very busy schedule, moreover, her particular character make her a suitable candidate for \"shut-in of the year\" if there ever was one such trophy. Her only hobby appears to be collecting dolls of beautiful boys, four of which have been.... acting strangely recently. Not much time will pass until the fateful encounter between the heroine and her now human dolls, brought into the world by mysterious means. What happened? How did this miracle came to be, and what's the scope of all this? The novel tries to tie in both questions embroidering a plot which is both very faithful to the standard, vanilla otome game in the most generic sense possible, and open to interpretation just enough as to try to boost up a somewhat compelling interlude. What this title really lacks, however, is a powerful climax.\n\nNameless has four main routes and two hidden, which are best played in a certain order to obtain all info and possible outcomes, and despite its best efforts at telling a mysterious story of magic and (initially believable) mental disorder. it is ultimately as simple as it can get within the realm of otome games. On one hand, the bad endings are all implied in a very subtle manner, which is especially nice and powerful. On the other, any scene\\sign of affection is constantly masked, almost as if the nearrator was afraid to show even the slightest constrast of emotions (might be because of Korean laws, I have no idea on this particular subject). Regarding the main plot, it is initially very intriguing but it loses steam as time progresses. Locations and graphcis are nice, the voice acting is pleasant and the dolls' design is captivating, however a constant lack of events of any relevance, with just a single thread connecting everything together (the diary) makes for a pretty boring \"ending\" (by this I mean the very last routes), despite this, it still holds up as a pretty standard visual novel.\n\nOthers, such as Amnesia: Memories have had a far easier time with narrative devices and plots slightly more complex but told far better, Code: Realize is another shining example of far better writing and pacing. This is, overall, a product with a good premise and a pretty shallow execution. It does what it does but it dares not ask for more. The fact that there are no achievements and the pricing is quite high does nothing to alleviate this. I'd say after I read Code: Realize my standards regarding otome games increased immensely and this is truly a barebones experience once you dive deep enough to find how little substance there is. Comparatively, Dandelion, another title from the same company (which shares some traits with this novel) was overall better although lacking in other compartments simply because simplier but better wrapped up and held together by a more concrete thread.\n\nOverall, I will not recommend this novel at this price. As a slice of life with magical elements it holds up pretty decently but it is nowhere near as good as it could have been with a little more imagination and better writing.\n", "timestamp_created": 1517676460, "timestamp_updated": 1517676460, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39810994": {"recommendationid": "39810994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174487218", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517649761}, "language": "english", "review": "JUST FINISHED THE GAME.

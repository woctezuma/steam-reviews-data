(Though playing shieldless definitely gets you moving!)\n\nI admit, I'm the guy who likes RPG elements in his games. I just want to make the numbers go up - earning in-game currency to upgrade weapons, damage, health, unlockables, and so on. Even Fruit Ninja has mechanics like buying power-ups for the next stage - why not add in a different option? You could still have Arcade-style gameplay and then a separate mode for more \"progression\" focused.\n\nSo yeah, for me personally it wasn't the amazing Overwhelmingly Positive level of experience, but it's still a solid game that I feel like I'll be coming back to again.

I personally find it to be one of the best wave shooters for the system boasting dodge mechanics, cover mechanics and some great aiming for those who can put the effort in. James Marvel\u2019s music is inspiring and equal to a dose of espresso in the morning as it pumps through your headphones.\n\nThe game is perfect for doing what it does flawlessly without biting off more than it can chew. Think space invaders except you are the ship \u2013 shooting down invaders while trying not to get shot. Along the way, you find powerups and fight bosses. The actual \u201cloadout\u201d in the game can be switched on the fly and includes varying fire modes and other utilities like a shield you can use to protect yourself from enemy shots. If a shield isn\u2019t the way you want to go \u2013 you can dodge and roll around your floor(room-space required!) and avoid the slow motion firing.\n\nThe visuals and sounds are nothing to sneeze at. You will see the glow of a laser rushing towards you in great detail while trying to roll away or accept your fate.\n\nI myself claim to be no expert at the game and have to \u201cwave select\u201d to manually progress which lets you pick up where you left off. I can\u2019t think of a single thing wrong with this game which makes me think it\u2019s a perfect title for what it is. The regular retail price on steam right now is $14.99 which seems perfectly placed \u2013 even without a sale active. It is a perfect introductory title to the VR while also including much replayability making it more than a \u201cdemo title\u201d.", "timestamp_created": 1509405465, "timestamp_updated": 1509405465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36068698": {"recommendationid": "36068698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355095575", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1515822262}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun arcade still game for VR.

I just got an HTC Rive and have been looking for games to play. I currently have ED: Horizons but wanted something else. I found this one and the video looked cool and the price isn't bad at all. \nI'll start out with the Pros and Cons:\nPros:\nIntuitive controls, easy to learn, lots of weapons (variations) to choose from, quick swap while in battle, overall a really fun VR experience.\n\nCons:\nYou do have to move around to dodge bullets and i found myself running into things because i didn't realize how far i moved. \n\nJust got done playing my first round, and i absolutely enjoyed it! The controls are easy to use and very intuitive. You start out with two weapon types (which have their own variations). You can either use a gun or a staff. The gun has 6 variations. Single round, rapid fire, burst, laser, laser burst, and grenade. You can switch the variation on the fly. The staff has two variations. A reflector shield and some lasso thing (honestly i haven't figured out what that one does). You can dual wield as well, so if you want to go all out on blowing stuff up, you can have two guns. To switch between gun and staff all you need to do is put the controller behind your back and pull out the new one. You can dodge bullets and in some modes you get bullet time to help you dodge easier. However, the later you get the harder it is to dodge all the bullets coming at you. There are also power ups throughout the game, the two i found were shield, which added static shields next to you, and drone, this added a friendly drone who helped you fight.

Because Space Pirate Trainer is an exhilarating virtual reality space-based shooter.\n\nWe were warned by the game's developers that Space Pirate Trainer is a room-scale VR experience right to its core. They weren't kidding! It's a physically challenging and demanding game that you'll need plenty of play space for the utmost entertainment.\n\nAs wave-based shooters go, Space Pirate Trainer is a great example of what a VR experience should be like: immersive, enjoyable and easy to pick up. There's so much to enjoy here in terms of game design, mechanics and gunplay. Its downside, however, is that repetition is an unavoidable part and parcel of a game such as this. \n\nAt just the current price point, Space Pirate Trainer is a VR bargain that's well worth picking up.

Sometime I can tell when an action is going to cause the Rift to disconnect from Steam VR, but often it's in the middle of heated battle.  This is the only game I experience this in.  The Lab, 5089, and Fruit Ninja have, thus far, not given me any connectivity issues whatsoever.  This is the only reason this review is getting a thumbs down.  It's not entirely fair to the developer, but I've also seen a lot of developers reach out when they see bad reviews, so it's proven to be a powerful mechanic in the past.\n\nOtherwise, this game is absolutely splendid.  I've only had VR for less than a week, and have been pretty picky about what is actually 'fun.'  Thus far, Robo Recall, KingSpray (unfortunately Oculus Store, because the Steam version doesn't work with Oculus), Fruit Ninja and Space Pirate Trainer have been the only games that have really stuck out as amazing expieriences. \n\nAt first, the game appears to lack depth.  You've got a pair of guns, I believe the default are 2 machine guns, and a menu box that says you can change guns with the joysticks, or reach over your shoulders to switch to shields.  But there's a lot the game doesn't tell you.  I'm not going to spoil what that may be, but experimenting with different combinations of guns and shields is key to surving very far into this game--unless you're seeking a specialty leaderboard, like my favourite, dual shield.  Dual shield is by far the most gratifying 'class' I've experienced.\n\nI've had the game a day, have 5.5 hours of play, and rank in the top 3000 in a few of the global leaderboards.  Climbing from here take a lot of patience, but especially so, due to losing connectivity all the time.  Really, if that weren't happening all the time, I'd probably have double the play time.  But sometimes the bug goes so far as to force me to restart Steam altogether.\n\nSo beware Oculus owners.  At this point, it may make more sense to buy this on the Oculus store; though I have no idea if the issue is any better over there.

The cables really dampen the experience of diving to the grand and emulating Neo or any action-movie star as you lean back to dodge the lasers coming to end one of your three meager lives.\nThe reason this game shines so well is because it captures an experience that VR can and should excel at (both because its pricey, so its best to split the cost with friends and because we should probably limit how long we go under). Playing this game in an arcade-like fashion, where your friends line up to go in and try and get the top score, is really where this game sells its core concept. I had a lot of fun taking every opportunity I had to beef up my proficiency in order to beat out my friends top scores (I presently hold the high score at the office!).\nIt helps too that the developer pumped out a change that made the game even better: with the inclusion of power ups and a neat tether you can use to swing around drones.\nI would argue that the best VR games we can have right now are games like this, and to go from vehemently bashing VR as a lazy way to fake immersion to a supporter of the future of gaming, this game is truly something else.\nIf you need a game to make you rethink whether or not VR has a bright future, then try this game.\n\nNumerical score of 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1497251287, "timestamp_updated": 1497251287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616725", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32314022": {"recommendationid": "32314022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060502104", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1515805012}, "language": "english", "review": "Uh... can you say \"most addicting game on the Vive?\"\n\nI bought this because of the great reviews.

But if you want a shield that also has a bit of offensive punch, swith to the lightsaber fishing pole laser grabber thingy majiggy, Not sure what to call it but basically you can block the shots with a sword, that can also pull in your enemies. then you can choose to slam them into the ground, or blast them with your favorite choice of 6 types of guns, that are quickly accessible VIA Thumb pad. Bottom line, you'll sweat and have a good time doing so. You might even catch yourself getting pumped up by the great sound track and yelling at the dang drones that our trying to kill you.

The only cons to the game was the lack of multiplayer or social aspects of it.. Yes i can see my friends scores and try to beat there records, but i have seen some similar games starting to incorporate coop in there shooters (such as serious sam VR).

It's the VR equivlent of Space Invaders. Point, shoot, dodge or sheild. Thats pretty much it. You're not going to get a storyline. You're not going to get any overly complex gameplay aside from tougher and tougher waves. It's a wave shooter (one of many for VR at the moment). \n\nNow the Good. \n\nIt's probably one of the better,if not best wave shooters.  It looks great, plays very well, has spot on physics and has cracking sound and music.\n\n\nI've had Space Pirate Trainer since April 2016 (Vive launch date) and in that time I've knocked up just shy of 7 hours gameplay. \n\nSo the question is, why am I recommeneding the game with such little play time?  Well..it's moreish. You pop in, play for 10 mins, see if you can beat your last high score then pop out.  As I said,  SPT is nothing more than a wave shooter. You stand in one game area and battle wave after wave of robots with the odd boss thrown in to the mix. Your guns have various fire modes, can turn into a sheild mace / space whip if you fancy and there are various powerups to be had. It's very fun in short bursts but once you die, you pop out and play something else till the next time. \n\nSPT does what it does very well. It's obviously been polished very well in the last 14 months (it got boring really fast back in April but has had considerable work since launch) and I can only hope the dev continues to add new content (which they are).  A couple more enviroments to fight in, maybe a power up that pops out a robot to fight with you, multi player or maybe even a turret / cannon  spawning (that you can control) would go a long way to adding to game play. \n\nThis early in consumer VR SPT is certainly a very good VR demo title (and has remained so for most of this year) and a fun title to play intermittently. It's a go to title for showing newbies the ropes but I would like to see SPT progress beyond that tech demo / old school wave shooter feel and offer something with a bit more meat on it's bones.  \n\nIf it's on sale then grab it.

Everyone with a Vive needs to have this game in their collection.\n\n-----1.0 UPDATE REVIEW BELOW-----\n\nThe final 1.0 release for SPT has an amazing amount of additional content over what the previous early access version had.  I really liked the game before, but I'm blown away by all of the additions.  There's 2 new game modes (they're both essentially a single extra game mode that has different health and point systems depending on which you go with), several new power ups, at least 3 new standard enemy types that I've run into, a new \"mini\" boss, and a full blown boss that's a pretty crazy fight.  There's also some unlockable gun skins and an environment unlockable as well as way more music tracks.  All of these additions have really broadened the variety in the game pretty significantly.  This has become an absolute MUST HAVE title for VR if you have even the slightest interest in wave shooters.  I feel like this is the best wave shooter out of all the ones I've tried so far.\n\nJust as a side note to anyone interested about possible motion sickness, since I like to check for this myself, there's pretty much no danger of motion sickness at all here.  The game is all done from a single platform that you physically dodge around in real space.", "timestamp_created": 1480289930, "timestamp_updated": 1508089117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27822697": {"recommendationid": "27822697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009714531", "num_games_owned": 386, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497098854}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun arcade style shooter.

The fast paced gameplay and James Marvel's fantastic drum & bass soundtrack are guaranteed to make players break a sweat and increase their heart rate.  It's the perfect marriage of classic arcade simplicity and VR immersion. The developers have successfully taken elements of Galaga, first person shooters and late '80s/early '90s bullet hell shooters to create one hell of a VR game.\n\nThe game is simple, yet has enough nuance to keep you engaged. There are multiple weapon types, a shield, and even a lasso/melee type weapon to allow for a good variety of play styles. Of all the gun games I've played for the Vive, Space Pirate Trainer's guns are the most tangible; you really feel like you're holding pistols that can be best described as a hybrid of Han Solo's blaster and Judge Dredd's Lawgiver. The haptic feedback is perfection and the track pad selection method is quick and intuitive.\n\nThe fast pace and initial simplicity make Space Pirate Trainer the perfect starting point for room scale VR.

Dodge the bullet from all direction and shoot back! But be careful, you can only be hit three times.\nThe fame mode is simple, only dodging and shooting. There are 5 kinds of weapons available and all of them can be used by both hands. The gaming speed slowed down when enemy bullet comes, giving players more time to response, you can also use your shield to block the bullet.\nThe unique movement recognition system is also the highlight. You can switch weapons by particular movement, for example when your hand reaches the backside of your head in the game, your weapon will be automatically switched into shield, as if you are carrying the shield all the way.\nThe immersive experience is also important and Space Pirate Training did well on this. The UI style perfectly fit the gaming environment. Special effect occurs when you are hit by bullet, after that, the path of that bullet will also be displayed.\nThe simple gaming mode is the only fatal weakness of this game, shooting enemies wave after wave quickly bored players.\nThe game is now a demo, Looking forward to the better performance in the future.\n\nTo talk, play and share your ideas about virtual reality, please join us: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/viriver", "timestamp_created": 1475048791, "timestamp_updated": 1475053636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25733323": {"recommendationid": "25733323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002494496", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480045393}, "language": "english", "review": "Didn't seem that interesting at first when I watched my kids play, but after the latest update I gave it a shot and it's a blast.

Definitely one of the most well made VR games I've tried - the game is very responsive, with the controls working almost flawlessly.

It takes a little while to properly test out all of the weapons available, and to find what works best for you, but when you do it is very satisfying to blast through the levels - until you get overwhelmed and shot in the back and its game over :(\nBut that's all part of the fun!\n\nThis is all accompanied by upbeat music and whilst its not what I would normaly listen to, it fits the atmosphere very well and help gets my blood pumping!\n\nThe recent update had added a whole bunch of new features - I especially like the new 'whip' kind of weapon where you can lock onto the pirate and fling them around (like the gravity gun in Garry's Mod). Its not very practical in the higher levels, but its so incredibly fun!\nThe powerups available are cool as well, and whilst the game would be fine without them, they don't ruin it like some games do with too many powerups.

Even my mum - who has always disapproved of me playing shooters and the like - loves it. Its simplistic and is sort of just an arcade game - but that's one of the beauties of it. Instead of over complicating things, it's just a very fun, very simple and very replayable arcade shooter. I find myself returning to it all the time to try and smash my high score. The simplicity also means that it's very easy to get used to it - making it a perfect demo for VR shooters! So if you want to have a party to show all your friends your brand new vive then I would suggest showing them this game. \n\nOne big bonus for me is the different firing modes for the pistol.

My legs are killing me right now from ducking and diving around my room like I was in The Matrix.\n\nIt's a fairly straight forward game. Wave of enemies come at you from nearly every direction in Galaga-esque formations. I could be wrong but I've only seen two types of enemies, currently. One is simply more \"tanky\" than the other. You also have a radar in front of you to help you get an idea of where they are and what to expect. Once you've been shot 3 times, that's the end of your Neo/Trinity masquerade.\n\nYou get 5 firemodes for each weapon in your hands. Single shot (You get an exclusive laser pointer with this firemode), burst fire, automatic fire, charged single shot (one shots anything as far as I'm aware), and continuous beam fire. Also you can reach behind your back with either hand and swap out for a shield on the fly. I've found the best combination for me personally is using the fully automatic mode on both pistols. \n\nThere is a visual and audio queue of enemies charging up before they fire so you can prepare to deal with them in quite a few ways. For instance, you can... \n1. Shoot and destroy the drones. (Obviously)\n2. Shoot and stun them, which prevents them from firing temporarily.\n3. Shoot the drone's lasers out of the air.\n4. Dodge the lasers. Time will always slow down when they fire at you.\n5. Switch to your shield quickly and deflect them.\n\nThere's of course a leaderboard which shows some people with some ridiculous high scores. It makes me think they just laid on the ground with a shield deflecting bullets. But eh. Also, it's worth noting there's a couple options that I actually preferred changing in the menu, such as the barrel angle and sights. For barrel angle I found it more natural turning it all the way down as the gun naturally shoots upwards which feels strange to me. As for the sights, I chose the 3 dot sight because it's quicker to use in the heat of the moment.\n\nOverall, it's currently one of my favorite Vive games.

It's just about the only one that really makes me want to jump around and act like an idiot while playing it.  So for those who don't know, this game basically puts you on a platform with a ship behind you (why? I dunno, for ambiance maybe?) and all these drones fly up in front of (and over and around and behind) you and you have to use your guns (Vive controllers) to shoot them down.   You can take 3 hits (apparently they seem to aim for my head only) before it's game over.  Enemies come in waves and they are increasingly numerous and difficult.\n\nThe handle of the Vive controller becomes the gun's handle (if that helps you visualize how you're holding them) and of course the trigger is the trigger.  You can use the touchpad to select different firing styles from: pistols with laser sights that shoot bullets, a laser pistol that shoots bolts in bursts, a laser pistol that fires in a continuous stream of shots, a laser that you charge up and does massive damage when you let go of the trigger (sorta like a sniper rifle?), and finally you get a beam laser that doesn't do much damage but it's super simple to aim.\n\nEach gun has a sight on it that you can look down to help aim but most of the time you'll just be shooting from the hip (not using the sights).  Also, you can reach behind your back to turn a gun into a shield  and use that to block incoming shots.  If you're a defensive type you can keep one gun and one shield, and if you're rambo you can go \"guns akimbo\". \n\nApparently the shield isn't wholly defensive.  you can ricocchet shots to attack the enemy with their own bullets, and if you push the trigger a shockwave forms from the shield and knocks all the enemies back (but doesn't damage them as far as I can tell).  It's sort of a shield bash.\n\nThings I like:\n[list]\n [*] Upbeat music keeps the energy flowing\n [*] Lots of fun arcade style action\n [*] Weapons seems fairly balanced so that the easier ones to aim do less damage\n [*] It's simple to learn so you don't need to study a manual before you go in\n [*] This is the kind of game that benefits greatly from a LOT of floor space.\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't like:\n[list]\n [*] Since the enemies can go over and behind you, sometimes you REALLY need to duck and/or move quickly (I bumped the wall not realizing how close I was)\n [*] the gun sights seem mostly useless... It's a nice touch, especially for the firing mode where you charge your shots, but it's really hard to look down the sights especially in the heat of battle.\n [*]Having to reach behind you to grab your shield and reach again to restore your gun is cool, but I'd prefer a smaller shield that I could just bring up with a button press instead.\n[/list]\n\nI really had to struggle to find something bad to say about this game. It's probably the most fun full-room game right now.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467422874, "timestamp_updated": 1467422874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524683", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23999204": {"recommendationid": "23999204", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991503275", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505689649}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple and well made.

Its an arcarde style shooter done right! The goal of the game is to shoot (or Pew, Pew) the hovering, one eyed robots that fly at you from the front, sides, and above. Getting a direct hit on the robots is very satisfying, and the game as a whole truly makes you fell bad-ass! The weapon choices are minimal, but you do have the option to choose how the gun will fire which gives an extra level of customization. The music fits really well with the game, and you will sometimes find yourself dancing along, giving a shooting/dancing experience. SPT does get difficult after getting far enough in the wave levels, but retrying over and over again to attempt to get the top high-score of your local games, your friends, or even the world, provides a great replayablitly level! The amount of content is fairly slim, but for the price, I HIGHLY recommend it.

The dev sure hasn't shown anything off that I'm aware of...) If it gets better, I'll revisit the review.\n\nAs it stands, this game is a monumental rip-off at $15, for the actual content you get. It's the minimum of effort in what a game could be, a tech demo that could be replicated in a week by one person. For 2 to 5 bucks, it might be OK, but when I can buy Jeeboman, which is nearly identical in play style, but is an actual game with progression, checkpoints, variety, balance, and gobs more fun than this yet only costs 10 bucks, why would I bother?\n\nThe weapons are unbalanced to the point of being useless. You'd think the single shot would be more powerful that a shot from the machinegun... but it isn't. So why the heck would I choose single shot, then, when machine gun is far more effective? the same goes for the 3-shot burst mode. Again, no more powerful, why would I use it? Because I'm stupid? The powerup shot that must be charged by holding the trigger is even more of a joke. It's just as hard to hit anything with it, and yet it takes multiple seconds to load each shot. If you want to die quickly, choose this. Ultimately, that leaves the laser beam and the machinegun... but it's easier to hit with the instant laser beam, so again, why would you use machinegun when there is a better option?\n\nAnd to stress again, as it stands on the day I write this, there is NOTHING TO THIS GAME. Die, and you start all the way over with the incredibly boring first waves again, and again, and again. There is one enemy with texture alterations making three of them. There is one gun model that doesn't change based on type of firepower. The shield doesn't work right in the heat of combat, either sticking on or not coming up when you try to deploy it, costing you time, or more likely, your game for your effort of using it.\n\nI remember seeing the demo of this game months and months ago and thinking it looked cool... and now when the Vive launches, the release version is that exact same demo, no changes. The developer has done NOTHING to the game in months and months, and calls it early access. I'd like to believe they'll continue, especially based on the faith Valve seemed to put in them as a featured developer, but I have to judge based on their output right now, and right now it's lazy, simplistic, and above all, boring. Avoid. Holopoint and Jeeboman are far better, and cost less.\n\nBen", "timestamp_created": 1462003362, "timestamp_updated": 1462003362, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432401", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22712702": {"recommendationid": "22712702", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973691548", "num_games_owned": 762, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467051080}, "language": "german", "review": "[b] Also ich hab das game ca 30 minuten gezockt und muss jetzt umbedingt die Review schreiben!\t[/b]\n\nDas Game hat Hammergeile Musik!

You'll pretty much manage to do everything there is within the game within the first couple of minutes.\n\nBeyond that, it's fun to compete with friends.\n\n[h1]WEAPONS[/h1]\n\nThe weapons are kind of cool, but I wish I had more choice. You just have a pistol at the moment, but it has different firing types.\n\n[b]Single Shot:[/b] This is just your standard pistol, but you have a laser sight (In fact, it's currently the only one with a laser sight).\n\n[b]Triple Shot:[/b] You no longer have the laser sight, but you do have 3 shots fired in rapid succession when you pull the trigger. In order to fire again, you'll need to release and pull the trigger again.\n\n[b]Rapid Fire:[/b] All you need to do is hold the trigger to fire an endless supply of shots. The only problem is that the longer you hold the trigger, the slower the rate of fire.\n\n[b]Charge Shot:[/b] Hold down the trigger to charge it up, and released it to do a shot that will pretty much always destroy your target. The problem is, you have to be accurate to make use of it. Your sight will turn green when you're about to make a kill shot, so looking down the sights is pretty handy.\n\n[b]Laser:[/b] Fire a low powered laser from your gun. When you hit your target, they'll usually be stunned and start to fall. After a constant stream of shots, they'll blow up, but it's the slowest way of destroying the drones. HOWEVER! You if you equip a laser in both hands and cross the beams, you form a very powerful laser beam. This does massive damage, but of course, limits you to one direction of attack, and no defense.\n\n[h1]DEFENSE[/h1]\n\nYou start the match with 3 lives. So that's 3 shots and you're out! Even rapid fire from behind will end your match pretty quickly, but the game slows down when you're close to an enemy laser. It creates this pretty amazing Matrix feeling. I'm not sure if you gain lives after X number of waves, but I have a feeling that's the case. Usually I'm too busy fighting to count how many lives I have left.\n\nReach to your back and your gun is replaced with a shield. This can reflect shots back, and with a bit of luck, can actually reflect them back to your attacker. On top of this, pull the trigger to charge up and release a powerful shock wave. This can not only force your attackers back, but can also deflect shots.\n\n[h1]LEVELS[/h1]\n\nThere's currently just the one level... it's pretty nice to look around, and you'll mainly be attacked from the front and sides, but there's no variety.\n\n[h1]ENEMIES[/h1]\n\nBeyond colours, I'm not sure what else there is. I understand there'll be boss fights soon, but at the moment you'll just be dealing with floating sphere drones. The look cool, and sound cool... but essentially repetitive.\n\n[h1]MUSIC AND SOUND[/h1]\n\nThis is subjective, but I get a lot of excitement from it. Fast paced drum and bass, and a great beat makes you feel pretty powerful and unstoppable... that is until you hear a drone charge up and shoot you in the back.\n\nThe guns sound awesome, and suitable. Nothing seems out of place or underpowered.\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\n\nIt has the potential to be a great game. At the moment it's fun and easy to drop in and out of, but don't expect too much at this time.\n\nHopefully we'll have a greater selection of weapons in the future (shotgun, please!), and a story mode would be pretty cool. It has a nice level of polish, and I look forward to seeing what we get in the future.\n\nYes, I'd recommend, even at this current level.", "timestamp_created": 1461774053, "timestamp_updated": 1461774101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644213", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22663632": {"recommendationid": "22663632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062146761", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463858164}, "language": "english", "review": "SO much fun! :)", "timestamp_created": 1461770523, "timestamp_updated": 1461770523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22660269": {"recommendationid": "22660269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037346777", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483328590}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy It!", "timestamp_created": 1461754834, "timestamp_updated": 1461754834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22659520": {"recommendationid": "22659520", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990675137", "num_games_owned": 1079, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511476513}, "language": "english", "review": "Space Pirate Trainer is my go-to title for a wave-based bullet hell & survival shooter.

Ok, die wird wahrscheinlich bei Hover Junkers noch dazu kommen - solange sie nicht dabei ist, gilt meine Empfehlung diesem tollen Titel hier. Und nun komme ich zum Warum:\n\nDas Gef\u00fchl, das man beim abschie\u00dfen der kleinen Sonden hat, ist einfach beeindruckend. Man weicht Sch\u00fc\u00dfen aus, blockiert sie mit dem Schild und muss gleichzeitig immer darauf achten, m\u00f6flichst schnell die kleinen Gleiter vom Himmel zu holen - sonst ist man schnell ein kleines H\u00e4ufchen Laserasche.

Sie schie\u00dfen von allen Seiten, schweben \u00fcber Einen, fliegen schwindeleregende Kurven: Das ist einfach Toll.

It is a thrill to play and has a ton of reply value. Much more replay value than most of the other titles that are currently available.\n\nThe game is very physical. If you want to get far in it, you have to dodge, duck and move your shield all around you. It gets more and more challenging the further you get. The difficulty progression is near perfect.\n\nThe basic idea is to destroy all the flying bots that hover around the room and occassionally shoot at you with your laser pistol(s). A very simple concept implemented masterfully.\n\nThe real thrill comes when one masters the mechanics of the game to survive through ten or more bots on the screen at once with multiple bots shooting at the same time! There are several things the developer implemented to allow one to survive such an onslaught.\n\nFirst, one has the ability to use a shield. This is most effectively used in a blind area where you know at least one or more bots are flying around but you are focusing on other areas of the room. When it gets really intense, you'll have to crouch down to really decrease your hit box size and also more effectively protect yourself with the shield. However, the downside is a loss in mobility in using the other main mechanic to protect yourself, simply dodging out of the way of the shots coming at you. When you are shot at, the game alerts you with a warning sound and also slows down time, so you have a real fighting chance to avoid the attacks.\n\nAdditionally, the game makes excellent use of sound. The bots that are close to you sound louder and you can hear the \"hum\" sound they make at all times. The shots they fire also make a sound. This aids greatly in knowing where the other bots are and where to aim your shield or how to dodge when one shoots at you. There is also a map in the lower front portion of the room that allows you to get a quick visual inspection of where all the bots are at.\n\nFinally, when a bot is about to attack you, you can hear it power up and also see it glow as it charges its weapon. You have the ability to shoot it to stop the attack. If you hit it the attack will be disrupted. Further, when you destroy a bot, the explosion disrupts the other bots in the area, stopping their attack and causing them to fly about from the impact.\nThe real thrill comes when you master the sound mechanic and efficient use of this map to protect yourself with your shield and determine when to crouch and when to duck and dodge. To master the game you'll have to use all these skills multiple times in the later waves.\n\nThis game is a must purchase in my opinion for anyone who has the Vive. I like it even better than Audioshield. Audioshield is great and also has excellent replay value but it doesn't have the difficulty progression that Space Pirate Trainer has (and the thrill of overcoming an especially difficult challenge that comes with that), which is why I prefer it.", "timestamp_created": 1460710292, "timestamp_updated": 1460710292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22424023": {"recommendationid": "22424023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025761799", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488490458}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best implemented VR shooters available right now.

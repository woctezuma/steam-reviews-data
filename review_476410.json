its magic system remains to be interesting, there is still much to be desired.

The mental patients discussion is just as excessive as the Libertads were in the previous game.

Give us more interaction between Woolf and Janis, or between Janis and Candela, or (insert names of any other two characters).

Although it is helpful to have played An Octave Higher, as there are familiar characters in both VNs, it is not necessary to do so.  In One Small Fire at a Time, you play as Janis, a 13-year old girl who is considered \"mad\" because she has \"magic deficiency disorder.\"  As you can guess, that means that Janis can't use magic, which is very unusual since in the world where Janis is, Overture, magic casters are the norm and anyone who can't cast magic is abnormal.  As Janis copes with the hardships of her illness (mainly dealing with bullying), she crosses paths one day with Aiden Woolf, a dragoon commander who comes to Eclipse, the madhouse where Janis is living, and he is there on a mission to investigate the owners of Eclipse.  Although Eclipse looks like the usual madhouse whose inmates include those like Janis and anyone whose behavior doesn't conform to what society expects of them, there is more behind the madhouse and it is Woolf's mission (from the king) to find out what it is.  I won't reveal anything more story-wise but I'll point out that One Small Fire at a Time does have branching paths so you can get the true ending and alternate endings.\n\nNow to my thoughts on this VN.  ;)  I truly enjoyed An Octave Higher and I was very excited when this VN came out.  I had high expectations for it and I wasn't disappointed at all.  First, I love Janis as the main character.  For those familiar with An Octave Higher, Janis is a supporting character in it and in One Small Fire at a Time, we see Janis as she was before she became a dragoon commander and it was interesting to learn that she couldn't use magic.  I loved her personality and I couldn't help laughing at times at how she addressed others.  Also, the writing itself was great.  I found myself getting really involved in the story and although we do see events from Janis' point of view, we also see another side, as when Woolf, along with his companions Professor Poe and Joff Godwin, investigates what's going on at Eclipse and its owners.  The art style is like that in An Octave Higher and if you like it then, you'll like it here as well.  Also, I love the orchestral pieces that are played and I think they fit very well with the time period that the game takes place.  (Basically, think of the US slightly before the Industrial Period.)  \n\nOverall, I truly enjoyed playing One Small Fire at a Time and getting to learn about Janis' story.  It was great to see familiar characters as well as new characters.  If you liked An Octave Higher, I believe you'll love this one, too.  Also, I'll note that for those who know what the true ending is in An Octave Higher, you may be able to take a good guess as to what the true ending is in here, too.  ;)  Congrats to the devs for making another wonderful VN and I hope we'll get to see another VN in the world of Overture in the future.  ^^", "timestamp_created": 1495432385, "timestamp_updated": 1495432385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662523", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31870068": {"recommendationid": "31870068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004496922", "num_games_owned": 1862, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495317321}, "language": "english", "review": "A really good visual novel game with a pretty deep story.

I liked it so much, I went through the first playthrough (5 hours) in one sitting; couldn't stop reading. I do admit that I liked An Octave Higher a bit more, but this prequel was definitely a close second. While some have suggested otherwise, I do think the VN is more enjoyable if you've read An Octave HIgher first. An Octave Higher explains the magical system and gives an overall introduction to the world in these stories. Besides, it's more interesting to see Janis's backstory while knowing who she is in An Octave Higher. \n\nLike in An Octave Higher, this story was very thought-provoking and causes the reader to consider things about life. It particularly raises questions about the treatment of those with mental illnesses in society. As someone who suffers from depression/anxiety, I did relate quite a bit to some of the rhetoric used in the story. \n\nIdeas on the time lapse: (kinda spoiler-ish)\nBased on how young Janis is in this game and how old she looks in An Octave Higher, I suspected the time between the two is maybe about 10 years or so, but thinking about it, I've decided that can't be right. Joff (another character in An Octave Higher) hasn't married or had his son in this story, and since his son was a teenager in An Octave Higher, assuming he got married (maybe to [spoiler]Ena[/spoiler]) and his wife immediately got pregnant, then maybe the time between the stories is about 15 years. Perhaps a bit more. They might even state Joff's son's age at some point in An Octave Higher, but I can't recall since I played it quite a while ago. \n\nThe joke ending was, once again, quite amusing.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game (as well as An Octave Higher) to those who enjoy thought-provoking VNs.", "timestamp_created": 1491327355, "timestamp_updated": 1491327355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29547869": {"recommendationid": "29547869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120250598", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485627259}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, that was unexpectedly Great.

The story is set some time before \"Octave\", more or less 20-30 years. We see origins of some secondary characters, most notably Janis and Joff Godwin.\n\nAnyway, you have the story explained in the summary of the game, above reviews section, and I don't want you to read the same shit all over again. I'll just tell what you can expect. You can expect well balanced story, with humour, action, sad moments, plot twists, etc. There are also many long and smart conversations about various things (mostly psychology), so if you don't like it, then I don't recommend it to you.\n\nArt. Art is very impotant factor in Visual Novels. Often in low-budget games, such as this one, artstyle is very cheesy. Thankfully this isn't a case here, character sprites and backgrounds are detailed and just well done. There are also many CGs for more complex scenes, which is very good. \n\nMusic. I'm especially sensitive on this point, and to my satisfaction, this game has very good soundtrack, I couldn't hear any generic overused stock music (well, there were few classical pieces).\n\nOverall, this game is very good, even if bit short (Better than if it was too long, then it would be quite boring), and for fair price.", "timestamp_created": 1479930179, "timestamp_updated": 1479930179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565296", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26729681": {"recommendationid": "26729681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300297476", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479728402}, "language": "english", "review": "This game ticked all the boxes for me. Interesting and developed setting, good characters, a gripping story and nice art. I loved the short chapters which made it easy to follow - a recent spell of depression has done a number on my concentration span, so the short chapters and clear-cut scenes were really nice.\n\nThere are lots of interesting ideas explored here, particularly about mental health. I'm always a little wary when I see something set in an asylum (as in countless horror games), but the creators had some really good observations about the nature of madness.\n\nThe setting was another plus. How magic would affect society was portrayed fairly realistically, at least to my mind, and I always love to see fantasy worlds where magic is used as another form of technology or science, rather than the standard swords, dragons and wizards set-up.\n\nAlthough there is a clear 'true end', there are a number of alternates. I really enjoyed seeing how the choices affected the story, for better or worse. I like that the 'true end' is not necessarily the happiest end for all the characters...\n\nOn to characters, another plus. Although it's short, I felt the characters were well-formed. I actually liked the protagonist, so kudos is due there as likeable protagonists seem to be few and far between. I found Aidan Woolf a little lacking though, which kind of throws a spanner in the works since he's a major character...I suppose the fact that he just explains his backstory maybe made him a little flat for me. My only other complaint was the propensity for death-bed scenes - a pet hate of mine.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this visual novel.

This game is playable as a standalone, but knowledge from the other will be helpful and will probably make it more enjoyable.\n2) This is a visual novel. There are choices, but otherwise there is no gameplay.\n3) Just like An Octave Higher, this has some mature themes. For example, sexual violence, mental illness, and suicide are discussed, sometimes at length.\n\nThe Good:\n1) Excellent writing. It manages to be both funny and disturbing as the situation calls for it. The story moves at a quick pace without being rushed. \n2) The music is similar to (and partly the same as) An Octave Higher. I personally think this is a good thing. Classical music mixed with thematic music for kinds of scenes and situations.\n3) Great art again, both backgrounds and characters. The styling is consistent so if you like the preview images, that is what you will get.\n4) Thematically very interesting. Just like in An Octave Higher, characters tend to wax philosophical at appropriate times. They wrestle with tough questions, and the reader is invited to think about it too. This time, the focus is on the nature of mental illness.\n\nThe Not So Good:\n1) Some of the humor was funny but took me out of the story. The references broke immersion in a couple spots. It turned out okay because I got back into it just fine, but that could annoy some people.\n2) The ending is a bit jarring. Some of the characters' actions didn't feel quite right. No spoilers here, but be aware that you may not really click with the ending.\n3) A bit short. I completed the full all routes in a litle over 4 hours. \n\nThe Verdict:\nI'd recommend giving this a read after An Octave Higher if you enjoyed that visual novel. I think An Octave Higher is a bit better (at least as a standalone game). If you liked An Octave Higher, I think you'll like this one too, especially if you find the discussion of mental illness compelling.", "timestamp_created": 1471316624, "timestamp_updated": 1471316624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24480494": {"recommendationid": "24480494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092251834", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469248946}, "language": "english", "review": "As shown in the Tags, this game is a 'Visual Novel' and an 'Indie' game.

Der Zeichenstyle ist Schwunghaft und spielerisch ein bischen Aquarell m\u00e4sig. Alle Charaktere sind sch\u00f6n Designed und sind teilweise einfach nur zum knuddeln oder verlieben je nachdem was ihr lieber habt. Negativ kann ich nur sagen das manche bilder extrem oft vorgekommen sind wie bei den Magiattacken.

Manchmal etwas verwirrend da es so kommt als w\u00fcrde ein Charakter f\u00fcr dich reden nur um dann pl\u00f6tzlich zu merken das du jemand anders Representierst. Es ist aber nie wirklichlich zu schlimm, solange man ordentlich liest und beim Plot am ball bleibt. Aber ich kann Verstehen falls jemand 1 stunde t\u00e4glich dieses spiel spielt und dann die Story in 5 Tagen durch hat das er sich erstmal wieder rein finden muss um nicht verloren zu gehen\n\nDie Kampfzehnen waren immer Detaltiert und sauber geschrieben. Dazu gab es auch eine Abwechslung beim Schreibstyle  das der Move erst in Bildern gezeigt wird und dann der Aufbau der Technick erkl\u00e4rt wird neben den normalen Kampfschreibstyle.\n\nMusik: Sehr sch\u00f6n und passend. Viel Klavier und klassische Musik. Viele charaktere hatten ihre eigene kleine Melodie Die sehr gut auf die charaktere gepasst haben. ich w\u00fcrde aber pers\u00f6nlich nicht die CD kaufen maximal 1-2 Lieder als Errinnerung f\u00fcr meine Bibliotek. Die Soundeffekte waren mittelm\u00e4sig aber inordnung.\n\nFazit: \n\nDas Spiel hat einen sehr guten Eindruck auf mich hinterlassen.\nEs war eine gute story mit einem nicht einfachen Thema was aber super umgesetzt wurde ohne dabei\nden humor zu verlieren (und keine Sorge ihr werdet auch andere Gef\u00fchle noch bekommen). Es ist vom Technischen nicht perfekt und man merkt das es manchmal am Geld gefehlt hat.\nDenoch war es f\u00fcr den 8 euro eine Erfahrung die Ich jedem wirklich empfehlen kann vorallem die j\u00fcngere generation\nvon 10-16 kann ich es empfehlen da es vieleicht Ihnen ein anderen Blickwinkel auf Klassenkameraden geben k\u00f6nnte\noder vieleicht ihnen zeigt das egal wie viele Schl\u00e4ge man einsteckt (philosophisch hoffentlich) und die Hoffnung schon aufgegeben hat, sich nicht selbstaufgeben kann den manchmal reicht ein l\u00e4cherliches versprechen das dich am ende zum Ziel f\u00fchrt.\n\nOne Smal Fire At A Time bekommt von mir das predicat klein aber oho ... nat\u00fcrlich die Flamme!!!!\n\n\nPs: WAS DIE IST 13  MANNN Q.Q  Aniflo out\n\n\nMeine Anderen Reviews und Kurz Reviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDcsTEn4wHhfH8mvtbgFEFQ\n\nDort wird am 13.06 20:00 noch eine ausf\u00fcrhliche editierte review erscheinen wenn ichs zeitlich schaffe.

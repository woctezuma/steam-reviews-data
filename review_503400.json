It is a pleasure to look at.\n\nIs it a pleasure overall? [i]Four Last Things[/i] is not a well-designed game\u2014it's a clunky, linear, and very barebones point-and-click adventure. Then again, stunning you with incredible design was clearly never the game's goal. Which is fine; point-and-click adventures are a good genre for creators who just want to showcase beautiful imagery, characters, and wit.\n\nUnfortunately, it's the latter that was a miss for me. While [i]Four Last Things[/i] starts with a hilarious Python-esque premise, and the sometimes crude humor is absolutely appropriate, the referential bits simply fall flat. I've only found a couple of jokes humorous at all, and some were downright cringy. From a game that was clearly made by a person well-versed in Renaissance art I kind of expected something more original than just calling Bosch's characters weird a number of times.\n\nIt has some sweet bits, like your character singing along with every musician [i]in text[/i], and the animations alone make the game worth buying. But [i]Four Last Things[/i] is definitely not a masterpiece, and is doesn't even come close to Monty Python's wit or Monkey Island's charn.", "timestamp_created": 1514838731, "timestamp_updated": 1514838875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38911056": {"recommendationid": "38911056", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970327587", "num_games_owned": 2342, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "last_played": 1514743607}, "language": "english", "review": "A point-and-click short adventure through crudely animated classical art capturing the irreverant humor of Monty Python both in visuals and dialogue.\n\nPuzzles skew towards easy - you will not be trying infinite combinations of items here. Generally, they are clever, fair and contribute to the humor.\n\nThe most important aspect however, is that the humor works. Careful attention was paid towards physical gags, with even the right-mouse button mapped to performing a backflip. Character dialogue is snappy with a few laugh-out-loud moments. However, the author would have benefited from an editor to remove the referential humor.\n\nUltimately, while I'd love to have seen more than an hour's worth of content, the narrow scope has allowed

Widely.\n(For those who are easily triggered by religious references, and having religion poked fun at... you can stop now, and just walk away from the Store page. This game pokes fun at religious beliefs and practices. Big time. And I LOVE the dev for it!)\n\nNo list of Pros and Cons this time. I am just going to try and give a *hopefully* brief description of the game and why it was so good for me. I did say *hopefully*. Remember that later...\n\nThe art is fantastic. You are playing in a wonderfully weird amalgamation of paintings done by the Dutch Masters during the Renaissance period. Many images from one painting added to another, with somne subtle, and some not-so-subtle changes to the snippets. Weird. Wonderful. Artfully done.\n\nThe animation style and much of the humor is very Pythonesque. Not so much the movies (although I seemed to notice nods to The Life Of Brian and The Holy Grail... but that could just be my imagination and obsession with Monty Python...), but more the feel and look of the old Monty Python's Flying Circus. \n\nMuch Meta. Old style dialogues with modern, overly meta thrown in. Again, weird. Wonderful. As tastefully done as possible. Without being prudish. No other way to describe it for me.\n\nThe puzzles were clever. Who and what you needed to interact with, in what order, and in what time. Yes, you need to use your brain. None were terribly difficult to figure out, but some took more time than others. A few were wonderfully simple and silly. So simple it was too easy to overthink how to work it out. Which made me chuckle. Going through a very difficult time in my real life right now, and having a game that is very clever and intelligent, with silliness and simplicity mixed in, and all sorts of philosophical and existential \"standards\" being poked fun at... I needed this. \n\nMy experience with this game. I adore it. It was just what I needed to lift some very dark clouds. But for those looking for \"deep\" gameplay, quick and easy puzzles and achievements, or handholding and brainless completion... move along. This won't be for you. The 4.5 hours of gameplay shown at the time of this review was ALL gameplay, no idling for Trading Cards, no artificial inflation of time played. But... I walked through the game, I did not run. I allowed myself to explore all interactions I could, and look at every little detail I could. And I know I missed some. So I will play it again. Just to see what I may have missed. \n\n[b]Thank you Joe Richardson! You did a good thing here, and made this middle aged lady smile.

It's reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's art-based animations in Monty Python productions, but at the same time feels completely unique in it's approach. It is also a very silly, but engrossing little tale of a person who wanted to confess his sins, but couldn't due to the church bureaucracy. So now he has to do all 7 again to get a chance to confess them.\n\nAnd it's a truly great game, which reminded me a lot of the great Monty Python & the Quest for the Holy Grail from\u00a07th Level, a usually forgotten silly little point and click adventure game based on the movie. Except, if that old game was often (intentionally) frustrating and annoying with its mini-games and puzzles, Four Last Things plays like a straight and really well made point and click adventure from start to finish.

However, it sets itself apart with its fabulous artwork, music and humour.\n\nThe game is set in the Renaissance era when culture, art and music were all the rage. You play as an un-named big-nosed traveller who arrives at a Catholic cathedral in search of absolution for your sins. Unfortunately, the priests inform you that as your sins were committed outside their jurisdiction, they can't take your confession. It's the rules... but there is a loophole. You can repeat all your sins within their parish and then you'll be allowed to make your confession. There follows your quest to commit the 7 deadly sins.\n\nGameplay involves the familiar techniques of interacting with characters and selecting one of 4 (outrageously silly) responses; picking up items to be added to your auto-hide inventory taskbar at the top, then using the items on other items or characters to make things happen. There are a dozen or so village scenes and you walk from one to another to further your quest, which culminates in your return to the cathedral to make your confession.\n\nThis is definitely on the lower end of the difficulty spectrum in this genre. It's not about challenge, it's about enjoyment of the content.\n\n[h1]Sound, Vision & Humour[/h1]\n\nIt's an exquisite blend of highly intricate paintings, classical music and modern, irreverent internet-style humour.\n\nThe scenes are made up of (seamlessly) bolted-together classic paintings and there's all sorts of Monty Python style photoshopping going on to produce hilarious animated results. You have to spend time and look closely or you'll miss some of the best bits. One of the scenes is an actual art gallery containing all(?) of the artwork used to create the other scenes.\n\nThere's a different tune for each scene. They are on a fairly short loop so don't expect any full length Mozart concertos or any of the well-known classics, these are snippets of lesser known classical music, and all the more interesting for it. Don't forget to do the Jam Session achievement for extra tunes - is it just me, or is that musician playing the lute in the style of Angus Young out of AC/DC?\n\nHere are some of my favourite bits of humour to give you a taste. Painting descriptions: Merry Peasants And A Couple Of Pig-Botherers; All Sorts Of Village-Based Shenanigans; Naughty People In Circles. Twerking in exchange for certain services. When you use the hand action on some characters you give them a slap (this never gets old). One particular exchange: SLAP! \"what was that for?\"... \"just keeping you on your toes\"... \"oh ok, thanks!\"\n\n[h1]Minor Gripes[/h1]\n\nAfter you enter the cathedral near the end of the game you're locked out of the main village and can't go back without starting a new game. This is particularly annoying if you want to collect the last remaining achievements not picked up during the normal playthrough.\n\nThere are a couple of cutscenes where a huge tapestry of wonderful artwork scrolls past. It's such a waste only to catch a glimpse of it all before it whizzes off the screen.\n\nIt would be nice to have a zoom feature (mouse wheel?) to admire those small details up close.\n\nWindows only. Linux please!\n\n[h1]Value[/h1]\n\nOK so it's short. You can complete it in 1-2 hours with a guide, so if you're finicky about that then wait for a sale. For me, the quality of the game is worth the price. It's exactly like a real-life art gallery - you can pay your entry fee and sprint to the exit, but that's missing the whole point of it.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nWhat do you do for entertainment, outside of gaming? Visit an art gallery? Go to a music concert? Watch a comedian? Well then here you have pure entertainment.

A lot of the characters are just distractions. Just ignore every muscian and dancer, except the one next to the metal-smith, and don't bother talking or interacting with anyone in the art room. Also, the sinners outside of the church have no involvement with the puzzles. Finally, the smoking guy contributes nothing but conversation, and the cheering people by the statue do nothing at all. Oh, and the fishermen contribute nothing, as do the street-fighters. \n2. There's an open area situated high in the sky, in which you can't do anything, so don't bother visiting it twice. This game does not drop any new items or characters into places as the story progresses, so basically, if it's empty once then it's empty forever. \n3. One quest involves solving a riddle. The trick is that this one isn't really a riddle--that is, the phrases should be treated literally and not figuratively. \n4. Some of the quests involve paying attention to the art and elements of the background. So, if you're trying to be creative about solving a puzzle but you keep being told that your permutations are not allowable, then you have to find an in-game analogue to make your design choices. \n5. Some items are hard to notice, especially since they don't look any different from the rest of the background textures. Here's some important locations:\n---A jug by the landowners. \n---A hammer and chisle at the lower right-hand corner of the town center. \n---A musical instrument on the windowsill of the cheering family's house.\n---A fish by the fishermen. Although I'm not sure if that was ever used for anything. \n\nIf you want to get all of the achievements, then remember these rules:\n1. Drink booze.\n2. Give the poor man near the end everything of value. Even fish and pie, if you are carrying them. \n3. Do something involving art. I think that you have to analyze a particular painting. \nOtherwise, I think that the achievements can be obtained via normal story progression.\n\nUltimately, I love it. The art style is amazing and employed in startlingly creative ways. I was chuckling because of the humor throughout. And it could be easily solved without a walkthrough; it's not like the game world is huge, even if you count all of the extraneous characters, so wandering back and forth aimlessly will eventually yield progression in short time.", "timestamp_created": 1488085872, "timestamp_updated": 1488085872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493590", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30184140": {"recommendationid": "30184140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068860602", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489792327}, "language": "english", "review": "Clearly the best point-and-click adventure based on classic artwork and involving a loophole in the Church doctrine that allows you to be absolved of your seven deadly sins only by committing them again LOCALLY that is currently available in the gaming market.

I was immediately taken with the renaissance artwork and minimal interface on display. More so, I was impressed that this game was designed and created, from the ground up, by a single developer. He clearly had a passion for Point and Click adventure games and, having been raised on games like Monkey Island, Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (basically anything by LucasArts), I was keen to try the game.\n\nI played the game for about 30 minutes and, while this is not enough to give a full review on the day it is released, it gave me enough information to help you, the steam community, decide if you want to purchase the game. Firstly, you will love the graphical style. As soon as you see your character walk in the opening scene, you will smile and maybe chuckle. This is a game with a sense of humour and this was a theme throughout my play through.\n\nThe writing / story is what makes a point and click adventure game, and in this respect, it does not disappoint. I will not spoil the story - I feel it is up to you to discover it and it will be a sin for me to divulge - but I will say this: I enjoyed it immensely. \n\nThe game itself is not long. Speaking to the developer, it will take anywhere from 2 to 6 hours to complete, depending on your point and click experience. However, this is not a bad length for this type of game. Some adventure games wear out their welcome. This one does not. \n\nThe lowdown is this, exceptional visual style combined with good writing and a nice audio track makes this little gem a must buy. Also, you get to commit the seven deadly sins.

It's filled to the brim with charm and creativity, and this shows from the amount of puns and witty, detailed level designs. The puzzles are challenging enough and, surprisingly, the combat actually meshes quite well in this game. The overarching plot isn't exactly unique in itself, but the execution of it and experience as a whole is definitely worthwhile. Lastly, the songs were pretty catchy. I just wish they were longer.\n\nWith that said, I did have some issues with the game. The map loading screens were a tad long, and with the amount of levels it became confusing to know which map was named what. It would've been nice to have the name of the level on the map itself.\n\nThe puzzles are done quite well and aren't too difficult, but there was a lot of backtracking involved as I progressed. The final world showed this even more so, but with the 'waves of despair' it added more frustration. \n\nI experienced one particular glitch that enabled me to sort of skip the boss fight.

The entire game takes place within the mind and it\u2019s world\u2019s and characters use this theme throughout.\n\nDusty sets out on his journey with his overly optimistic companion, piper, after his scrapbook is stolen. Dusty\u2019s journey takes him to various parts of the mind. The right side of the brain, where creativity is controlled. The left side of the brain, where logic comes into play. Finally, the conscious mind, where you\u2019ll find a harsh and ever changing landscape.\n\nIn each area you\u2019ll be tasked with defeating nightmares. These nightmares sing while battling them and each song is excellently done. The songs vary depending on the nightmare as well so it\u2019s varied in genre. I personally liked the fear of death\u2019s songs the most, since his were rock/metal based. They all were excellent though and very catchy. The ambient music was also very good. There are often instruments as trees and hearing them was also enjoyable. All in all, the music mixed with the ambient sounds was quite eargasmic.\n\nThe game\u2019s gameplay mostly revolves around solving various types of puzzles. These puzzles are very well designed and are the perfect mix between easy and challenging. The game definitely makes your brain work and the puzzles are often very fun to solve as well.\n\nI also really liked the colorful artwork that was used throughout. Each area you visit is well designed and you could feel that a lot of work went into making them unique. The game often felt like playing a fairy tale in truth. It was a mixture between lighthearted and dark and it was highly entertaining.\n\nThe game does feature some combat and it often kicked in at perfect moments. This way the puzzles never become monotonous or repetitive. I will admit that the combat system isn\u2019t the game\u2019s focus so it\u2019s a bit on the basic side. It does it\u2019s job well in the end though.\n\nOverall, Figment is an amazing audio-visual experience. It\u2019s gorgeous art style mixed with the excellent music throughout creates a torrent of enjoyment. Listening to everything on a surround sound system was pretty amazing and I highly recommend it with headphones. The game\u2019s story was pretty good too but it\u2019s world, mixed with the music and art is really what makes it worth playing. I highly recommend this one folks, it\u2019s pretty epic.\n\nIf you're interested in checking out my full review or would simply like to see my final score, you can find the review here: http://www.endworldgaming.com/puzzle/figment-review\n\nThanks a lot for taking the time to check out my review folks, happy gaming!", "timestamp_created": 1514666108, "timestamp_updated": 1514666108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38867509": {"recommendationid": "38867509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312635558", "num_games_owned": 524, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509278597}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438-\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u0420\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439-\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u044d\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. \u041c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b.\n", "timestamp_created": 1514652954, "timestamp_updated": 1514652954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465116", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38825717": {"recommendationid": "38825717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011500340", "num_games_owned": 1636, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514566308}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun, relatively short (about the right size), game.

The story has elements of Pixar's Inside Out with its own lovely humor and quirkiness and I found myself humming to the music long after playing the game. The puzzles are probably slightly on the easier side but I actually credit it to good game design and well-placed hints and writing, which I would much more prefer than wandering and struggling for hours to then solve the puzzle and have the game hints only make sense after figuring out the solution.\n\nI did receive this game for free and having played through the game and then looking at the price tag, I would gladly pay full-price now and will get another copy as a gift but I could see myself being a bit wary of the price if I hadn't already played and fallen in love with it. For those willing to support really great indie games, I highly recommend this.

The action-adventure game released in late September of this year has the player controlling Dusty, a guardian of the mind who is needed once again. Chasing down the traumas inflicting the mind, Dusty and his trusty bird friend Piper, travel great distances to seek out and destroy the suffering. Their journey takes them around the brain to areas such as the appropriately named Cerebrum city and Freedom Isles. Join Dusty and Piper in a grand and beautiful world solving complex puzzles and defeating the anguish inflicting the mind once and for all.\n\nStarting up the game, I immediately plugged in my controller to see what Figment would best be played with. I was in for a pleasant surprise as the controller felt just as good in my hands as the mouse and keyboard, if not better. The vibrations, easy controls, and nostalgia of playing my Xbox sealed the deal for me as I continued the game with the controller. Figment includes more than just a story to follow and enemies to tackle. It includes many sections that aren\u2019t mandatory to continue the story. These usually include memories or as the game calls them, \u201cRemembranes\u201d. One of these Remembranes includes a young boy named Todd who says \u201cGo away, you jerk. I never want to play with you again!\u201d. Remembrances are an insight into why the mind is experiencing all the trauma we see and fight.  You can also knock on the doors of local residents of the mind, and listen as they express their concerns or say a witty comment. Details like this make or break a game and Figment is definitely a stellar example of how including features like these really add to a game\u2019s enjoyment.\n\nThe first 10 minutes of the game was basically an introduction to the mechanics and one of the main villains, Nightmare. Dusty obviously isn\u2019t new to the whole saving the mind thing, as Piper drops many hints that they have known each other for a long time. Piper asks Dusty for help once again but he\u2019s reluctant saying that the mind has moved on. Only when Dusty is personally affected by the Nightmare, a skinny purple entity with four arms who steals Dusty\u2019s martini and scrapbook, that he decides to go after it. We retrieve his sword, solve an abundance of simple puzzles, and meet the mayor, who oddly talks only in rhymes, and sends us on a mission to destroy the three sources of trauma.\n\nFrom there Dusty and Piper travel into the right hemisphere of the brain, which is a huge change of scenery. We go from a dull, dark and rainy region of the brain, to a bright, vibrant and lively area which is no doubt in reference to a more creative part of the mind. Musical instruments are abundant as guitars, trombones and flutes are placed all over the land, some of which serve as plant life. Within the first five minutes of arriving, we are introduced to the second villain, Plague man. Plague man seems to take advantage of our fear of sickness as he spews toxic gas and summons rodents that sneeze and do damage. As a side note, I\u2019m a fan of how Dusty dies in this game. If you take too much damage from the gas or the rodents, Dusty poofs away in a cloud of smoke only to quickly reappear at the last checkpoint. The death animation isn\u2019t overly done and you are quickly returned to play the game once more.\n\nAs you progress through the game, the puzzles become more and more complex. Figment isn\u2019t a type of game that you can breeze through. It requires thinking, patience and the occasional YouTube walk through and for some people, this is their cup of tea.\n\nI\u2019m sure we can all think of a period in our life where our heads were filled with darkness and despair. We all go through it, everything in our life isn\u2019t going to go as perfectly as we\u2019d like to. Sometimes we are troubled with anxiety, depression, and fear and this is what the game bases its story off of. The antagonists in the game are our real-life fears visualized as quirky and humorous villains that perform the occasional musical performances. They run like cowards as you bravely continue your journey to rid the minds of the difficulties. Figment takes a playful approach to the very grim realities many people face on a day to day basis. It\u2019s a game for all age groups and each group will enjoy and analyze the game differently. In the end, Figment is about facing your fears and how life is just one big game that shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously.\n\nI enjoyed many aspects of the game and had little to complain about. The dazzling and elegant world the game had to offer was one of its finest qualities. It was filled with detail with more than just a story to follow. Knocking on the doors of the inhabitants, I found myself curious about what everyone had to say. Perhaps if the residents walked out of their house, and showed their faces instead of just lighting up a window, it would\u2019ve added to the game\u2019s great design. Although the combat was light, it was solid enough. Figment isn\u2019t entirely about combat but when you slay your enemies you get the feeling of satisfaction that makes you want to do it all over again.The combat can feel a bit frustrating at times as the enemies routinely disappear and reappear as they cycle through their abilities. This is mostly solved as some of the enemies share a health pool, so once one of them dies, so do the rest. The puzzles can sometimes seem overwhelming as the setting zooms out and you can see all the different parts that you have to deal with. However, completing one, especially a long complex puzzle gives you a sense of gratification that keeps the game moving. Finally, the musical performances add a great touch to the game. The catchy tunes are placed perfectly with the situations and I found myself humming to them sometimes. Overall the game has good combat, thought-provoking puzzles, fetching music and a diverse and stylish environment that connects to the ever-growing anxiety, depression, and sickness around the world.  \n\nEnomview Score: 8 out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1516565104, "timestamp_updated": 1516565104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 117, "total_negative": 8, "total_reviews": 125}}

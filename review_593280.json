The whole game is quest driven to the point of parody. I didn't encounter any bugs/crashes. Just incredible.\n\nThe artsyle is like Dont Starve meets Sproggiwood and the music is really great. I already said I liked the writing and the story is actually engaging.  It's more mature than expected (but immature as hell, so many friggin' cat puns. lol).\n\nIf you like cat jokes, cat quests and neat combat get Cat Quest.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the \"Mew Game Plus\" options they seemed a little much.  Didn't bother with them.  I also wish they had more dungeon variety and had more NPC interactions in dungeons.  99% of the time it was \"go in the cave, clear the cave, oh wait I heard them escape outside lets go back outside!\" type stuff.

[b][i]Cat Quest[/i][/b] is also a game that is about 4 hours too long. This light and breezy aRPG from the gentle folk known as the GentleBros is a game made with a lot of heart and soul that sees you assume the mantle of a Dragonblood, and ancient type of cat warrior  whose job is to protect the world from dragons and all other manner of nasties. [b][i]Cat Quest[/i][/b] It is also a game that includes an excessive amount of padding and repetition for such a small and simple tail (meaow, yes that spelling is correct) that after the 4 hour mark I was feeling a little bit less pawsitive about it. [b][i]Cat Quest[/i][/b] takes the traditional gameplay mechanics we know from countless aRPG's but keeps them incredibly simplistic (you can see [b][i]Cat Quest[/i][/b] started life as a mobile game that got pawted over to PC). Still there is fun to be had here as you run around an open world knowns as Felingard on a mission to save your sister from the claws of a resident evil cat called Drakoth while attending to the every whim and cat-astrophe of its inhabitants.

Im ersten Spieldurchgang hatte ich die Haupsttory, die Nebenaufgaben und das Besuchen aller Dungeons in ca. 10 Stunden erledigt. Danach kamen dann die neuen Spiele mit unterschiedlichen Modifikatoren wie z.B. \"St\u00e4rkere Monster\", \"Nackte Katze\" usw.  hinzu.\n\nInsgesamt also ein einfaches und kurzweiliges Abenteuer, welches auch gut von einem j\u00fcngerem Publikum erlebt werden kann. Preis/Leistung stimmen f\u00fcr mich gut \u00fcberein. Und als Katzenfan kommt man hier auch voll auf seine Kosten.\n\n\n\n[b]Pro:[/b]\n+ Kurzweilig\n+ Simples, aber nicht langweiliges Gameplay\n+ Bunte, aber knuffige Grafik\n+ Katzenbezogene Dialoge bei denen ich hin und wieder schmunzeln musste\n+ Musik und Sounds sind typisch und passen zur Stimmung des Spiels\n\n\n[b]Con:[/b]\n- Einige Errungenschaften k\u00f6nnen nur durch wiederholtes Durchspielen erlangt werden.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n[b]Story, Charakter und Ausr\u00fcstung[/b]\n\nDie Story ist an sich nichts Neues: Schwester wird vom B\u00f6sewicht entf\u00fchrt und der junge Held zieht aus, um das Geschwisterchen zu retten. Am Ende der Geschichte gibt es noch eine Wendung, aber ich will jetzt nicht zuviel verraten...\n\nDie einzelnen Quests der Haupt- und Nebenstory sind durch den Pfeil, der einem den Weg weist, immer einfach zu finden und f\u00fcllen die Welt mit Leben. Dabei sind einige etwas interessanter als andere, aber Spa\u00df hatte ich dennoch an allen.\n\nDie ganzen Dialoge sind voll mit Anspielungen auf Katzen und ich hatte anfangs die Bef\u00fcrchtung, dass es \u00fcbertrieben wurde. Allerdings muss ich zugeben, dass es mich eigentlich nicht gest\u00f6rt hat und an manchen Stellen sogar richtig putzig ist.\n\nEs gibt kein typisches Klassensystem wie in anderen Rollenspielen. Es gibt insgesamt 7 Zauberspr\u00fcche und diese k\u00f6nnen bis zu einer maximalen Stufe von 10 erlernt werden. Alles weitere wird \u00fcber die Ausr\u00fcstung geregelt, welche Boni oder aber auch Mali auf die Eigenschaften wie Trefferpunkte, Angriff, Magie usw. geben k\u00f6nnen. Bei einem Stufenaufstieg erh\u00f6hen sich dann ebenfalls nochmal die Charaktereigenschaften um einen bestimmten Wert.\n\nDie Ausr\u00fcstung ist so gestaltet, dass nicht das ganze Inventar voller Beute ist, sondern dass es nur eine begrenzte Auswahl an Gegenst\u00e4nden gibt. Sollte man in Kisten (gefunden oder bei der Schmiedin erworben) einen (zuf\u00e4llig ausgew\u00e4hlten) Gegenstand finden, den man bereits hat, wird dieser automatisch verbessert. Ausr\u00fcstung kann bis zu einer maximalen Stufe von 99 verbessert werden.\nAu\u00dferdem gibt es legend\u00e4re Ausr\u00fcstung (Mut, Glauben und Willenskraft) sowie das Altmeister-Set (Altmeisterhelm, Altmeisterr\u00fcstung und Ragnarok), die ebenfalls verbessert werden kann.\n\n\n[b]Grafik und Performance[/b]\n\nDie Darstellung ist recht bunt, einfach und niedlich. Wenn man den Stil mag, gibt das Ganze ein rundes Gesamtbild ab.\n\nDie Systemanforderungen sind niedrig und ich hatte keinerlei Probleme - keine Ruckler, Spielabst\u00fcrze oder sonstiges, was das Spielvergn\u00fcgen getr\u00fcbt haben k\u00f6nnte.\nMein System: AMD Phenom II X6,  GTX660 und 8GB RAM\n\n\n[b]Missionen und KI[/b]\n\nDie Missionen sind einfach gehalten und k\u00f6nnen eigentlich nicht verfehlt werden, da ein Pfeil immer die Richtung anzeigt. An zwei Stellen in der Hauptmission m\u00fcssen erst Nebenauftr\u00e4ge erf\u00fcllt werden, damit man in der Hauptstory weiter kommt. Aber auch dies wird einem vorher verraten, sodass man zu jeder Zeit wei\u00df, was man machen muss. Lediglich mit den \"goldenen Schatztruhen\" konnte ich zu Beginn nicht viel anfangen. Dies wird aber klar, wenn man sich wirklich alles in der Welt anschaut oder den entsprechenden Guide dazu liest.\n\nNebenauftr\u00e4ge k\u00f6nnen erf\u00fcllt werden, aber dies ist keine Pflicht. Allerdings sind sie eine gute M\u00f6glichkeit, Gold und Erfahrung zu sammeln. Au\u00dferdem f\u00fcllen sie die Welt mit Leben und man hat insgesamt mehr vom Spiel, wenn man diese mitmacht.\n\nDer Kampf ist ebenfalls recht einfach. Jeder Monstertyp hat immer die selben Angriffsarten. Als Beispiel haben F\u00fcchse immer einen relativ gro\u00dfen Wirkungsbreich, in dem sie einen Feuerangriff starten. Fische haben hingegen nur einen kleinen Angriffsbereich. So kann es kommen, dass man von einem Rudel Magier, welche hinter B\u00fcschen stehen, schnell mal einen auf die Nase bekommt, da diese einen recht gro\u00dfen Angriffsbereich mit ihren magischen Attacken haben.\nWenn man allerdings ersteinmal herausgefunden hat, wie welches Monster angreift, kann man sich leicht darauf einstellen und den Kampf gegen Monster mit einer h\u00f6heren Stufe wagen.\n\n\n[b]Errungenschaften und Spielmodi[/b]\n\nEinige der Errungenschaften erh\u00e4lt man einfach durch das Spielen der Geschichte. Einge erh\u00e4lt man, wenn man sich genau in der Welt umschaut und alles erkundet. Und dann gibt es welche, die man nur durch wiederholtes Spielen der Geschichte mit vorher eingestellten Modifikationen erh\u00e4lt. Das Bestreiten des Abenteuers mit einer Katze der Stufe 1 oder einer Katze, welche keine Ausr\u00fcstung tr\u00e4gt und nur mit den Boni aus den Stufenaufstiegen \u00fcberleben muss, w\u00e4ren hier zwei Beispiele. Ebenso muss man, wenn man die Altmeisterr\u00fcstung haben will, das Spiel schon drei mal durchspielen. Will man diese dann auch noch in der Stufe verbessern, kommen weitere Durchl\u00e4ufe hinzu...\nDies ist f\u00fcr mich wirklicher ein Negativpunkt. Auch wenn das Spiel und die Geschichte niedlich sind und Spa\u00df machen, irgendwann nach dem x-ten Mal ist es dann doch recht langweilig. Vielleicht ist es anders, wenn man nur hin und wieder ein R\u00fcndchen spielt und nicht wie ich das Spiel in relativ kurzer Zeit \"durchsuchtet\". Grunds\u00e4tzlich sind die einzelnen Spielmodi nicht schlecht und k\u00f6nnen nochmal ein anderes Spielerlebnis vermitteln.\n\n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\n\nCat Quest ist ein kleines, niedliches Spiel f\u00fcr Jung und Alt, welches mich an Spiele aus vergangenen Tagen erinnert. Man wird nicht mit Regeln und Strategie erschlagen und auch der Geschichte kann man einfach folgen.

I really, really tried to.  However, this is not a game you should spend more than 2 dollars on...and that is being generous.  It's obviously designed for a mobile device, and that does not translate very well to a dekstop and especially not a laptop.  The cat puns are cute...for a while.  The writing is dreadful. Not that you should expect award winning dialogue and seriously in-depth character development from a game that is cartoony in appearance and is called \"Cat Quest\", but this is some of the worst I've ever seen.  I came up with a new drinking game because of this crap.  Every time a character has \"...........\" for their line in a speech balloon, drink.  Two drinks for \"Heh\", and three drinks for a forced pop culture reference/lame-as-hell joke.  You'll be ***ing smashed within an hour.  Half a beer for a fetch quest with the most asinine purpose behind it (go get a DVD collection that I use to make armor because reasons. Also, we need to shove another unfunny pop culture reference in). And a whole beer for everytime that STUPID, *****ing, ******* of a *****ing *****, piece of monkey ***** dodge function fails you.  I don't think I'll ever be able to convey how much the dodge mechanic sucks or how many times it will not respond fast enough to actually work.  Anyway, I don't recommend this game at all for the PC.  If you've got a hankering for a game to kill some time on a smoke break or something, then fine.  Grind a little while on your phone, and for God's sake don't pay for anything.  That might allow these guys to make more awful **** and try to pass it off as a computer game.

There's no trash to pick up, just gear. And you'll never clutter your bag with six different Longswords -- you have one longsword, and if you pick up a second, the first one just gets stronger. The same with armour. \n\n    You have three slots for gear: head, chest, and weapon. When you sort your inventory by these three slots, the sorting puts the best piece at the very front so you immediately know what gives you the most benefit. This isn't perfect, though -- say you're more interested in hitting heavy with magic, or you want to build up your armour. You'll need to peruse and compair for yourself, but the best well-rounded piece is always right at the top of the list.\n\n    Spells are also kept in the inventory, and you can train them up to level 10 by buying new ranks. You can keep four spells at the ready and it's easy to swap them out. Combat doesn't interrupt you from changing gear or spells, and if you don't want to fight you can just wander off and the mob will pretty quickly lose interest.\n\n    Left clicking is your attack. That's it! You'll attack ahead of you, and if a mob dies while you're in the middle of murdering you'll gravitate toward the next nearest one, if there's a monster close enough.\n\n    Right clicking gives you your magic menu, or you can use 1, 2, 3, or 4 to cast spells\n\n    The quest system is sleek too: while you're on a side quest, the main quest is on hold. You'll get a marker to help you find where you're going (which has been helpful for me, since I'm playing the game in French and I don't always understand what I'm being told), though normally it's not really necessary. You see up front how much gold and xp you'll get in reward, but almost every quest will also give you a random piece of gear.\n\n    I do feel like the art is a little (lot) lazy in some places: there's almost no variation in the NPCs (I can think of maybe five NPCs that have a truly unique appearance), and while the animations are smooth they're a little samey after a short while.\nThe music is nice, though after the first hour you'll have heard it all.\n\n    The dungeons have a cool aspect to them: killing all the monsters inside will 'complete' the dungeon, but if you left any chests behind the dungeon will have a little chest icon over it to let you know. Many of the nifties in dungeons are only found by looking for hidden pathways, and while some dungeons do point the way to let you know, most of them don't. I am a little frustrated that most of my time in a dungeon is spent running against invisible barriers, trying to find out if there's a hidden path, but the dungeons themselves are so very short that it's not too much of a time waste.\n\n    Monster variation is pretty cool, too, if pretty standard: there are base types of mobs and then, essentially, palette swaps of those with different moves or spells. Some mobs are boss types, and some are just really clever -- like statue hands that are animated by magic, and slam into the floor. \n\n    You can see where monster spell ranges are, and you have a clear visual of their attack time. The mob will flicker red or gold depending on whether they're weak or strong to a certain type of magic or to your physical attacks.\n\n    There are no real ranged attacks in the game. Some spells reach a little bit away from you, but there are no bows, no fireballs, etc. So if you're like me and you generally prefer to be a ranged physical damager, you're a bit out of luck. :B\nMoney essentially doesn't matter. There's no food or potions to buy, and inns are free.\n\n    You can spend that money at the blacksmith to try your chance at better gear, but the loot you get from doing that is random.\n\n    In all, I've been binging the crap out of this game because the play is fun, the story is cute and entertaining (except for the immediately imperiled sister that you spend the game trying to rescue), and the system has yet to annoy me. Even when I'm in dungeons that well outlevel me I find it a fun challenge and not an irritation. Taking down lv 99 dungeons when you're sub lv50 is fun, and I suspect totally intentional. \n\n    I want to say this is a super solid introduction to more complex games of this type, given the wandering mobs on the overworld and the way the dungeons work, along with the quest system and the super simple but still really satisfying combat system. But even as an intro-type game, it really stands well on its own.\n\n    And it's full of cat puns.", "timestamp_created": 1514683536, "timestamp_updated": 1514683536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610417", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38880290": {"recommendationid": "38880290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125792202", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 194, "last_played": 1514675190}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall it's a great game.

Especially if they want a nice relaxing yet fun and challenging one. :)", "timestamp_created": 1514675672, "timestamp_updated": 1514675672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38879291": {"recommendationid": "38879291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156550674", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 662, "last_played": 1514738635}, "language": "english", "review": "You probably would expect a cat pun in this review but the amount of puns in the others already make me want to claw my eyes out.

Es macht somit einfach Spa\u00df die bunte Gegend zu erkunden.

Hierbei muss man die Story mit gewissen Handycaps durchspielen, z.B nur mit level 1, als nackte Katze OHNE Ausr\u00fcstung,\nnur 9 Leben oder mit st\u00e4rkeren Gegnern.\n\nMich hat es vom ersten Moment an gepackt und so schnell nicht mehr los gelassen. Das Christmas Update war sehr nett gemacht und ich hoffe man kann sich bald an mehr solcher Updates erfreuen!\nNicht nur f\u00fcr Katzenfans zu empfehlen!!

The art design is simple but elegant, and the controls are easy, understanding the game is easy and it's in multiple languages. I haven't gotten to far into the game, but it's lovely. There's always a nice little arrow telling you where to go, which helps me a lot because I'm often forgetful. I don't know if there's a way to sell items, if there isn't, that's the one downside to the game, as well as if you go into a cave (dungeon) and kill mostly everything, go out and heal, then go back, every creature respawns, but otherwise it's amazing.

Las quests se hacen repetitivas, tanto las principales como las secundarias, y acabas hasta por olvidar un poco tu cometido.\n\nRespecto a la jugabilidad: Es un poco dif\u00edcil adaptarse al principio, sobre todo por el tema de la magia, y el tener que controlarlo todo entre el raton y el teclado a veces es confuso (claro, siempre puedes cambiar los controles, parezco gilipollas, \u00bfno?

Por ser un RPG, est\u00e1n bastante bien, no son los t\u00edpicos gr\u00e1ficos de 8-Bit que te sueles encontrar. Y tiene gatitos.\n\nOtros puntos a tratar: Tiene bastantes referencias y juegos de palabras con gatos, lo que hace del juego algo llevadero (me matan demasiado los gatos andaluces x'D). La banda sonora no est\u00e1 mal, no es de las mejores que he escuchado pero est\u00e1 guay. El hecho de poder tener varios tipos de equipamiento es muy positivo, ya que puedes decidir por tu cuenta si ser guerrero, mago...\n\nPara resumir: No es de los mejores juegos que he jugado, ni de los peores, pero tiene algo que lo hace entretenido de jugar.

This is old-school ARPG level 095, not even 101. You see that guy? HIT HIM WITH YOUR SWORD UNTIL HAPPY ORBS FLY OUT! You see these caves with questionmarks? WALK INTO THEM. You can walk to any village and take a nap to save and refill health and MP, even in the middle of multiple stage quests. This saved me on more than 1 of the end-game quests (damn spike-butt adds).\n\nMy 3 caveats are small.\n\n1 - You don't get to pick and choose the armor that is level-up'd. Devs say they want you to pick and choose armor/weapons, but this just leads to frustration. When you want to actually level up something and need to sit through the chest opening dialog AGAIN... and end up getting some worthless item upgraded from level 6 to 8.\n\n2 - The fetch quests do require some significant back-tracking which is tedious in the mid-game. Not terrible as this just gave me more time to spam the fire spell on the thunder goats.\n\n3 - Level markers. I'm very much a grind early and breeze through gamer. I ran through a level 10 dungeon probably 30 times to reach level 16. From then on, I was ahead of the level curve on the side-quests. However, the main quest doesn't have a level marker. I fought the red dragon at level 40... Effectively the dragon was put into a blender set to liquify. I didn't know I was twice the recommended level. Not knowing the proper level made me quite the furry monster against the main quest.\n\nI'll finish the main quest this week and really don't feel the need to go through the mew-game+ modes.

Miau. Ha merecido la pena.\n\nEn primer lugar, cabe resaltar que esto no es un juego de esos profundos y complejos que tanto parecen gustar. Este juego es muy pero que muy simple. Y no es particularmente dificil. Pero nada de esto es malo, ya que resulta muy pero que muy entretenido.\n\nQuiz\u00e1s lo \u00fanico que se le pueda achacar es su duraci\u00f3n (9 horas en mi caso). El apartado visual es colorido y muy vistoso, su historia es rid\u00edcula (para bien) y la m\u00fasica es perfecta para el tipo de juego que es. Creo que lo mejor que se puede decir de este juego, es que es perfecto para cualquiera.\n\nLlevo jugando toda la vida, y naturalmente ya tengo una edad, con lo que me atraen m\u00e1s seg\u00fan que juegos. Pues este juego me parece atractivo como veterano (la diversi\u00f3n que proporciona compensa su simplicidad), pero tambien puede ser muy atractivo para personas m\u00e1s novatas. Diria que es el juego perfecto para ense\u00f1arle a jugar a un ni\u00f1o, o para iniciar a cualquiera.\n\n\u00bf\u00bfPero de que es?? Pues es un juego de mundo abierto (kind of), aventura rpg, y gatos. Super cuco, oyes (con voz pija).\n\nAdem\u00e1s, los desarroladores est\u00e1n por la labor y hace poco, a\u00f1adieron algunas quest m\u00e1s, y se les ve por los foros. A ver si el juego triunfa m\u00e1s y se deciden a hacer la secuela contra el imperio de los perros o las ratas pirata. O por lo menos una expansi\u00f3n gorda :D\n\nPero mejor que leer analisis de aficionados (como yo), lo mejor que podeis hacer es bajaros la demo y probarlo. No creo que os arrepintais (yo no lo hice, h\u00e9me aqui).\n\nEn resumen, recomendad\u00edsimo, salvo que seas uno de esos de \"oh, que porqueria, no es original\".

Wenn man will kann man es zwar bereits in ein paar Tagen durchgespielt haben, bekommt daf\u00fcr aber auch ein relativ zeitloses Gameplay ohne L\u00e4ngen und vielen sch\u00f6nen Anspielungen im Katzenstil. Der eine oder andere Gag oder Wortspiel sorgt auch f\u00fcr ein regelm\u00e4\u00dfiges Schmunzeln und wirkt trotz der dominierenden Katzenthematik jedoch nie ganz ausgelutscht oder fad. Auch die Quests sind zwar nich bombastisch in Szene gesetzt, wirken aber recht nat\u00fcrlich und fl\u00fcssig.\n\nIch muss aber zugeben das ich mir pers\u00f6nlich von der Hauptgeschichte noch einiges mehr erwartet habe, zumal der gegebene Ansatz doch sehr vielversprechend ist.... aber wer wei\u00df, da is ja noch genug Raum um die Geschichte weiterzuf\u00fchren.\n\nIch bin und bleibe zwar f\u00fcr immer eher ein Hundefreund, dennoch bin ich froh das ich Cat Quest gespielt habe.

Even though Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is a game from 1992, and the idea that people need eased into the realm of RPG video games might seem silly now, back then, well, it was still silly.  Anyway.\n\n     Cat Quest is the simplest form of ARPG.  Quests are point to point or clear this dungeon, leveling is fast, and enemies telegraph their attacks through big red AoE marks on the ground.  Honestly, if I had to pick a game that would teach a five year old how to play WoW, this would be it.  Well, I\u2019d probably just let them play WoW, but still.  Ok, maybe not on Moonguard.\n\n     My daughter loves Cat Quest, so maybe this sort of game is filling a need for an RPG that doesn\u2019t have three skill trees, fifty stats, and a gear enhancement system that would make Stephen Hawking throw up his hands in despair.  Well, you know, if he could move his arms.  Maybe Cat Quest is a forerunner in a new breed of ARPG that dispenses with the complexity and depth of traditional games, ushering in a new era of accessible games!\n\n     I sure hope not.  The thing is, the simplicity and ease of access come at a price.  Boredom.  You can only repeat the same thing so many times before it becomes tedious.  Cat Quest pushes that pretty  close to the breaking point.  There is no variety.  There are no surprises.  Once you learn the enemy patterns, of which there are maybe four, you win.\n\n     It\u2019s not a bad game, Cat Quest.  It does the thing it does perfectly well.

This was most definitely worth the impulse buy.\n\nI have to say I enjoy a lot about the game, the combat, the magic system, the writing, the CATS. The only real flaw I can think of is in how you upgrade your gear; by finding the same item in chests strewn about, or chests bought from the blacksmith. I found myself gravitating towards the Squire set of equipment, which boosts armor and magic to a slightly lesser degree than just investing in one of the two normally, with the axe providing damage + magic, perfect for someone toying with the systems. The helmet and armor are working well enough, keeping up with most of my gear at around level 25 as of the time of writing, being decently common in the chests, but the Squire Axe, which I acquired early on, is still level TWO. The RNG on upgrading seems a bit silly, especially as i've left the Ranger set untouched but it's probably some of my highest leveled gear at this point.\n\nNamed gear also seems a bit... underwhelming, for the point i'm at. I got a Skull Helmet that was mildly outclassed by my Squire Helmet decently early on, and the Family Jewels sword was mostly outclassed by similar gear, just looking cool but being not very worthwhile. This problem became a bit more relevant when I got the [spoiler]Golden Key[/spoiler] at around level 35, with most of the gear from the [spoiler]Golden Chests[/spoiler] in early dungeons seeming roughly on par, if not somewhat below, most of my generic gear. \n\nI guess another issue would be leveling, mostly following quests. I was level 20 or so, and did about 3-4 level 20 quests, and before I knew it, I was roughly level 27 and still had a handful more regular level 20 quests to go. Doing a batch of quests in just the southern half of the continent will easily bump you to around level 30 in just a few hours, with plenty more quests to spare.\n\nBesides that, this game is most certainly worth your time. The combat and spells are fun to play with, and I found myself greatly enjoying my time so far.

The main villain while super generic in the beginning ended up having a pretty decent backstory to his character and while the game isn't meant to be taken too seriously it has just enough depth to make the player care.\n\nIt's pretty short, my first playthrough took me 5 hours but there is loads of side quests. For the price, even without a sale it's a steal. It's one of those games that I can find myself coming back to and since it has a New Game + mode and other unlocakble things after it's beat is well worth the time put into it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514189803, "timestamp_updated": 1514189803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38644478": {"recommendationid": "38644478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131982736", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 663, "last_played": 1514597463}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like hack and slash + cuteness overload + cats, this is the game you need right now.

Just beware that you are buying a simple fun game that may offer about 5-10 hours of gameplay.\n\nPositive sides:\n+ Humor, characters and language (special thanks for Russian version, it's just amazing)\n+ Looting (items are diverse, although at a certain point you may find some items, or even a particular item, that can't be surpassed by any other)\n\nQuestionable:\n? Main and side quests are good but repetitive.\n? I value games that are fun to replay over and over again, be it a multiplayer or an awesome singleplayer campaign. I doubt that this game (at least right now) belongs to such a category. I know that developers add new regimes and may add something else in the future, so let's see what happens. It would be disappointing if that was the final product.\n\nNegative sides:\n- Price - After completing the overly repetetive campaign and most of the side quests there seems to be nothing else to do, making me wonder if the game is worth what it's asked for. Keeping in mind that there is a mobile version of the game with an appropriate price I feel that I overpayed.\n\nThe game definitely promises pleasant experience, although first impressions might promise even more. I have played 5 hours straight while congratulating developers in my head. After playing 9 hours, the interest is lost. The game is fun and not crude, but maybe new enemies/mobs, new quests, more diverse map and fighting mechanic, as well as co-op would make the game even better.

Some items are just purely worse than others. In the normal game, the level progression makes certain stats like extra HP useless on items. Overall, I would say I had a lot of garbage and only rarely switched what I was using. The equipment that lowers one stat and increases another just isn't worth using for the most part in the normal game where you see it first.\n\nI would say the game is a great format for bigger ideas, like co-op multiplayer and deeper level and item experiences, and I look forward to any similar future releases from this company that decide to go that route.\n\nIt was fun.

And you can explore every part of the world, as soon as It's possible for you to reach them.\n\nThe skills are also very useful, and have different effects and uses, which may aid you during the gameplay, even If you doesn't play as a mage.\n\nThe quests of the game have a interesting plot, though, includding the side quest, I, myself, enjoyed more the side quests than the main quest, looked like as If I were playing Final Fantasy III again, but with cats and hack n slash gameplay.\nBeside the lots of cat puns are quite...\n\nThose are the good sides of the game, now the bad sides.\n\nFirst, the chests inside the dungeons doesn't respawn, meaning that If you want to upgrade your gears, you have to buy new chests from the Blacksmith, or try finding chests on other dungeons you didn't explored yet.\n\nTalking about chests, almost every chest in the game have a RNG of which gear you can get, the bad is that It might also give you a item you have already maxed the level, meaning that you wasted a chest away.\n\nBuying new chests from the blacksmith is the most tedious thing ever, but isn't as tedious as training Enchanting on Skyrim, you have to do a ritual to buy the chests, no matter what chest It is, press E on the chest to trigger a dialogue with Kit asking If you want to buy the item, press Yes, then a chest appears on the screen, you have to wait a little while before the E appears so you can open the chest, press E, then the animation of opening the chest plays and after that appears the item you acquired. Now repeat that over and over until you either get what you want, or gets tired. It's boring and annoying!\n\nThe villain of the game is a [spoiler]weakling! You notice that since the beggining of the game, and If you keep doing side quests during your gameplay, you'll notice that he'll keep being a weakling even until the end game, everytime he spawns a clone, he kind of admits himself that he's a weakling, since his clones can be beaten with ease, If you master dodging the spells the he launches, you will end up laughing on how pathetic the boss is, and even more how he persists until the end the game on challenging the player.[/spoiler]\n\nThe monsters all have their own same behaviors, they either melee attacks, either have melee attack and casts, either casts, either melee attacks and casts two skills, either melee attack and casts 3 skills, well, just count how many cast prediction bars have under the enemy.\n\nThe cheapest fight I had in the game were [spoiler]against the Catulhu, using the melee It's almost impossible, since It used an AOE trap skill very often, so only using magic is able to defeat it, but since the player has so low number of mana, that means...[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]There is also the fact that after unlocking water walking, you can right away unlock the Flight skill, since just by unlocking it, you can go get the Flight Skill quests right away. Beside water walking allows you to face enemies in the water, there is not much in the game that requires this, also, flying is faster, why would you walk, or even water walk when you can fly to your destination?[/spoiler]\n\nAnd to finish, Spirry. Since the character has the personality of a door, Spirry talks for him, he's not that much as bad as the bag from Secret of Grindea, but I'd like to say something else to him at the end game, after beating the final boss.\n\nWell, this is my review about the game, beside the game doesn't have really much, being that I beaten It in 90 summed minutes of gameplay, the game is quite conforting to play, and grinders will probably love It, even more since level cap goes beyond level 100, and If I remember well, there are level 200 dungeons, so either you be hardcore and try beating that dungeon underleveled, or grind 'till there.\n\nYou may also pick the set that matches mostly your gameplay, and try to level it up, there are new game plus and other things in the game, but right now I'm not going to attempt it, maybe in the future.\n\nAt first, I played the game ignoring the entire plot and stuff, but after seeying some funny situations, I begun reading the plot and It's quite funny, and most likelly full of refferences too, beside I saw some beggings in the game... And a promisse that If the game gets popular the plot might be expanded, which either means a new game update, dlc, or a new cat quest game.\n\nOverall, the game is fun and worth playing.\n\nEdit:. Well, after giving a closer look into the game, and also finding out Mew Game capabilities, duck Drakoth, duck Kit Cat's chests, and duck Spirry, this game is fun, It's worth playing, and when done playing, replay with Mew Game plus, If you want more challenge on the new gameplay, use the Stronger monsters modifier alongside the one which allows you to bring your levels and equipments with you.\n\nOverly recommended!

Even if the enemies do not get stunned they have a fair amount of time before they telegraph an attack again. \n\nYou can see the outline of each attack before it happens requiring you to get out of the way and take your chance from the opening. With all the enemies present they have fair patterns with different solutions some easier than the others but there is nothing like leveling up to prepare for a challenging adversary if your not too skilled.\n\nThe spell system is perfect and satisfying with all of the spells having a purpose and suiting a play style using the RMB to select and execute the spell is really quick and i would love this to carry on to cat quest 2 and other games rather than moving a finger from your directional keys to hit a button which some people might have a problem with.\n\nThe combat is based on your skill level and really satisfying combined with the coincidence it is the right amount of quest to level up to a comfortable level to face anything that the game can throw at you from the recommended level from the quest on the main story so there is no pointless boring grinding but immersive adventuring of different places, dungeons and caves its really nice as they have made the experience system not too slow or fast but also once again perfect.\n\nThe storyline and art style is nice having combat on the overworld map instead of being taken to a individual fight screen for boring turn by turn fighting where you are not tested on skill in that case but here it speeds up encounters and put them always as a fun ordeal that you will face and there is no problems in running away from a fight you find difficult. \n\nSimplistic to a point where the player can adopt it really fast but fits a fine line of flow of not being too easy or being too hard. Both in the complexity of controls and difficulty of the game.\n\nI would play this game over and over again but i wish that there is a way to reset the game to level one as mew mode can be challenging as it replaces enemies with boss types or harder ones with the old normal game enemies making it for a tougher experience it would be nice to have a reset feature for introducing the game.\n\nWhat i do not agree is the weapons system as it is all based on luck of what you get instead of purchasing what you want in the game. The game's loot system upgrades older equipment by finding the same item in the chest you opened so its all based on luck and sometimes you might not find the thing you wanted due to your play style.\n\nI wish there was more variety in the combat but it doesnt mean its solid and that is something that hopefully will be present in cat quest 2 that i will certainly buy.\n\nWith many positives that the game developers have done right and only one nitpick negative that can be overlooked as it doesnt affect gameplay with the price of the game now there is no harm in trying it and certainly it can burn many hours with fun filled entertainment while playing cat quest.

There's a lot of fun, open-world exploration and just enough hidden stuff to find. The graphics and sound are top-notch -- actually, much, much better than I expected, given its modest price. I completed one whole do-everything-get-all-the-achievements playthrough in about 18.5 hours, which is pretty good value for about ten bucks. And, what can I say, it's an incredibly charming, lighthearted game. \n\nThere are extra modes for replaying with more difficulty, if that's your bag (it's not mine), and about half the Steam achievements lie in beating the game on subsequent playthroughs.\n\nThe story is pretty light, and it's certainly not an RPG in the sense that there's really no choosing and playing a role. All the quests are pretty much linear, and there's no branching decisions. However, that's not the kind of game that I think it purports to be. What it is instead is good, clean fun, light, long enough to provide great gaming value but which doesn't overstay its welcome. \n\nAlso, it never crashed once on my Mac (that's saying something) and the controller support is excellent -- I didn't touch either the keyboard or mouse at all for my entire time with the game.\n\nI have zero complaints about this game, really.", "timestamp_created": 1512436431, "timestamp_updated": 1512436431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38068299": {"recommendationid": "38068299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030994386", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "last_played": 1514051541}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game that is worth buying.\n\nPro:\nGreat art syle\nMain story is well written with an interesting twist\nFun to play\nSome of the NPC's have some great dialogue\nGreat combat mechanics and upgrades system\n\nCon:\nMain story is abit short and can be finished within 8 hours\nSome of the quests are fairly repetitive\n\nOther than that I hope to see the developers release some dlc.\n", "timestamp_created": 1512433581, "timestamp_updated": 1512433581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38067301": {"recommendationid": "38067301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041524766", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512669562}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished the game within 4 hours, but has alot more gamemodes to get through after finishing the main story!

Great graphics, nice storyline, and straightforward gameplay. It took me 5 hours to complete the main storyline which included completing several quest boards and dungeons to level up.\n\nAs other players have mentioned - the combat mechanics are limited. There are only a handful of enemies in the game and once you've faced them once you'll know how to deal with them the next time. The gear you collect is mostly useless (apart from fun to dress up your character with) and this includes the weapons. You're often given \"Unique\" items that you'll either never use or will use for 15 minutes until you find a better standard weapon.\n\nThe characters are fun and the mainstory arch has some nice twists and turns. Character development does allow players to play how the want to (more magic or more slashing). I found myself building a hybrid and spending all my gold on spells as the blacksmith didn't seem worth it.\n\nNow that I've completed the main quest I will be unlocking the Steam achievements. If this requires me to play through the game again I probably won't do that.\n\nCat Quest was a fun and charming way to spend my Sunday afternoon.

There are lots of cat puns. And if you don't like that then maybe you should consider a cat-scan ;). \n\nCat Quest has a cute story that, while short, will throw you a few twists and turns. I called a few things ahead of time, but it did a decent job of still surprising me in the end. Well worth the playthrough, and if you speed right through it you can finish in about 6 hours. I did most of the side quests (59/62) and leveled up to 74 on my first playthrough and there was still plenty to do after i finished the game. Certain dungeons are listed as level 200 and if you want the achievement for dungeons you'll need put on your big boy britches and either play new game plus or challenge the games mew game plus (challenge mode basically).\n\nLots of replay value too. At least for me. Its cute and fun.\n\nPros: \nReally fun combat\nMagic based on directional interface so calls for interesting gameplay\nQuests are funny\nStory is engaging\nSave feature is fast\nDodge is responsive (with practice)\nMagic can be OP (Get Purrserk early and use it on cooldown)\n\nCons:\nHealing is tied to a weak magic or saving the game (only minimally annoying)\nYou dodge in the direction you're moving. If you aren't careful you can dodge into death. AKA get good\nUpgrading magic can be expensive\nOnce you level up enough and get certain weapons the game feels too easy (there are harder challenges in mew game plus so this isn't a too big of a concern)\nside quests require a lot of moving across the map and until you get flight this is super annoying to navigate", "timestamp_created": 1512278528, "timestamp_updated": 1512533916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604269", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38023350": {"recommendationid": "38023350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157769561", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512281077}, "language": "english", "review": "all i gotta say is that it took me 6 hours to beat it and i got to level 90 then a new option opened up called mew game (stupid hard) and yeah its fun enough for the first 6 hours worth 10$ in my opinion so yeah hope this settles it for you also\nthe gameplay is all dodge walkback in attack dodge spam spell repeat and yeah super fun", "timestamp_created": 1512277699, "timestamp_updated": 1512277699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38023269": {"recommendationid": "38023269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179789241", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512276997}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e3b\u89d2\u662f\u732b+++\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b80\u5355\u6613\u4e0a\u624b+++\n\u753b\u98ce\u53ef\u7231+++\nBGM\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u50cf\u624b\u6e38---\n\u6d1e\u7a74\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u65e0\u804a\u5237\u5237\u5237---\n\u5267\u60c5\u592a\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u70b9\u70b9\u70b9---\n\u5185\u5bb9\u592a\u5c11\uff0c\u73a93\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u5c31\u5f88\u65e0\u804a\u4e86---\n\u5efa\u8bae10\u5143\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5165\u624b\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1512277419, "timestamp_updated": 1512277419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639594", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38023027": {"recommendationid": "38023027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004490009", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503539166}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, cute game with easy game mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1512276440, "timestamp_updated": 1512276440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38023021": {"recommendationid": "38023021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134717009", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512282028}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53ef\u60dc\u4e0d\u80fd\u53cc\u4eba", "timestamp_created": 1512276410, "timestamp_updated": 1512276410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38022522": {"recommendationid": "38022522", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975829233", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512556639}, "language": "german", "review": "[h1]Cat Quest[/h1]\n\nDas Spiel war zuerst als \"nicht interessiert\" markiert.

But I just can't. \n\nFirst of all, I like APRGs like Diablo, Torchlight, Path to Exile, Titan Quest, Grim Dawn, you name it. The thing is, Cat Quest has different controls. While in most ARPGs you move and perfroms base attack with left mouse button, in Cat Quest you still  perform base attack with left mouse button, while you move with WASD. That changes a lot, though skills are traditionally binded to 1-2-3-4 keys. Have you ever tried to move with WASD, use your skills with 1-2-3-4 and base attack with left mouse button at the same time? My advise: do not try to. \n\nThere is second option, though. Skills can be used with right mouse button. You click with right mouse button, choose a skill from dropdown menu and use it. I have to say, this is more convenient, than the first option, but it makes game less real-time and more turn-based. \n\nI have to say, I had similar problems in Hand of Fate, but in that case I just reassigned skill keys to my additional mouse buttons and played that way. Cat Quest, hovewer, does not have Controls menu at all. So you just can't reassign controls. \n\nI wish the developers do something about controls and in this case, I'm willing to try the game again, and perhaps, change my review.", "timestamp_created": 1511986630, "timestamp_updated": 1511986630, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.304364", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37925661": {"recommendationid": "37925661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129286418", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512197888}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e14\u0e35\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e09\u0e32\u0e01\u0e08\u0e1a\u0e0b\u0e36\u0e49\u0e07\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e43\u0e08 oops \u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e1b\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e14\u0e35\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32 \u0e0b\u0e37\u0e49\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e49\u0e19 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e08\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a", "timestamp_created": 1511955236, "timestamp_updated": 1511955236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37925295": {"recommendationid": "37925295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295032096", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512030609}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8d3c\u68a6\u8d3c\u597d\u73a9\uff01\u6253\u51fb\u611f\u8d3c\u68d2\uff01\n\u671f\u5f85\u540e\u7eed\u72d7\u56fd\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1511954013, "timestamp_updated": 1511954013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37924315": {"recommendationid": "37924315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006179748", "num_games_owned": 867, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512154068}, "language": "english", "review": "Felinecredible! :)", "timestamp_created": 1511950933, "timestamp_updated": 1511950933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497339", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37923551": {"recommendationid": "37923551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314315732", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 229, "last_played": 1514666443}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Aranyos, cic\u00e1s j\u00e1t\u00e9k, egyszer\u0171 RPG mechanik\u00e1val f\u0171szerezve.

I feel that the cheeky cat puns over and over, and the censorsed violence is revoked by the fact that at one point you literally complete a pentagram demonic summoning seance.

abschalten sucht und sich \u00fcber - teilweise \"flache\"- Katzen-Wortspiele am\u00fcsieren kann.\n\nDas Spiel wirkt bunt und l\u00e4dt zum entdecken ein. Aber vorsicht! \u00dcberall lauern Gefahren und Herausforderungen f\u00fcr unseren Abenteurer. W\u00e4hrend man sich die Gegner vornimmt und die Dungeons leert levelt man auf und f\u00fcllt seine Tasche mit R\u00fcstungen und Waffen. F\u00fcr jeden Spieltypen, egal ob Magier oder Tank, ist das passende Set dabei.\n\nAber neben den fiesen Gestalten gibt es auch allerhand Katzen in Felingard die Hilfe ben\u00f6tigen. An den Questboards, die es in jeder Ansiedlung gibt, finden sich aufeinander aufbauende Auftr\u00e4ge, die manchmal tragische, lustige und verwirrende Quests enthalten. Manche sind einfach auch so absurd bzw so mit Wortspielen randvoll zugepackt, dass man einfach lachen muss.\n\nDie Dialoge sind leichtherzig und einladend gestaltet. Mit wenig Textzeilen wird das n\u00f6tige erz\u00e4hlt, aber gleichzeitig auch viel Atmosph\u00e4re geschaffen.\n\nGenerell ist das sch\u00f6ne an Cat Quest auch, dass es relativ simpel f\u00fcr ein RPG ist - kein F\u00e4higkeitensystem, kein \u00fcberladenes Tr\u00e4nke- und R\u00fcstungswirrwarr. \"Nur\" ein paar Zauberspr\u00fcche die man verbessern kann und eine \u00fcberschaubare Anzahl von Waffen und R\u00fcstungsteilen. \nHier ist man wirklich mehr mit entdecken und questen besch\u00e4ftigt, anstatt stundenlang die beste Kombi aus tausenden zu finden. \n\nAbschlie\u00dfend bleibt noch zu sagen wer einigerma\u00dfen gut englisch verstehen/lesen kann, dem empfehle ich das Spiel auf englisch zu spielen damit man keine Wortspiele verpasst! :D\n\nKlare Kaufempfehlung!", "timestamp_created": 1511477762, "timestamp_updated": 1511477762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37199845": {"recommendationid": "37199845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404197090", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512158219}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "gr\u00e1fico lindo demais, bem detalhado. foi uma experi\u00eancia bem divertida.", "timestamp_created": 1511469912, "timestamp_updated": 1511469912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37184641": {"recommendationid": "37184641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320467780", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507454614}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f) \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0451\u043b \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439)", "timestamp_created": 1511466348, "timestamp_updated": 1511466348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553409", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37184581": {"recommendationid": "37184581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064812466", "num_games_owned": 533, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511468837}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo maravilhoso, vale cada centavo.

I ended up completing the whole game, including all of the side quests and getting all of the equipment (though a certain bug required extra time to get a specific item). But even though I did all of that, I would say that the game probably should not be \"Overwhelmingly Positive,\" which owes to Steam's inability to review in ways other than simply \"Good or Bad.\" I do not think that the graphics or game's sense of humor should save itself from its bigger flaws.\n\nThe graphics for the game are pretty nice, though I'd say a majority of the world looks pretty similar in style until later on, with a few outskirts being drastically different than the rest, including some funny easter egg areas. The music and sound never gave me any issues (except for the cat \"meow\"-ing when hit in combat sometimes, which bothered me for some reason).\n\nBut I would say that the story and gameplay are the imbalanced parts of the game. The story, as a whole, is a little funny at times, but basically boils down to \"Here's some main villain out of nowhere; follow him.\" And more than half of the side quests redirect to this main villain again, though it's usually towards the end of quest chains going \"He is the reason this happened!\" There are some places where the main storyline gets a little weird, and makes you think of where it will go... But by the end of the game, it sort of falls away and ends really quickly, like you just ran off of a cliff. Not much is resolved, and the interesting parts of the storyline remain as hidden references. My reaction to the end was \"Huh? That's it?\"\n\nI would say that the side quests had more fun with their mini-stories than the main storyline itself did. There's a lot of humor in them, of course, with many puns and jokes. Some people might find it off-putting, but I enjoyed that aspect for the most part.\n\nFor the gameplay, however, it's a simple system. You gain experience and gold. You level up. You swing weapons, dodge, blast magic, and collect equipment. You run around for quests. (Actually, running back and forth across the map is probably most of your gameplay time until you unlock a new movement ability.) This is pretty much \"Any RPG Experience Ever (TM)\" in the simplest terms. The gameplay is action-oriented and you get to mostly explore as you want, so you're not forced following certain quests the whole time. You can find higher-leveled side quests and try them earlier on, for instance, like I did, instead of following early quests or the main storyline.\n\nBut the mechanics used for exploration and combat are the downside. If you play the game consistently without many breaks, you should probably find that the game is overly easy, becomes repetitive, and lacks repeatability. If you're really bad at dodging the enemies, then you might find it difficult for some reason. There are maybe between 20 to 30 types of enemies in the game, but there's only about 6 ways the enemies can attack you. Each enemy only follows similar attack sets for the most part, with slightly altered ranges and directions. Thus, the combat boils down to \"Dodge this way, attack, wait, dodge that way, attack, wait\" ad infinitum.\n\nMost of the equipment in the game is unnecessary, and you will probably ignore a lot of what you come across. Even the spells you acquire (while some are useful in certain corridors) for the most part are not needed. In fact, you can probably complete the game with just the Fire spell you unlock near the very beginning. While the quest stories are a little fun, all of them pretty much resolve with clearing out a dungeon or destroying a group of enemies on the overworld, hence repetitive combat is the main key point.\n\nAbout the only way for the game to change \"difficulty\" is to buff enemies, debuff equipment, or for you to fight high-level things as a weakling. All of these methods are essentially artificial difficulty and do not require any extra strategy or change in gameplay, for the most part, and only would make the game more grind-like. Ironically, the developers are releasing \"Mew Game\" as a New Game Plus format that has modifiers to do the above, such as prevent usage of armor or weapons, or limit yourself to Level 1 for the whole game.

Did not expect the game to be as fun as it actually is, I foresaw a shallow indie RPG and got something really fun with a lot of charm! Combat is engaging, progression is quite complex and the story/atomosphere/art style are all amazing.\n\nSome design input: \n\nAt the very beginning when I started playing and was about 1 hour into the game, I was utterly immersed and then... I started doing all the side quests. What I found vaguely irritating (less so at the later stages of the game due to certain gameplay mechanics) was that each hub had a questline with progressively higher level requirements. This meant that you could not complete storyline A and then move onto the next hub with a different questline. \n\nFrom my point of view, this has two major disadvantages: first of all, I'd much rather experience one story as a whole and complete it without initiating another narratives at the same time. It just feels disruptive when you're doing multiple questlines concurrently and sometimes one might actually forget what the quest he/she was on is about. Secondly, you have to constantly move between different hubs which can get quite tedious and boring and also it juts artificially lengthens the game which is not a good thing in my opinion.\n\nI just think that the player experience would be much better if the hubs were designed in a somewhat different manner:\n\ninstead of having Hub A with quests for levels 1, 4, 9 > Hub B with 2, 5, 10 > Hub C with 3, 6, 13 the dispersion should look something more like the following: Hub A with 1, 2, 3 > Hub B with 4, 6, 7 > Hub C with 5, 8, 9.\n\nAnomalies in level requirement curve should be much rarer.\n\u200b\nOf course this is purely subjective and someone might not prefer the latter, just my two cents. \n\nThe game is deceptively simple and has a lot of depth behind it which I really love. With that being said, while I really appreciate any types of 'secrets' if you will in all kinds of games (huge fan of zelda and the souls series) and a design philosophy which doesn't give everything to the player on a silver platter, some of the 'secrets' that were put in Cat Quest might be game breaking to a certain degree. \n\nTo give you some examples, dungeons such as the founder cave or the hidden level 99 cave can be exploited to easily farm gold and experience with A MUCH HIGHER efficiency than any other method in the game. When you introduce such areas, monsters there should probably not be able to respawn after being killed. \n\nThat way discovering these areas will still feel rewarding but consequently players won't be able to exploit them and at the same time will avoid ruining the game for themselves (other content becomes trivial after completing the said dungeons multiple times and farming the same spot repeatedly is really not fun).\n\nThe spell/ability system is somewhat luckluster imo or rather the foundation for it is good but the spells themselves need some tweaking/balancing. The very first one you get (the AoE circle) along with +% DMG that you get later on are clearly the best choices and shun other potential fun builds. \n\nAlso, Willpower and Faith both need a major nerf since they render all the other much cooler looking equipment useless.  ^^ Lets us assume that you can only get Faith and Willpower at the very end of the game without making other content trivial. These items still outshine all the others though. Even then, that should not be the case in my opinion. I think it's much more interesting if you have a lot of varied gear and every single set is somewhat better in a different area. \n\nThe game is quite short which is fine given its pricing but more importantly since I think it could get monotonous if it were a lengthy title. As I have already said, the combat is engaging and fun BUT you're basically doing the same thing over and over again. What this game could use is some additional minor twists in gameplay from time to time, perhaps logical puzzles of some sort that require you to interact with environment in a certain pattern? \n\nCat Quest has a lot of potential I think and while it is already an amazing game, in my humble opinion it could benefit a lot from replayable 'end game' content. I wonder if the developers thought about future systems to implement? How about something along the lines of greater rifts as seen in Diablo. \n\nI'd suggest adding procedurally generated dungeons with randomized monsters that get progressively harder and scale endlessly. You could call them 'dragonblood challenges', an ancient arena of sorts that the past dragonblood used to test their might. :) \n\nYou could even add an in-game leaderboard of some kind that would allow the players to compare their dragonblood challenge scores though I suppose that might be slightly trickier to implement.", "timestamp_created": 1509888336, "timestamp_updated": 1510511725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.899373", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36271713": {"recommendationid": "36271713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120542743", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511910138}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't see why this has a 95%+ rating.

It's easy to like it. Controls are good, graphics are easy to look and well done, there are lots of quests and items to get. Though no usable items what so ever. The only usable you have are your spells.\n\nBasically you level up, gain more hp, attack and spell power from levels and items. Also items level up when you find a same item you already had.\n\nWhat ever Cat Quest has is fun and nice but it doesn't have too many different enemies and the sound track is pretty short.\n\nThe same formula repeats over and over where you get a quest, walk where you're supposed to and then back. Sometimes you clear an underground cave and open 1+ chests. This might or might not bother you. To me it's kind of a problem but not big enough of a problem that I'd stop playing. \n\nCat Quest plusses:\n\n+ very charming world and characters\n+ fun music and graphics\n+ simple and fun to play\n+ lots of quests and items\n\nCat Quest minuses:\n\n- it does get repeating pretty fast, it repeats the same formula for all the quests with very little variation\n- not too many different enemies, gets repeating\n\nFinal words:\n\nCat Quest isn't my favourite game at all but it might be one of my favourites. Right now I'm okay how it is but I can't recommend it to everyone.

Auch der orchestralisch angehauchte Soundtrack passt wie der Hintern auf einen Eimer \u2013 einfach klasse! \nDie Quests gehen leicht von der Hand, wiederholen sich im Laufe der Zeit doch leider immer wieder in ihrer Art: suche [i]diesen[/i] Gegenstand, t\u00f6te [i]diese(s)[/i] Monster \u2013 was auf Dauer doch recht monoton wirkt. W\u00e4hrend dem Verfolgen der Hauptstory und dem Erledigen der Nebenmissionen viel dieses jedoch nicht allzu stark auf. Erst nach circa 7,5 Spielstunden und dem Abschlie\u00dfen der Hauptstory war zum Erreichen s\u00e4mtlicher Erfolge das [i]Grinden[/i] angesagt, um das Level 99 (nach oben gibt\u2019s keine Grenze!) zu erreichen und noch fehlende Items f\u00fcr das Arsenal finden zu k\u00f6nnen.

Er ist doch recht hilfreich!\n \nAlternativ kann ich ab Level 99 das Bezwingen der Monster in der [i]Einsamen H\u00f6hle[/i],\nwelche mittig in der Karte liegt, nahe legen. Dort bekommt man f\u00fcr einen ca. 20-sek\u00fcndigen Lauf genau 2.018 Gold! Das sind rund 60.000 Gold in 10 Minuten bzw. 180.000 Gold in einer halben Stunde! Wem dann, so wie mir, nur noch ein Gegenstand im Inventar f\u00fcr den Ausr\u00fcstungs-Erfolg fehlt, der speichert vorher und geht anschlie\u00dfend zu Kit Katz und kauft dort die goldenen Truhen zu je 5.000 Goldst\u00fccke. Ist der gew\u00fcnschte Gegenstand nicht dabei, l\u00e4sst man sich in der N\u00e4he von Monstern umhauen und man steigt wieder mit dem zuvor gespeichertem Goldbetrag ins Spiel ein und versucht sein Gl\u00fcck auf's Neue! :)\n[/code]\n\n[h1][i]Vielen Dank f\u00fcr\u2019s Durchlesen und viel Spa\u00df beim Zocken![/i]\n[b]Game On!

Quite a balm in a game industry overrun with grimdark gorefests. If the Gentlebros hope to be the next SpryFox, I wish them godspeed in that noble endeavor. \n\nThe cat theme is taken just far enough. The sound design is cute, and the music is just right, although not likely to be added to an audiophile playlist. Gameplay is smooth, and the art is fun to look at without looking cheap. It's an easy game, and death has no consequences besides sending you back to your last catnap location. Those seeking a challenge can choose to tackle higher level dangers or make use of nerfing equipment like the Crappy Set. No grinding is actually required except to get the Level 99 achievement, and even that took me only 15 minutes in the purpose-built leveling field. As for accessibility, the game lacks custom key bindings, but scores good marks on audio being unnecessary and color blind friendliness. \n\n10/10 Would Catventure again.", "timestamp_created": 1506135152, "timestamp_updated": 1506135152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35131978": {"recommendationid": "35131978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101040368", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505921579}, "language": "english", "review": "It has cats, puns, and is an RPG.

Not having to walk into walls constant would have probably shaved an hour off my playtime for the main quest, and upwards of two hours for the total playtime.\n\nStill, it was a fun game, although I do recommend waiting until it's on sale.

There are only the overworld, that looks like you are constantly traversing a big map, and simple dungeonmaps you go in fight everything and the leave again. \n\nSome of the fun lies therein how the game plays with this aspect and uses it in humorous ways to lead the player around and from battle to battle, putting down lines and x and other symbols on it like it was drawn unto the world.\n\nThe Gameplay is VERY simple, quests are super linear and the fun in following them comes mainly from how the game presents the little scenarios and stories in. \n\nThe combat is quick and easy to understand, so easy in fact i wont go into details because after fighting just one enemy most people will have understood everything there is. HOWEVER that doesn't means the game can be beat by button mashing, not at all. Players who just mindlessly button mash and not pay attention to the warnings for incoming attacks will find themselves frequently and repeatedly dying.\n\nThe Equipment system is actually a bit broken. You find equipment in form of hats/helmets, armor and weapons and if you have a specific item again said item will be upgraded. There are chests to find in the world but you can only find and loot them once. After that you need to rely on the smith. In the smithy the player can choose to purchase a small chest for 50 Gold or a big chest for 5000 gold. The Items out of that are randomly chosen and then upgrade their respective gear in your inventory. \nThis sadly leads to some of the items being flat out useless although they might look better since you have a chance that they never are going to be better then the ones you got a the beginning and that you leveled up big time until then.\nNever has a game more needed a fashion slot more so that the players can equip the look they want while getting the stats from something better.\n\nThe magic system is okay, nothing special but also usefull enougzh so that you constantly use it.\n\nNow, to be truthfull, the game is actually really repetetive when it comes to its gameplay.\nYou pick up a quest, you follow the marker, kill a bunch of enemys and then follwo the next marker.

Debemos de rescatar a nuestra hermana de las garras de Drakoth, como el \u00fanico Sangredragon que queda con vida, realizando misiones secundarias, explorando mazmorras y consiguiendo mejores equipo para volvernos m\u00e1s fuerte.\n\nCuenta con un sistema de combate bastante simple, tenemos los ataques cuerpo a cuerpo de 3 golpes asignados a un bot\u00f3n y podemos asignar hasta 4 botones para utilizar magia que cuenta con una variedad de hasta 7 tipos de magias diferentes. Podemos desbloquear 2 habilidades para explorar Felinia, la habilidad de caminar sobre el agua y la habilidad para volar, \u00e9sta \u00faltima aumenta bastante nuestra velocidad de movimiento lo cual la hace perfecta para explorar el mundo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidamente y completar lo que nos haga falta.\n\nTenemos bastantes misiones secundarias disponibles en los tablones de las ciudades que ser\u00e1 nuestra fuente principal de Oro y Experiencia a lo largo de nuestra aventura por Felinia.\n\nAl subir de nivel, obtenemos una mejora de nuestras estad\u00edsticas de vida, da\u00f1o cuerpo a cuerpo y da\u00f1o con magia, obteniendo mayor mejora de vida que las otras estad\u00edsticas. As\u00ed mismo, existe una estad\u00edstica denominada armadura, \u00e9sta solo se consigue aumentar con equipo. La Armadura se regenera autom\u00e1ticamente despu\u00e9s de un tiempo a diferencia de la vida que debemos ir a tomar una siesta para recuperarla.\n\nTambi\u00e9n contamos con una gran cantidad de equipo que podremos obtener de misiones principales y secundarias, pero la mayor\u00eda lo obtendremos de los cofres que se encuentran en las mazmorras. Hay 2 tipos de cofres, los normales y los dorados s\u00f3lo que para abrir \u00e9stos \u00faltimos necesitaremos encontrar una llave.\n\nNormalmente los cofres nos dar\u00e1n objetos aleatorios salvo algunos pocos cofres que tienen objetos fijos (es decir, siempre nos dar\u00e1 ese objeto en la partida). Por la naturaleza de los cofres, nos pueden tocar equipo repetido pero no te preocupes porque al obtener un equipo que ya hab\u00edamos obtenido antes, dicho equipo subir\u00e1 de nivel hasta un nivel m\u00e1ximo de 99 mejorando las estad\u00edsticas del objeto.\n\nTiene un estilo visual adorable y una banda sonora bastante buena que se nota una clara inspiraci\u00f3n en cl\u00e1sicos del g\u00e9nero. El juego est\u00e1 repleto de bromas de gatos y referencias a otros juegos (Tomb Raider, Slashy Hero) e incluso series de la televisi\u00f3n (Juego de Tronos) que te sacar\u00e1n una sonrisa mientras juegas.\n\n[h1]Opini\u00f3n Final[/h1]\nCat Quest es un juego ARPG excelente que nos trajo The Gentlebros, muchas misiones, equipo que coleccionar, bromas de gatos y una banda sonora agradable que en conjunto crean la receta perfecta de lo que es un juego divertido y ameno. Lo recomiendo a cualquier persona ya que es uno de los mejores indies que ha salido en este 2017.\n\n[h1]Aspectos Positivos y Negativos[/h1]\n+ Sistema de combate simple pero m\u00e1s que suficiente.\n+ Bromas y referencias que te sacaran una sonrisa.\n+ Montones de misiones que cumplir y equipo que coleccionar.\n+ M\u00e1s de 50 mazmorras que completar.\n+ Estupendo arte visual y banda sonora.\n+ Variedad de enemigos (incluso hay un enemigo secreto poderoso en los mares).\n- Obtener todo el equipo se basa en la suerte que tengas al abrir cofres.\n- No hay mucha variedad de misiones ya que s\u00f3lo son de matar enemigos o completar mazmorras\n\n[code]Si te agrad\u00f3/disgust\u00f3 mi an\u00e1lisis apreciar\u00eda bastante que lo valores con los botones de abajo.[/code]", "timestamp_created": 1504983432, "timestamp_updated": 1511464043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34836977": {"recommendationid": "34836977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101307096", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508484317}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, adorable and not actually as easy as I had assumed it would be.

Don't be put off by the generic name and cute asthetic, at first I thought this was going to be some cheap cash grabber but it actually has some polish and feels very well made. Controls feel tight, combat, though it is simplistic, it still feels satisfying. Gear leveling system is cool, though I could do without the box randomization system. And Though the cat puns can be reaching at times, the writing is actually well done and interesting, even the sidequests are interesting and kept me engaged as to what is happening.

It would be nice if there was some kind of repeatable quest at the end to gain some gold and exp, instead of going through the same dungeons over and over.", "timestamp_created": 1504018098, "timestamp_updated": 1504018175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545940", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34577907": {"recommendationid": "34577907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074421935", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504444511}, "language": "english", "review": "fking finel boss pain in the ass", "timestamp_created": 1504015486, "timestamp_updated": 1504015486, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.254811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34577201": {"recommendationid": "34577201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038410624", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503972461}, "language": "english", "review": "Quick game but packed full of fun.

If there is anything that the internet doesn\u2019t get bored of it\u2019s cats. I can\u2019t exactly explain it, but an obsession that goes back to Egyptian times can\u2019t necessarily be overrated. Cats invading video games isn\u2019t exactly new either, with games such as Cat Goes Fishing, Catlateral Damage, Fort Meow and many more. Maybe I have been fortunate, but I have enjoyed them all and never been left with a fishy taste in my mouth. When I heard about Cat Quest, an open world RPG, I knew I had to check it out.\n\nNeedless to say guys, its pretty pawsome.(I swear that\u2019s the last one.)\n\nRight off the bat, I do recommend Cat Quest. Not just because its adorable and over the top, akin to something like Slime Rancher. I recommend it because I genuinely had a blast and couldn\u2019t stop playing the game until it was all over. If Cat Quest accomplishes anything, it is that it is super simple and fun to play. This game is going to attract a wide age group and its got something for all of them.\n\nAs soon as you start the game and get past some story tidbits, the first thing I noticed was this huge vivid over-world map. Felingard is the name of this huge continent and you will explore all of it. This map isn\u2019t just a means of getting from place to place. This map is the game. Monsters, towns, and events play out on this screen or one of the fifty two dungeons. You begin your epic quest to defeat a mysterious figure named Drakosh and his dragons.\n\nThe combat itself is all real time from an isometric view. The beautiful part is that the combat is super simple but manages to stay complex enough to keep you on your toes. You can slash with your equipped weapon, dodge roll, or cast one of the many spells in the game. This is one game I highly recommend you play with a controller. The enemies telegraph their attacks with either a red circle or symbol to represent a spell they are about to cast. Some enemies are faster than others and using different spells/tactics to overcome them is required.\n\nThe problem I found with Cat Quest\u2019s combat is that it tends to have extremes. The combat is either far too easy or you\u2019re going to die very fast. It never quite hits that sweet spot in the middle. Cat Quest does however have a good pace as the dungeons themselves range from level 1 to 99. If you find it to be too easy then just hop into a dungeon five or six levels higher than you and feel the pain. The dungeons themselves are rather simplistic in design and more about combat and loot.\n\nLoot in this game I felt a bit divided on. Cat Quest has a stat system with the usual suspects, e.g. health, magic, damage, armor. You can mix and match armor pieces to create your own play style. If you don\u2019t like physical attacks, then wear magic armor. Some armors even go to extremes giving huge benefits to one stat and taking away from others. Also some armors just suck in general, guess they are there to keep the game challenging maybe? The problem lies in Golden Chests.\n\nSometime in the middle of the game you will get access to these beauties. Golden chests contain rare loot. These rare items can break the game quite easily. I stumbled upon an item called Courage that gave me vast amounts of health. This item made bosses seem like they were tickling me and I just stood there whacking away at them. Now I could\u2019ve not used that item, true, but I didn\u2019t know any better. Plus if it\u2019s in the game, why not use it? Cat Quest respects your time as a player and for that I appreciate it. However, the game\u2019s combat just loses some of its enjoyment once you gain access to these golden chests. It\u2019s like the game gave up and handed me the win.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say I didn\u2019t love the combat in Cat Quest, I just wanted the last boss to actually be a challenge instead of dead in five seconds. I think the combat system had great potential to keep things fresh and fun all the way until the end. Cat Quest didn\u2019t need to hand me the keys to the kingdom, proverbially.\nSide quests and story galore.\n\nOne of the main highlights of Cat Quest is by far is its dialogue/story. Side quests are filled to the brim with cat puns, and hilarity. There are times where I found myself genuinely laughing and that isn\u2019t an easy task for a game when it comes to me. On top of that, there is actually a pretty intense lore here that I found myself being wrapped up in as the game progressed. Drakoth\u2019s story and the birth of the Dragonbloods is very interesting and far from what I expected.\n\nThe story isn\u2019t one dimensional, despite appearing that way. The reason behind dragons tearing up the place is rather sad. When I finally reached the end of my \u201cCat Quest\u201d I was left with far more questions than answers. Which also left me with a bit of a gripe. The end feels like it\u2019s baiting for a sequel or DLC. While I don\u2019t want to give any spoilers, Cat Quest comes to a climax with a threat looming, but the game just ends abruptly. It felt odd. Queen\u2019s Bay an area that has one quest and no follow ups, more or less confirms this suspicion. Then again, more Cat Quest is hardly a bad thing.\n\nIn all, the side-quests were fun and enjoyable. They brought a life and personality to the world that left me wanting more. I can\u2019t wait to see the Mice Pirates and the Lupus Empire. There was one side quest though that annoyed me to no end. One which had you traveling back and forth from opposite ends of the continent. Silly Chef cats.\n\nAnother obvious statement is that Cat Quest is very family friendly and pleasing to the eyes. This game is candy wrapped up in kittens. One fear I had was that the huge over world map would be one tone but Cat Quest does manage to keep things varied. You will venture on islands, snow caps, plagued lands and more. The art is very well done and mixes seamlessly with the combat and magic effects. \n\nThe monsters, and sprites themselves are cute and I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle when I put a big metal helmet on my cat. Item design is one area that I was also impressed with. It added plenty of personality on its own. An area that didn\u2019t hit the mark for me was the menus. They were very bare-bones. Cat Quest is also available on mobile devices, and it shows in the menus especially.\n\nThe music and sound effects are as equally pleasing to the ears as the graphics are to the eyes. Every time I heard a meow when I got hit, it made me smile. There were times people nearby thought an actual cat was meowing, if that tells you anything. The music is as fun and adventurous as is required for this type of game. You can expect an orchestral soundtrack and if you keep moving in the game, no one track over stays its welcome.\n\nI guess you could say I had a purrfect time.\n\nSorry I lied, I couldn\u2019t help meowself.\n\nI finished the game out at about nine hours and that was getting all the current Steam Achievements. Including all the outfits, and clearing all the dungeons. You\u2019re looking at anywhere between six to ten hours total playtime. The game doesn\u2019t have much in the way of replay. There is no new game+ and it\u2019s basically a get done and go type of deal. Keep an eye out though for future DLC or an update. Aside from the achievements across all platforms, there are also Steam Cards. Obviously that\u2019s computer only.\n\nTo wrap up, I found Cat Quest to be a highly enjoyable popcorn style game. You eat it, you love it, it\u2019s bad for you chances are, but hey life is short and there is cats. It\u2019s not going to rock the boat for innovation or expand your mind on new levels of philosophy. What it is going to do is give plenty of entertainment that you or your kid can enjoy together. I personally think it\u2019s a good homage to the ARPG genre and worthy of your attention. Did I mention the cats?\n\nMeow!", "timestamp_created": 1503987933, "timestamp_updated": 1503987933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34568393": {"recommendationid": "34568393", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990974837", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512170810}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazingly fun and full of cat puns and cute graphics!", "timestamp_created": 1503980629, "timestamp_updated": 1503980629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523103", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34567145": {"recommendationid": "34567145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096857335", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503974791}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game!", "timestamp_created": 1503974851, "timestamp_updated": 1503974851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454054", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34566770": {"recommendationid": "34566770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083696162", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503879892}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun at first, probably the first half, it doesn't really fall off much, it's an overall neat game, However, the dialog and the overload of puns all over the place and the childish dialog.. can get quite cringy.\n\nBuy at your own risk!\nwas plenty of fun to play, sadly was pretty short </3", "timestamp_created": 1503973146, "timestamp_updated": 1503973146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609909", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34566041": {"recommendationid": "34566041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097617512", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513251220}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4f5c\u8005\u4e0d\u4f46\u662f\u5438\u55b5\u515a\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u662f\u53cd\u6c6a\u515a", "timestamp_created": 1503969708, "timestamp_updated": 1503969708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34564407": {"recommendationid": "34564407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338274710", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 59, "last_played": 1514128853}, "language": "english", "review": "Cat Quest is a fun and unique RP and fun For ALL, Purfect (one r) to rule your cat game collection\nPros.

I haven't had an urge to go back and play a game as much as I did for this in years. It's really easy to level up and the side quests provide enough XP to level up pretty fast. The only criticism of this game I can think of is the playabilty once you reach level 99. Once the side quests (which there aren't THAT many) and main quest are over the game lacks anything else. Without going into too much detail and providing spoilers there is a section which hints at an expansion of the game coming out providing the game becomes popular so I hope this happens. \n\nOne more thing on this game - I know we aren't on the App Store for iOS but I must say for people considering buying it for their phone or iPad on the go, don't.

I decided to give it a try as a couch-relaxing game, and I loved it.\n\nWhile the cat/purr/mew/paw jokes are repeated over and over again (maybe a bit too much, but as some say \"so bad it's actually good\") they actually help keeping the tone and atmosphere where it should be, never taking itself too seriously. It is a game, after all, and we already have plenty of \"serious\" games.\n\nThe gameplay felt fantastic and quite responsive, even though I played it from the couch with a steam controller while streaming the game off another PC. You can also tell the game is also pretty well crafted and balanced, with a touch of \"dark souls\" difficulty: the quest level is a mere indication, not a necessity, and while significantly harder nothing stops you from doing quests or engaging monsters 50-150 levels higher than you. For example I did one of the toughest side quests (level 99) around level 55-60. It proved VERY challenging, but significantly fun and engaging (and also rewarding, mind you).\n\nWhile not an extremely long game, if you're just looking for something to play over a weekend, from the comfort of a couch, this game is terrific. The devs also hinted to possible future expansions, and given the fun I had with this game, I'll definitely look forward to it.\n\nTL;DR: highly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1503876921, "timestamp_updated": 1503876921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34540808": {"recommendationid": "34540808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180206419", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503261792}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game, decent story line, easy mechanics\nin just a few hours i was able to beat the entire game, wish there was more", "timestamp_created": 1503874189, "timestamp_updated": 1503874189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34540648": {"recommendationid": "34540648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048055565", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504925271}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple solid hack-and-slash worth loosing a few hours in.\n\n[list]\n    [*] Good writing, visuals, and audio that all build an adorable and funny world.\n    [*] Fairly simple fighting mechanics and leveling that manage to feel satisfying.\n    [*] Not too challenging (so far).

I will split my review in two parts a more simple pros and cons part and another were I talk about each pro and con in depth.\n-Pros-\n-Nice Colorful Graphic Style\n-Fluent Animations\n-Somewhat Large Open World To Discover\n-Lots of Items To collect\n-Plenty Of Dungeons To Delve\n-Many Side Quests\n-Unique Cast of Monsters\n-Well Thought Out Villian\n-Weapon/Spell Progression\n-Cat Puns\n-Cons-\n-World Seems Very Small End Game\n-Very Little Post Final Boss Content\n-Most items are useless\n-Very Strait Forward Story\n-Ending?\nNow I will explain every pro and con in a bit more depth\n-Pros-\n-The Graphics in this game are very colorful and meld very well with the world. They seem to make every part of the world blend together in a painting, but the painting is a open world RPG.\n-The Animations in this game are so nice. They are so fluent I am very happy that I didnt run into a single animation glich while playing through this game.\n-The World the out feeling very large and as long as you are still discovering new areas to explore. Although that all changes when you unlock flight.\n-Their all tons of items to collect. Some of which take special caves to find and collect, this includes facing a level 200 monster and wading through a pool of invisble traps). Also I thoughly enjoyed the chest opening consept of this game it not only helped level up and discover new gear, it also gave the game a little bit more depth to its currency system.\n-Their are tons of dungeons in this game to delve into and defeat the lurking monsters. None of them feel even mildly close to the same either.\n-Their are plenty of unique and fun side quests in this game to leveling you up, earn you some extra gear, or just to explore the open world. All the quests seemed very well thought out and well made. They did a very good job of avoiding extreme amounts of fetch quests and when fetch quests occures they even acknowledge it.\n-The monsters in this game all serve a meaning and balence the game very well.\n-The villian in this game changed alot during the course of the game. He starts out as the most steriotypical villian I have ever seen and by the end I was beyond sad for him. During the final battle while I was at the edge of victory I lost on to him just to see if their would be another ending if I lost. I didnt feel very good about winning in the end either. In all this villian when from bland to making me look bland.\n-The proggresion in this game may be strait forward but it works very well. It makes you stronger through the entire game and give you options to your playstyle.\n-Their are more cat puns then you will ever need\n-Cons-\n-At the end of the game the world goes from a massive open area to a small area due to the flying abilty it lets you travel the world at insane speed compared to before. It may seem really cool at first but I think it takes alot away from the games feeling.\n-After you win the final battle their isnt to much to do. You can clean up any side quests you have left and go slay the hidden ocean boss but after that its really just grinding levels and chests to get stronger with no meaning.\n-Most items in this game are useless after you start getting gold chests. It just means the base items seem to all become crappy items and the gold chest gear is all you will use.\n-If you are looking for a game with a crazy good story this is not for you. I have to say the backstory is very good but the playable in game story in very bland.\n-The reason the ending is a con is because I dont think its complete but it may get DLC which would make this already amazing game 10x better.\n", "timestamp_created": 1503790287, "timestamp_updated": 1503790287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34514539": {"recommendationid": "34514539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142116227", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511707113}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein echt s\u00fc\u00dfes und gut spielbares RPG mit vielen kleinen WItzen.

Nada absurdo mas basicamente temos que lidar com os drag\u00f5es que foram liberados e com outros inimigos ao longo da jornada. A busca aqui desde o come\u00e7o \u00e9 encontrar sua irm\u00e3 e tamb\u00e9m trazer paz para o lugar. N\u00e3o posso entrar em mais detalhes pois j\u00e1 que o mesmo se baseia nisso e tem um pequeno plottwist, vale a pena conferir voc\u00ea mesmo. O enredo \u00e9 simples mas para este tipo de jogo funciona bem. \n\nMiss\u00f5es Principais e Miss\u00f5es secund\u00e1rias: As miss\u00f5es principais s\u00e3o \u00f3timas e bem desenvolvidas. Sim, s\u00e3o simples. Por\u00e9m, para um jogo casual s\u00e3o divertidas e com di\u00e1logos divertidos. O mesmo pode se dizer sobre as miss\u00f5es secund\u00e1rias que s\u00e3o v\u00e1rias. Elas n\u00e3o tem uma complexidade. Por\u00e9m, aumenta o tempo de jogatina e tamb\u00e9m consegue manter o jogador preso. O motivo? por mais que seja tudo simples demais em quest\u00e3o de enredo tanto na principal quanto nas secund\u00e1rias o jogo entrega bastante humor tamb\u00e9m. As miss\u00f5es s\u00e3o simples, mas funcionam bem e algumas certas miss\u00f5es voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 sim, passar trabalho.\n\nJogabilidade: Excelente e com suporte a controle e de f\u00e1cil adapta\u00e7\u00e3o tanto no teclado quanto no controle. Basicamente usamos o mouse para atacar e alguns bot\u00f5es do teclado para derrotar os inimigos com poderes. Tamb\u00e9m entrando nesta quest\u00e3o: Os poderes s\u00e3o legais e cada um tem efeito positivo e negativo nos inimigos. Voc\u00ea pode obter todos durante a campanha principal e miss\u00f5es secund\u00e1rias. S\u00e3o bem feitos e com \u00f3timos visuais. Basicamente tudo que voc\u00ea vai encontrar no mapa (bem bonito e variado) s\u00e3o diversas miss\u00f5es e sides quests que v\u00e3o te dar experi\u00eancia e dinheiro, \u00e9 legal fazer todas j\u00e1 que o jogo \u00e9 f\u00e1cil de se obter todas as conquistas e aumenta a vida \u00fatil do jogo. \n\nObs: sempre vasculhar todas as \u00e1reas das dungeons (cavernas) pois o jogo tem muitos itens que v\u00e3o desde os ba\u00fas dourados (itens poderosos) at\u00e9 os ba\u00fas comuns. Se n\u00e3o achar algum item, v\u00e1 at\u00e9 os vendedores espalhados pelo mapa, eles v\u00e3o te ajudar (Desde que tenha dinheiro).\n\n\nArmaduras, itens: Temos v\u00e1rios itens para coletar durante a jogatina que v\u00e3o desde armaduras, espadas, machados, helmets e muito mais. S\u00e3o todos bastante variados e a maioria deles se encontra nas cavernas do jogo. Todos possuem seus pontos negativos e positivos, assim afetando o seu personagem de diversas maneiras. O legal \u00e9 que temos os sets completos no jogo. Ent\u00e3o da pra ficar brincando e variando o personagem. Tamb\u00e9m temos os itens lend\u00e1rios que s\u00e3o super simples mas que deixam o jogo ainda mais f\u00e1cil (n\u00e3o chega a ser um ponto negativo). Mas vale a pena equipar estes itens e se sentir o mais poderoso de todos. Lembrando que nosso personagem aprende a andar pelas \u00e1guas e tamb\u00e9m a voar. Isso para um gato n\u00e3o faz sentido n\u00e9? pois \u00e9, mas estamos falando de um jogo que realmente brinca com isso e consegue por s\u00ed s\u00f3 trazer extrema divers\u00e3o e satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nTrilha Sonora: Simples e bem executada combinando perfeitamente com a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo e mudando nas batalhas mais desafiadoras.\n\nPersonagens: Controlamos nosso personagem durante a aventura e seu pequeno amigo (fantasma) e temos que lidar com a maioria das situa\u00e7\u00f5es. Nosso personagem \u00e9 praticamente calado, mas o fantasminha tem seu carisma de sobra, assim como nosso inimigo e os personagens do mapa que s\u00e3o extremamente carism\u00e1ticos e conseguem tirar um sorriso do jogador. (Os desenvolvedores tamb\u00e9m deixam nas entrelinhas uma pequena informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre uma poss\u00edvel DLC com cachorros) Id\u00e9ia genial. Os inimigos s\u00e3o bem variados tamb\u00e9m.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos, ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o, mapa: Os gr\u00e1ficos todos coloridos e extremamente bem feitos, isso aliado a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o perfeita e boa varia\u00e7\u00e3o nas cavernas (dungeons) e locais para explorar. O level design das miss\u00f5es (cavernas) s\u00e3o bem variadas. Se vamos falar de mapa, temos aqui um mapa bem grande para um jogo deste porte, o mapa realmente \u00e9 bem grandinho e com muitas coisas para fazer e tudo muito bonito. \u00c9 \u00f3bvio que n\u00e3o \u00e9 enorme como um RPG mais s\u00e9rio, mas foi feito com carinho e amor pelos desenvolvedores. Que s\u00e3o \u00f3timos em responder todas as d\u00favidas por sinal.\n\nPontos negativos:\n\n- Falta de idioma Portugu\u00eas - Brasil.\n- 6 - 8 horas se voc\u00ea jogar s\u00f3 a principal.\n- O chefe final \u00e9 extremamente f\u00e1cil e isso pode decepcionar os jogadores.\n- Caso acabe n\u00e3o achando algum item (como aconteceu no meu caso) prepare-se para fazer grind e acumular dinheiro para comprar os ba\u00fas dourados e obter o item. Pode demorar muito at\u00e9 conseguir e isso pode irritar demais os jogadores j\u00e1 que na compra dos ba\u00fas (que tamb\u00e9m est\u00e3o pelo mapa) tudo vem de forma randomica ou seja: se falta apenas 1 item, prepare-se para gastar mais algumas horas em busca do mesmo.\n\nSobre o pre\u00e7o: Eu peguei o jogo por 20 reais, obtive mais de 10 horas com o mesmo e me diverti bastante ao longo das miss\u00f5es secund\u00e1rias e prim\u00e1rias. O humor do jogo, a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o, gr\u00e1ficos coloridos e vibrantes s\u00e3o \u00f3timos, os di\u00e1logos entre personagens e o vil\u00e3o acabam por deixar o jogo ainda mais gratificante e bem humorado. \n\nSe voc\u00ea procura um jogo leve, bonito e casual e quer simplesmente relaxar de outros jogos com dificuldade mais alta. V\u00e1 e pegue Cat quest que vai valer o pre\u00e7o full para voc\u00ea.\n\nJ\u00e1 se voc\u00ea \u00e9 um jogador que gostou do jogo mas achou o pre\u00e7o salgado, recomendo com 30% de desconto.\n\nNo geral Cat quest me divertiu e rendeu boas horas de humor e divers\u00e3o e explora\u00e7\u00e3o do seu mapa. \n\nVale a pena!", "timestamp_created": 1503680342, "timestamp_updated": 1503680455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34485178": {"recommendationid": "34485178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135116049", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504337646}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8d85\u7ea7\u597d\u73a9\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\u8d85\u7231\uff01\u671f\u5f85\u7eed\u4f5c\uff0c\u52a0\u6cb9", "timestamp_created": 1503679190, "timestamp_updated": 1503679190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34484807": {"recommendationid": "34484807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065993122", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511474578}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend this game to anyone who is new to RPGs, struggles with twitch gameplay, and/or loves cats.\n\n\n\nWhen I play games, I like to play strategy and management games, almost exclusively.

Instead of being a strike against Cat Quest, I think the length and variety is just enough to suck in players like myself.\n\n\nI'm hooked. I want more Cat Quest. I want more games like Cat Quest.

A top down ARPG with everything centered around cats, what could possibly go wrong? Melee attacks are assigned to one button with a simple 3 hit combo, regardless of weapons. Magic however can get pretty interesting. There are 4 slots to equip different spells each being assigned to a trigger or shoulder button. In practice this a fun way to mix and match the spells to counter enemies.\n\nThe majority of the adventure has you on a map overworld searching for dungeons. The first few hours feel fresh, however this gameplay loot repeats for the remainder of the game. Quests are all fetch/kill quests which have you go to another dungeon. While the game pokes fun at this RPG trope, it also follows it to a T. \n\nMy only real gripe has to do with the nature of chests.

I decided to take the plunge and 104 hours later (and a whisker past half-way through the game) I do not regret one single penny. I was even further impressed when I found my old HP Touchsmart would actually run it, and quite well at that. \n\nThere's quite a lot to say about this game so I suppose I'll start with asthetics and graphics. Cat Quest is f*****g adorable! The colors are bright and vivid, even on my old deck, The way you play on the map is unique in that you traverse across the literal map. There's no getting lost and when you play it you'll see why. The movement and combat animations are gorgeus and it feels good to run around smashing quests and slaying dragons. \n\nThe gameplay itself is smooth as you lope gracefully across the map like a glorious lion. The difficulty level is right in that sweet spot between challenging and satisfying. The simple control scheme makes this a relaxing hack and slash when you need it or an intense firestorm when you want it. \n\nIf you like cat puns, you'll squee as you read the dialogue. Unfortunately there is no voice acted dialogue but I don't feel like that takes away from the game. In fact, I think it adds to the simple charm of it. The writing is witty and the references are amusing and clever. Gentlebros managed to pack a lot of game into such a small file.\n\nAll of these elements culminate to create a bright, epic adventure filled with fierce battles and cat-astrophic puns. Cat quest is a good investment for any gamer who enjoys rpgs and cats. Especially cats. I got it for the cats.\n\nDid I mention you play as a cat? \n\nWhen it comes to Cat Quest, curiosity might've killed the cat but satisfaction brought it back!", "timestamp_created": 1503369232, "timestamp_updated": 1503369232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34404716": {"recommendationid": "34404716", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969692639", "num_games_owned": 557, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503357541}, "language": "english", "review": "Completely taken by surprise with this one.

Cat Quest will make you feel relax.\n\nI know I sound like a copypasta strainght from the description box of a game but what I say is true. However I have a couple of cons:\n- I need more, it was too short for my liking. The game has lots of potential for lots more, I feel it could use a lot more of the elements for an open world RPG. For example more story, more equiment, more side quests to offer. That sort of thing. Now for the record as of the date I was writing this I have heard of no new updates for it, yes the game hints at more but currently I have heard of no updates. \n\n-The controls could be a bit better, if you are playing this I recommend playing with an controller instead of the mouse and arrow keys. I found it a lot more easier and adaptable with a controller.\n\nOther  than those cons.

Anyway, let's see if i can manage a pro and con of the game.. \n\nPro's : \nAdorable style and characters\nGreat humour, even without \"swears\" although they do exist in meows.. godcatit.. where was i going with this..\nReferences :D\nThe story is great! though, you have to let yourself get lost in the world to learn lore and actually explore a little\nThe combat is GREAT! Even as limited as it is, I very much enjoyed it. It does get frustrating at times, though that's because I was stubborn.. \n\nCons - The side quests can get repetetive occasionally, though they are fun, and you do have to do a lot of them to be able to beat the game and be strong enough\n\nTLDR : It's MEOWING amazin.

The game itself is very fun with fluid controls and dodging mechanics. Combat is a really simple matter but does require some thought. It isn't just rushing in to attack the monster (usually), but rather has an element of strategy and learning the patterns of some enemies' attacks while attacking them. Dodging is your best friend throughout the game and takes some learning on when to dodge and where.

Its just bad. No if ands or buts about it, the ending is terrible. It really feels like the developers gave up completely on making a fufilling ending. Like, there isnt even a final boss so it makes all of the leveling and gear progression through out the game (Which was a lot of fun while doing it) was completely usless in the end. You could beet the game no problem at level 55 which is like bare minimum level without doing all the sidequests like I did. I worked up to level 80 and it felt completely worthless. It was a VERY fun ride up until the end and I 100%  suggest playing this game for that, but if you beleieve the ending of a game can make or break the experience then i'd skip it.

You have a melee attack, a dodge roll, and spells you can assign to the shoulder buttons. \n  - The main story and the side quests are well written.\n  - The game is adorably drawn. \n  - Good humor and excessive cat puns (that last might be a negative :) \n  - Rewarding loot and gear leveling system.\n\nCons:\n  - Limited # of enemy types. \n  - Systems aren't very deep. The combat and gear and leveling are great, imo, but some might find it lacking. For example, you have only 3 stats: health, attack, magic. Another, you have only melee, no ranged weapons (though spells provide some range).\n  - It eventually ends, and that will make you sad.", "timestamp_created": 1502787329, "timestamp_updated":

The gameplay first off is a Real time RPG adventure,  where you level up and gain stats, along with magic and swordsmanship, thats... your whole arssenal of offensive weaponry. However, there are Body and Head wear that increase your Health,Attack,Armour, and Magic, however, some armor tend to take away stats instead of increase it. Leaving you 3 diffrent ways to play the game, and you can shift these weapons without worry, of having to grind more, you can shift playstyles as much as you'd like, and as often as you'd like. You also have the capability to roll, making you wanna make out with your space bar with how much you'll be rolling, it almost makes the game too easy, but if you tend to dodge into the wrong directions, (you can roll by pressing space and any direction on the arrow keys) you can take a hefty ammount of damage when up against the wrong enemy. The magic has really neat effects to help you, and to be able to combo into physical attacks, and can let you attack during a roll... yet, the magic can be really busted if used correctly, but the healing paw is the worst with how if costs so much mp, yet, it heals worth crap.\n\nNow, the story... honestly isnt something specactular, first off, you are sailing across the ocean when a white cat named Drakoth destroys your ship and takes away your sister. (Ala; LoZ Windwaker) So now you must head off with your guardian spirit Spirri to save your sister by defeating Drakoth's 4 dragons. The story is simple yet easy to follow, even doing the sidequests give more info into the inhabitants of the land of Felingard, even hinting at other species living off in the distance, however, the story quickly throws you for multiple loops at the end of the game, where it just throws plot twist after plot twist at you, where it seems like they tried to reveal the plot twists in impactful ways, however, they dont really succeed since they tell you these plot twists earlier on in the game if you do sidequests, which, the game wants you to do all of em, but, the most irritating thing about these sidequest storylines is that the lore you learn from it never really matters in the end, it seems like endless tagging on. And speaking of sidequests, 3 of them arent even lore related, these 3 are either ads, promises of seeing more races other than cats, and the game developers litterally fucking with you. \n\nNow, balancing is hard to do, and this game is proof of how hard it is, when you get armor or weapons for the first time, they are permanantly in your inventory, and if you collect them again, the weapon or armor levels up, and the stats increase. This can get very broken with a vast ammount of the weapons  and armors yeilding negative stats more so than the positives, and even then, it locks you out of being able to do both magic and weapons at their strongest unless they come from gold chests, which make it so easy to cheese the game, that its not even worth trying at somepoints, \nthe final boss didnt even take 5 minuites to complete, its pathetically easy with how the balancing in this game is off.  and plus you can spend the most easy to obtain money in anything I played to buy random weapons, and to increase the strength of your magic,\n\nthe Dialouge isnt the best, it seems forced most of the time, but the puns are nice, and it gave me a few chuckles. its amusing to say the least, but all of the characters seem to not have any personality, if they show it, its usually reversed a few sentances later\n\nAnd lastly, the visual representation is beyond adorable... allbeit the obsessive use of ritual circles make it tiring to see them... the colors are bright and fun, but, some times, its just solid Red, White or black, and the dungeon themes keep coming back again and again with diffrent layouts, it gets old quickly.\n\nPros:\n-The gameplay is fun, versitile, and can appeal to diffrent playstyles,\n-The Writing in humorus and Cat pun filled,\n-There are diffrent armor types to appeal to anyone.\n-The visuals are cute as fuck (the mage cats are my favorite things ever)\n-There are 7 spells that assist you in battle, which helps you out immensly, \n\nCons:\n-Its super easy to cheese the game, making the difficulty mind numbing\n-The characters arent too standoff-ish, I couldnt even remember the guardian spirit's name for the longest time,\n-The plot has been done before, but better,\n-There are times where the game gets bland and reppetivie in its design and dungeons,\n-The game devs seem to troll you with how much deception is going on in most cases,\n-The magic is unbalanced unless you pay to upgrade, making them your most powerful tools... a bit... too powerful\n\n\nConclusion:\nI really like this game, I really do, but it doesnt seem like the game was tested for balancing purposes, Its incredibly easy, yet it punishes you by trolling you with various ways of being unfair to you\n\nFor 10 dollars, this does seem like a good game, but if you're looking for a story driven or exploration heavy game, this is not for you, its a relaxing game to play, but not get invested in. \n\nI reccomend it for its price,", "timestamp_created": 1502683366, "timestamp_updated": 1502683366,

The introduction lasts about 30 seconds, and by the end of it you know the premise \u2013 you\u2019re a cat knight who kills dragons. The action is fast-paced, the dialogue is snappy, and you bound across the landscape from town to town in just a matter of pawsteps. Think Skyrim if it were 80% simpler and, well, feline.\n\nIn fact, a lot of the mechanics of this game are much simpler versions of classic RPG adventure games like Skyrim. While there are weapons and armor to find, there\u2019s no selling or bartering, and certainly no customization. Everything pretty much just upgrades as you do, and getting new toys is a game of luck. It has the classic setup \u2013 a main quest with side quests along the way \u2013 but each mini quest takes about a minute and a half to complete. You can learn magic to supplement your attacks, but there are only six spells available over the course of the whole game, and most of them do pretty much the same thing.\n\nThe simplified RPG experience has both positives and negatives. It\u2019s terribly satisfying to plow through the main storyline, soaking up XP and gold left and right, especially when the fighting mechanics are easy to pick up. Learning the attack patterns of new monsters is intuitive yet challenging and a lack of complicated combos and attacks for your own character allows you to get into a good rhythm when you stand up to a swarm of bad guys. There\u2019s something refreshing about stripping away the complicated upgrades, levels, bonuses, customizations, and gadgets of more convoluted RPG games.\n\nBut with simplicity you also lose a great deal of the newness that keeps these games interesting. Cat Quest is addictive and its shtick is clever and fun \u2013 up to a point. After a while, you\u2019ve giggled over all of the cat puns, learned all of the spells, and seen the same side quest with only a small variation about 50 times, and things start to slow down. At a certain point the only way to progress in the game is killing the same monsters over and over in order to gain the XP necessary to complete the next quest. That can get tedious, especially when there isn\u2019t a wide variety of interesting places to explore or people to meet (the townspeople, or towncats, are all a touch bland, and the caves are devastatingly similar). If the game were a little shorter, the simplicity might have been a better advantage.\n\nStill, the mechanics are sharp and fun, and the storyline is humorously clever, so I\u2019d give Cat Quest a 7 out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1502634335, "timestamp_updated": 1502634335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0,

It pays homage to other classic titles, especially Zelda, and is filled with paw-some references. It's also filled - FILLED! - with cat-puns. Some of them are quite bad, like \"catfrontation\" (Clawfrontation was the obvious choice).\n\nThe game is stunningly well-made, it is perhaps the cutest game out there, but in terms of art direction it's bright, colorful and uplifting, the animations and character designs are great as well. You control the protagonist, who has his sister kidnapped at the sea by a magical white cat. You are then accompanied by a Na'Vi-like guiding spirit that is as annoying as her who will help you on your quest to rescue your sister. \n\nCombat is in real-time, just like Zelda, in which you click to attack freely, and you must run around the map to dodge incoming attacks and spells. Some enemies can be quite challenging. While the game isn't linear, meaning you can go wherever you want to in any order you'd like to, areas are separated by level, which means you might need to get a few levels before advancing further. The world is pretty big and is filled with dozens of quests.\n\nOverall, the game is really fun, it's super cute, very entertaining, but unfortunately too short. It can be completed in less than eight hours, which is feeble compared to the staple of the RPG genre. But in-game the developers have inserted many meta jokes, like the wolves of the Lupus Empire will only appear if Cat Quest becomes popular enough. My guessis this version of the game is testing the waters, because it growls for more content and it has the pawtential of being a good classic of the genre - if given enough attention.\n\nYou should definitely play this game if you love adventure, RPG and kittens.", "timestamp_created": 1502467201, "timestamp_updated": 1502467201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34171401": {"recommendationid": "34171401", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990816990", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502431238}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the part with the cats.", "timestamp_created": 1502467160, "timestamp_updated": 1502467160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34170865": {"recommendationid": "34170865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362788069", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502847992}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that proves cats care about there owners.", "timestamp_created": 1502465424, "timestamp_updated": 1502541316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34170419": {"recommendationid": "34170419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140390209", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502474097}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game! so much fun!", "timestamp_created": 1502464234, "timestamp_updated": 1502464234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34170255": {"recommendationid": "34170255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365119133", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504319455}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u628a\u6e38\u620f\u6240\u6709\u7684\u5f69\u86cb\uff0c\u4e3b\u7ebf\uff0c\u652f\u7ebf\uff0c\u6d1e\u7a9f\uff0c\u9057\u8ff9\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u662f\u6240\u6709\uff0c\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5047\uff0c\u6211\u73a9\u5b8c\u4e86\u8fd8\u68c0\u67e5\u4e862\u904d\u5462\uff09\u73a9\u5b8c\u4e86\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u611f\u89c9\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4ee5\u540e\u8fd8\u4f1a\u66f4\u65b0\u5417\uff08\u6211\u4e0d\u662f\u6765\u9a97\u8d5e\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u611f\u89c9\u4f1a\u7684\u5c31\u70b9\u5426\u5427\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1502463770, "timestamp_updated": 1502463770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521472", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34168421": {"recommendationid": "34168421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068552646", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502863132}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u8bc4\uff01\n\u753b\u98ce\u5e72\u51c0\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u5f88\u9002\u5408\u4f11\u95f2\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1502457792, "timestamp_updated": 1502457792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34168307": {"recommendationid": "34168307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030590674", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503500942}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6d77\u76d7\u5b9d\u85cf\u5728\u54ea\uff0c\u6d77\u76d7\u5b9d\u85cf\u5728\u54ea\uff0c\u6d77\u76d7\u5b9d\u85cf\u5728\u54ea\uff0c\u6781\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u8bf4\u4e09\u904d", "timestamp_created": 1502457439, "timestamp_updated": 1502457439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "comment_count": "18", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34168271": {"recommendationid": "34168271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071293385", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512370934}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is extreamly good, and I feel like it was worth the money if they continue to update the game.

However let me start with the negative. I found it to be a bit repetitive in the sense that all of the quests have you running from one town(closer to an outpost than town fyi) back to the other as soon as you are finished with one quest(they are all very short)- and then it's on to the next one all over again. There isn't anything special about the different towns, nothing memorable to compare one from another, they all look identical. For that matter the quests are similar in nature as well, it feels that you do the same thing over and over. \n\nThere are other things that bug me too. The dungeons show you the recommended level to enter but once you've cleared the floor there is no distinction to show you which dungeons you've completed. There are quite a few and they are randomly scattered all over the world so this does complicate an otherwise fast-flowing game. The game lacks some depth, complexity and systematization for sure. For my recommendation I factor in that this is an indie game afterall.\n\nAnyway, despite the issues that I found to affect my enjoyment the game is fun in a very casual way. Things progress very quickly and don't require a huge sacrifice of time to advance in-game. You are rewarded just as quickly as the quests complete. You can save very often as there are save points all over the map. Which means restarting is quick and pain-free for the most part. Combat is simple, clean and fun. No turn-based or trickery. The graphics look \"cute\" and the music is also decent. I'm overall impressed.

Cats, dogs and mice rephrases would not make it into a very stimulated franchise.\n\u200b\nGameplay\n\u200b\nThe combat is the child friendly version of Dark Souls. You will be surprised and you will die some times. But it doesn't matter since you can save very close to your mission\u00a0every single time. It's content with combos and the first skill you get is the wombo-combo starter. Nothing feels more satisfying in this game than to burn your foes and make them weaker with a ring of fire and then delivering your finishing moves.\n\u200b\nThere is a gear shop and a mage tower for skill upgrades. But this early on quest items would suffice well.\n\u200b\nStory\n\u200b\nThere are two branches in the plot design. The main story and the side stories. The side stories are not hand me 9 copper ores and you will get a sack of coins. They are excellent made with follow ups and twists in between and in the end. To\u00a0put it short, a chapter themselves.\n\u200b\nThe main story involves the cat hero himself and his catnapped sister. To save her sister, the main villain wants the cat hero to defeat three dragons in the world. \n\nAnd the peasants misfortune with his gone family member makes you feel downsy and afraid of what will happen next.\n\u200b\nGraphics\n\u200b\n2D vector and hand drawn graphics makes the game cute in a world of creepy stories. But does the graphic setting go well with the game? With the cast being cats in a fantasy world, it does. To least to say, it is kid friendly.\n\u200b\nSound\n\u200b\nVery hypnotizing for the mind. Good sounds, good music. Makes you drawn into the games world more (except for the cat humor).\n\u200b\nFinal Score:\n\u200b\nGameplay: 7\nStory: 5\nGraphics: 5\nSound : 7", "timestamp_created": 1502286035, "timestamp_updated": 1502342989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34125001": {"recommendationid": "34125001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091315800", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506140430}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uadc0\uc5ec\uc6b4 \uace0\uc591\uc774\uac00 \ubaa8\ud5d8\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\n\uac8c\uc784 \ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ub0b4 \uadc0\uc5ec\uc6b4 \uc218\uc778\ub4e4\uc744 \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uadf8\uac83 \uc678\uc5d0 \uc124\uba85\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c\uc9c0\n\n\uc7a5\uc810 : \ub113\uc740 \uc624\ud508\uc6d4\ub4dc \ud544\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uac00\ub4dd\ud55c \uc218\uc778NPC\ub4e4 \n          \uc758\uc678\ub85c \uc798 \uc9dc\uc5ec\uc9c4 \uc804\ud22c \ud68c\ud53c\ud558\uace0 \ub54c\ub9ac\uace0 \ub9c8\ubc95\uc4f0\uace0, \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc990\uac81\ub2e4.\n\n\ub2e8\uc810 : \ud55c\uae00\uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc548\ud568, \ub2e8 \uc601\uc5b4\uba74 \uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50 \uc878\uc5c5\ud55c \uc815\ub3c4 \ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ubc14\ub85c \uc774\ud574 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568", "timestamp_created": 1502284817, "timestamp_updated": 1502285002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34124993": {"recommendationid": "34124993", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977308850", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501166631}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it, that is all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT'S PUUUUUR-FECT FOR CAT LOVERS!!!....", "timestamp_created": 1502284783, "timestamp_updated": 1511390764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.357647", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34124967": {"recommendationid": "34124967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168832526", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513606520}, "language": "english", "review": "It's cute, it's smooth play and supports controller very well.

however, i was delightfully surprised how much fun this game is. I sat down to only play 15 minutes just to get a feel for it and before i knew it i had been playing for over an hour. The combat is fluent and not too challenging but also not too easy, you need to time all your attacks and dodges because some enemys can do stupid damage (although if you get hit its only on you because the game gives you more than enough time to get out of the way of an attack). If you get this game for just one reason, get it because of the hillariously cute cat theme of the game.

Though combat is simplistic (with a button for attacking, one for spells, and another for rolling), there is a great amount of enjoyment to be had with this title. It's back to basics, the fundamentals that make other action RPGs so much fun: fighting, looting, and fashion. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nCombat is boiled down to the bare essentials. You have one button for swinging your melee weapon, a selection of up to four spells to cast, and a dodge button. All of these are used with equal frequency. It's not enough to just whack an enemy, more often you will need to slow them with ice or weaken their defenses with fire. You can't just stand there and wail on the baddies, you will need to watch for their attack warning and roll out of danger. You're given a lot of warning when danger approaches, and in exchange you are punished greatly if you do get hit. Cat-like agility will be needed.\n\nLoot is comprised of armor, helmets, and weapons. Every chainmail helm has the same stat distribution as the next. However, every time you get a new chainmail helm, the one you already have goes up in level, and thus in stats. This means you might be mixing and matching sets rather than sticking to one for the entirety of your playthrough. \n\nSide quests are sadly tedious, all falling under the umbrella of Kill X or Fetch Y. There is some variety thrown in, in the form of tracking and chasing, but those moments are just a game of follow the dotted line. Avoiding side quests isn't really an option, either, as they're the best way to level up. Simply killing monsters won't be enough, unless you go after those of a much higher level than you.\n\nBalancing is an issue, in terms of leveling. Starting off, you'll see a lot of quests above your paygrade, though you're free to attempt them. After awhile, you'll find yourself rocketing past the level recommendations for the main quest and going back to find side quests you're now 20 levels too big for. Eventually you'll want to tackle quests that are deemed too high a level for you, but with the right gear and magic, you will do just fine.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\n\nHeading straight for the end of the game, ignoring any side content you don't have to touch, you'll likely finish the game in 3~ hours. Factoring in all the side quests and dungeons, expect to get about ~6 hours out of this game. There's promise for future content, though it's hard to tell if it's hinting at a sequel or DLC. \n\nIf you're looking for a fun and simple (but not too simple) game to relax with, this would be a great fit for any veteran or newcomer to the gaming scene. It's accessible and charming, and while the content isn't as substantial as some may like, what is there is better polished than in most other games for its cost. Quality over quantity is the name of the game.\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n+ Charming art style and orchestral soundtrack blend for a simplistic but enjoyable gameworld.\n+ Decently sized selection of gear, some original and some referential.\n+ Simple combat, but more depth there to be found if you look.\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n- Very boring side quests that lead to mashing through dialogue just to get it over with.\n\n[h1]To read the full review, please check out this [url=https://www.keengamer.com/article/16925_cat-quest-review]link[/url].[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1502207458, "timestamp_updated": 1502207458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657646", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34106032": {"recommendationid": "34106032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083754515", "num_games_owned": 5836, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 3110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510248079}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Cat Quest is a [i]'pawsome'[/i] game with cute graphics, fluid gameplay, fun quests, and lots of cat puns.

It's definitely that, but it's also so much better than that.\n\nFor one thing, the game design here is really great. They've streamlined typical RPG systems like loot, inventory management, skill progression, and so on in ways that are approachable and intuitive. Instead of accumulating tons of garbage loot, for example, getting multiple items of the same type fuses them together in a higher-level item instead of cluttering your inventory. Rather than a complex skill system, your playstyle is largely defined by what skills you buy with money, and what items you equip, so there's a lot less to manage while still providing flexibility.\n\nThere's also a lot of clever quest and level design, despite a very limited toolset. The designers make clever use of things like visual trails and NPCs to create interesting-feeling quest setups that are a bit more flavourful than \"Kill the thing at this location\" (though often that's the climax of a quest). There's a neat quest line involving two cities in a sort of time loop, for example, that makes interesting use of the simple tools the designers had to make the quests. Levels are also cleverly designed - many of the dungeons have a slightly puzzle-like quality that makes clever use of enemy placement and obstacle layout. A few of them are particularly fiendish or comedic, which is great.\n\nFinally, the writing? It's shallow and simple, sure, but in so many little ways it's actually surprisingly well-written. There are some decent plot twists, some interesting character backgrounds you can discover through side quests, some ancillary lore and worldbuilding hinted at, some funny gags or games and pop culture references, even some heartwarming little moments and a few clever snippets of social critique. It's nothing mind-blowing, but it's shockingly good for what looks like a random cutesy game, and it's frankly better than some of the fancier-looking games out there.\n\nSo, long story short: Cat Quest is way, way better than I thought it would be. But don't worry - if all you wanted are cat puns and hats with cat ears, it's got tons of those too.", "timestamp_created": 1515978195, "timestamp_updated": 1515978241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39350629": {"recommendationid": "39350629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271325925", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 110, "last_played": 1515685718}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0411\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0440\u043f\u0433))\n\u041c\u044f\u0443)", "timestamp_created": 1515967834, "timestamp_updated": 1515967834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39349474": {"recommendationid": "39349474", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961935411", "num_games_owned": 681, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 353, "last_played": 1516107940}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow i really enjoy this game!

It's cute and charming at first glance but the gameplay is horribly tedious. \n\n\nThe gameplay consists of doing the same thing over and over and over: You follow a quest marker to fight a battle or talk to a random NPC who sends you on the hunt for even more quest markers. Rinse repeat. The slow walking speed adds to making travelling over the world map a chore. Sometimes you go inside a cave, every cave is more or less the same. A quest for a sepcific town is only available at [i]that[/i] one town, resulting in A) missing low level quests until you are way overpowered for them and B) backtracking galore. And \"Towns\" themselves are merely save spots, inhabited by barely any people with very little to say.\n\nThe battle system is alright. You hit, you dodge and you cast some spells. Simple but fluid enough to be engaging. The enemies have just enough variety, not much to complain here. It does its job.\n\nThe biggest annoyance by far is the writing. Every goddamn sentence contains a cat pun. Look, I love puns. I love cats. But replacing every \"for\" with \"fur\" does NOT qualify as a pun. Certainly not a funny pun. And this crap begins to wear you down quickly. I applaud the devs for committing to the cat theme, but my god lay off. Aside from neverending puns the writing is mediocre, inoffensive \"kiddy-friendly\" jokes that are more miss than hit and many insults that contain the word \"butt\". A Hat in Time this ain't. Cat Quest was very clearly intended for a young audience but that does NOT excuse boring gameplay and crappy writing.\n\n\nOverall Cat Quest reminds me a lot of Crashlands, an honest attempt at making a good game but ultimately failing to deliver a full-fledged experience. Crashlands at least had witty writing and fun characters to make up for its terrible combat & gameplay. Cat Quest's writing is lame and the halfway decent combat & cutesy visuals alone are not enough to save it from being utterly forgettable.\n\n\nIf you want baby's first RPG/Zelda you're better off with Oceanhorn. If you want a genuinely well written RPG with minimalistic yet interesting mechanics that's still \"kid-friendly\" your money would be much better spent on West of Loathing.", "timestamp_created": 1515942063, "timestamp_updated": 1515942063, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430464", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39298722": {"recommendationid": "39298722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005091773", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 191, "last_played": 1515817831}, "language": "english", "review": "A TON OF MEMES.

It's cute, well written, controls are tight, and it's great fun. It's basically a telegraph based action RPG where you complete main and quests full of cat puns. Enemies project red areas that you need to dodge out of, and you have melee, dodge and magic abilities. Levels 1-99 with loads of content. It may be a bit simple for some, but it's really satisfying to level up and bash stuff. It also has a new game mode with challenges such as no levels or no armour which unlocks really powerful gear for your main save file.\n\nCompleted in 8 hours (Add about 15 hours to that for 100%)", "timestamp_created": 1515163218, "timestamp_updated": 1515163218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39085094": {"recommendationid": "39085094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001747146", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 677, "last_played": 1515161092}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a seriously lovely game with a cute main character and a LOT of cat puns. It's great if you want to spend an afternoon or two being a small but fierce catventurer. I really enjoyed it, and I would love to see more of it. It's just a really fun game that is fun to play without stressing you out.\n\nThat said, however, that the first third of the game is significantly better than the rest - after level 30 or so, only a few hours into the game, side quests dry up and the gear you get is mostly for show. It's like someone only created enough content to fill a third of the game, and then threw in some dungeons and mew game challenges to make the game feel more complete. It's a shame, because the world is really vibrant and cute, with lots of little settlements that have plenty of character behind them, but feels shallow and barely explored once you reach higher levels. It really does feel like the game was primarily designed to suck you in and then leave you to your own devices, which gives it a rushed, cheap vibe of a pay-to-win mobile game, and I kept expecting some sort of microtransaction to pop up. Thankfully, nothing like that happened, but especially after the spectacular first third of the game, I was left feeling a bit disappointed, especially with how the story fell completely flat towards the end and how some of the characters (like the buff mayor of Pawt City) and locations (like Windmew city) looked so promising, but offered so little.\n\nI still heartily recommend this game for a few hours of fun, especially if you get it on sale.

Smooth gameplay, good graphics, a variety of side quests and storylines therein, simple but good combat system, and I've always had a weakness for puns. \n\nMy only complaint is the upgrade system, but sadly that's kind of a big one. For the love of GOD, either make money easier to get after quests run out, make the good chest option much cheaper, or make it less randomized. At the very least an option for what kind of equipment you want. All my equipment levels are horrifically mismatched and the only way I can upgrade the good stuff is to give up several quests worth of loot for a tiny chance at what I want.\n\nI happily recommend this game, but devs, PLEASE don't do this upgrade system again if you make a sequel.

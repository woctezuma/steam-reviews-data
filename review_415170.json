A few puzzle games are on a higher level than that, though. Engare is one of them.\n\nTwo reasons you should buy this:\n\nThis is an exercise in artistic concept.  The more you understand that concept, the more entertaining it becomes as you get better and better, firing the neurons in your brain that are required for this charming endeavour.\n\nThe music is enthralling. I'll let you know now that it is repetitive but, so is the complex, pattern-based essence of the game. \n\n\n\nTwo reasons you should not buy this game:\n\n You have already mastered the form. You're such a pro that this is just a banal tool for the masses to enjoy and are not at all challenged by timing the beginning of the pattern.\n\nNearly inconsequential and very infrequent button detection bugs throw you into a severe rage, destroying your ability to relax and take in any form of beauty.\n\n\n\nI should say that Engare may not have taught me a single fact but, I feel like a useful lesson has been imparted on me every time climb to the next difficulty.  That's what a puzzle game should feel like - that epiphanic, 'Ah Ha' moment. I have always understood the basic idea behind geomatric art, having been one of those kids who received an apathetically purchased spin-art set on more than one occasion.

sounds interresting right?\nWell I played through the entire game, and here are my thoughts on it!\n\nPositive:\n+ great introduction, which made me excited to get in and start playing and seeing all the cool complex shapes I'd be seeing\n+ The music is great, and so is the artstyle, kudos to that\n+ the first few levels are great and show you a bunch of complex and beautiful shapes (for the most part at least)\n+ the drawing tools are absolutely amazing\n\nNegative:\n- past the first 2 areas, it feels like the dev had already shown you all the cool complex shapes too eartly on and ran out of ideas for shapes so he just started giving you a bunch of basic/uninterresting shapes to make with more complex puzzles, meaning that the payoff for the harder puzzles became more and more dissapointing as it went on\n\n- the last 2 puzzles of the game are just levels where you make the shape that you want to move on, no idea why those are main levels and not just one mode avaiable in the area of the game that let's you play around with shapes (screenshot 3 and 6 from the store page are form that zone of the game)\n\n- the first few areas had all those interresting setups, with grids of squares moving in odd patterns and blocks colliding with each other and swapping blocks with one another making finding where to draw the sahpe quickly, except that those went away after that and the last areas became 80% nothing but rotating sticks attached to one another (the ramining 20% being circles in circles)\n\n- the drawing tools are locked behind those main game levels, which is a shame\n\n\n\nSo all in all, the drawing tools are amazing and I have nothing bad to say about them, however I do feel inccredibly underwhelmed by the main game itself, and the drawing tools being locked behind those means that you'll have to get through them all to unlock all of the tools.\n\nFinal Score: 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1510416080, "timestamp_updated": 1510416080, "voted_up":

I was hyped for it ever since this April 2016 preview from Killscreen. So many ticked boxes: A video game (Check!) about the mathematical (Check!) beauty (Check!) of Islamic Art (Check!). How could this not be absolutely awesome in an awesomely original way?\n\nSo I was very excited when I saw it in the new releases on Steam. But awesome it is not.\n\nInstead, it is a small collection of \"puzzles\" that are easily solved within an hour. Calling them puzzles is generous because you solve them with a single click, plus maybe a few clicks of trial-and-error if you don't get it right the first attempt. What do they consist of? Typically, you are confronted with a few geometrical shapes that rotate in intricate ways, and a small drawing/pattern that is your target. You have to click on the part of one of the shapes where you want to place a virtual pencil. The shapes continue their movements, carrying the pencil with them (think spirograph) and if the resulting pattern sufficiently resembles the target, you win. it's all very simple and also very easy, except in some puzzles that inexplicably require millimeter-to-millimeter reproduction of the goal pattern (most levels are somewhat lenient with this, as it should be). The very last levels have sliders to adjust the size of the geometric objects and/or the speed of their rotation, but it doesn't make the puzzles more challenging or much more interesting.\n\nWhat the game does well, is exposing the simple geometry behind some typical islamic decorative patterns. As a limited educational tool, it's not bad. But it completely fails as a game, never offering any enjoyable challenge. The content is almost laughably thin: don't expect to spend much more than a single hour with it. As you progress, you'll unlock a few drawing tools to use in a kind of sandbox mode, but again, this is very limited in what it allows (you can't customize the colors, for example) and in the time you'll want to fiddle with it.\n\nThere is so little content that one can only wonder what happened during the 18 months separating the preview with the game's release.\n\nAdd a few annoying but non game-breaking bugs, and it's really impossible to recommend. I am convinced there is a good game to be made on the subject of Islamic art. But Engare is not that game.

A few ideas to improve future versions, which i hope are planned (i would like to see a linux version too):\n\nright click should control the \"play/stop\" state of the needles.\n\nimo the option to change background color of puzzles or use simple textures would be appreciated.\n\nI would like it to have world-maps like angry birds and similar games, and also that the game was offered for free with a litlle more content than current version; additional levels and a level creation tool to allow players to share new puzzles could be part of dlc. i think that could help make the game more popular and visible, and also improve sales: new levels and game mechanics as extras.\n\na \"vs mode\" could be interesting for those who buy the game; could work as a race to see who solves more puzzles within a time limit, or also by forcing the other player to start playing a different puzzle each time a puzzle is solved. More songs, music player in the start menu, and a gallery for 3d and 2d models of actual architecture and rl art should be offered as rewards imo, and also and psychedelic animations with fractal patterns for the ending of each level rather tha the minimalistic ones it currently has (which should be optional to play at the end of each sublevel). this would help the game to be taken more seriously as both a cultural and educational tool.\n\nAll options related to the drawing tool should be open from the beginning, and choosing to start the game or the tool should be included in the start menu. an option to change volume in the middle of the game, and even background themes (like in tetris games) should also be present. the drawing tool should export to svg and png too, and be able to export and import text files with settings to generate different patterns.\n\nalso 3d models and more options should be available, like the option to use color in designs made with the drawing tool, and mix patterns with transparency and bevel effects; in general, more options to experiment more seriously and make it more useful so it feels lees like a toy; could have a \"switch mode\": \"simple (toy) mode\" and \"pro (designer/entusiast) mode\". \n\ni visited the website of the dev, and imo the other game about 3d illusions could easily be ixed with the concept of this \"game+tool\" if the concept of art+educational (puzzle) game was expanded.", "timestamp_created": 1509490690, "timestamp_updated": 1509490690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36174816": {"recommendationid": "36174816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097544180", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509573737}, "language": "english", "review": "absolutely halal/10", "timestamp_created": 1509479312, "timestamp_updated": 1509479312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36171937": {"recommendationid": "36171937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023818732", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509470104}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing puzzle game like I've never seen before.

Usually, with puzzle games, you face a system that feels difficult and strange at first (think Braid or sokoban games), but you progressively feel more confortable and start to think and feel like the system wants you to. This process usually takes a couple of hours, but with Engare it is very much faster: within the first few levels you go from not understanding how to solve the puzzles to think in terms of movement rather than static forms. Of course, you can just brute-force your way through the challenges. But the real experience is the change of perspective this game offers: you start to see movement in static images and static images coming out of mathematical patterns of motion.\n\nWhich brings you to the second part: experimenting with these patterns to create your own images, rather than copying what the levels want. This is probably the main experience of the game, and what really makes it worth the (very small) price. It is an incredible and potent tool, and at the same time very intuitive and simple.\n\nI have been following the development of this game for a few years, and finished it in a couple of hours.

I played through the game in a few hours, and enjoyed almost every minute of it even though I knew almost immediately how to solve many of the puzzles.  If you've never done parametric/polar coordinate math, some of the shapes or how to make them will be genuinely surprising.\n\nThe game is in my opinion a great way to intuitively learn how compound motions can produce a variety of interesting figures.  I enjoyed it so much that I plan to use it in a math class this very semester, along side traditional Mathematica-based computations.  An \"education mode\" or \"education edition\" would be a very welcome expansion of the game, where completed puzzles could also show you some of the mathematics behind them...but I wouldn't want that to in any way distract a player who wants to play it as-is.\n\nA few points for improvement: I discovered that holding the command key (Mac) allows slow motion and clicking; doing control to slow-mo didn't allow clicking.  Had I discovered this earlier, or had control allowed clicking, some of the puzzles would have been less frustrating.  In several, I knew exactly how to set up the shapes and where to click, but simply couldn't get a click to register on fast-moving objects.  This will hopefully be easily fixable by the developer.  A second point: two of the later levels do not have a required shape to produce; it would have been helpful to have the game say something like \"make any shape.\"  At first I thought there was a bug.\n\nOverall a VERY nice production, and very well worth it.

The basic mechanic of the game involves you putting a dot on one of the moving objects on the screen, which then draws a pattern by moving the dot as it moves and the dot traces the pattern. You solve a level by getting the objects to draw a pattern similar to the one drawn above the screen in each level. \n\nThere are several twists that will be added as you near the end of the game. The game has 6 chapters each with 6 - 12 levels and also a sandbox mode with 6 different pattern drawing tools. \n\nThe main game takes about 30 minutes to 2 hours to finish depending on your knowledge of math, physics and geometry and also depending on how many puzzle games you've played before. If you aren't good at math or haven't played many puzzle games before, don't worry, the game is very good at introducing you to its ideas and concepts and none of the levels are too difficult so that you might get stuck on them, there is even a chance you'll enjoy the game even more. There is a bit of awe that comes with solving each level, especially if you are completely new to the mathematical and geometrical concepts it's based on.\n\nThe sandbox modes are as fun as the main part, if not more, but in a different way. You are free to be creative, use your imagination, explore an infinite number of patterns and capture their beauty, and there are quite a lot of things you can create that are distinctly different from eachother. In fact, you don't even have to try to create patterns that are  jaw-droppingly beautiful, simply trying things out creates amazing patterns. You also can export your finished work of art to other 3D and 2D graphics softwares to use them in your own thing.\n\nWhat would have made the game better:\n\n- more levels that explore the mechanics to its limits; the levels are all simple and easy and I can't help but feel there could have been a lot more levels that wouldn't take away from the game's awesomeness in anyway.\n- puzzles involving mechanics other than the main one; it's an admirable fact that all the ~50 levels in the game are based on only one mechanic, but the game is supposed to be about \"motion and geometry\" and I feel a lot more can come out of that if the game had more than one mechanic around that idea.\n- being able to combine different patterns from the sandbox and color them so that you can have a finished image within the game would've been really nice. But you can do that in your graphics software of choice if you're not lazy like me.\n\nBuy and play this game if:\n\n- you want to play a puzzle game very different from your average casual puzzle game.\n- you like math and geometry and want to play a game involving mathematical concepts that underly amazingly beautiful patterns.\n- you are interested in experiencing another culture's art; the mechanics and the art in this game, as well as the drawing tools are all inspired by Islamic art and the music is heavily inspired by traditional Iranian music.\n- you have about an hour of free time to enjoy a relaxing, meditative experience.\n- you have never played with spirographs, don't know much about geometry and want your mind to be blown away by the things you see in this game.\n- you love to create, you are an artist looking for inspirations or even someone who could use a couple of cool-looking patterns and models in their own work of art.", "timestamp_created": 1508870932, "timestamp_updated": 1508928693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501155", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35972948": {"recommendationid": "35972948", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991757321", "num_games_owned": 2044, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508879321}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Middle Eastern and turkic/slavic themes then get this you  won't be dissapointed .", "timestamp_created": 1508870172, "timestamp_updated": 1508875821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501463", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35970993": {"recommendationid": "35970993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213738731", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509656808}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game \n", "timestamp_created": 1508863722, "timestamp_updated": 1508863722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450970", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35968336": {"recommendationid": "35968336", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969427377", "num_games_owned": 3935, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508855485}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply one of the most beautiful and engaging toys I've ever played with.

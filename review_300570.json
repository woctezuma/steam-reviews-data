Your role is to design and construct the \"factory\" to make each construction. In order to prove that your process works, you must deliver 10 perfect copies of the requested item to a \"scanner\" that validates that each copy delivered is correct. As you progress, you are given additional tools, more challenging conditions/restrictions and more complicated items to assemble. \n\nI first learned about this game through a YouTube reference/review from Mark Brown's Game Maker's Tool Kit (search for it and watch it) that put this game in the genre of \"Problem-Solving\" rather than \"Puzzle-Solving\". The distinction is worth noting. This game allows you to develop many potential solutions to each problem - and rates you on the time, moving part and space efficiency of your solution in the form of showing your performance relative to that of all the other Steam players.\n\nYou have unlimited design time to develop your solutions, and, apart from the final level, there are no practical time limits to how long your solution can take. There's even an achievement (\"Subversive Engineering\") for the running time of your (successful) solution being a really long time. \n\nBecause you learn to use each new element one at a time, I never found the learning curve too intimidatingly steep, and the sense of reward when you solve a problem stage is strong. It is also possible to \"finish\" the game without completing all of the problem scenarios, in case there's one that you are having fits over.  \n\nI've put over 150 hours into this game. Not because it's difficult to complete, although some of the campaign puzzles can really stretch your brain, but because I've wanted to \"beat\" the efficiency requirements to get all the achievements and develop better solutions.\n\nAlthough there is Workshop support, I haven't done any of the Workshop levels yet.

It just seems to be a very fine balance to work with. I just hope it does not get very tough and I can get my money's worth. The only thing that is a downside is the controls are a bit awkward to get used to and also the tutorials are just pictures which at times can be a bit confusing. If you get a hand of the controls and liked spacechem this game is a recommended purchase. I generally do not work on better solutions after completing but for those who like it there is the finshing chart which shows how well you did as in spacechem. There is some sort of story going on but I did not care about it and was only in for the puzzles.\n\nEdit: There is a mechanic introduced in the level called atropos station which made the game more like writing code with all the spatial constraints. Like flip flops I hated that introduction.

Give people all the abilities, teach them rules, and then let them play rather trying to make it a puzzle by changing the rules. \n\nAnd if you feel like you want a little more challenges, Zachtronics \"famous\" leaderboards return, you're graded on speed, how many blocks used, and how much space is used, and each stat is tracked individually, so if you master one and then lose that mastery, it remembers your best overall.  Those leaderboards really shine when you see a friend's name or realize there's a far better solutions that other people have figured out.\n\nThat's not to say this game is perfect, out of the three games, there's one thing that hurts these games.  There's a tutorial but it's limited.   There's great world building and explinations, except the explinations for items come a level AFTER you used them.  Oh... \n\nSo there's sign posts that let you know \"how to do things\" except, they're not clear.  At least the first one confused me, and I had no idea what I was doing wrong, I was getting items to the end point at the correct time, but I didn't weld them together.  What an idiot I was... \n\nI actually looked at a video online, figured out what I was missing and from that point I started to understand how the game works and the fact the game would give me items that I needed but only explain it after I used it.  So yeah that's a problem.  The first couple levels of this game were a bit rough, but then I was flying.\n\nThe other problem is the SAME problem that TIS-100 and spacechem have.  That are utterly fabulous games that give me so much joy.  But most people won't enjoy them. I love the challenge of Infinifactory, but I fully accept this is my own mentality.  I am a programmer, I like to program things.  If you're not looking for a puzzler, or don't find workflows or building factories that interesting, this isn't the game for you.  If you want to shut your brain off and just kill demons this is NOT the game for you.  If you get frustrated when something doesn't work and don't like the idea of debugging things, this is not the game for you.  \n\nHowever, if you like optimizing factories, or figuring out solutions that might be lacking in one area to improve another, oh my god you'll love this game.   For instance, it's common to solve the first puzzle with 40 blocks or more.  I found a solution for that first puzzle using 4 blocks.  That gave me a feeling of amazingness.  I not only solved it, I made it perfect.  Then I optimized it for speed and floor space, each one took a different solution and I still may be lacking the speed solution, but I love that feeling of trying to find the absolute optimal answer.   The pursuit of it is just amazing and the challenge of using the tools given to eek out a little more speed or just solve later puzzles is a blast. \n\nBut like I said with TIS-100 that's me, this is a very odd unique game that probably taps into some programming mentality of mine that makes me enjoy it, and if that doesn't sound that enjoyable.... well maybe this game isn't for you. \n\nAnd that's ok, but I still recommend this game, because this is the game for me, and I think it's just the absolute bomb.   It's enjoyable, interesting and deep without being too frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1508874288, "timestamp_updated": 1508874288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843230", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35945473": {"recommendationid": "35945473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025098153", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513793558}, "language": "german", "review": "Schlaues Spiel, typisch Zachtronics", "timestamp_created": 1508767387, "timestamp_updated": 1508767387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35913788": {"recommendationid": "35913788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056956593", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508658739}, "language": "english", "review": "The fact that I can't opt out of the scoreboards in any way makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable and I can't stand to play the game with them present.", "timestamp_created": 1508660028, "timestamp_updated": 1508660028, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.253075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35899690": {"recommendationid": "35899690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135844519", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508610836}, "language": "english", "review": "Makes me want to genocide little moles..... :( :pusherblock:", "timestamp_created": 1508611657, "timestamp_updated": 1508611657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501940", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35806718": {"recommendationid": "35806718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156708747", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1516069752}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this game right now.

There is no \"right\" way to solve a level, which allows you to be creative and to try out different ideas.  You can also compare your solution to others' via a few metrics to see how your solution stacks up.\n\nI found the levels to have a massive amount of replay value.  I enjoyed iterating on solutions to streamline them, looking at other peoples' solutions on youtube for inspiration, and revisiting older levels when I was a more advanced player.

provided by your alien bosses to build mechanisms that achieve results required for each scenario. So far (15 hours in), I found that objectives will either involve assembling multiple copies of some gizmo from scratch, or modifying/upgrading pre assembled gizmos that show up.\nThe game lets you loose without a lot of hand holding, which means there is a learning curve which people may respond differently to. You will know if you are adjusting well to that curve if you find yourself getting inspiration from what you did in prior scenarios, as you naturally develop your own arsenal of small solutions or sub-mechanisms. On the other hand, things are probably bad if you find yourself completely stomped and overwhelmed at each scenario with no idea on how to start.\nI would agree with those who say this is like Spacechem in 3D. If you haven't played that one, I highly recommend it. I found Infinifactory easier, but maybe that's because Spacechem has  somewhat conditioned me on how to think about solutions.\nOverall I find this is a great game.

I fully recommend it as a puzzle game, but I can't recommend it as a physics-based puzzle game.\n\nAs a puzzle game, it's got a lot going for it:  it's challenging without being too difficult (so far), it's logic-based, the controls are mostly intuitive, and it's even got sort of a story/lore with some decent humor.\n\nHowever, this game must take place in some alternate universe where the laws of physics aren't applied evenly, and that bugs me.  Since you're scored on how many blocks you use for your solution (with fewer blocks being better), you often have to come up with solutions to the puzzles that would not work in real life to get a good score.  For instance, if you need to make a structure that is three blocks wide, you only need to support one of those blocks with a conveyor belt, and it doesn't matter which one.  That means you could have a conveyor under the leftmost block with nothing supporting the middle or right blocks, and the whole thing will keep moving along the conveyor as though the center of mass is supported when it clearly isn't.  That diminishes the game somewhat for me, but I realize that's a personal preference and that not everybody will care about that, hence the split recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1501724853, "timestamp_updated": 1501724853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680025", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33806556": {"recommendationid": "33806556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013753434", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1515790304}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a mix of Portal and SpaceChem, for people who like Factorio, presented through a blocky Minecraft like medium.\nHow the hell can you not love that?", "timestamp_created": 1501067976, "timestamp_updated": 1501067976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33791982": {"recommendationid": "33791982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066523003", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501010576}, "language": "english", "review": "Superb puzzle game.

It had good potential and I could see how it could lay out but it just wasn't executed in a way that I liked.", "timestamp_created": 1492923823, "timestamp_updated": 1494677671, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.411416", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31305470": {"recommendationid": "31305470", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998822451", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492892685}, "language": "english", "review": "Zachtronics has a history of creating highly acclaimed conveyor / programming logic puzzles, ever since their cult hit SpaceChem. Their other games have been 2-dimensional, but Infinifactory brings the same formula into 3D. \n\nThe addition of 3rd dimension adds a whole lot more space for creating solutions, which can be both a good and a bad thing. Having more space can make solutions turn rather messy towards the end, where the conveyor belts can zigzag wildly among multiple levels of elevation, whereas 2D map restrictions forced a certain level of optimization to make the most of limited space. On the other hand, 3D offers far more possible solutions to any given puzzle, so wider range of players are able to find an answer eventually. \n\nThe campaign difficulty is decently challenging but not too hard. For the most part the game leaves you to figure out your own tactics and favourite setups with the blocks you're given, which you earn gradually while progressing in the story. The story is rather weak though, and only starts to open up later in the game. The game's also rather visually simplistic, which worked just fine for the 2D puzzle games but sticks out a little bit more in the 3D environment. Still, neither really bothers anyone who's simply absorbed in the puzzle solving.\n\nThe game tracks how well your solution was optimized, based on time, blocks used or how much space your factory takes. You can compare scores with your steam friends, or see where your score lands among the entire playerbase, so you can always go back and optimize your solution to compete for best scores. If you'd prefer more tangible goals besides score hunting, there's a good handful of achievements which require a certain score within certain levels, which often requires you to fully rethink your entire setup to complete.\n\nThis game is a solid entry in their library and I have no problem recommending to fans of puzzle games, but in my opinion this isn't quite as good as their other titles.

If you're familiar with Zachtronics' other titles and liked them at all, stop wasting your time reading this and run-do-not-walk to the \"buy\" button.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the genre or the other titles, let me put it like this: you're building a factory.  You get some collection of stuff in, and some tools (conveyor belts, welders, etc) which you arrange into a production line to build a specific requested product.  You have essentially infinite freedom for what to build, and the _first_ puzzle is figuring out how to make what you want.  \n\nThen things get a little OCD.\n\nEvery solution you build to a puzzle is scored on three factors: how fast you solved it, how many pieces you used, and how \"big\" your solution was (for a measure of bigness that is not worth trying to define here.)  And it shows you how well yours scored compared to other users who have played the game.  Even if you're not the competitive type, it's awfully hard not to look at the fact that someone else solved it in half the time, think \"That's impossible!  Well maybe if I...\" and look up 4 hours later from the ruins of your civilization to realize that you are now addicted to this game.  Often times optimizing your solution one way will make it hilariously inefficent according to one of the other two scoring factors, so you'll end up solving the same problem many times.\n\nThe game is also set in a quirky-but-dark setting with a nice touch of humour.  It doesn't impose on the gameplay much (yet) but it does add a nice tone.  The interface is quick and intuitive.  The music and art assets are well-done, and the support is nothing short of phenomenal - I emailed Zachtronics with an issue and got a response from the developer within minutes (not that you should expect that every time, but I was still impressed... especially since the issue was actually User Error.)\n\nThanks Zach!

I have played several other Zachtronics games before, so I knew this would be hard, but it is not as hard as I feared. I have played it about 20 hours now and I am through most of the first campaign, but I know that there is more to come and it will get more difficult. So far I had very few moments of frustration, though I had to take a break sometimes and think about a problem. I never felt the need to use online solutions, though it might be helpful to look at some of the user guides with some tips and tricks. In contrast to other Zachtronics games, I felt that the levels are quite large, so there is a lot of room for unelegant solutions, which still do the job.\n\nDue to the 3D the game is much more immersive than other Zachtronics games and I like that it feels like you are constructing factories to manufacture actual stuff, like spaceships, tanks and packaged meat. It runs very smoothly on my non-gaming notebook, looks pretty enough and the backgrounds are gorgeous. The music is nice and not distracting, good for long periods of concentration. The story or setting reminded me of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". It is funny and bizarre, but also sad at times. I really makes me want to know how it continues and I actually care for some of the characters (Floyd). However, I cannot judge how it will be in the later part of the game.\n\nIn the game you get different inputs and have to build a factory to create something as an output (for example a Sattelite). Otherwise you are given total freedom, so you can get really creative and in the end you are really proud of your own, personal solution. It is not a puzzle game in the sense that there is a predefined solution that you have to find, which is what I like about Zachtronics games. The puzzles (at least in the first campaign) feel all quite different, so it does not get repetitive. In some way it is like programming, because you can use sensors for kind of \"if then\" instructions: \"If there is a block at this position, active that pusher in that other location\". But you don't have to be a programmer, it is just some logic thinking. It's fun.\n\nFor the moment I will stop playing this game because I have an exam soon, which is why I am doing the review now.

Infinifactory is, simply put, SpaceChem in 3D. \n\nPros\n\n+ Challenging Gameplay\n+Finishing levels gives a great sense of satisfaction\n+The audio logs are very interesting\n\nCons\n-Game doesn't seem to know quite what its tone is supposed to be. The times when you interact with the aliens are funny and goofy, but the audio logs you find on the bodies of your predecessors are pretty dark and haunting. There's even a [spoiler] dead dog [/spoiler] within the first few levels. The uneven tone of the game doesn't take away from the gameplay, but I wish they had gone either serious or silly all the way/\n-Visually, not great. The visuals seem pretty utilitarian in their purpose. They show what you need to see with no bells and whistles. Lighting isn't great, either.\n-Music gets old fast, especially when spending a long time on a level. I usually play my own music unless I find one of the audio logs.\n\n\n\nIn spite of the cons I've listed, I would still highly reccomend it.

Every challenge gives you a set of building blocks and asks you to build a factory line that puts them together into a specific structure. The different factory parts at your disposal are so multifunctional that there's tons of ways to go about it. This doesn't make it easy - on the contrary, it's all about combining simple parts to perform complicated procedures! You feel like a genius engineer every time you solve a level.\n\nThe learning curve is exquisite. It starts off really gentle with a few levels just to get familiar with the mechanics, and slowely introduces new blocks throughout the game. It nudges you slowly towards realizing how the simple parts you're given can be combined to form incredible contraptions to solve even the most complicated engineering challenges. The later levels [i]really[/i] challenge you and will have you spending multiple hours on a single problem. You'll size up the challenge and decide it's best to divide the puzzle into puzzles, assembling parts of the final structure on several separate conveyor belts so you can tackle one problem at a time and put it all together at the end. There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of getting your own idea to work and then watch it go in a beautiful harmony of interlocking mechanisms of your own design.\n\nTook me 50 hours to complete every single level, and I haven't even started on the Steam Workshop content. Plus, if you like, you could go back and try to improve on your old solutions (you can compare your score with other players).\n\nThis isn't a game for people who like to fill in sudokus - this is a game that challenges you to find your own solution and think like an engineer.

The player will unlock more machine parts and mechanics as they progress.\nThe games interesting story is initially told through tape recordings that the player will find in different levels.\nThe levels seemingly easy but quickly get more difficult as the game progresses. There are many different ways in which to construct the different production lines in each stage and the player is rewarded for making their factory as efficient as possible. This game is sure to frustrate any player but they will be rewarded for their determination.\nThis game has elements from, and can be compared to, other games such as Factorio and Minecraft, but it is also very different from those games in other ways and is more than capable of being considered independent from those games.\n\n[h1]Positive Aspects[/h1]\n+Fun and interesting puzzle mechanics.\n+Excellent soundtrack.\n+Freedom to solve puzzles in different ways, with more efficient ways being rewarded.\n+Good story, however, the story does not [spoiler]at first[/spoiler] have a central role in the game.\n+Very relaxing, yet difficult gameplay. [i](opinion)[/i]\n+Workshop support for creating new levels.\n+Nice aesthetic.\n+Good learning curve.\n+Longer that it seems.

If you enjoy building contraptions in block-based building games, then you'll absolutely love this.

Blocks can only be rotated in the X/Y plane, which means that a lot of the functional blocks have two variants for side/top (but no bottom) which leads to some annoying building restrictions (Why can't my piston push up? Why can't my welder weld from below? Why can't my laser/eviscerator aim down?), but if full 3D rotation was present these extra blocks could be removed, and we would have a lot more options for building things. \n\nAlso, the tutorial is pretty much non-existent, and there's a lot of advanced building techniques that the game doesn't even hint about. Some players enjoy the trial and error of discovering this on their own (I do to some extent, but eventually it just got to be annoying when some of puzzles expected you to know an advanced technique, but didn't actually give you any hint whatsoever on what it might be), for everyone else, there's plenty of online guides.\n\nThe only real flaws I've seen are some performance issues (stuttering) and occasional crashes. The autosave system saves frquently enough though that I never really had any problems with losing anything.\n\nOverall, despite a few small issues, this is a great puzzle game and easily recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1487617292, "timestamp_updated": 1487617292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30050803": {"recommendationid": "30050803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003016494", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488045308}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredible game that makes you feel like a production line designer.

I'll just yammer out a bunch of reasons why:\n\n- There are several radically different solutions to many of the puzzles.\n- It's incredibly satisfying to watch your solution work.  Especially the big ones.\n- The mechanics are introduced fast enough to keep you engaged, but slow enough to be approachable.\n- The mechanics interact with each other in deterministic, but very emergent ways.\n- There are a _lot_ of puzzles.\n- The actual interface for building these factories is top notch.  The area select and toolbar kept even complex designs quite manageable.  The developer has clearly thought hard about user experience.\n\nIf you are here for a puzzle game, I cannot recommend Infinicatory enough.", "timestamp_created": 1482990766, "timestamp_updated": 1482990766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28768018": {"recommendationid": "28768018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138888841", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 1515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514046397}, "language": "german", "review": "Cooles Spiel welches Prinzipien von Programmierung verwendet (siehe auch SpaceChem).\n\nF\u00fcr jeden Programmieren oder Puzzler etwas.\nMan muss mit kargen Erkl\u00e4rungen und ausprobieren zurechtkommen - dann auf jeden Fall eine Kaufempfehlug!\n\nMehr Sprachen - wie Deutsch w\u00e4ren auch cool.", "timestamp_created": 1482962391, "timestamp_updated": 1483643367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28722243": {"recommendationid": "28722243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010026656", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482867985}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game, I recommend it to everyone that love to build intricate machines, it is always amazing when you finish a build to see it building the serie of products flawlessly, especially when you spent hours to design and tweak the mechanism.\n\nThe gameplay is rock solid and allows to do all sorts of non standard and creative mechanisms, like having separate structure with welders that floats in the air or using blocks in a circular treadmill to act as a clock.

Spacechem broke me and the thought that Infinifactory was harder put me right off. After getting this game from a bundle recently I was pleasantly surprised to find it completely accessible. People call it hard but it's not at all, every puzzle in the game can be easily brute forced to solve. If the abstraction of Spacechem scared you away I would definitely recommend this.\n\nThe real challenge, and fun, comes from trying to be as efficient as possible. Build a factory that works then go over it cutting out the fat and speeding it up. Or maybe try building a vertical compact factory, it might be slower but you'll have a much smaller footprint. Each level conviently gives you a chart that compares your results to the global stats. One factory I built is an order of magnitude faster than the global average which made my day! It also gives you a list of your friends who play the game showing you how your factories match up to theirs.\n\nAlternatively it can also be fun to build a factory as obtuse and whacky as possible. Why weld things the boring way on the ground when you can toss them in the air and weld them as they fall? My favorite is to move all of the single blocks as close to the output field as I can and weld everything at once before it gets picked up.

I can say that I fall under that category, and I thought it was fantastic. Due to its logical nature, Infinifactory is a game geared toward the same kind of people that enjoy programming; while playing, you'll likely find yourself using a lot of the same practices you might use when coding, such as building machines in \"sections\", optimizing, and debugging. It's also a great way to know if coding is something you'd enjoy or not; if you don't like this game you probably shouldn't try programming either. The game has plenty of content, and as an added bonus, if you have friends who play the game you can compete to see who can build the smallest and/or most efficient machine (which really adds some good replay value).\n\nBesides the fantastic and unique gameplay, the game has some pretty solid graphics and good, relaxing music. However, there's one thing about this game I find questionable, and that's the story. You've basically been \"captured\" by \"alien overlords\" who are forcing you to create these machines for them.

Of course, no one is going to play this game for the story, but I think the game would be a lot more polished if the story were to be completely overhauled or even removed entirely (I do in fact like the space setting of the game worlds, and I think the game would work out just fine without any story whatsoever).\n\nDon't let the stuff I said about the story turn you away from playing Infinifactory \u2013 it's still an amazing game, and I highly recommend it if you think you're up for the challenge (especially if you enjoy or are looking into programming).", "timestamp_created": 1476678412, "timestamp_updated": 1476678412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26080845": {"recommendationid": "26080845", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999957685", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510695870}, "language": "english", "review": "Scratches my programming itch, while still letting me be creative", "timestamp_created": 1476669825, "timestamp_updated": 1476669825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504341", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26059758": {"recommendationid": "26059758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061622350", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463723304}, "language": "english", "review": "It was included in the Montly Bundle and I wasn't sure I would like it, but then I couldn't stop playing.

Basically a great deal of the early puzzles can usually be solved by using the same solutions over and over with a few tweeks each time. But unlike other puzzle games where the point is just to solve the puzzle and how you do it isn't very important, Infinifactory asks you to get creative with your solutions. You are judged on how quick, efficient, or costly (number of parts used) your solution is and how difficult each puzzle is or much fun and enjoyment you get out of the game (especially the earlier levels) is based on how much you try to optimize your solutions. You can never optimize all three categories and the game doesn't expect you to since the categories aren't comparable. Is making the solution take 20 cycles longer worth reducing the power cost by 5? Who knows and who cares. You choose one category and try to max it. You'll also find that solving for one category asks you to solve completely different problems than solving for another so you can try switching it up if you ever feel like your solutions are getting stale. But more importantly is that when you try to maximize for something the specifics and layout of each level become much more relevant to your solutions. This can change the solution for each level drastically and will require that you do something different each time.\n\nThere is also a fourth category you can optimize and it's creativity. The game doesn't judge you on it but chances are if you're interested in Infinifactory you probably like the idea of building contraptions. Many times during a puzzle I would think to myself, \"I wonder if I can do this\" or \"Would that even work\" and I'd end up ignoring the categories and just building something that looked cool or was super intricate.

Care was clearly put into every aspect of this game. It looks amazing, and it's fun to play!\n\nI can't think of a single negative thing to say about Infinifactory. The puzzles slowly build up from blatantly obvious to extremely challenging, teaching you along the way how to use the tools you're given. Every so often you get a new block type that will allow you to take more control over how your machines work. The scoring system shows how well you do compared to everyone else in terms of number of how quickly your factory produces the output, the footprint of your factory, and how many machine blocks you used, but there is nothing wrong with making an overly complex or inefficient machine so long as the final product is correct. This makes the game accessible to a wide audience since it doesn't matter if your solution uses 20 blocks or 2000.\n\nThe key to Infinicatory's success is that it layers a bunch of simple mechanics that enable you to build complex and open-ended solutions to each puzzle. The blocks you have at your disposal are equivalent to a basic programming language. The puzzles are only as challenging as your creativity allows.

Although all three games are great, Infinifactory is in my opinion the best of the three.  The big difference is the three-dimensional aspect of it (Zachtronics' slogan is \"Like SpaceChem, but in 3-D!\").  The 2-D nature of SpaceChem and TIS-100 sometimes leads to situations where it's very hard to see how to proceed to a solution without completely gutting your existing one. In Infinifactory, because of the third dimension, you can usually kludge your way to a working solution if you put in enough time.  And that's where the brilliance of the game shines through: once you finish a level, you will get three histograms showing where your solution compares to other peoples' solutions in terms of speed, number of blocks, and total footprint.  If you've done a kludgy solution, you won't score well, and it will bother you to the point that you will eventually come back to make a better solution.  Elegance counts in Infinifactory, just like in real engineering!  (Sometimes I come up with better solutions while sleeping, and I have to rush to try them out when I wake up.)  So this game has massive replay value, more than any other game I've played.  Also, I find that TIS-100 and SpaceChem feel kind of dry and abstract after a while, but the more tangible nature of Infinifactory doesn't seem to have this problem.  There are only a small number of block types, but one of the delights of this game is that you are always finding new ways to combine blocks to form functional groups, which you then will use over and over again (starting by redoing all of your old solutions to use the new trick).  If this sounds like programming, it is!  If you're a programmer or an engineer, this game will be like crack to you.  It has the same \"feel\" as programming, but the actual tasks are sufficiently different that it's still new and exciting.  Pretty much the only negative thing I can say about Infinifactory is that you can spend way too much time on it if you're not careful.  Oh, and if you're an expert and manage to get through all the levels, there are also community levels to continue to torture your brain, or you can create your own.

It's the kind of puzzle game that presents you with a seemingly insurmountable task, and through only the basic systems presented it helps you experience that delicious eureka moment when everything clicks. I'm getting ahead of myself here, but it's hard for me to contain my admiration for everything Infinifactory accomplishes.\n\nYou play an unnamed human who gets abducted Fire in the Sky style by aliens. Instead of probing your tender orifices, however, they just task you with building factories for them. Every puzzle takes place in an exotic location with hatches that produce objects, and a platform that demands a finished product made from those objects. Your job is to use your infinite supply of factory blocks provided to combine, separate, and rescramble the input into the appropriate output. As I mentioned before, this can be anything from linking three boxes together to constructing a missile to breaking down a whale into packaged meat.\n\nThe beauty of this setup is that you have simple tools that can be spun into factories of infinite complexity. Your basic work blocks are things like conveyors and rotators and welders that get the job done. Added to this though are sensor-controlled pushers and blockers, destructive grinders and lasers, and even programmable counters once you get far enough in. The combination of these elements allows you to create meticulously-timed networks of shifting lines and presses that can produce satellites, starships, and even fully-furnished rooms. And consistency is important as well, because every puzzle requires you to produce not one but ten of the requested object. The amount of combinations possible also means that there is no one solution for any puzzle, but a vast array of elegant or brutish layouts to experiment with.\n\nDiscovering the full potential of your blocks through the campaign will take well over a dozen hours, spread across upwards of thirty puzzles that gradually ramp up in complexity. As you progress so too does the story, conveyed through audio logs, meetings with your alien overlords, and some quality environmental storytelling. I won't spoil what happens at the end of the campaign but I will stress that it is one of the most pleasant surprises I've had in recent memory, especially in the additional content it reveals. On top of this is a wide-open testing mode, a custom puzzle creator that lets you set up your own scenarios, and a fully-integrated Steam Workshop that lets you share and download user-created puzzles of surprising quality.\n\nHonestly I would be in love with Infinifactory if it had even a quarter of the content. There are few things as satisfying as watching a sprawling industrial complex churn out rovers or tanks in perfect rhythm, complete with hearty whirrs and clanks. The sound design deserves some special mention for the perfect effects and incredibly chill soundtrack (included free with the game!). And there's even an element of community with your solutions being rated against those of your friends on criteria like how fast they work and how much space they take up. This is a puzzle game that leaves nothing out, combining rock-solid design with excellent story, presentation, and spread of features. Infinifactory has easily claimed a place as my favorite puzzle game of all time, with a perfect balance of challenge and satisfaction.", "timestamp_created": 1470946303, "timestamp_updated": 1470946303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24779599": {"recommendationid": "24779599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072475166", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463099151}, "language": "english", "review": "It melts your brain until you remember that you can drop blocks in three dimentions, and gravity only matters to what you're producing.\n\nIts a puzzle game and it makes me cry.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1470674074, "timestamp_updated": 1470674074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550993", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24772411": {"recommendationid": "24772411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049452612", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470509382}, "language": "english", "review": "the food pellets taste good", "timestamp_created": 1470638028, "timestamp_updated": 1470638028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24768660": {"recommendationid": "24768660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038386303", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468633702}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm mixed. \n\nStory wise, I was playing through campaign and somewhat enjoying the subtle plot and gameplay.

You wake up on an Alien ship. You meet your new \"managers\" (Read; you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on).\n\n\nFrom your cell, you can access ever more difficult puzzles which requires clever thinking from you with blocks that do a variety of different things. Starting with conveyer belt blocks. Each new puzzle adds one or more new blocks to the mix, this added with increasingly complex end solutions required to move on. Think, I need these three blocks to meet somewhere and get wielded together at the right time and then get moved to the very end and so forth.\n\n\n\nI'm in no rush to finish this one. Half the fun is just trying to figure out a working solution. It's rare I play a puzzle game like this. I usefully tear down Professor Layton like games puzzle wise. Infinifactory on the other hand has me wanting to slow down and sort of savor the experience, instead. I would recommend this game to anyone who really likes puzzle games that have no one solution to any problem but complex enough that this becomes part of the challenge!\n\n\n\nThe interface is really smooth by the way. It's really easy to build, rotate and remove blocks quickly. Which is good because you will be doing a lot of this while also jet packing around the levels.\n\n\nWho would I not recommend this game to? \nSomeone who wants either a lot of story (it is there but sprinkled in with extremely dark humor) and or a lot of action (unless you find completely puzzles thrilling!). \n\n\nGraphically speaking, it\u2019s not bad, the word that comes to mind is clean with just a hint of cell shading around the edges. \n\nI get a lot of new games through the Humble Monthly Bundle these days (I just got out of college and things were tight for a while), that being said, if this game was on sale by itself I would've picked it up eventually, I had my eye on this one. First as a gift to Brian but also for myself to check it out at some point. It seemed quirky to me but in a good way. \n\nOh, and one last thing, the game naturally understands that there are many ways to go about solving each puzzle, beside each level you get three accompanying slots next to every puzzle for possibly (read; radically so) different solutions to the same one and it shows you how much more effective each one is from one another. So conceivable you could always come back and increase productivity of each puzzle.\n\n\nI know this must sound boring to someone out there but trust me when I say, as I get older learning how to effectively manage a pipe line becomes increasingly important and it tickles me to play something that sort of, if albeit in a more abstract way, reinforces this mind set.

You're tasked with building factories that must move, weld, rotate, lift, and destroy input blocks to match an output, and it must do this 10 times. The puzzles are all fun and challenging to solve, with a great learning curve as you progress. Each new set of puzzles adds a new block or game mechanic for you to work with, and so the game is kept interesting and fresh, and the feeling you get after completing a puzzle you've been stuck on is euphoric. The game also grades how well you did after you complete a puzzle against other players, making you want to improve your solution until you're better than everyone else.\n\nThe design of this game is fantastic and each setting for the puzzles manages to pull off a terrific atmosphere of loneliness and isolation. The factory blocks you build with are all very nicely designed, as are the input and output blocks. If I had one complaint about the design, it would be the information boards occasionally put in the puzzles to help you with how to use a new block (like in the 4th screen shot). Sometimes there's \"human\" symbols on them, such as a \"?\" or \"3x\". I mention this because your abductors clearly have no interest in learning your language, so why would they use symbols that you'd understand? I also want to mention that I love the soundtrack in this game.\n\nThe story. Hmm. Well, as I mentioned, you have been abducted by aliens, and they are enslaving you and putting you to work building factories that make useful things for them, and I really like it. Much like Portal, the story is more like a framework to give an excuse to solve puzzles, and not the other way around, and it works really well. The story is told simply. You meet your abductors at the beginning of the the game, and then at the end of each set of puzzles to recieve a reward from them, and each time they garble opressive sounding nonsense at you and then send you to your cell. The story is also told through failure logs on corpses you find scattered throughout the levels, and gradually this builds up the bigger picture of your overlords. The tone of this game reminds me most of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy: funny but with an looming sense of tragedy. The humour is very subtle, and I love it. BUT...\n\n[Spoilers after this point, scroll to the bottom if you want my conclusion] (I would do the black out text thing but I have no idea how)\n\nThis is ALL ruined when you get saved. Yes... I know... Being rescued is just the worst isn't it?\nAfter the last set of puzzles you're put infront of the overlords, and they present you with a reward as usual, but this time it's a bomb that a resistance group planted, and you are saved by them and put to work building ship parts etc.. needed for them to rescue more and then eventually go home. The puzzle quality doesn't drop, but the atmosphere and humour certainly does. That atmosphere of complete loneliness and isloation and opression that was created by the overlords is totally destroyed. The dead corpses and failure logs are gone, and are replaced by recordings from the resistance leaders, almost all of which I hate. The only tolerable character for me is Ortis, and you don't even meet him. The dark underlying humour is replaced with generic banter between the leaders and \"I'm so glad that you didn't die from that explosion when we saved you\" jokes. It's so difficult to say this but I hate the second half of the story. If you'd stayed under the opression of the overlords, but kept the same puzzles from the resistace campaign, you'd have a perfect game in my opinion. Maybe it could've been that the resistance did start to attack, and the overlords started forcing you to build things that would destroy the resistance trying to save you.\n\nMaybe the story bothers me a bit more than others, but it still remains that it annoys me.\nRegardless of this, I still highly recommend this game for the gameplay. It's a fun, challenging puzzle game and I guess that's all it really needed to be.", "timestamp_created": 1468352593, "timestamp_updated": 1489318559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24266537": {"recommendationid": "24266537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168711833", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 409, "last_played": 1516515491}, "language": "english", "review": "Even for the price, this game is great.

The key skill in this game is visualizing and manipulating objects in 3d space, and arranging all the inputs in the assembly process in proper orientation and sequence to complete your project.  Some of your tools are conveyer belts, pushers, sensors, welders, rotators, elevators, and demolishers, and I know there are some more, but I'm only 31 hours in so there's a couple blank tools I haven't seen yet.  Up to this point I've eagerly approached each puzzle, and only really had a couple major setbacks that required complete rebuilds.  You are able to optimize on different vectors including speed, # of parts used, and something else that I can't recall presently ;-)\n\nCompared to Zachtronics game Spacechem (which I also enjoyed), I think the puzzles in this game play out in a bit more \"fun\" way than the puzzles in Spacechem.  In Spacechem I found myself staring at the screen trying to find a devise a solution for a long time - and then \"bang\" the moment of enlightenment would come.  Infinifactory is different in that its more a series of small steps that gradually lead you to completion, although you do have to plan holistically the entire way.  The third dimension also provides interesting flexibility in builds also.\n\nThe levels are beginning to get a bit difficult for me - I've stalled out on one of the meat preperation levels (the one with the whale) - and this is the first one that I've been hesitant to go back to because the solution looks a bit messy to me so far, it's sortof difficult to see what's happening,  and I have to carefully plan out my cuts on paper to maximize yield.  It's the first level that I haven't been drawn back to so far, but I'll get back to it soon enough.\n\nAnyhow, yes I recommend this game.  It's one of the best puzzle games I've played.   My one suggestion is that I wish there was a straightforward way to insert a logical \"AND\" into the sensors to require multiple conditions to be true before an action is carried out.  That can be overcome vie less straightforward means usually dependent upon timing, but its seems in several places I was wishing I could insert an \"AND\" condition and not worry about it so much.\n\nYes, I recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1465814040, "timestamp_updated": 1465890411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23521650": {"recommendationid": "23521650", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967750384", "num_games_owned": 792, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513990515}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and challenging, I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1465743529, "timestamp_updated": 1465743529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485830", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23500322": {"recommendationid": "23500322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041457591", "num_games_owned": 927, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 1346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468561171}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this on May's humble bundle and was intrigued by it...ironically enough [i]despite[/i] it being by the makers of Spacechem. You see...I didn't like that game. It had potential, but had lots of things dragging it down. And with the premise here being somewhat the same but in 3D (take this input and build this), I was cautious: would this suffer the same fate?\n\nI can be blunt: absolutely not. Infinifactory is IMHO much, MUCH better. In what way? I'm glad you asked... :-)\n\n-despite it being 3D, building and placement is intuitive and straightforward. There's a minimal time between the \"I want to build [i]this[/i]\" and actually placing it. At first I thought this game would work better in an isometric perspective (think the first rollercoaster tycoons), but I'm not sure anymore. In any case: it works for the use you want to make of it.\n-much more aesthetically pleasing, even to the point of too much. Someone certainly had fun creating beatifull skylines and wide open floating space platforms. Why are we building a production line of missiles on a sharp mountain top? No reason other than \"Because We Can!!!\". But hey: video game.\n-nice soothing music. And for puzzle games like this, this is a huge plus.\n-decent difficulty. In spacechem, I felt like being thrown into the deep water soon after the intro levels. Thus far, the difficulty progresses much better (though don't kid yourself: levels remain challenging)\n-interface is clean and simple\n-perhaps due to things already mentioned, but I really feel like \"just doing stuff\" in this game. I like to try, see what works and even love to see how my own best-laid plan turns out completely wrong due to me not understanding e.g. how conveyor belts handle larger block chunks. There's no one single solution, but this game enables you to just trow things at the wall and see what sticks. :-)\n\nOn the story, I'm not completely sold. Despite audio logs and occasional performance reviews by aliens who captured you, I just don't feel really engrained in it. It's in no means bad and occasionally funny, it just doesn't connect to the actual gameplay. Then again, there are hardly games you play just for the story to begin with. ;-)\n\nI could name a few other nitpicks (like no toggle fast(er) forward button, or the jumping which is useless with infinite jetpack ammo), but that would only distract from the message that this is an absolutely great puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1465643542, "timestamp_updated": 1465643542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23499712": {"recommendationid": "23499712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075742770", "num_games_owned": 1822, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465765434}, "language": "english", "review": "More i play this game, less i feel like a clever or at least average.\n\n In fact i feel like a re-tard Einstein.

I am thinking basically, that's another problem. \n\n This game will give you some frustrating experience and brain damage but in fact you will be happy when solve puzzles and complete your first chapters. Hardtimes awaits you :p Even in the first or second chapters, you can get frustrated and after 3/4 it becomes ever more complexity game. (There is a lot of chapter so... I can say that i quit at around %10 of the game)\n\n Since this is one of the most complex puzzle game with such great musics and ost also gameplay mechanics, I would recommend this game to all puzzle lovers and hard thinkers. I grabbed this game from Humble Monthly so it's a shame that I am not one of these (Still, I've played and manage to beat Antichamber,Portal,Talos Principle etc. lulz) Since i can feel like a retard, i will cry in my empty dark place.\n\n But there is a thing that makes this games almost perfect. The gameplay and mechanism. It's easy to make levels with creator (cuz the gameplay is pretty simple actually. It's all about the blocks and some pipes.) and share it via Steam Workshop. You always can play other players' level and get even more brain damage. \n Another thing is this game has Steam cloud and your save files will be pretty safe. Leaderboards, achievements and great level editor support is so nice for a game like this.\n Although gameplay is simple and great it's complex in itself. Some puzzles could require high amount of time. Some are seems like easy but you still spend more than 1 hour.\n There is no actual bugs, clean gameplay and clean 60 fps. Graphics are not the best but looks quite nice.\n\nSince spacechem is super-hard, this game is no surprise at all.

Period. In my opinion, a good puzzle needs to meet three conditions:\n\n1. It must require hard thinking to solve \n2. It must not be frustrating when no immediate solution can be found\n3. it must make you feel smart when a solution IS found. \n\nThe first point is pretty obvious, since most people play puzzle games  in order to think. point 2 is the reason I don't like puzzles as a genre; almost all puzzles can only be solved in one exact way, and if I am not thinking in the super unorthodox and particular way the author deems to be correct, I cannot solve it, and that is frustrating to me. Point 3 is the most important. I can accept some frustration if I end up feeling good when I finallly solve the puzzle. However, again almost all puzzles I have tried make me feel like an idiot for not seeing the solution quicker, when in fact the solution was by design arbitrary and for the lack of a better word, \"stupid\".\n\nEnter Infinifactory. 1. Infinifactory is hard! I have sat at a single puzzle for literally 3 hours scratching my head trying different solutions only to be foiled by something. It requires three-dimensional visualization and thinking. It requires both hard thinking and creativity in order to solve. \n\n2. The aforementioned puzzle I tried for 3 hours didn't feel like 3 hours. I decided to play the game for 20 minutes one night before bed, and 3 hours later I realize it has not been 20 minutes. I then continued for another 3 hours (I didn't need sleep *cough*). Infinifactory lets you constantly make progress towards a solution, even when I largely have to start over and delete what I did. It does this by naturally building off of previously done things, and requiring you to combine many small solutions into a coherent whole. \n\nFinally, 3. Infinifactory makes me feel like a ****ing mastermind mechanical engineer and PhD in quantuum mechanics that just solved nuclear fusion when a factory I built works and works beautifully. I have  never rage quit this game once, since even failing is fun. Seeing the factory being built as it becomes more and more complex is satisfying and inheritantly lets you want to continue and not get frustrated. I would recommend this at 5x the price. \n\nTL;DR: It is fun to struggle to a solution even when it takes hours to get there.", "timestamp_created": 1463223146, "timestamp_updated": 1463223146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676254", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22955913": {"recommendationid": "22955913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188515021", "num_games_owned": 1306, "num_reviews": 290, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463351898}, "language": "english", "review": "Aliens forcing you\nto be smarter and work harder\n\nsounds about right", "timestamp_created": 1463151237, "timestamp_updated": 1463151237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22926967": {"recommendationid": "22926967", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970931517", "num_games_owned": 1174, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463586524}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uafc0\uc7bc", "timestamp_created": 1463062877, "timestamp_updated": 1463062877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22924845": {"recommendationid": "22924845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008085086", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1515861124}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043a, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b!", "timestamp_created": 1463052081, "timestamp_updated": 1463052081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22924370": {"recommendationid": "22924370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088522314", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477207376}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Pros- [/h1] [list]\n[*]Very well designed puzzles\n[*]Unique concept\n[*]Great graphics with low system requirements\n[*]Dark Humor(pro for me, may be a con for others) Oddworld-esque\n[*]Decent V/Os\n[*]Easy to understand\n[*]Blocks are place-able from large distances.

But you won't get bored, as there are frequent twists that can wreck your initial plans and make you consider a reset; sometimes the pieces don't fit together as you expected. When a new mechanic is introduced, expect to spend some time figuring out the nuances. Best of all, as you solve the sub-puzzles of a given level to your liking, your sub-solutions will play and re-play in the background as you continue working on the remaining pieces, which can be oddly satisfying. The score statistic histograms add some replay value for optimization.\n\nYou can't die. Timing matters for machines but not player actions. Small mistakes are easily fixed for no penalty. The UI is nicely polished. There's a darkly comedic backstory that intrigues without getting in the way (warning, includes mentions of harm to animals).

You essentially create a machine out of blocks/parts that each do a different thing, one block might be a conveyer belt while another is a sensor that can be connected with yet another block that pushes blocks in front of it whenever the sensor activates.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are simple and very easy to understand. But to create a machine that produces the goal product can be very hard and requires both logic and intelligence. You will feel very rewarded once you finally succeed. But don't think it is over yet, you will be scored and compared to other players based on how small your machine is, how fast it can build and how many parts/blocks you used for it. You will feel an urge to go back and improve upon it if your score is not to your satisfaction.\n\nDue to the nature of the game it means that for each puzzle there's basically an endless amount of solutions. This gives you a lot of freedom which many other puzzle games lack. In fact, you can save up to 3 machines for each puzzle, this way you can experiment with your current machine without losing anything, you can even try and optimize it for production while neglecting its size and parts.\n\nI'll definitely recommend you pick this up if you enjoy puzzles and logical thinking.", "timestamp_created": 1451201558, "timestamp_updated": 1451201558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461538", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19972289": {"recommendationid": "19972289", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971610972", "num_games_owned": 1010, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462717372}, "language": "english", "review": "Caught me by surprise.

It's a genius example of puzzle design, really, in a style somewhat reminiscent of The Incredible Machine. You're given a specific input and output, sometimes a few special pieces in the middle, and set loose to design your madcap assembly line. There's no right answer, just whatever produces the desired product without causing a broken pileup along the way. You are then given a numeric breakdown of your carbon footprint, blocks used, and cycles (length) taken, on a bar graph showing average global player scores for that level. I think that's also brilliant, because you aren't competing for any specific \"S Rank\" conditions (although there are some achievements to that effect), you're just shown how you stack up to the player average and left to decide for yourself if you want to try to go back and optimize things just that little bit more...\n\nLevels often look daunting at first glance, but as prodded at will usually unravel gradually as you work out where to put piece buffers, delay gates, and so on. Failing that, you can always go look at some other player builds, which in recreating you will come to understand the fundamental components thereof. Even by cheating you're learning to play the game better.\n\nThere's also a more sandboxy set of levels available, and a built-in GIF recorder for showing off your solutions.

In theory perhaps but in practice it's devious, dastardly and downright mind boggling at times. There are many ways to approach each puzzle, forcing you to think laterally and often creatively about how you'll tackle it. I've been taking it slowly, doing one or two puzzles a night and my brain has been loving every minute of it. As the levels progress the puzzles become more complex, forcing you to think up new and better ways to perform parts of the overall task, and gradually increasing your arsenal of available tools to do it with.\n\nWhat really puts the icing on the cake is the great sense of accomplishment upon solving each puzzle.

You are presented with a bunch of input parts, and it's up to you to move and weld them in order to match them to the desired output. The factory that you put together to accomplish this purpose needs to synchronize the movement of all these individual pieces such that they interact cleanly, and don't accidentally push a piece one tile off and suddenly you have a massive traffic jam. Unlike some puzzle games, you're not stuck bashing your head trying to find the one and only solution - you're finding out how to make your own solution work.\n\nFor those who have played SpaceChem, you'll be right at home with these concepts. For those that haven't, I highly recommend you try the free demo for SpaceChem and see how you like that.\n\nI find the difficulty in Infinifactory to be much more forgiving than in SpaceChem. You will never run out of room to come up with your solution - you have all the room in the world to make your solution as inelegant and bulky as possible if that's what it takes to make it work. Of course, the major appeal is still optimization. There are 3 categories to optimize for - complete the desired output in as little runtime as possible, use the least amount of vertical real estate, or use as few factory blocks as possible. The beauty of those optimized solutions is really what gives a great feeling of accomplishment to the players.\n\nAs detailed, the gameplay is extremely solid.

So this review might be a bit biased, but I\u2019ll try to be as objective as I can.\n\nOk, first off: what is Infinifactory?\n\nIn Infinifactory, you build a factory out of blocks around input blocks, which you combine, wield and modify in order to obtain the output block (or structure) that you have to move to the output pad. This description doesn\u2019t give justice to the game, I think other Steam reviews are way better at explaining the core of the game, but I\u2019ll expand on more detailed elements of the game.\n\nInfinifactory is better described as a [i]puzzle game[/i], because of the way the game is structured: you have a problem, and you have to provide a solution to it. But it is a [i]puzzle game[/i] in a way you have never seen before (at least if you didn\u2019t play another Zachtronic game, such as [i]SpaceChem[/i] or [i]TIS-100[/i]). In the sense that you don\u2019t have a unique, inelastic solution that you have to figure out by trial and error or logic: you build your factory from the ground up, with as much (if not more) freedom as if you were playing Minecraft, but with only functional blocks. This is why I love this game so much: each puzzle have literally a near infinite ways to be solved, and each solutions has its flaws and advantages. You can strive for the most elegant factory, or maybe you want something compact and minimize the footprint count, possibly, you can go for optimisation, or you just want to get done with the puzzle and unlock the next one. Each one of those building style will lead to drastically different factories and unique dynamic problems and challenges that you create for yourself, because you are masochistic and want to be higher ranked on the leaderboard.\n\nMany people compare this game to programming, because the way problems happens and how you solve them is comparable to programming. As you progress into the game, you\u2019ll have to remember technics that you learned on easier puzzles and use them in combination with other new technics, or adapt them to the new terrain and the new parts you are presented with.\n\nWhen you build a factory, you can test it with the \u201cplay\u201d button and easily figure out where your factory goes wrong (if it goes wrong, which it will, unless you are the incarnation of God on earth) because the game mechanics are based on 3D space and very simple predictable physics. It leads to you being able to judge what happens in the factory and build it based on your visual representation of what could happen.\n\nOk, now I won\u2019t talk too much about the rest of the game, because the puzzles are where the meat and body of the game lies. In terms of graphics, it is good enough to be pleasing to the eye. In terms of story, it is good enough and minimalistic enough to not be distracting, and the music is soothing. All of that is the perfect storm to build a calm atmosphere which let you focus on the puzzles and building your factory 100% without losing your mind or being annoyed at all. Which is probably what puts this game over the top for me.\n\nThere is Workshop support: that means you can download custom puzzles made by other people and solve them in your way. There is some really good ones, and it would be a shame to miss on them. You can also build your own maps with the in-game map editor. This one is basically a Minecraft on steroid, since the game style is voxel based, so it is easy enough, once you get how to reach your favourite blocks, to build your own puzzles.\n\nSo why is this game so little popular? My guess is on the price tag: it seems a lot for an \u201cindie\u201d game, and people just don\u2019t buy it. But look at my playtime, I have played Infinifactory for about 67 hours.

I fear I will never be able to do the game justice, so here goes with a short review as ideas simply pop into my head!\n\nAs you can notice from my first parapgraph I think extremely highly of Infinifactory.  For some time I was searching for a puzzle game with great replayability.  I heard about and played Spacechem, which is an impossible game not to mention when reviewing Infinifactory.  Both are developed by Zachtronics and both employ identical mechanic, but Spacechem is in 2D and Infinifactory is 3D.\n\nThe essence of the game is to take some materials as an input and manipulate them via building a machine/factory from different types of blocks to conform to the required output.  So you may have to rotate and weld two different types of blocks together or receive a broken item, remove the broken parts and replace them with good parts.  The variety of puzzles is very good and you don't feel like you're repeating the same processes during your progression.\n\nThe beauty of both games is that each puzzle can be solved in maybe an infinite variety of ways, so once you have made a solution you can go back and attempt to streamline various factors of your machine : footprint, cycles and blocks used.  Very similar to engineering projects in the real world!  \n\nHopefully some of your friendlist will also play the game as in game leaderboards are included for each puzzle to further the replayability.  There are slots to save three of your machines for each of the puzzles, so you can purpose build a machine for each of the scoring criteria e.g focus one machine solely on having the smallet footprint possible even if it is at the expense of being less efficient and having an increased cycle count.\n\nI'm approaching 60 hours into the game and I am half-way through the second campaign of the two.  I've gone back and fine-tuned a few of my older machines and completed a couple of the community made puzzles.  There are literally hours and hours of gameplay available.  I'm generally not a \"sandbox\" type of guy either so Zachtronics have definietly managed to include the magic ingredient with this one.\n\nA lovely feature of the game is to be able to export animated gifs from a static camera point of your working machine, which will loop infinitely.  It can be very satisfying to construct a particulaly nice process within your factory and watch it loop over-and-over.\n\nThe game has a slightly comedic and quirky story that holds the levels together and they progress in difficulty at a nice rate.  The levels get a bit easier when you start the second campaign and then begin to ramp up again!  There are some tough levels which may put off a few people that don't enjoy a mental challenge.  I found myself trying to solve some of the puzzles in my head whilst at work!!\n\nThis is one of my favourite games of 2015 so the question of whether I recommend it is not a tough one at all!!  It's easily worth the full price, I bought the game in a sale and feel a little ashamed for doing so!", "timestamp_created": 1449311127, "timestamp_updated": 1449342170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760073", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19496110": {"recommendationid": "19496110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013662416", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496288795}, "language": "english", "review": "Spacechem in 3D!!!", "timestamp_created": 1449307568, "timestamp_updated": 1449307568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19410967": {"recommendationid": "19410967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008115616", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472379803}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u679c\u7136\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4e70\u5427\uff0c\u53cd\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e48\u4fbf\u5b9c", "timestamp_created": 1448972926, "timestamp_updated": 1448972926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19409647": {"recommendationid": "19409647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051951897", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450101667}, "language": "english", "review": "Veeeeery nice!", "timestamp_created": 1448967388, "timestamp_updated": 1448967388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19403725": {"recommendationid": "19403725", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970760320", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512768019}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr - great game that will keep you awake and keep you interested. 10/10\n\nFantastic Puzzle Game.

Selbst, das schon recht komplexe, SpaceChem kann da nur noch weinend bei zuschauen, wie ich eine Fabrikationskette nach der andere zusammen schustere und einen Fehldruchlauf nach dem anderen produziere. Aber jeder Fehler im System fordert mich heraus diesen aufzusp\u00fcren und zu eliminieren; nur um mich mit einem fragenden Blick dem n\u00e4chsten vermurksten Objekt hinterher winken zu lassen.\n\nWas Zachtronics hier zusammengebastelt hat ist eine wahre Wunderwaffe um den Gehirnzellen mal richtig einzuheizen. Erstaunlich ist vor allem die Minimalistik mit der das Spiel auskommt. Nicht nur das die Grafik nicht gerade eine Augenweide ist und der nette, aber doch recht belanglose Soundtrack, zu monoton wummernden Maschinen leise im Hintergrund vor sich hindudelt; nein, es ist auch die Minimalistik im Spieldesign die von der ersten Sekunde an  fasziniert. Mit sehr wenigen Bauteilen, wobei die Limitierung hier nicht auf der Anzahl sondern auf der Auswahl liegt, soll ich ein Objekt erstellen, welches auf dem ersten Blick mit den gegebenen Mitteln unm\u00f6glich zu bauen ist.\n\nUm das etwas genauer zu veranschaulichen zitiere ich hier einiger meiner Gedankeng\u00e4nge:\n\n\"Wie zur H\u00f6lle soll das gehen?\" \n\n\"Wo ist das schei\u00df Teil mit dem ich die Steine nach oben dr\u00fccken kann?\"\n\n\"Das ist unm\u00f6glich!\"\n\n\"Ah, hm....\"\n\n\"Ich k\u00f6nnte ja das mal auspro....\"\n\n\"Ah, das k\u00f6nnte klappen...\"\n\n\"Hm, shit.

Its a sweet premise: Design the factory that machines the goods, and does them perfect again and again. You get a real sense of process and possibility, coming up with an A.) succesful and B.) efficient conveyer belt and fusing and manipulating path to achieve this. I wish more games could offer an emotive, plot-logical place of real, creative problem solving. It seems alien invaders like Vogons have kidnapped you and many others. You are crowd-sourced for the automated, efficient assembly of machinery, perhaps for the invasion of your own planet. It bares some similarities to this project, harnessing the human brain for a problem computers can't figure out: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/09/19/pc-gamers-save-the-world-a-bit/\n\nYou encounter the remains and optionally the audiologs of the failed characters left behind on most jobs. Once the cat is out of the bag they seem mostly to only be able to add texture to the story, but its a great story anyway.\n\nPlaying it, I use parts of my brain that are hard to tap. The puzzle game genre doesn't otherwise offer this kind of thorough, creative satisfaction. When learnt your creations can really come alive, consuming and outputting. Its like a language, like you've absorbed some spirit of programming by stealth. I think the design is splendid on all the levels, and when I think of the choices made to make such complexity intuitive and inviting it seems genius. Its so unlike the many degrading, addictive games that tempt us to distraction and numbness. I don't regret time spent with Infinifactory, and Its not like having my head buried in the sand, rather I come away feeling somehow better equipped to deal with life's problems. \n\nThis opens the door of gaming for so much more, and at the same time as this innovation its definitely a game in the mechanical sense of a voluntary ruleset, manifestly challenging, that you struggle to perform better in, like a living parable. Unlike some missed opportunities nowadays which seem to dismiss this element as beneath them, or just not them (unworried by the essential concept of false advertising). Its something of a masterclass in that regard. \n\nI imagine it could be an amazing layer or part of the loop in something larger. Civ or Eve or Besieged or Kerbal Space Program or PlanetSide 2 or even Minecraft. Though I know its rude to state such things, crafting everywhere else seems really lacklustre, pithy and abstract now. This would have to be late game, jetpack-fuelled crafting in most settings, but my god! But then I think this with some action stage would EAT MY LIFE. As it stands, and if what you've gathered appeals, its a great investment.

Or whatever gets the job done.\n\nOn the more difficult puzzles, the magnitude of what is required by the puzzle can make solving it take over an hour, easily. There is a certain threshold of patience, that if you can commit enough time and thought to that problem, you should be able to get it done after a while.

A lot of the annoying parts of SpaceChem have been stripped out -- the controls are much smoother now, and the silly interface of arrows and reactors is completely gone. If you like engineering games or the concept of SpaceChem, even if you didn't like SpaceChem, you'd enjoy this one.\n\nThe game does a great job building in complexity over time. A few levels feel like you're just doing the same thing over again, but I was impressed with how many levels presented a new concept, given the simplicity of what you're doing. Nor did anything get too hard, too fast; each new element added had tons of use cases, and each puzzle usually explored one of these use cases to the fullest possible extent. I felt like an expert at the end of the game, and levels that had taken me a while initially turned out to be really easy when I went back to them.\n\nAfter a while, there's seemingly not much that can be added to the game other than asking you to build ever greater and more complex structures out of the cubes you're given. Thankfully, the game stops just short of getting boring, then gives you a lot of new toys to play with (via the DLC) and a bunch of difficult puzzles, then gracefully bows out. It's free, so it feels like a warm \"Thank you so much for playing -- play these if you still want stuff to do\". The DLC feels pretty tedious (especially the laser levels), but even that's something I might appreciate in a few months if I ever want to play again.\n\nThe achievements are exactly how achievements should be -- not too annoying, but requiring you to play a little bit creatively to get. The game took me about 12 hours to beat, but it was so much fun and I'm honestly glad it didn't drag on longer than it should have.

Given parts, build a factory which assembles the parts into a final product. New tools are introduced one at a time, and there is just enough help given to the player to get them going. Obstacles and pitfalls arise naturally forcing the player to think of creative workarounds. I found the final puzzles very challenging, but neither frustrating nor insurmountable. Solving the finale was pretty satisfying!\n\nStory\nUnlike Spacechem, whose story was as cold and unforgiving as space, Infinifactory's storyline includes some subtle humor, as well as voice acting and interaction with physical characters. To me, the introduction of humor was a bit awkward at first, especially since it still retained elements of the same grim tone as Spacechem, but it was easy to get used to.

It takes something truly compelling for me to spend hours, sometimes days at the end, perfecting a single puzzle, and yet I have never felt frustrated.  This is a game that truly earns the description 'engaging.' \n\nEverything that happens in this game is because you made it, and you need to have your brain firing on all cylinders to make it through. But fear not, any new players considering this game: the mechanics are easy to approach and you'll be hooked in no time.  Players who have enjoyed any other game by Zachtronics (like Spacechem or TIS-100) or who like similar games with similar mechanics (Factorio, Big Pharma,  even the city-builder games by Impressions) will absolutely love Infinifactory, but I think anyone willing to giving Infinifactory a chance will love it too.\n\nIn this quick review, I'll discuss the gameplay of Infinifactory, it's aesthetics, and try to answer why I've been unable to put this game down. \n\nThe gameplay is simple: from a certain point at the start of each stage, a series of inputs regularly pop out a component-usually a single box, but other times a more complex shape.  From there, the goal is to simply combine these inputs to meet at the output area, and repeat this ten times.  The player has a number of tools at their disposal, from simple conveyor belts and welders, to parts that push and destroy.  With these parts, all sorts of advanced operations may be performed- advanced techniques even allow players to build 'circuits' from these simple parts.  A later level may resemble a factory made by a mad scientist, full of pipes and blocks, with piecies whirring and whizzing by, only just avoiding disaster.\n\nInfinifactory has pleasing visuals, notable for its sturdy blocks and the orange and blue color scheme of its factory parts.  The environemnts are colorful, vidid, and distinctly not of this world. The screen shots do a better job describing what it looks like than I can, but as you can see, there are a great number pleasant and varied stages, and for the most part, there feels like a good variety of factory components, too. \n\nThere is an interesting story being told, usually through voice logs and a handful of scripted sequences that set the stage for Infinifactory's otherworldly visuals. In many puzzle games, even those that do try to tell a story, the gameplay has no relation to the story. Here, there's a [i]reason[/i] why you're building things- and you may not exactly be doing it of your own free will. The story's tone is quirky, with a grinning undercurrent of black humor.  There are a few twists and turns along the way that delighted me.  I found that a nicely written story like this helped ground the events and kept me interested.\n\nPuzzles in this game have a wonderful quality where the final output seems simple, yet constructing it from its individual components can be deceptively challenging.  There's a smooth difficulty curve, with tools introduced gradually and new techniques being learned organically as more challenging puzzles are introduced. By the time I'd beaten the game, I found that I could go back to puzzles that took me 90 minutes to solve and beat them in 20 minutes, with a much better score as well.  \n\nAt the end of each puzzle, the player is ranked according to three criteria: how fast the puzzle was, how many blocks it took to build, and how much space it took up.  I like the way that this scoring encouraged me, because it was rare that I hadn't done well in at least one category.  This system encourages different styles of play-those who (like me) enjoy sprawling, messy solutions that strive to be as fast as possible, or those who favor a more restrained, elegant design.  \n\nThe game comes with a capable level editor that's integrated into the Steam Workshop. Already, tons of user-made levels are available for play. In my experience, though, few have stacked up against the levels in the campaign.  Most are based around gimmicks or some other novel use of the mechanics.  Sometimes this is successful, but overall I haven't found it as satisfying. That said, I can't claim to have explored the workshop throughly, or to have attempted to create any levels of my own.\n\nThe true joy in this game comes from the sense of owning each solution you make. There's no single way to solve each puzzle-there are hundreds.  After completing a particularly challenging puzzle, I've often looked up how others have solved theirs- not once has my solution resembled someone else's. \n\nI never had the feeling, like I often do with puzzle games, that I was fighting with the developer to find the 'right' way to solve the problem.  Instead, Infinifactory simply gives its players a handful of tools and asks, \"Why don't you build something interesting?\"\n\nI think it's the mark of a great puzzle game that I have enjoyed my failures as much as my successes.  I have looked back at puzzles that took me hours to solve, and even though the final result was a swollen, creaky machine, I can remember all the hurdles and struggles it took for me to create my solution and think, \"Yeah, I built that.\"", "timestamp_created": 1440981059, "timestamp_updated": 1442021238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.752981", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17791958": {"recommendationid": "17791958", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970406475", "num_games_owned": 1421, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468518800}, "language": "english", "review": "Another sublime \"programming\" game from the mad genius who brought us SpaceChem.

You have to build a production line out of conveyer belts, welders, pistons, sensors, etc that can repeatedly turn the ipnuts into the outputs. All this is done in a Minecraft-like world of cubes (and the guy who created this game also created Infiniminer, which was a major inspiration for Minecraft).\n\nOnce you've solved the puzzle, you get three little graphs that show you how your solution compares to the solutions of all the other players in terms of how quickly it produces the required output, how many blocks you used, and how much space it took up. Then (if you're like me) comes the fun part: optimize, optimize, optimize, and try to get the best possible score in each of the metrics (most likely with three different solutions).

Primarily, it is not a game about finding the goal: what you start with, and what you end with, are both given to you. It is up to the player to turn the input into the output, and to do so, they must design a machine to solve the level. It is not a game about building things; in a very abstract way, it is a game about programming. Just like SpaceChem and TIS-100. And a few Flash games, mostly made by the Zachtronics themselves. It's a very barren market; you owe it to yourself to play at least one of them, if you like puzzles. And Infinifactory is, by far, the easiest to recommend.\n\n\"Like SpaceChem, but 3D\" is not an inaccurate description. It is very much about taking a collection of parts, each with a very simple job (move a block, turn a block, detect a block) and stringing them together to make outputs. But Infinifactory demonstrates a key difference to SpaceChem: it's not as aggressively difficult. It is impossible to understate just how difficult SpaceChem becomes at the later levels; so difficult, that it's hard to even find enjoyment from the frustration. And you can take the developer's word for it: in the postmortem, Zach Barth described SpaceChem as having \"an oppressive 40+ hour difficulty curve that only 2 percent of players reach the end of.\"\n\nInfinifactory manages to provide all the satisfaction of SpaceChem, without the progress-denying difficulty. And it is not due to a lack of difficult levels; the game introduces many new mechanics at a regular rate, and it makes use of all of them. The more forgiving difficulty comes as a result of more subtle design choices; there's the obvious increase in player options by having a third dimension, but Infinifactory also never forces the player into a confined space. The actual construction zone in SpaceChem was always tiny, but you are never at a loss for space in Infinifactory. Combined with having a lot more tools, this means the player can solve any level using a vast number of approaches, and will almost certainly be able to make that method work if they keep at it. I would posit this as a very good thing.\n\nThe story of the game is dissimilar to SpaceChem and TIS-100 in that it is surprisingly straightforward. Both of their other games dabble in a Lovecraftian-esque sense of mystique, stories that tease you with the unknown, often even making the player uncomfortable even as they desperately want to have the answers. Infinifactory's story has its twists, but I must say I missed the sense of discovery their other games have provided; I feel that has always paired very well with the gameplay.\n\nThe last levels of the game were far more disappointing (minor spoilers to follow). The difficulty curve of the endgame is very well done; each of the final areas are easily distinguished by their mechanics alone. However, this breaks down at the second to last level. This level introduces an entirely new mechanic: instead of turning inputs into outputs, you have to build a machine to control the firing of weapons, and target your enemies. At the same time, it introduces a new block - a toggle, to allow you to control the machine in real time. The level itself is also fairly difficult, with failure always only a few seconds away. To throw all of these new mechanics at the player at once, and require such aptitude from them, is quite off-putting; while I did enjoy most of the boss levels in SpaceChem, I felt this was poorly executed. The final level itself was also incredibly underwhelming. Not that it was easy - it's an alright final level - but it was a bit disappointing that none of the mechanics introduced towards the end of the game were actually implemented. I believe the final level would have been much more interesting if the inputs were organized in a more forgiving way, and all the mechanics such as paints and metal were somehow implemented in it.\n\nAnother, much broader issue is the implementation of the Steam Workshop. Namely, there is no in-game way to really interact with a level, other than just playing it. It would mean a lot if the game would offer for you to rate/comment on a level after you've played it - while you can always open it up in your browser, you clearly can't expect others to do that, and most of the community levels for Infinifactory have no ratings or comments. The real issue is that browsing for levels is affected by this lack of information, and the game itself does not encourage anyone to provide it.\n\nBut that's the last two levels out of a game containing a few dozen. Those two paragraphs basically contain all of my complaints for the game, but I can't fit all of my praise into this entire review.

There's a fair bit of replayability if you are interested in competing with friends to get the best scores on a puzzle or are just interested in optimizing them to be faster, smaller, or use fewer blocks.\n\nI absolutely recommend this to anyone interested in a puzzle game, it's a lot of fun and just the right amount of challenging.", "timestamp_created": 1437237358, "timestamp_updated": 1437237358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17108941": {"recommendationid": "17108941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009675436", "num_games_owned": 802, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512716833}, "language": "english", "review": "Pirated it.

Did you like it? Just skip the rest of this review and buy Infinifactory now, you can thank me later.\n\nEverybody else: this is a game for programmers, engineers, puzzle addicts, and generally anybody who enjoys using logic to solve, or create, problems. Kidnapped by a Vogon-like race of aliens, you will be forced to create machines that automatically assemble (and sometimes disassemble) an increasingly complex variety of objects. Your tools are a collection of cube-shaped building blocks - conveyors, welders, pistons, sensors, etc. - of which you have an infinite supply. There are no time limits or resource limits, just a set of inputs and a target output. The feeling of satisfaction you get when one of your creations finally works the way it's supposed to is only matched by the feeling you get when you suddenly realize how to get it working even better; shaving a few cycles off your assembly time or eliminating a handful of extraneous blocks. And if, sorry, *when* you get frustrated, there's something oddly rewarding about deliberately monkey-wrenching the works and watching the garbage output pile up to the sky. In the end, you're free to settle for hackish stupid-but-it-works solutions, or to go full ASME and devise mechanical logic gates and suchlike to produce fine-tuned precision assembly lines - each level has three \"slots\" for you to work in, so you're free to copy over designs or work on alternative solutions without throwing away work you've already done. There's even a Steam achievement for creating exceptionally inefficient solutions, which is a nice touch.\n\nThe plot, such as it is, is mostly there for seasoning and is at first just dribbled out in the various atmospheric touches like your spartan quarters (containing only a bed, a food pellet dispenser, and a bathroom-like facility clearly designed by somebody who didn't know much about human anatomy, and didn't care to learn more) and the aliens' curious and misguided attempts to provide motivational rewards. Details start to emerge as you progress, mostly in recorded \"failure logs\" hidden throughout the levels, and finally things start to be spelled out in considerably more detail, after a plot twist which I guess I shouldn't give away here. There's humor, tragedy, and intrigue, all of which is really just a bonus as far as I'm concerned - like any good puzzle game, the puzzles themselves provide all the motivation needed to want to press on, and I found the difficulty curve to be just about perfect.\n\nThere's a few glitches in the version I'm currently playing - occasionally you'll fall through what appears to be solid ground, for example - but fortunately your character is equipped with a jetpack so this is merely an annoyance, and not really game-affecting. The graphics are simple and clean, and this should run fairly well even on low-end or outdated PCs. I should also mention the ability to automatically record looping GIFs of your creations, which is a nice touch.\n\nThis is definitely not for people who prefer their games to mostly consist of problems that are solved by shooting at them, but if the concept behind Infinifactory appeals to you at all, I can all but guarantee you're going to have a lot of fun here.", "timestamp_created": 1437143912, "timestamp_updated": 1437144114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17091686": {"recommendationid": "17091686", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992113995", "num_games_owned": 353, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438310037}, "language": "english", "review": "It's straightforward.

The puzzles are sometimes bananas, requiring some pretty twisted logic and lateral thinking.  While you strive for a solution, there's a constant nagging feeling that sometimes your solution is just [i]inelegant[/i] and you need to do it better.\n\nIt's oddly darkly humorous.  There's a strange undercurrent of defiance against your alien overlords, from listening to the audio diaries of the project managers who came before you, from resenting the food pellets that drop into your cell when you complete sections of the game.\n\nIt's also gorgeous - not so much in graphics, which are perfectly adequate, but in the efficiency of the presentation.  No main menu.  No weird visual effects cluttering up the screen. No unnecessarily ostentatious setpieces.  No splash screen! On load, the game drops you right into where you left, so you can literally load the game and get building.  There's a gorgeousness to seeing your machine, your factory do its work, and the satisfaction that comes with it makes the effort all the more worth it.\n\nIt's one of the most interesting puzzle games I've ever played, and I'm enjoying it hugely despite not being great at coming up with particularly creative solutions.", "timestamp_created": 1437139783, "timestamp_updated": 1437139783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 187, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.909707", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17085772": {"recommendationid": "17085772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084086958", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435978002}, "language": "english", "review": "wast of money and time", "timestamp_created": 1437100180, "timestamp_updated": 1437100180, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.055692", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17069059": {"recommendationid": "17069059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081954911", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461016580}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of the best 3D puzzle games I have played since Portal.

I'd just refund it if it was bad, right? Well after two days i already had 32 (out of 48) hours of gameplay (when i ate dinner i left it on so it might \"only\" have been 30 hours)!

Infinifactory is WAY more fun than SpaceChem. I'm not sure whether to attribute that to its satisfying 3D Minecraftesque environment, or the story with all its food nuggets, VHS tapes, and trucker hats, or the wide variety of blocks that such an environment allows. Really, it's all of the above and more.

As I watched the last completed unit pass into what we'll call the recepticle, I thought \"this was money well spent, and I'm going to go through and optimize all my earlier builds. Moreover, this was so good that I'm going to go write my first Steam review to send thanks to the devs and recommendations to other logic gamers.\" That was my thought at that point in the game, and then I found out there's more. More compelling, more complex, and I figured I'd stop here, write that review, and only then get back to the next build.\n\nI've already spent a lot of extra time rebuilding machines that passed but didn't satisfy me, satisfy in the sense that maybe they wasted blocks that could have been put to better use, or managed to build the prescribed number of objects but would have broken had it been asked to cycle endlessly (just one there) without any bugs. Feels good to come away with instant feedback that tells you that you've built something as efficiently as anyone else has been able.

There's that sense of accomplishment when you see your machine completing the task, especially when your results compare favorably with the global statistics. There are audio logs from previous solvers scattered throughout the levels which add to the world, but are not needed to enjoy the game.\n\nAs with SpaceChem, on occasion, I find some puzzles to be immediately obvious even at later levels, while others I sometimes have to think about for a while before a possible solution emerges. There are also some quirks of which control block takes precedence that you will have to work around and/or exploit to get the jobs finished.\n\nCommunity created puzzles are available in the Steam Workshop, but prepare to be challenged by them.

The game will rank your solution for a given challenge against the population playing the game, so that you can see where you score.

Improving one of the three scores will usually come at the cost of one or both of the others.\n\nZachtronics stands out for me as a real leader in modern puzzle games.

Despite the Early Access tag, it feels fully fleshed out, I have not yet found a single flaw or bug and I've been enjoying Infinifactory with every new puzzle being thrown at me.\n\nYou get a few blocks as inputs, you rotate them, stamp them, weld them and do other stuff to get the required output. When you get 10 outputs, you complete the puzzle. It sounds simple, but as the later levels introduce new mechanics, blocks and other stuff, the game becomes a thousand times harder, but in a challenging way. You try your best to solve the puzzle, you fail, you modify your design, fail again, try to change things up and voila! It works! And it's extremely satisfying to see your contraption work flawlessly after you're done. I found myself looking at every single block in my factories for at least a few minutes before moving on to the next puzzle. What I absolutely love doing is just randomly picking one block and looking at where it'll end up in the finished object.\n\nFrom the start of the game to about its half, I went through each puzzle in about 15-25 minutes, so it wasn't hard. Right now I'm at the last few puzzles, and I just can't solve them! I manage to solve one a day, and even then I realise that there must be a better solution! It drives you to improve, optimize your factory and just look at the mechanisms doing their work, slowly combining little bits and pieces into one cool-looking object.\n\nThere was one time when I built the complete factory for a puzzle, then I see the very first finished 'instance' of the output making its way to the finish line, and then suddenly the game yells at me. It says that I have a hole in my object that shouldn't be there! I look at the object that arrived, I look at the needed output... and then I realise that it's true. I made such an easy way of solving the puzzle at the start, then I just had to add a few small pieces and ship it to the output point, and now I have to come to the very beginning of my solution to try and change it to fit what is required, and I have no clue how to do that. I spent approximately 15-20 minutes just trying to fix the flaw in my existing design, but it was really satisfying to see it work in the end, and have another 'puzzle completed' tick in the menu.\n\n80% of people have already stopped reading this, but I'd like to add just one more thing. Since I'm a person which absolutely loves sandbox games, unlocking the Level Editor after completing a bit more than half of the game was a \"FUCK YEAH!\" moment for me. I instantly jumped in and saw that there were two options: \"Simple\" and \"Advanced.\" I went for Simple first, it gave me an open hangar and a few blocks to build my puzzle with. I built something, solved it to be able to upload it to the Workshop and then uploaded it. However, there were barely any blocks from the full game that I could place down, and the space in the hangar was still limited. I wished I could build in other environments from the game and add features that you come across in certain levels but never do again. I became really sad, and I was going to find a suggestion thread for the game to ask to improve the Level Editor by adding more stuff into it. However, I completely forgot about the \"Advanced\" mode of the editor. After I quit my custom puzzle, I glanced at the menu, saw it and remembered that there was another mode! I hastily clicked on it and what I saw completely blew my mind! It was a genuine Level Editor, it had all the different environments from the game, EVERY single block type, EVERY feature that the game had and slightly modified and expanded puzzle options! It felt more like a genuine developer editor than a small thing for players to build their own puzzles with. There were special blocks like invisible conveyors, invisible blocks, level borders, a starting position block, the map origin and so on and so forth.  In the block menu, all the blocks are labeled with text instead of icons, that's because there are hundreds of available blocks. At first it's a bit hard to navigate, but after you get used to it, you start finding all the blocks you need in no time. Granted, this kind of editor would not suit every single player, and it's good that Zach seperated the two editors, but for players like me, which are really into game design and understand how developers actually make their game, it was really easy to get used to and I'm really glad that it's possible to create the same environments as the actual game instead of sitting in the same hangar with the same blocks and very limited options available to you.\n\nOverall, the game is amazing, if you like puzzles, buy it right now. You get your money's worth completely, if not more than what you've actually payed for. The game is interesting, it has a very good difficulty curve and is worth playing until the very end. Now, the game was developed by a single person, and seeing how great and flawless everything in the game is, it's more than a huge achievement for the developer, Zach. I'd say that puzzle-lovers should definitely buy the game even in Early Access because it's as good as the consumer version would be.

Since you are basically creating a space factory of sorts, you have to pay close attention to the timing of every individual part of your machines. Having one single element of your design slightly off in timing can throw the whole thing out of whack, and will cause you to loose levels. Fortunately, the machine only runs when you tell it to do so, and you can pause it in action for a closer look at what exactly is happening at any time. \n\nThe learning curve is decent and starts out fairly simple, but it does ramp up the difficulty quickly. Infinifactory gives you just enough hints to get started, and leaves the rest for you to figure out on your own. This is the sort of game that will force you to think spatially, and have a tendency to throw complete curveballs at what you though you knew about how to complete a level. Later in the game, when you start unlocking new components, you can return to your previous levels with the new components, and try to improve your score using them and any new techniques you have figured out.\n\nAs an added bonus, the music is very well done. It is very relaxing, but not to the point that it will put you to sleep.\n\nOverall, If you love challenging puzzle games, then I absolutely recommend picking up Infinifactory.

The game also has tremendous replayability, challenging you to craft more efficient designs; a smaller overall system footprint and seamless manufacturing processes.

It's not instant gratification, it's grueling visualization and planning, only to watch your brilliant idea fail miserably and need many revisions and modifications before even working correctly, and then further modifications to actually optimize a build.\n\nStill, it's not nearly as difficult as making a real assembly line, but that's basically what this game is, assembly line simulator.\n\nThat's not why I am giving this game my recommendation though.  While it is a great assembly line simulator, it goes above and beyond that in thoughtful design and detail.  It could have easily been a game that was purely solving puzzles, but they instead opted to include a story line, one with many subtle implications, both dark, terrifying and humorous.  These story parts are sparsely distributed between small cutscene like performance reviews by terrifying and confusing aliens, and other dead humans that came before you.\n\nProbably the most intriguing thought that came to mind for me was after the story picked up a little, and after thinking for a bit on how the ones before you dealt with their predicament...  I thought it was funny how many of them saw their prison as horrible torture, and how the charcater you play is obviously some sort of engineer.. I had a good laugh at the idea that it was torture for everyone but an engineer, who must surely find it to be the greatest thing to ever happen...\n\nNo intrusive troglodytes to obstruct your work, no bosses that don't understand engineering, no stupid monetary constraints.  Just you, the problem, and the machine.  An Engineer's wet dream really...  Also abducted by a giant Alien mega-empire...  Just to stroke the Sci-fi fanboy deep down inside every engineer.\n\nI love these little touches, it brings the game to life in a way that a menu and empty room never could.  And the game could have easily been just menus and bland puzzle rooms, but instead you are transported to various alien worlds...  You see the failed attempts of those that came before you, and you listen to the intriguing storyline that plays out as you play the game.  It gives reason to the puzzles, and that makes all the difference.\n\n\n\nAll that being said, it is a fairly difficult game.  I don't think I've played a game before that required this much cognitive excersize in order to advance...  You really have to be able to see the machine working, step by step, in your mind, long before you place the blocks...  \n\nFor me personally, that's one of my greatest joys of being a sentient being.  I love using my imagination to create working devices, and I especially love it when I finally manage to bring it into the game world, and it works perfectly...  Brings a tear to my eye...\n\nSo if you're up to the task, pick up this little gem and see if you can get a better cycle score than me...  Just remember, I pretty much start all the puzzles now by switching input to max and working it out from there first, and taking away input as needed.  I've noticed it actually doesn't make much of a difference, and in many cases makes it much easier, to just do max input.  It's a bit overwhelming at first, but all the same rules apply, just with a much smaller range of error...  But often times I can make it work with very few sensors and a few well placed conveyor belts...  Definitely much easier when you're thinking about the whole thing moving and going at the same time...  \n\nAlso it's quite deceptive... You'll get most of the way through a problem, switch the machine on, and realize that every 7th manufactured part causes the whole assembly line to back up because one block moved into the right place at the wrong time....\n\nSo... be ready for ragequit.", "timestamp_created": 1425672440, "timestamp_updated": 1425672440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14726937": {"recommendationid": "14726937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046746883", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513991967}, "language": "english", "review": "FU***** GREAT GAME !\n\nYou like puzzle and the 3D, this game is a must !", "timestamp_created": 1425318900, "timestamp_updated": 1436930034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14724609": {"recommendationid": "14724609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075670295", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507726281}, "language": "czech", "review": "Velmi zaujimava hra, trosku kratka ale kedze to je Early access tak je to prijatelne. dufam ze sa este pridaju nove puzzle. za mna zatial 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1425307463, "timestamp_updated": 1425307463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14720515": {"recommendationid": "14720515", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972465709", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474145101}, "language": "english", "review": "Zachtronics is simply the best in puzzle gaming.

Both games share a similar creative element that makes them great. Since there is no \"right\" way to solve a puzzle, every solution you come up with feels like it's uniquely yours, and you get a massive sense of satisfaction from seeing your creation in action after a long period of head-scratching.\n\nDifficulty wise, I found it slightly easier than the previous game, but still an extremely challenging puzzler. I've heard complaints about it being too obtuse, with tutorials too hard to understand, but I found that the game had a great sense of discovery and experimentation that would have been ruined by less subtle guidance. The puzzles themselves offered some great brain-straining, though I ultimately found myself running into less frustration and fewer dead-ends than I did with Spacechem.\n\nThe scoring system deserves mention for being unusual, but brilliantly designed. In addition to the obvious scoring of solutions based on how fast and efficently they complete the goal, the game also scores you on your \"footprint\". What this means is, looking on the solution from the top down, how many squares are covered by machinary or have moving parts passing over them during a run of the solution. So, ten machine parts only count as one footprint if they're all stacked on top of on another. This is different than Spacechem's scoring of how many parts (symbols) are used to make a solution. In addition to creating a different way of thinking for those looking to get the best possible score, it allows a surprising amount of creativity that would have been lost if it simply counted the parts. For example, a large assembly can easily be moved by one conveyor belt, but it looks quite strange. A floor covered in multiple conveyor belts would look better, and would have the same footprint score as the more basic solution. This even allows some artistic freedom, as you can construct roofs and other shapes above your moving parts without penalty.\n\nThe game features a humorous, but very dark story of alien abduction and enslavement, most of it told through audio logs found on dead bodies, holding their last words before they died trying to solve the very puzzle you're trying to solve. They range from funny to heart-wrenching, and I found myself getting far more invested in the lore than I expected to. Cool-looking factories would have interested me enough, but instead I was making cool-looking factories at the behest of my evil alien captors and questioning just what I was making and why. Even the puzzles themselves had humor and personality, eventually making me feel like I was constructing actual products, not just assemblies of cubes. If I had one complaint, it was how the ending left me hanging. Obviously I don't want to spoil anything, and this may be the only \"Early Access\" part of the game, but it seemed like there was a LOT more story to tell after the last puzzle.\n\nSpeaking of Early Access, this game is probably the most complete early access game I've ever played. I ran into absolutely no bugs or crashes, no missing or placeholder content, and a campaign that lasted me well over a dozen hours. Infinifactory could have easily been released as a finished game and I'd have no critisism about its current state.

As you progress you will find some much joy while working through the increasingly difficult problems tossed in your direction!\nHave you played Minecraft with all of those production mods?\nOr played games like Prison architect where a lot of joy is finding solutions to knew; ever-growing problems?\n\nEven if you aren\u2019t that great at solving the puzzles there is still fun to be had, as they've included an in-game difficulty switch. Is the puzzle too hard? Then turn your production number downward to a negative number. You'll get fewer points for production; however, the puzzle becomes easier to solve! \u2014Perfect right? The best part is it works in the other way too!!! You can increase the difficulty to get your production numbers increased. The scale starts at 0 and has a min of -10 and a max of +6. As another layer of challenge and skill (as if it was even need!) you also get a 'foot print' graph as well. So the next way to play is finishing the puzzle with the least amount of pieces possible.\n\nIt is excellent, because you can reiterate your designs and track your progress and compare your progress to the community. You feel very accomplished when you see your production line running non-stop at the end of puzzle.\n\nThis game is a large ecosystem of problems with virtually infinite solutions. You are given all of the tools required to build it in any way you choose and better yet these components utility are taught to you in individual puzzles as you go (much like portal). So there really isn't anything overwhelming you; it is a very progressive game, building on your previous knowledge. This game is great for all skill levels of play! The only thing you need is a desire to grow and move forward.\n\nAnd I haven\u2019t even started talking about the story of the game; which, is only adding to the experience. There is a wonderful and mysterious world to discover. You learn more about what is going on as you play and listen to audio recordings. And you feel accomplished when you get your next batch of pellets and reward. (And that is where I\u2019m stopping, because you need to just experience it yourself, without me ruining the surprises.)\n\nThis overall feels like a finished game as well. I personally believe the game is finished and the only reason the game is still in early access, so they can get player feedback and testing. Perhaps they will add more levels, but there is already a huge diverse pool OCEAN to interact with. (And player generated levels on top of all that!!!)\n\nIt\u2019s just a shame really, when you realize people get paid to do this work in the real world and here we are doing it for free, because it is entertaining. (Perhaps some people out there will realize there calling is designing assembly lines.)\n\nAnd did I fail to mention how hilarious things can be when you watch your creations fail too. Just watching everything backup and crumble in fast motion will give you a chuckle. Perhaps later in the game or in development they\u2019ll add things that can catch fire and blow up your assemblies if you don\u2019t have proper distance or safe assembly practices! (At this point I\u2019ve only got about half way through the blocks on the level selection, so I don\u2019t know if there actually isn\u2019t)\n\n~!!!!!!Also this game will cause nausea, so I suggestion going into options and A) making look sensitivity min, B) Field of view dropped to 60, and C) Uncheck 'Camera Wobble'\nOr play around until you have settings you enjoy!!!!!~\n\nTL:DR \u2013 This is an excellent puzzle game with a wide range of difficulty and challenge; don\u2019t let the early access stray you away!", "timestamp_created": 1423315792, "timestamp_updated": 1423319153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14358166": {"recommendationid": "14358166", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969050156", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437247550}, "language": "english", "review": "100% positive reviews...just buy it already.", "timestamp_created": 1423257235, "timestamp_updated": 1423257235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14350219": {"recommendationid": "14350219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025201418", "num_games_owned": 675, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438592042}, "language": "english", "review": "IT'S SPACECHEM\n\nIN 3D\n\nMY BRAIN FUCKING HURTS AND I LIKE IT", "timestamp_created": 1423216542, "timestamp_updated": 1423216542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14348712": {"recommendationid": "14348712", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992296099", "num_games_owned": 496, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462772218}, "language": "english", "review": "It's strange how something so absurdly frustrating can also be so satisfying.", "timestamp_created": 1423203683, "timestamp_updated": 1423203683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14344991": {"recommendationid": "14344991", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981080438", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474495557}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "Brilliant sequel to the equally brilliant Spacechem.

Some of you guys make me feel like a complete idiot.  I'm the player that is simply happy to find a working solution, optimization (largely) be damned.  And in this game I feel the spatial freedom is the ultimate thing that makes finding any solution that much less challenging than in Spacechem (not that it is not challenging!).  I am sure many of my solutions so far use 3-10 times as many blocks as are necessary for the perfect solution.  But I don't care!  After laying down a few hundred blocks, correcting my logic and paths hundreds of times, and wanting to throw my laptop out the window, it is just as rewarding as when I managed ANY solution later in Spacechem.\n\nSo that being said, I can't speak for the depth of the challenge here being satisfactory for the Spacechem geniuses out there.  This game is much more accessible and beautiful, and I have already gotten much further than when I basically decided to give up on Spacechem.  If you gave up on Spacechem, and was disappointed in yourself for doing so like I was, you should ABSOLUTELY play this game.  If you are a Spacechem Mozart, you will have to rely on other reviews.

In 3d!\n\nOkay, that's the facetious review, but it really gives you a solid idea of what this game is.\n\nIf you didn't play Spacechem, let me explain the game here.  Essentially, this is a game about moving cubes around the map via conveyor belts, rotating them into place, and attaching them to other cubes in the right way.  The challenge comes in trying to get everything to line up correctly, as oftentimes you'll find that the blocks are being delivered to you in a way that makes it difficult to deal with them.  In your head, imagine that you have several cubes of sugar.  From the left side of your table, you have a constant line of green sugar cubes.  From the right side, you have a line of red sugar cubes.  The game tasks you with building a red cube that is flanked on each side with green cubes.  Doing this with just conveyor belts and block pushers is the challenge of the game!\n\nNow, this game does a lot of things right.  The interface is very solid and the puzzles are very well thought out, allowing for a lot of creativity.  You won't get stuck on things, the game boots very quickly, and I have yet to see even a bug or a crash so far.\n\nI can only think one downside, which is after each area you get awarded a random item by the alien overlords you are working for.  This takes up about 30 seconds, and that's all the complaints I can think of.\n\nSo would I recommend it?  Yes, I would, but ONLY to people who know they like puzzle games.  If you are unsure if you like puzzle games or not, pick up Spacechem and find out.  You can probably find it for almost nothing, and if you enjoy it then pick this up as well.\n\nAs for me, I'm off to compete on level scores against my friends.

And I don't mean it like \"OMG, they render everything in glo-o-orious 3D\" -- no, it's the puzzles that are genuinely three-dimensional, which adds a completely new layer of complexity to the game.\n\nFor another, the game features an entirely new story, of which I've seen but a little so far, but which I already like a lot.\n\nThe rest of it is just good old SpaceChem -- with emphasis on \"good\", because it seems that Zachtronics kept all the good parts, from free-form puzzles admitting zillions of different solutions (which doesn't mean finding a solution is easy -- OH GOD, NO!) to subtly soul-destroying difficulty curve, and from zany sense of humor to online histograms readily showing you just how much does you cherished soltuion suck compared to true masters.\n\nNo, wait, they did drop one good thing -- you can no longer automatically upload videos of your solutions to YouTube. But since the game is in Early Access, there's still time to fix that.\n\nI should probably mention that I had some reservations before buying the game, and that, in particular, I was worried whether the first-person perspective would turn out to be a huge annoyance. I'm happy to report that it's not -- your in-game avatar is equipped with a blatanly unrealistic jetpack, which allows you to roam around the puzzle about as freely as a free cam would. I do think that controlling the jetpack through mouse wheel would make the experience even more smooth, and I'm not sure there's any point to \"dying\" -- momentarily -- when you fall off a cliff ohdamnforgottoturnthejetpackon, but all of that doesn't really add up to a genuine \"annoyance\", and may be fixed in the future.\n\nLastly, if you tried SpaceChem and *didn't* like it, I think it's a sure sign you're not gonna like Infinifactory either.

I suppose, to some degree, that is true:  Those who loved SpaceChem will most likely enjoy this game, but I think it is important to make it known as distinct from SpaceChem.  So, with that, I'd suggest going to the next review if you want actual reasons on why to get this game, since I'll just discuss the mechanical similarities and differences between Infinifactory and SpaceChem.\n\nSpaceChem was a game of constraint - given one more Waldo, more bonding, or grid space, and every level becomes easy.  I imagine most people knew how to beat each level in SpaceChem, but they couldn't manage to fit in their solution to the allotted space, since symbols can't be placed on the same spot, or an avenue couldn't be found to move the molecule through.  SpaceChem was also precise - you told each molecule when they could come in, and you did what you wanted to them (except for randomized inputs, but the idea holds - you planned for accounting for inputs) before sending them off to the next reactor. You had Syncs and slightly more involved ways to make things happen when you wanted them.  The key to solving a SpaceChem puzzle was generating something manageable - once you had that, you had the level.\n\nInfinifactory is still an open-ended puzzle game.  Your solution was the one that came to your head, not the single reduced possiblity that could win you the level.  You'll still have different solutions from your friends, but the breed of how this is accomplished is different.  You see, in Infinifactory, inputs come out at fixed intervals, and while you can modify that interval, the fact of the matter is that you can't do things when you want to, you must react to this constant push of inputs, or else one input will mess up the one that came before.  Indeed, that is the fundamental difference between SpaceChem and Infinifactory:  In Infinifactory, you deal in reacting to incoming blocks, with a fair ability to do anything, while in SpaceChem you plan on how to use your scarce resources to achieve the result.  \n\nIt's a subtle difference, to be certain, but I think it is rather necessary.

This creates some irritating desyncs in the factories you create.\n\nThe game can also be played how you want.

I liked the idea of SpaceChem but didn't play it much in the end as aspects of it seemed unintuitive to me. (I meant to go back to it, and figured I just needed to learn how to play it, but never did.) Not so here. Everything is clear from the start and I was instantly hooked.\n\nThis is one of those puzzle games that gets inside your head and makes you start interpreting other things you look at as if they were in the game. Like how Tetris makes people dream about blocks, or instinctively work out how to slot everything they see in the real world together, just in case, because part of your brain has started doing that automatically.\n\nI am not usually a fan of Early Access but it's fine in this case. I can see there are some slight UI improvements that might be added to the final version (already being discussed by the devs) but that's about all you might gain by waiting. I usually dislike EA because I only want to play most games once, so I'd rather play them in their best form, but with this game you're solving puzzles which are so open-ended and free-form that you can solve them again another day in a completely new way, using new techniques you've learned and pieces you've unlocked, and still have a blast. And the game is already in a very good state. So this is a rare case where I can recommend an Early Access game.\n\nInfinifactory doesn't suffer from the problem of some \"build a thing to solve a puzzle\" games where the solution is either so simple or so restricted that you are not really having to think, only to work out what the designer wanted you to put where (except one or two levels which are obviously tutorials on new pieces, which are understandable a bit like that, but even then encourage experimenting). It's very open and you're generally given a large 3D canvas in which to invent methods of solving things. You can go for elegance, simplicity, or audacious complexity. Whatever you choose often turns out a lot more complex than you thought, which is part of the fun.\n\nPrice wise, it seemed a bit high at first for what I thought might be a simple puzzle game. Having played it and become hooked, and seen the depth and replayability it has this has, the price is well worth it. I have spent literally hours on some puzzles, and even once they are finished the desire to improve the solution or just experiment remains. You will more than get your money's worth with this game.\n\nCongratulations to the devs, you knocked it out of the park and created a classic.

The pseudo-leaderboard statistics encourage replaying to find more optimal solutions, also enabled by the game saving your past solutions and having multiple slots for each challenge so you can keep your successes while still trying new things from scratch. While I may have blown through the entirety of the included levels in a single day due to my immense ability to obsess for very short times, I have yet to try any user-submitted content or attempt any interesting creations of my own. The quality of the level creator and community support will go a long way toward increasing the longevity of the game... And all that without even being fully released!\n\nThat's not to say the game doesn't have any issues. Several blocks have multiple types, such as clock- / counterclock-wise rotators, horizontal/vertical sensors and welders, which take up the limited space on the hotbar. Fortunately the block selection menu can easily be used to select blocks not on the hotbar, but I'd rather have the virtually identical blocks simply become completely identical blocks to free up some space.\n\nOn a related note, rotation. The reason that some of those duplicate blocks are needed is because there is only one axis of roatation available, and being able to place any block vertically would provide a lot of more appealing solutions compared to what is actually available. Maybe this was intentional in order to make the Lifter block acquired late in the game more relevant, since it's literally the only way to move anything \"up\", but even the lifter is frequently awkward to use especially on large composite objects making vertical space management very important when planning construction.\n\nThe only other thing is that the levels which have \"meat\" in the title are very disturbing, especially the second one. They are skippable, so do so if you consider yourself the least bit squeamish. I held myself together, but on the second one in particular I couldn't even bear to watch the machine I created; once I knew it would work I literally stared at the wall instead, and refused to do even a second of optimization. I would be happier if those levels simply weren't in the game at all. They don't ruin the experience though, and as mentioned they're skippable.\n\nUpdate: After playing a little longer I found a control which is only mentioned in they key bindings list, block mode (or something like that). This shortcut lets you switch between the horizontal and vertical versions of a block that has them, as well as pushers/blockers and counter/clockwise rotators. With this shortcut it's possible to have access to every block on the hotbar (other than one block which is only available in the free-build mode).", "timestamp_created": 1422417529, "timestamp_updated": 1423935441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14201876": {"recommendationid": "14201876", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960272599", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435534296}, "language": "english", "review": "Zach has been making logic based games for a while now and this is arguably his best yet.

Each level has the player place blocks in a desired arangement into a goal area.

Buy if you like puzzles or making things that make things!\n\nThis game is a lot of fun. It's a series of block-building puzzles, in 3D, where you're building an assembly line to produce a specific end product. It starts you off slow with 'move these objects to the recepticle', then 'fuse these objects and move them' and before you know it, you've got an assembly line stripping the broken bits off of a tank and fusing on replacements.\n\nThe game shows a lot of promise. Many of the existing puzzles are still being improved, and some of the story elements seem to suggest that this is only the beginning of the campaign. (There are also a number of concept puzzles mixed in with the others that give me high hopes for what's coming down the road.) For now, other players are already designing new challenges and putting them in the Steam Workshop, so it should be a while before you run out of new puzzles to play.\n\nThe developer is open and responsive to criticism, and has a dedicated subreddit for discussing feature improvements. Every level ends with a short 3-question survey soliciting feedback. If you do buy the game, please help them make the game better by giving them feedback!\n\nThere are a few shortcomings (e.g., no copy/paste, no crouch key, and the labelling on some of the blocks is a bit hard to make out) but they're all minor nitpicks, and haven't kept me from finishing all the puzzles. These are all things that have been brought up with the developer, and I expect at the very least copy/paste will be addressed at some point. As alluded to earlier, the story is unfinished (though a rough sketch of at least the first half of gameplay is readily apparent!) and the puzzles don't go vertical in the difficulty department (unlike some of the later Spacechem levels). It's my guess that they have, at most, about half of the puzzles they intend to add to the base game. (And there are still at least two block types that haven't been revealed.)\n\nI heartily recommend this game if you like puzzles, or ever wished you could get something a bit more sophisticated out of Minecraft in the contraption-construction department. If you love programming, there's also a good chance you'll love this game. (I've seen way too many other programmers I follow on Twitter raving about it.)

It's still about using tools to assemble and disassemble block-based assemblies, but because it is in 3D, and is much easier to visualize the pathways things will take, it is much easier to grasp how to construct machines to do the various tasks.\n\nThe puzzles currently included in the game are still hard - this is not a walk in the park and once you get past a half-dozen puzzles, the challenge bumps up greatly.  However, the game gently introduces new block types - with minimal instructin but obvious application, so getting your mind around these puzzles can be easily done.  And like SpaceChem, all you are trying to do is get a working solution to start, but then using the histrograms of friends and other players, try to go back and improve your scores.

If you follow the indie scene even slightly, I'm sure you heard the ample praise and acclaim for Zachtronics' chemical puzzler. After a foray into card-game strategy with Ironclad Tactics, the developer has returned to  the world of meticulous planning and systematic construction with Infinifactory. You might have heard it described it as \"SpaceChem in 3D\", and while that's an apt description, it doesn't exactly detail what makes Infinifactory an awesome evolution of the SpaceChem formula. Infinifactory takes everything you loved about that game, on a grander scale and with new depth, wrapped up in an alien industrial aesthetic. \n\nForget about bonding elements and creating molecules. Infinifactory leaves the microscopic world of SpaceChem behind for the world of alien engineering. The enigmatic story puts you in the shoes of a person captured and forced to build extraterrestrial constructs. Audio logs and notes allow you to gradually piece together the overarching tale, but let's be honest: you're here for the puzzles. \n\n\"SpaceChem in 3D\". Introducing the third dimension adds so many tweaks and new complexities. Having to remember that items take time to fall when you're trying to sync up blocks across multiple levels. Working out how to maneuver pieces across multiple axises so that they all eventually meet. Having to build objects with height and width and depth. Getting the mess of energy conduits and welders and pushers to work and timed correctly...all without Spacechem's sync command to fall back on. On top of all that, Infinifactory has the most seamless, intuitive, user-friendly control scheme and interface I've seen in a block building game. You can effortlessly rotate and place blocks, easily create long conveyor belts or delete unwanted sections in seconds. \n\nIt's the meticulous construction and pursuit of perfection and optimization you love. The hypnotic rhythm of seeing your complex sprawling mess of moving pieces and parts actually work properly after countless failures and tweaking. The challenge of learning how everything works and functions, and using that knowledge in new ways that makes you feel like a damn genius when it all comes together in the end. It's all that, in a 3D world of sky docks and armories and spaceships and missiles. Six hours in, and for me, Infinifactory has already eclipsed SpaceChem, due to the presentation and polish and the spatial depth that offers new challenges in ways that SpaceChem never could. The price may seem steep, but for the amount of polished content already here, and the content to come, it's well worth the asking price. While Infinifactory may be in Early Access, the current version is literally the 1.0 release version, with a feature-complete finished main campaign. Mini-campaigns and new blocks and mechanics will be added in future updates \n\nIf you enjoyed SpaceChem even in the slightest, you won't be disappointed by Infinifactory.

Really, if you've played Spacechem your experience with this game will probably be exactly like your experience with that. The only negative that I have is that some of the specifics of the game mechanics make certain tasks harder than they should be. Rotating single blocks, or welding things vertically, for example, are a lot less intuitive with the current mechanics than rotating large pieces or welding things horizontally.

The game was a lot of fun, about the only downside was that I felt the official \"campaign\" felt a bit short. However, the number and more importantly, the quality of the puzzles being posted in the Steam Workshop has more than made up for this.\n\n[u]The following was posted Jan 26, 2015[/u]\nI'll throw my review of the early access version of Infinifactory in here as well. If you've looked at the other reviews you'll see that pretty much everyone is very positive about the game. I agree with those folks. However, a lot of people have been saying that this is SpaceChem in 3D. I played a lot of SpaceChem and I have to say that Infinifactory is really a lot better than a 3D version of SpaceChem. \n\nPrimarily, the reason Infinifactory is better is because SpaceChem was always rather space limited in it's format. There was only a set amount of 2D space to work in and once you got past the early SpaceChem puzzles I would be conscious that I was having to compromise my creativity to keep my designs in that rather small space. While there are limitations in the 3D space available on some Infinifactory puzzles, I've felt that I'm really being able to be creative (and perhaps a little sloppy in my designs) without that constricted feeling I would get in SpaceChem. Certainly, you can tweak and tune a solution in Infinifactory to get it as near perfect in Cycles and Footprint, but it's not required. And that makes it fun.\n\nAnother reason Infinifactory is very good is how the 3D environment is structured. Except for a few folks in North Korea, pretty much everyone has at least tinkered a bit with Minecraft. Infinifactory uses the same presentation so you can start solving puzzles right away without having to understand how all those nodes worked like you did in SpaceChem. Blocks stack together, right click removes, left click adds, it's all very straightforward. Most folks will be able to grasp the concepts pretty quickly.\n\nThe final reason Infinifactory is so good is another fallout of the 3D environment, specifically that your avatar is actually inside of the game. Want to know why your conveyor belt doesn't seem to be doing what you want? Walk or fly over to it and look. Want to be sure that there's clearance when your swinging around a large assembly through a gap? Move your viewpoint into position and fire up the process, then observe. You can start and pause at will, so you can actually look at what's going on at any point at any time during the process. It's amazing helpful when you're trying to troubleshoot.\n\nOK, there's another reason I can really recommend this game as more than just a 3D version of SpaceChem. Infinifactory is [u][i]fun[/i][/u]. There's so much satisfaction and enjoyment when you can build your own assembly line and watch it work. And, really, there is just as much satisfaction and enjoyment trying to figure something out, being stymied, scratching your... head, looking at it from all different angles, starting, pausing and restarting... then suddenly getting a true epiphany on how to make it all work.

Constantly challenging, the curve in this game is very solid. Whenever a new block is introduced it gives you a rather simple puzzle in order to learn how it works, and then in the next level you want to scream at the game because that new block is making this already puzzling game even more puzzling.\n\nPros:\n - Amazing puzzle game. Open-ended solutions allow you to brag to your friends that your solutions are faster then theirs'.\n - Fitting and varied graphics. Every major \"section\" has a different planet design, and they always look great. Amazing skybox/background images and looming ships watching you really fits with the 'story.'\n - Story. Speaking of the story, there is one. I haven't finished the game so I don't know what kind of ending there is (or if there is one) but various elements in the levels (which are totally optional as to whether you investigate them or not) reveal how you got to where you are.\n - Almost a full fledged game already. Even though this game is in Early Access, it is basically a full game. Even if it was released this moment, I would not regret buying it.\n\nCons:\n - No graphical settings. This will hopefully change since the game is still only in Early Access, but this is big for me since my computer isn't that amazing, and the game feels sluggish for me because of the various effects that are rendered (completely playable, I just feel like I'm snail in neck brace).\n - Some of the puzzles can be a good bit more difficult than others in that same section, but since you don't have to complete every single level to progress to the next section (in the first few sections you can do all but one to progress) and since the Early Access features a mandatory feedback system on how difficult and fun the puzzle was, I am sure any overly difficult levels will be reworked as the game improves.\n\nOverall, this is a gem. Who knew building factories on alien planets could be so fun, even if it makes your brain melt.\n\nMy score for Infinifactory as a Factory building and Puzzle solving game - 9/10\n\nOh, and I can't leave out the best part...\n\nMy score for Infinifactory as a Food Pellet eating and Memorabilia collecting simulator - 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1421883038, "timestamp_updated": 1421883038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14103203": {"recommendationid": "14103203", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992854342", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504110840}, "language": "english", "review": "Superb puzzle game.

But there's another old, free Zachtronics game that's even more like Infinifactory. It's called Manufactoid, and if you don't mind some ugly graphics and (very, very light) programming, then you should absolutely check it out if you're on the fence about Infinifactory.\n\nThe goal in Infinifactory (and Manufactoid, and SpaceChem for that matter) is to build specific objects from the inputs you're given. You have conveyor belts and rotators to move blocks around, sensors and pushers to move them around in a smarter way, welders to fuse blocks into the larger objects that you're tasked with building, and some other kinds blocks that I won't spoil. \n\nIn Manufactoid (seriously, go Google it if you like this sort of thing! I'll wait...) you had to write tiny little \"programs\" to run your factory. For example, you might have to write some code that said (translated to English), \"anytime sensor 5 is activated, also activate pushers 3,4, and 7\". In principle you could write much more complicated programs (the language is Lua), but in practice this is what it ended up being. Infinifactory takes out the programming completely, but the third dimension makes up for it by giving us much more flexibility to hook up our sensors, pushers, and so on without them interfering with one other.\n\nAs others have said, this isn't your typical half-baked Early Access title. These guys are doing it right. The graphics are appealing, performance is good, controls are tight, and there are 30 well-designed puzzles already. Anyone who has played SpaceChem knows that 30 puzzles (okay, maybe 20 since the first few are necessarily easy) can last you a long time. And there'll no doubt be a lot more coming along soon.\n\nJust buy it.

Zachotronics has mentioned that this is actually what they would normally have released as a first full version, but they decided to go the Early Access route so that they can take player feedback to fix any critical issues that crop up post-release. A prime example is the game not having view inversion support for the mouse on launch but being added just hours later.\n\nThe production ready quality really comes across in the game. Except for the button to record your solution (as you could in SpaceChem) being disabled and marked as \"Soon\", the game does not come across as a work in progress at all. Everything works fluidly and smoothly, and looks great (or as great as something in this visual style CAN look, at any rate). No blocky minecraft textures here. It's simplistic, but somehow exactly what a game of this nature needs.\n\nThere are a couple of minor issues with the controls currently. You can't scroll through the hotbar with the mouse wheel, and the number of slots is not big enough, but these are apt to be coming in a very near update.\n[EDIT: The day after release, an update was pushed that makes the hotbar bigger, although you still can't scroll through it with the mouse wheel (yet)]\n\nGameplay wise, the game is (as mentioned) similar to SpaceChem, with the exception that instead of programming a reactor with constantly moving Waldoes, the inputs come out at set intervals and you must use a connected sequence of things like conveyor belts, welders, sensors and so on to shuffle things around and attach them as appropriate. The different elements are introduced slowly before being combined to help you come to grips with how to use everything. I would say that in this regard the pacing is spot on.\n\nThere is a built in level editor, although there is no access to it until you finish the main campaign. Steam workshop support allows you to share your levels with others, which is a great thing for the longevity of the game. Only a day after the initial release, new levels are already showing up in the workshop.\n\nThe back story of the game is handled well, and the setup for the story as a whole (being abducted by aliens so that you can build factories for them) is used as the setup to  explain the core mechanics of the game, which works very well. The initial levels start with simple puzzles to get you used to the concepts needed before starting to get dastardly. As mentioned, the pacing seems to be spot on (thus far).\n\nWith this being an EA (for now) title, there is a small survey at the end of each puzzle regarding whether it was fun to solve and how hard it was, allowing for them to tune things if needed.\n\nI leave you with this: after initial training, you get dumped into a cell and are provided with some food pellets to munch on while you ponder your next move.", "timestamp_created": 1421781924, "timestamp_updated": 1421881080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14084652": {"recommendationid": "14084652", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988050328", "num_games_owned": 918, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460985170}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun puzzler, similar to spacechem but the extra dimension makes quite the difference.", "timestamp_created": 1421775108, "timestamp_updated": 1421775108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14084035": {"recommendationid": "14084035", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977095729", "num_games_owned": 759, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470002057}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic.

It also has the humor of Spacechem - when you are reviewed by your alien overlords, and they give you some food pellets and some kind of reward it's epic in it's own way.  \n\nIf you liked Spacechem or modded industrial Minecraft, you'll love this game.  You'll also like it if you enjoyed Factorio.  I'd say this game is more challenging than Factorio because the puzzles are more constrained.  \n\nI don't know why this game is listed as early access - the day 1 release version is rock solid.  It would be perfectly acceptable as a full retail release.

And in a way you are, as this game is a lot harder and smarter than most games out there.\n\nPros: \n- \"I'm such a bad-ass\" feeling\n- Great tutorial/intro\n- 3 solution slots per level\n- Spacechem pyramid dangling in the rear view mirror in the intro\n- Learning curve is very well balanced\n- Stable and polished\n\nCons:\n- No in-game recording and sharing tool (ok, this shouldn't be a Con, but we got spoiled...)\n- No or too few data points to compare performance (this will turn into a Pro later, as this feature is awesome)\n\nGraphics are functional but nothing to write home about, neither Pro nor Con, but certainly good enough.\n\nI recommend you pick this up at full price if you can, as this is one developer that deserves more money so he can make more good stuff like this. The fact that H1Z1 is topping the top selling list while people put this game on their wishlists waiting for a sale just makes me want to cry.

I love logic puzzles, and sadly enough, this game doesn't focus as much as I would like torwards that aspect, needless to say though, this game is still really fun, and now onto the review. \n\nThis game your average sorting game, if anyone remembers that really old logic game where you put conveyors down in order to sort the different colored socks, this is much like that, which is really cool because there is not many games in that said genre. If you are into that type of game this is defnitly for you, my main complaints are that it doesn't hold to the \"logic\" side like TIS-100 and shenz did, which is the main reason I loved the games, to put it bluntly, this game is incredibly simple once you learn the aspects of the controls, this does not mean said aspects are thrown at you, oh no, in fact, the \"tutorials\" are literally signs that you have to decipher \"ok what is this sign telling me\" \"oh wait shift opens available blocks?\" \"OH IT WANTS ME TO WELD THIS\", \"hover over the blocks to see where you failed\" (it doesn't actually explain what you did wrong by hovering btw), which if you are into that type of learning experience only adds to the fun of the game. This for me however is my biggest complaint, Not that I dislike a good learning curve, I actually prefer them, however it needs more direction torwards what is supposed to do. The learning curve, unlike shenz and tis, is not the \"i know what im doing just not the right thing\" but more of the, \"ok what am I supposed to be doing. What do you want from me\", which leaves me feeling more angered than perplexed.\nAside from that the only other thing I disliked was the intro, which was weird, I couldn't tell it was an intro and thought it was a game bug at first.

I like these types of games and have written good reviews on a few Zachtronic games. I really want to write a good review of Infinifactory but I can't. \n\nMy problem with this game is while it is okay to make something have to think to come up with a solution, there is such a thing as making it too hard to figure out. Right from the first training puzzle, the thing I felt was missing that was not the case in other Zachtronic games was the needed components to construct the solution. Shenzhen IO, TIS/100 and SpaceChem always had enough of the basic elements -- motion, a grabber, and a switch -- to complete the problem. With infinifactory, the grabber -- which in this case would be a clamp -- was missing and it was sorely needed on the third training puzzle where I had to weld a vertical two-block stack, then move the union to the transporter. There was simply no way to join two falling objects at different altitudes into a union and then at command move the union to the transporter. I spent a total of 2 and a half hours on that one puzzle before finally giving up and uninstalling.\n\nWhen something becomes too hard to do, it stops being enjoyable. Infinifactory made the learning curve much too steep at the beginning and I truly feel it should have followed a more shallow incline demonstrated in the other games.", "timestamp_created": 1517332450, "timestamp_updated": 1517332450, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.284169", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39725982": {"recommendationid": "39725982", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970549447", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 664, "last_played": 1521480646}, "language": "english", "review": "Cross between SpaceChem and Minecraft. I liked this game because it had some really good puzzles as well as the fact that the game story added a lot of flavour to the game and made me relate and care about what was happening in game. I also liked the way they show you other people's performance as a subtle nudge to try to challenge yourself to find a more optimal solution without forcing you, it gave me a huge buzz when I found a solution much better than anyone else for one of the puzzles. A few things were not explained at all which caused me to get stuck (like at the start, that there was a counter counting how many blocks ended up in the sink, a basic game mechanic it turns out), so you might have to do some Googling just to figure out what's going on, but I enjoyed it nevertheless and you could argue that the extra challenge better reflects the story of the hero.

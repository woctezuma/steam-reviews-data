The playable pre-title sequence makes the games resemble a movie series, but there is no time for the player to sit back and relax. This involves a lot of clicking and pointing. The main characters have to find the cause of death. For clues they have to track people online (in game) and visit dorm rooms and churches, homes and offices, derelict buildings and construction sites. They have to connect the right items and names to get the right answers to their questions.\n\nI played and loved the first four games when they were only available through Adventure Game Studio, the engine used for these games. When they became available through Steam, I bought the whole series, including the fifth game, replayed them all and loved them even more. They are not perfect.

However, the games don't suffer from one flaw that exists in many quests, and that is excessive use of items. In some quest games you usually stack up a lot of items and end up trying every combination of item and something clickable on the screen until you find that absurd combination that makes you progress. The Blackwell series doesn't have that flaw as items aren't the main part of the game. Also, when places become irrelevant you can't access them anymore, which also prevents having to go back and try to find something useful in every place that you've been through at the endgame.\n\nThe progression in the game is made by combining the abilities of Rosa (or Lauren in Blackwell Unbound) and Joey, which complete each other. Joey can enter locked rooms but cannot interact with anything, and Rosa can do the opposite. Only by combining their abilities you will make progress. There's also a built in search engine inside a game in which you have to use in order to progress, which makes you feel that you're doing detective work and not just trying to figure out how to use your inventory.\n\nThe plot becomes \"bigger\" in each episode and ends with a grand finale in Blackwell Epiphany, so you don't feel like you're doing that same thing in each game.\n\nI really enjoyed the series and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1500017115, "timestamp_updated": 1500017115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33393039": {"recommendationid": "33393039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072006918", "num_games_owned": 878, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499571450}, "language": "english", "review": "Blackwell series's grand finale.

[spoiler]For example, you'd know you needed Connor Fielding's service number, but you couldn't turn up a web search, and you couldn't ask either Maggie or Peter about it at all (asking Peter could have produced a response like 'it's on my dad's photo' even, but it seemed odd that you couldn't even ask). The only way to get the number was to get into the gym to pick up the photo.[/spoiler]\n[*]While you think that you're investigating ties that are set up/established by Deception, you find that it's only tangentally connected, and that whole storyline set up by Gavin is just completely abandoned.\n[*]The flashbacks (and therefore the past we get about Joey) felt a bit rushed and sloppily done. The story would have flowed better without them, because I don't feel that they achieved quite the impact they were supposed to. It told us nothing new about Madeline and the Countess, and only very little more about Joey.\n[*]The end. While I didn't expect the 'everyone lived happily ever after' ending [spoiler]Rosa's sudden ability to save all the souls *except Joey* was a bit over the top, although I could have theoretically bought it with the whole sudden \"power of the universe\" thing.

I think it's the fact that for a while I've been looking forward to a new entry in the Blackwell series that I've come to love all these characters. To think that I started to play this series because it starred a glasses wearing redhead.\n\nThe game can be pretty challenging, and in that regard seems to be an improvement over the previous Blackwell games. At times though it does seem unclear what to do, and you keep on trying many things before you get just one step further. Sure, with some logical thinking you could get there, but at times it doesn't even seem all that logical. You do need to think like a ghost at times.\n\nBut I do think the game shines the most when it comes to the story itself. It all sets itself up for the final moments of the game, and it does take a lot of elements from previous games as well, integrates them to make it seem like it was planned all along. I mean, it might have been, I don't know. It does feel like one big world, and honestly, I can't wait to jump into this world again in a future game (though not necessarily a Blackwell game).", "timestamp_created": 1479931234, "timestamp_updated": 1479931234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26809800": {"recommendationid": "26809800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013706087", "num_games_owned": 694, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479931385}, "language": "polish", "review": "Wow, poruszaj\u0105ce zako\u0144czenie \u015bwietnej serii.

The art has really come into its own after a poor showing in the last game, and a focus on exterior locations has resulted in some truly beautiful backgrounds. Puzzles feel completely natural which could be an effect of the game design changing so little between Epiphany and Deception or simply from the fine tuning done over the past four games. \nThis is also by far the longest of the Blackwell games. The story focuses on the job ahead of our heroes this time rather than mystery of the duty itself, but still manages to be epic. As a spirit medium, Rosangela is involved in the most important moment of each of these peoples' lives (existences), which is brought home by another string of excellent voice performances. Those individual stories are then woven together to create something that not only hits harder than it ever could have alone but also provides answers to what has become the Blackwell legacy. \nBy the time the credits role, every loose end has been tied up as well as if could have ever been - save for one. Sadly, the society the pair vowed to hunt down at the end of Deception has been largely forgotten in order to focus on the finale of the series. As important as it was for the last game, it just didn't fit in this game. The writer includes a deleted scene in the commentary to point out exactly why that line of investigation would have overcomplicated an already complex story. The commentary track as a whole is more robust in this game than in the last. It now features explanations from the artist alongside Gilbert's traditional commentary and the occasional blooper from the voice recording sessions.\nThis game has so much offer, but going any further in depth would run the risk of spoiling its stirring conclusion.

This beloved series that just keeps growing on ya! I'm extremely impressed by the way that Dave Gilbert developed this story. By the end of the whole series I felt very connected to Rosa, Joey, and the cast of characters from the entire series. It is also amazing to see the games improve as they progressed, getting rid of elements that detracted from the game and replacing them with elements that helped push the game along. I'm not much of a mystery/clue finding type of gamer, so if a game series is able to get me to enjoy something that I'm not that into then the game is pretty special. For this fifth and final installment here are some of the pro's and con's of the game.\n\nPro's: The storyline is marvelous in this game, lets just say everything wraps up rather nicely. I absolutely love Rosa and Joeys relationship and think that the actor who plays Joey does an amazing job and yes the hilarious banter is still there. The puzzles were fun, as usual. I was glad that this game had some different puzzles that the other four games had not done before and the continued ability to switch between Rosa/Joey. The length of the game was good, comparable to Convergence and Deception (Unbound and Legacy both seemed a little short).\n\nCon's: One word, the art. Still hate it and always will! I also think it is funny that I love and hate the consistency issues. I think that making the necessary changes from game to game is a good thing to do, but it really makes you feel like they should have done that in the previous games and can be a little jarring when Joey is drawn different, the style of music changes, the mechanics change, or the voice acting is different.\n\nAs I've said in many of the other reviews, some of these games by themselves are not the greatest (cough...Blackwell Legacy), but if you can get through the first boring chapter in the book then you will find a pretty amazing series one that will not disappoint.\n\nBlackwell Legacy: 6/10\nBlackwell Unbound: 8/10\nBlackwell Convergence: 7.6/10\nBlackwell Deception: 8.2/10\nBlackwell Epiphany: 8.5/10\n\nBlackwell Series: 8.2/10\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!", "timestamp_created": 1463462601, "timestamp_updated": 1463462601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22989155": {"recommendationid": "22989155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013735252", "num_games_owned": 620, "num_reviews": 180, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463281788}, "language": "english", "review": "Blackwell Epiphany is the epic conclusion to the Blackwell games and it does not disappoint.

The story becomes strangely compelling, the characters feel right, the music is immersive, and the gameplay is top-notch for this genre.\n\nI have been legitimately haunted by certain parts of the story, and have had deeper feelings about the characters in this series than almost any game I've played.  I feel like the story walks a fine narrative line between cheesy and heavy handed that is quite difficult to achieve.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, Blackwell avoids many of the pitfalls of the point-and-click adventure.  There is little to no backtracking, and you don't have to watch your character walk through the same stale environments over and over again while you try to figure out what you missed.  When you are stuck, it is often a matter of figuring out how to connect information, rather than some obscure hidden object puzzle.  Everything in Blackwell has some connection, and you have to use real-life experience and some detective skills to solve problems in your environment.  I feel like this game has been a great example of what a detective/mystery game can be.\n\nBlackwell is a shining example of less-is-more.

Very good storyline and game mechanics. It kept me up late at night several times because I just wanted to know how the story ended. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that the story ended after part five. But that is probably a good thing because you do not want to ruin a good story by stretching it thin.\n\nYou play this adventure with two main characters: Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Malone. Part two is kind of a prequel in which Rosangela is replaced by her Aunt Lauren Blackwell.\nRosangela and Lauren are mediums and Joey Malone is their spirit guide. Together they help the souls of dead people (ghosts) that are stuck in this world to move on. Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.\n\nJoey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.\n\nA very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information. By cross-referencing the right information you will learn new things which will help you to further progress into the game. Some information you have to lookup on the internet (in game) and emails play an important role too in this game.\n\nThe Blackwell series consists of five separate parts:\n\n1. The Blackwell Legacy\n2. Blackwell Unbound\n3. Blackwell Convergence\n4. Blackwell Deception\n5.

The conclusion to everything. And, may I add, a magnificent conclusion. Epiphany mantains everything positive from Blackwell's previous instalments, and even manages to improve them, by a good margin.\n \n Graphically speaking, there's been no evolution whatsoever. And that's pleasant, due to the already suiting, and fitting art style. Besides, after four games, one gets used to the low resolution, and pixel graphics, that are not a negative aspect, at all. There are still a bunch of achievements that add replayability to the game, as with the previous titles.\n\n Imagine if you grabbed all the action scenes from Legacy, Unbound, Convergence and Deception. Epiphany seemed to have about the same action and suspense as all the other games combined, if not more. That's amazing. And justifies the price tag, as well. As such, the title is also the lengthier of the five. Voice acting is still suprisingly good, and I will miss the sound of Rosa's and Joe's voice. Soundtrack is still a beautiful mix of Jazz, and the same theme is always being played, in different takes.\n \n Concluding this not so long review, as I can never write about everything I experience through games, I feel like I will miss the Blackwell series dearly. I will miss to send ghosts to meet their peace. I will miss to hear both Rosa and Joe talking to each other, joking in the process. This was quite a ride.

An excellent conclusion to a series that started good and kept getting better. Story impact is far greater having played the previous four games and I'd recommend starting from the first game instead of jumping in at the end for this game to have fullest impact. A few puzzles with obscure or finicky methods to solve them, uneven voice acting among the supporting cast prevent this from being the perfect adventure game but those are minor quibbles regarding a game that is a minor masterpiece of the genre. Definitely recommend the game.\n\nLong Version: Before adventure games got cool again, with Telltale's increasing mastery of the genre and updates of older classics like Monkey Island and Grim Fandango, the Blackwell series was keeping the point-and-click adventure genre alive. There are five games in the Blackwell series, and you can track the increasing competence of Wadjet Eye Games in terms of art direction, vocal direction and storytelling across each game in the series. There is a practiced confidence that enters the series - not arrogance, but confidence borne of learning the lesson taught by each game and applying it to the next game in the series.\n\nBy Blackwell Epiphany, the series has reached its apex. But for it to have maximum impact, playing the previous games are crucial. Sure, I think you can come into the series with this game and get a lot out of it. But when you've been playing as Rosangela and Joey for four previous games, everything in this game resonates so much more. The final outcome of these two people (well, one person and one ghost) has so much more weight. And boy, does it have weight. The stakes in each game of the series have increased, and Blackwell Epiphany takes the stakes the highest they ever have gone. I won't spoil it for you - normally, spoilers aren't such a big deal but with a story heavy game I'll be safe instead of sorry - but it manages to be big, Hollywood movie big stakes, without feeling empty and cheap. It's a real credit to the world they've created.\n\nThe game's not perfect. It's an adventure game so there's a few \"guide dang it\" moments where it's not entirely clear what the next thing to do is. However, like most of the series, Blackwell Epiphany avoids the pixel-hunt trap and the solutions are not obtuse to the point of ridiculousness. The voice acting can be slightly uneven, which has been a bane of the series (and Wadjet Eye Games in general, I've found) but Rosangela and Joey's voice actors are excellent and really understand their characters well, and they're the two you'll be hearing the most. As mentioned, it's probably the best voice acting in the series thus far. The art direction is good - it's achieving the standards set by the Lucasarts games of the 90s they lovingly emulate with crisper textures you'd expect from a modern game. That said, the series does not achieve the level of graphical polish that we've been seeing with modern adventure games like Telltale's games or Life is Strange. It's a retro experience, the heir to Lucasarts gaming instead of the characterization-heavy modern offshoot. Whether that's good, bad or simply different is up to you.\n\nIn the end, I absolutely recommend this game if you like adventure games. I do say that it is worth it to go back and play the series front to end instead of playing this game without having played the others. You *can* do it, but you'll lose something wonderful - the sense of wrapping up a fulfilling story with a couple of old friends you've seen change and grow. You just can't get that playing this game alone.\n\nNota bene: You'll notice I don't own the previous games in my library but talk about the entire series.

Per scoprirne quanto prima la conclusione l'ho giocato a tappe forzate, quasi trattenendo il respiro. BE \u00e8 una adventure punta e clicca dalla grafica stile retro, quinto ed ultimo episodio della serie Blackwell, serie che \u00e8 OBBLIGATORIO giocare nell'ordine, cominciando dal primo episodio: Blackwell Legacy. Il punto di forza di questo gioco, come di tutta la serie, \u00e8 la trama originale. Non nascondo che all'inizio,nel primo episodio, ho un po' sorriso alla trovata dei salva-anime, presupponendo una futura trattazione leggera e quasi sopra le righe, ma poi il dipanarsi della trama \u00e8 andato su ben altri registri: non posso svelare punti troppo esplicativi, ma posso senz'altro dire che in BE, come anche in Blackwell Deception, ho provato molta tenerezza, se non emozione e forte commozione, ad assistere alle sfortunate traversie di povere anime... C'\u00e8 da dire che il gioco fa leva su argomenti 'facili', nel senso che l'argomento stesso richiama di per s\u00e8 commozione, quello della morte, dell'avvicinarsi ineluttabile delle persone, di tutti noi, alla fine della vita, di quella vita che vorremmo sempre con noi  e che invece dobbiamo prima o poi abbandonare, rimanendo magari inappagati, con i nostri sogni incompiuti; ed infatti il gioco ci pone di fronte a scene di abbandono alla vita piene di pathos e di significato doloroso. Riguardo la trama, per\u00f2, il gioco ha rischiato, se non lo ha fatto addirittura, di cadere nella trappola di infliggerle talmente tante pericolose forzature da viziarne il decorso narrativo pi\u00f9 logico e fluente, svilendola piuttosto che esaltandola: in altre parole, soprattutto quando si ha a che fare con ambientazioni fantastiche, fantasiose, non realistiche, ad un certo punto, o per mancanza di ispirazione, o per incapacit\u00e0 narrativa, o per altro, si pu\u00f2 cadere nella tentazione di inventare situazioni poco verosimili, calate dall'alto, slegate da ci\u00f2 che si era costruito finora, tale da confondere e quasi da fare 'violenza' sul giocatore per fargli accettare quanto gli si racconta. Per esempio, nel caso specifico, a me sembra che in BE si sia introdotto qualche elemento stonato di troppo, senza nessuna giustificazione, giusto per arrivare all'epilogo voluto. Un'altra nota dolente del gioco \u00e8 che non \u00e8 localizzato in italiano, argomento al quale sono molto sensibile:  il gioco si riesce a capire, ma la velocit\u00e0 non regolabile del parlato che appare come sottotitoli e la presenza di espressioni gergali e difficili rovinano, secondo me, una parte essenziale del godimento della trama, non tanto, per\u00f2, da farle dare una valutazione negativa, come sarebbe da mia regola personale. Se fosse esistita una scala di valutazione, il voto sarebbe sceso da 90 a 65-70, per cui chi vuole comprare la serie ne tenga conto. Passando alla colonna sonora, direi che il suo stile \u00e8 armonizzato con la trama e e con l'ambientazione, ed \u00e8 di alto livello. Il parlato \u00e8 eccellente. La grafica pecca di mancanza di opzioni di configurazione, per cui \u00e8 probabile che si usi la finestra di gioco standard. Altro elemento di cui non si pu\u00f2 non parlare quando si tratta di una adventure riguarda gli enigmi, che in BE non sono insuperabili, mai fuori luogo o senza fondamento logico.

The environments drawn with so much thought made me feel as though I've visited New York City. \n\nI have no comments on the gameplay and puzzle solving itself as everyone has their own level of patience for point-and-click games. The blackwell games always make sure you solve the puzzles on your own (and feel great about yourself!) with just enough suggestion secretly planted in your head. Never are any of the puzzles unfair pixel hunting frustrations.\n\nIt's somehow extremely saddening to learn what is preventing a ghost it from moving on.

Gameplay is also the longest out of all of the Blackwell series, most say around 9 hours for the first play through. I was more eager on hearing the story than figuring out the puzzles, which is reflected in my hours played. \n\nThe end is, as I said, bittersweet and leaves an unfulfilled hole in your heart, but doesn\u2019t any story when you fall in love with the characters? \n\nAll in all, a fantastic point and click adventure game.

You've been prepared for this final act throughout the whole series, and when you face it... you will know there could be no better ending. It is not the ending you want. It is not the ending you asked for. You keep whispering to yourself, even screaming in your head that this shouldn't happen! Yet you know that there is no better ending that this title deserves. We go out with a bang. It leaves you with a bittersweet sensation. We have to acknowledge that it is our time to say goodbye.\n\nA couple months after the events of [i]Blackwell Deception[/i], we learn that Rosa has established a symbiotic relationship with Detective Durkin. She has become a silent informant for Durkin, as he helps Rosa to reach inside information on cases that she works on. Durkin doesn't ask questions, Rosa doesn't impose answers. We catch up on this partnership when Rosa is sent to investigate a rundown hotel by Durkin. A casual enough \"ghost whispering\" case occurs and finds resolution by Rosa and Joey's already tried abilities. Just as Rosa was leaving the scene, she witnesses a dreadful murder! The next day, not a word is spoken on the news about the said murder and Rosa's suspicions do raise by the minute. Does the police cover up the story? Why? It is time for us to chase another mystery... Maybe our last.\n\nIn this final game, we encounter many old friends, enemies and familiar bystanders. Sometimes we smile, sometimes we pout, other times we wish that we'd be capable of throwing a punch through our screen. We live through our saddest, happiest, weirdest, cruelest encounters yet. But in the end, what rests with us the most are no other than Rosa and Joey. We witnessed their growth, both in character and relationship step by step. Now we are able to see that Rosa has fulfilled her potential, and we can finally claim that we know who Joey Mallone is. They are the kind of characters that you'll keep carrying with you long after their stories are told. Rest is \"a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing\".\n\nGameplay wise, the game contains the longest playtime compared to all other installments as you can expect. There are many things to reveal, explore or dabble with. I'd say one play through would take around 8-10 hours, which would completely worth the full price. We are already familiar with all options and controls that the game has in store for us. Nothing changed. If I were to complain about one thing, I'd say there was some relevantly periodic backtracking which concerns casual visits to police station. Aside, I am silent on the complaint department.\n\nThere are thousands of words that I wish to write about this masterpiece of an adventure game, but sadly the contents elude me as I ponder on. This was it. The one big finale. The grand exit. Literally no more Blackwell games to wait for. I found myself holding my breath as the story unwraps its countless unexplained mysteries one by one. Each crisp of information blew my mind. Each answer that I have been given, I anticipated for more. Flashbacks, metaphors, oddly exchanged dialogues, the gravity of choice and the collective unconscious; they all came back to present us the finale that we were waiting for. And that finale, was excellent!\n\nJust as I realized \"what the hell was happening\", the credits started to roll. I felt tears filling my eyes, and I cannot say this for a lot of games. Well done, Dave Gilbert. Well done and well played! I bow before you!

They shift expressions as they talked but I kind of liked the animated talking ^^;; But I can see that can actually be a bit more tedious to do over time.

You can really tell how far the series has grown and developed since the Blackwell Legacy, as Epiphany presents darker themes, more complex (yet still logical) puzzles, and more advanced graphics. All elements have become perfected in this installment. Of course, since Epiphany is the final installment in a 5-game series, it is best enjoyed only after playing the previous games since by then you'll have a greater understanding of the characters and backstory - and those games are definitely worth playing and come at good prices. All of the previous plot threads are tied together, and a lot of information is revealed in this game that wouldn't make sense without playing the previous games first. \n\nThe story comes to a peak in this game in terms of emotion, and manages to tackle more serious themes skillfully. The characters are well-rounded and interesting as always, and the banter between Rosa and Joey is still present and brings great humor to lighten the mood. The final scenes of this game were very-well done and gave the series a proper grand finale that it deserved, but it can be a lot to handle at first after playing the previous games and becoming so attached to the characters. This is truly one of the few games that broke my heart. The entire series has made me greatly admire the skill and effort of Dave Gilbert and his team. \n\nI give this game a 10/10, and I strongly recommend the entire series to anyone who enjoys adventure games.", "timestamp_created": 1434606224, "timestamp_updated": 1434606224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16483200": {"recommendationid": "16483200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171665878", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480112600}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game saga from the start to the end. so tender in the mood and so strong in the contents. very funny moments with very touching too. you'll see an improvement of graphic, animation and attention to details and gameplay in each single episode. great work people! compliments!", "timestamp_created": 1434578838, "timestamp_updated": 1434578838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16453816": {"recommendationid": "16453816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042838346", "num_games_owned": 3679, "num_reviews": 186, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434476845}, "language": "french", "review": "The Blackwell Epiphany est le dernier jeu de la s\u00e9rie des Blackwell et il la conclue en beaut\u00e9, je peux vous le dire !\n\nRosa et Joey sont confront\u00e9s \u00e0 une affaire comme ils n'en ont jamais vue auparavant.

And it's impossible to talk about this game individually outside the context of the entire series.\n\nThe Blackwell games are the kind of games you enjoy while sipping on a smooth whiskey and listening to slow jazz. Luckily, the games' soundtracks provide some amazing jazz, so you only have to worry about the whiskey.\n\nThe art is a purposefully pixelated retro style, which works because the gameplay and philosophy behind it is very much in tune with the visually similar point-and-click adventure games of the 90's.\n\nThe puzzles can be occasionally obtuse and frustrating, but for the most part once you learn the mechanics you'll know what to do next. And if you don't, the one tried-and-true adventure game formula of exhausting all conversation options and trying to combine every item with everything interactable will inevitably work.\n\nWhere the game really shines is the voice acting. Dave Gilbert continually got very talented people to work with him and the games are so much better for it. Both Abe Goldfarb and Rebecca Whittaker deserve to win awards for their multiple performances.\n\nThe series just kept getting better and better, making Epiphany easily the best entry of them all. The story really shines when it gets dark and serious, and Epiphany succeeds tremendously there. I'm so glad the writing didn't shy away from some really rough places and concepts. Bravo for taking a risk and going there.\n\nThis game is like the icing on the layered cake of the whole series. Its creators should be very proud of it.

Those who expect a story arc which Deception somewhat started at the end will not find it there, instead it bring another, more Blackwell-ish, main story. It's one of the best adventure games recently too.\n\nThis game still uses same engine as other ones used, though support widescreen too, it was released only one year ago after all. Shift+Tab will still do a weird thing to the game, while pressing Tab key again would fix it. It also had more glitched and small bug than usual, like Durkin the detective still talking in location which he leaved if you phone or even game crashing when calling partner in some case, happened one time. Do save.\n\nBlackwell Epiphany is a big finale of a series and ends it on a high note. It's the most polished and ambitious game in the series, in pretty much every aspect. It didn't introduce any big new features in the gameplay, but continues what Deception figured for the best. Well, aside from having ability for Rose and Joey, the spirit guide, to explore multi-screen areas serapately, with new button to call your partner to the scene. Helps.\nAs modern adventure game, you can't die or get into dead end. Blackwell is fairly standart adventure game, somewhat. It uses inventory system much less, instead focusing on talking, getting notes, combining clues and searching Internet in your smartphone, with typing. As well as ability to switch character to Joey, though he still doesn't play as much part as Rose. Still does. Still teamwork.\n\nThe setting, whole setting of a game is telling you that the game it's the finale. Where the tale ends. Having a never ending night with snow falling, urban background with green pallette to it, it creates unique and dark, deep atmosphere. Not to mentioning that the pixel-art is the best here, very professional and has a great work put into lighting. No complaints about sprites, animation or background aside from nitpicking, it's just plain amazing!\nMusic delivers professional quality as well. It's dark and ambient, yet has moments of sadness and jazzyness, with electronica at intense moments. Even has some memoriable pieces.\n\nAnd plot is probably the biggest, best thing about this part. But immeditly I should warn you that it doesn't really follow what Deception set up to. Instead, Rose and Joey the spirit guide got even bigger problems to handle, as after solving the nice dark intro case they just had the most unlikely and logic shattering thing to happen right in front of their eyes, setting out to solve their final mystery. And well, plot is very emotional, especially to those who already got attached to pair of out heroes, it's just plain awesome and exciting. I wanted to clap at the final parts, especially at part where Joey and Rose had to act serapately, psychological thing. And an ending will not be just \"it's OK\" either, it will punch you into stomach. Whetever you like it or not, you still will not ignore it.\nAnd yes, the game mostly has a feel of mystery and ugency to it, slowing down in the middle only to deliver the traditional \"solve two ghost cases in same time\" thing, which is still welcome.\n\nAnd yes, the game still inclused commentary mode extra. In each area, you get to choose by yourself if you want to hear Voice Bloober, Artist Commentary or Game Designer Commentary. And yes, I feel it's more worth it this time, I got to enjoy hearing more about game design than just voice acting. It's great.\n\nReally, looking back, Blackwell is a great series and I got attached to it already. And it's one awesome finale. Will miss it. And maybe those loose plots will be delivered in another game, not related to Blackwell family itself...\n\nSo yes, highly recommended adventure game, but promise to beat the previous parts first.

Enter Joey Mallone, a ghost and spirit guide tied to the female members of the Blackwell family. When Rosa's aunt, Lauren Blackwell, passes after being in a coma for decades, Joey is 'released' from Lauren and enters Rosa's life. Details are revealed throughout the five installments of the Blackwell series regarding the female members of the Blackwell family, how Joey came to be, what happened to Aunt Lauren to trap her in a comatose state, etc. Together, Rosa and Joey seek out and help tormented ghosts trapped in the physical world cross over to \"the other side\" throughout the series. \n\nIn BLACKWELL EPIPHANY, the fifth and final installment of the game series. \nRosa\u2019s now fully embraced her quest to find trapped spirits in New York and help them to move on.  We finally discover the origins of the two most prominent characters of the series, and learn a little more about a shadowy organization that is the antithesis of everything Rosa and Joey stand for. Many answers to things will be brought to light which have been hanging over the series since it's inception. The Blackwell series has always been focused on human stories, which has made this series so special. It definitely stands strong on its own merits with the incredible writing of Dave Gilbert.\n\nEPIPHANY begins and immediately takes a serious dark turn when people's souls are ripped apart right in front of Rosa and Joey's eyes. And there's the ghost of a little girl which hits Rosa and Joey harder than others -- but, for the most part, not treated as all that different or special than the others along their journey.  Death is unfair. Rosa and Joey know and accept that. It's the race to get the little girl's ghost \u2018safe\u2019 before whatever is destroying souls can take her death as easily as it took her life. There are other ghosts to be dealt with, too. From the TV news anchor desperate to leave her past behind, to the brother and sister striving to deal with childhood abuse. \n\nHow does one end such a phenomenal series? When you get to the last act, everything kicks into high gear heading for the finish line ... the grand finale. And, wow! What a finale! The very last scene is ... dare I say ... perfect! \nThanks, Dave, for such a wonderful experience over the past decade with the Blackwell series. Kudos!!! \n\n(To enjoy the story at it's best, the games should be played in order of creation. 1st 'LEGACY' -- 2nd 'UNBOUND' which explores the events and time that Lauren Blackwell and Joey were working together in the 1970s (while Unbound turned out, unintentionally, to be a prequel to Legacy, it should be played after Legacy to not only help enlighten the player as to what happened in the first installment, but also gives the player clues as to what is coming in future installments) -- 3rd 'CONVERGENCE' which takes place about six months after the events in Legacy -- 4th 'DECEPTION' which takes place some time after Convergence -- and 5th 'EPIPHANY', which is the final installment in the Blackwell game series.)", "timestamp_created": 1420774455, "timestamp_updated": 1420774455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677753", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13873082": {"recommendationid": "13873082", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998412992", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420739544}, "language": "english", "review": "The Blackwell series are really great adventure games, and the finale is no exception.

The graphics are pixellated, in a style which is very reminiscent of the first and second Kyrandia games. I quite like it, and if you're a fan of that sort of thing, I'm sure you will too. If you DISlike pixellated graphics, don't let that dissuade you from buying this game.\n\nHowever, don't you DARE buy this game standalone. The bundle is not that expensive, so buy every game. It deserves that. After playing all the games coming before Epiphany, I grew to love the main two characters, and actually cared about them. That's rare for me because I generally dislike female leads. I can't talk much about the story because I don't want to spoil any of this amazing game or series, but once you get attached to the characters as I do, this game will break you.

strong modern Adventure series. I honestly think that the thing I liked most about the series was that some of the voice acting felt a bit stiff and 'un-professional'. I say that not as an insult, but as a compliment. Especially considering that Rosa went against the mold for a large number of reasons, I feel like it gave her a more natural feel. It carried a lot of the social-awkwardness, and really drove home that these were not heroes in a story; these were just people (and.... well, a few un-people) doing the best that they can in a world that despite their efforts continued to grow increasingly stranger and more dangerous. Most of the puzzles are simple, though considering the series is primarily story driven, that isn't a bad thing as it helps to keep the plot advancing. Admittedly, as all adventure games go there will be one or two puzzles in any of the games that can leave you scratching your head for a while.

It takes everything introduced in the previous four and makes it the biggest and best of the bunch. It ends on a bittersweet note, though it gives everything proper closure.\n\nThe Blackwell series has never been about the gameplay or the puzzles. At its core, it's truly been about the characters. Rosa Blackwell, Joey Mallone, and the rest felt real and believable. The dialogue reflected this wonderfully, and it was their personalities intertwined with the narrative that made the games a true delight. Though, I personally can't shake the feeling that there could have been more done with these characters, perhaps more focus on their behavior outside of matters concerning the plot. But, with what it is, it's executed masterfully.\n\nThe Blackwell series had me entirely engrossed in each and every installment with its genuine characters, interesting narrative, and shining quality and passion.

One. The only one that I could find anyway. I only really looked for it because I had a slight difficulty with something I missed. I'd seen what I needed to do earlier, I just didn't remember, probably because I'd run out of coffee quite a while ago.\n\nAnything I could rag on this game would pretty much be nitpicking. In all honesty, if this game made any screw-ups, they are no worse than certain AAA titles that get stupidly enormous amounts of undeserved praise. The ending wasn't perfect, I kinda saw it coming, but it gripped me and it didn't piss me off. Granted, yes, a few holes were left unfilled, but ultimately they can somewhat be ignored due to the way things were wrapped up being quite final. It did seem a tad abrupt, though, but I've seen far worse endings, believe me.\n\nThe gameplay tries to draw elements from all the previous titles and succeeds rather well. I felt it was a bit of a challenge without being completely convoluted and irrational as torturing your neighbor's dog for no reason, so I'm happy. At no point did I really need a guide, but nothing was excessively easy. This and the last game both did this pretty well, unlike Convergence which felt rather too straightforward to me.\n\nMaybe the series could have kept going, wrapped a few more loose-ends up, but overall I think this was a fine conclusion to an excellent series.

Rosa seems to less fleshed out in this version too. I can't quite put my finger on how but it just doesn't really feel very much like the character I was really liking in the other games. \n\nWithout getting into spoilers, the plot is a mess. The creator claims he had the ending planned all along but it certainly doesn't feel that way. Plot holes pop up all over the place and certain characters just all but vanish in the second part of the game. Everything feels very contrived and coincidental. There's also a point where all of the work you've been doing in the beginning of the game is completely wiped out. \n\nAs for gameplay. It drops a lot of the note taking and deduction stuff from the previous games for more nonsensical puzzles. Joey's blowing power either doesn't work on things you'd expect it to work on or does work on things that it shouldn't (Like blowing a surgical scalpel down a long hallway.) \n\nThe voice acting and art direction are still top notch as would be expected from a Wadjet Eye game, but in the end it just didn't really interest me the way the previous games did.", "timestamp_created": 1413911116, "timestamp_updated": 1413911116, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12576109": {"recommendationid": "12576109", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994638644", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416632105}, "language": "english", "review": "       A hugely enjoyable finale to the beloved series. It doesn't tie up every loose end, and not every plot development makes quite as much sense as you might like, but as a chance to reconnect with these characters and see them through one last, sweeping adventure, it is not to be missed. The voice acting and pixel-art backgrounds have never been better, and the story itself is longer by far than any of the previous entries, giving you chance to really lose yourself in the spectral mysteries and companionable snark of the Blackwell world.  If you enjoyed the other Blackwell games, it is unthinkable that you will not get a tremendous kick out of this one.\n\nQ. I liked some of the other Blackwell games, but not all. Which features does this use?\nA.You can still swap between Rosa and Joey, you can use inventory objects on the outside world, and you can once again combine entries in your notes to make fresh deductions (a feature I deeply missed). The art is SVGA-ish pixel art, as opposed to the cartoony drawings in some versions of earlier games, and as I say, it's probably the best art in the series (though the oddly stiff walk animation from Deception seems to have lingered just a bit).\n\nQ. Do I have to play the other games first?\nA. Technically no- most major plot points are recapped or alluded to in the game. You will, at the very least, be able to follow the gist of the story. But why punish yourself that way? The earlier games are funny, clever, and quick to play, and give the events of Epiphany a real impact.

If you do choose to pick up this game, try not to look things up unless you're really stuck - the feeling of solving a tricky puzzle is worth it.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this series to any fans of old point and click games, ghost stories, or anyone just any game with a good story in general.", "timestamp_created": 1411618740, "timestamp_updated": 1411618740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500204", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12185404": {"recommendationid": "12185404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000802368", "num_games_owned": 1553, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411386068}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0445  \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044f\u0445 \u0411\u043b\u044d\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435, \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c-\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0443 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u041d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439. \u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442, \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043a, \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0439. \u0413\u0438\u043b\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435, \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u044b\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0439. \u041d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u044b \u0411\u043b\u044d\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435. \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0439.", "timestamp_created": 1411386651, "timestamp_updated": 1411386651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565117", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12138192": {"recommendationid": "12138192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032034509", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411043697}, "language": "german", "review": "Gro\u00dfartiges Ende einer gro\u00dfartigen Serie. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1411043764, "timestamp_updated": 1411043764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12089858": {"recommendationid": "12089858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025050975", "num_games_owned": 720, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410644053}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

I may be writing a review for this game, however, it revolves around the entire series as a whole and should be played as such.  From the start, you realize this is just like any point and click adventure from old.  The minimalist approach to the interface is overshadowed by the thought and heart poured into a truely enticing story and wonderful characters.  I do recommend you start with the first entry, and enjoy the ride for the entirety.\n\nDoes that sound too good?  Well, realize, this is actually a review, not just gushing compliments of a few aspects of the game.\n\nOnce you take the plunge in the first game (the first in the series, not the precursor game which I did not know about till I completed the 5 Blackwell games), you will get a sense that the creators want you to learn, and the tutorial aspect is not necessary.  It takes a bit, but once you get into the swing of things, you will start combining notes, using the few items you collect in the game properly, and later in the series, you will get the hang of swapping between your main character and their  ghostly companion.\n\nThe weaknesses of each series seems to be repeated.  I personally felt that some of the 'puzzles' were simply 'do in the right order no matter what information the player has seen', 'luckily you clicked the right notes in the right order' or even 'glad you visited this person now after you did one thing' to progress.  Later entries in the series seemed to try for less linearity, however, it really boils down to perfect order.  Maniac Mansion, this is not.\n\nThe story, characters and a large portion of the quests, however, make up for the handful of blunders.  I won't spoil the series ending, but be prepared, it is a doozy.\n\n`Rogerztheurbanlegend", "timestamp_created": 1408428326, "timestamp_updated": 1408428326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11671609": {"recommendationid": "11671609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015037096", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1399202500}, "language": "english", "review": "anyone annoyed by the fact that this game didn't have anything to do with finding out what that group from the last game? this is still a phenominal game and if you are a fan of the series so far you will love this.", "timestamp_created": 1407826283, "timestamp_updated": 1407826283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11609821": {"recommendationid": "11609821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047046700", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409891256}, "language": "english", "review": "If Deception was serious and dark, Epiphany is heartwrenching and tearjerking.

Gameplay proceeds along similar terms to previous installments, with puzzles requiring the use of Rosa's phone and the odd leap of logic to solve.

It has a very Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows feel in that it's really designed for the fans who've played through the first four--while I wouldn't recommend it, it IS possible to play Unbound, Convergence, and Deception without first playing Legacy. Epiphany really needs to be played last to be satisfying.\n\nSpelling this out: DO NOT PLAY THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE OTHER BLACKWELL GAMES FIRST.\n\nOverall, I basically love everything about Epiphany... except... I've listened to the commentary, and I understand the reason for the ending, but... I really wanted it to end differently. It's such a Deus Ex Machina, besides being the least probable outcome [even being a series about ghosts and mediums], and... I dunno. I do get and like the imagery and respect how that's the only way it could happen--it's just kind of... aww.\n\nThe commentary is particularly insightful at the third act twist [where the Epiphany is explained], and I highly recommend listening to it if you have the chance.

If you've been reading these in order, you already know my scoring philosophy and standards.\n\nStory: I don't normally do this first. The normal structure of these reviews is Gameplay, Story, Graphics, Audio. For this game, though... I've gotta bring the story top and center. Deception left me with a feeling of disappointment on the story front, especially after Convergence and its utter excellency. This game does have a few not so compelling spots, but I like to think that's for pacing's sake. The high points are well worth any wait, and they most definitely make up for any minor blemishes this game has. It does jump the shark a little bit at the end, but for drama's sake, it's top notch. I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a little choked up at the end. What that one reviewer said was right, though. This really is an incredibly satisfying ending to a series which has always been about pretty great writing. 10/10.\n\nGameplay: We've also gone back to the quality of puzzles in Convergence. They all make sense, don't require any incredible leaps of logic (despite a few instances where my solution would've worked just as well as the game's), and are often quite clever. 8/10.\n\nGraphics: The art in this game is quite frankly amazing. All the characters and backgrounds have a great amount of detail to them, the art is very clean yet stylized, and it all just looks great. 5/5.\n\nSound: Voice acting: perfect. Music: Perfect.

Or I could also evoke Goodbye Deponia.\n\nThe conclusion of Blackwell Epiphany is anticlimatic, lacks catharsis, and is somewhat depressing and discouraging. I'm not petitioning for a happier ending, but even for a deliberate \"bad end\", it's badly executed, and falls short of whatever you might be expecting or hoping after Blackwell Deception.\n\nBlackwell Deception spoilers ahead, and some hints at the ending of Epiphany...\n[spoiler]As you remember from Deception, Gavin was totally freaked out when we took him to the spirit world, saying that he's not supposed to be there, hinting at some kind of contract that forbids this... And true enough, he was torn apart there and then.\nNow, given the slight hints at things going on behind the scenes, I was expecting a spiritual conspiracy drama, some kind of detective mystery, with superhuman, and potentially divine powers moving the pieces from behind the scenes. I mean come on, if you like conspiracy stories, what better than a conspiracy God himself may be in on. I was really curious about the \"They\" mentioned by both Gavin, and the first victim we meet in Epiphany...\nWell, drop any expectation, because they are going to be betrayed. There IS no \"they\". The solution of the mystery is so incredibly inane and bad, that I could only liken it to a \"the butler did it\" moment. And in this mystery, it is not through investigation and clever handling of clues that the butler is uncovered by Sherlock Holmes or Poirot. Naaah. The butler just confesses without warning.\nAnd yeah, the conclusion that follows is pretty cliched and not thought through AT ALL. Not to mention being quite similar to bloody Mass Effect 3.

It runs longer than its predecessors, and features all the staple mechanics of the series: you have your Joey and your Rosa, you solve mysteries and save ghosts, and you engage in lots of conversations with a colourful cast of New Yorkers. What is noteworthy, however, is what the game *doesn't* contain; specifically, it doesn't really address the major cliffhanger set up at the end of Blackwell Deception, opting instead for an entirely different (and rather more cosmic) climax. There are also a few moments where the game just seems to \"forget\" about a character or a plot point, and a somewhat annoying \"cheat\" right at the game's final puzzle, where all of a sudden a staple mechanic from the series works a different way from how it always has. Those are minor annoyances, though, and overall the gameplay is smooth and engaging, and the dialogue is brilliant. The voicework by Rebecca Whittaker and Abe Goldfarb has come a *very* long way since Legacy, and is now quite good. Plotwise, there is one major twist that is far too obvious, but several surprises, and an ending that is probably not at all what you're expecting.\n\nOverall, I'd give Blackwell Epiphany 4/5. It's quite a good game, but it seems to be perhaps a bit too ambitious; it's like there was too much stuff trying to cram its way in.

Epiphany's story takes some very dark turns, even moreso than previous entries, but is underpinned by the uplifting relationship between Rosangela and Joey.  The development of the main characters, and their friendship with eachother is done very well and you really care about them individually and as a team by the end.  The soundtrack is great.

If you've played other games in the series you'll know what you're getting into, but to put it simply this is Wadjet Eye's finest work to date - a point and click game that I can easily recommend alongside classics in the genre.\n\nOnce again, players take on the roles of both Rosa Blackwell and Joey Mallone, their job is, as always to help lost souls move on, and as before there are a large number of ghosts that need saving, each with a different story to tell. Unlike previous games, all the ghosts in this game tie directly into the primary overarching narrative, adding considerable gravitas to proceedings and helping to shake things up. There is some assumption of prior knowledge of the series, the game doesn't waste time retreading how Rosa and Joey do their jobs but instead dives right into the main course. In terms of gameplay. The dual characters mechanic returns once again and players must make use of both Rosa's and Joey's different abilities to solve puzzles and overcome dialogue based obstacles throughout the game. Puzzles are for the most part fairly simple, there's no hair tearing moments and bizarre solutions to impede your progress - for the most part everything is pretty logical. The clue system from previous games returns, requiring players to combine topics/clues from their in game notes page to determine links and hypothesise potential solutions to problems. This works well for the most part, with Joey again serving as an in-game hints system that the player can utilise as much or as little as they desire. The focus here is very much on the story, there are also plenty of references to previous games for fans yet the game is also strong enough to stand on its own.\n\nIn terms of game length, the game feels longer than previous entries, I think Wadjet has finally hit upon the optimal length for its games with Epiphany after previous entries were criticised for their short length. The narrative and writing quality are consistent throughout, Wadjet Eye have been going from strength to strength with this series and Epiphany is no exception. I did notice a new mechanic in play early in the game, where the two leads would spontaneously begin short, unprompted banters discussing their current location, etc, not unlike the party banter systems employed in several rpgs. Sadly this fizzled out quite quickly and is only seen in the first third of the game.\n\nThe artwork in Epiphany is fantastic throughout, it's building on a similar aesthetic to Blackwell Deception but everything is more detailed and beautifully rendered in pixel art. They've found a really great style to use (and artist to bring it to life) and they neatly sidestep the animation issues that many other modern point and clicks exhibit because of it. Hoping to see future games maintain the same style and level of quality.\n\nThe music is nice and fits well with the tone of the game for the most part, it did seem to be a little on the quiet side this time around and is very much in the background for most of game. In terms of other audio - Wadjet's voice acting on the technical side of things has come a long way now, there's none of the issues the plagued earlier entries to be found here which is great. All series regulars reprise their roles in Epiphany and they all give solid performances.\n\nIn terms of story, this being the final game in the series, Epiphany wraps up the Blackwell series and answers most of the questions you might have had. I won't lie though, I wish we'd have seen some more entries to the series before the finale.\n\nSadly there is one significant dropped plot arc which occurs (or rather should have occurred) between Deception and Epiphany that I felt hurt the continuity between those two games somewhat. Based on the ending of Deception and where Epiphany picks up it felt that we'd skipped a step in the story of Rosa and Joey and just leapt from there to the series finale, which is an unusual and unfortunate misstep. Aside from this one issue the series as a whole flows nicely from one game to the next. I won't talk about the ending here as I think that's something best experienced and I don't want to colour anyone's view on it, suffice it to say I felt it was a fitting ending but it's not the one I would have gone with.\n\nThere's always been a certain sense of familiarity with the Blackwell series and the protagonists thankless task of helping the dead move on all the while the hustle and bustle of New York. There's something that's quite grounded in reality about the series that makes it quite endearing and relaxing to play, this is underlined through Dave Gilbert's commentaries that are embedded within each game you really get a sense that you're experiencing these locations through his memories and the series as a whole just really has a sort of personal touch that's difficult to describe and I don't often see/feel in most games. That, married with the real world setting really heightened the experience for me across the Blackwell series.\n\nUltimately, Blackwell Epiphany is highly recommended, as a fan of the series this was a deeply satisfying game to play.

I was introduced to this series a meager four days ago. I was intrigued by the old-school point and click \"talkies\" I had grown up with on old CD-ROMs from Fate of Atlantis through the Monkey Island series all the way to the newer Telltale Games products. I hardly knew what I was getting myself into.\n\nThe Blackwell series stars the Blackwell family, mainly Rosa and introducing her Aunt, Lauren, in Unbound. At some point in the past, their Grandmother suddenly became saddled with a ghost, Joey, who was her spirit guide. Unable to take the pressure (limiting plot spoilers), she died and Joey passed onto the aunt. It turned out he is a spirit guide, destined to guide Mediums like the series protaganist Rose to lead lost spirits to the final destination.\n\nThis is where the puzzle element comes into play. Like most adventure games, you interact with the environment through investigation, item manipulation and conversing with other characters. The first game in the series, Legacy, is fairly light on puzzles and is easily completed, but the series quickly grows into a satisfying old-school adventure title as the series progresses. Epiphany is the masterstroke of the series in this regard, with multi-threaded and complex puzzle threads that still fit well within the realm of logic.\n\nHowever, where the series truly shines is in the storytelling. The writing, character development and accompanying voice acting is near perfection. The series easily hooks you into the characters and makes you care about them. The slow reveal of the history, feelings, pain and emotion of each character over each of the five games easily drew me into the Blackwell world. With Epiphany, the entire series wrapped up in a way few games, movies or even television shows could ever hope - satisfying, even if bittersweet.\n\nThere are a couple of hiccups in the game, primarily in code bugs in Unbound that cause voice tracks to trigger improperly, one being an ugly spoiler mid-way through that gave away part of a conversation from the game's finale, but otherwise is solidly coded and well designed. The graphics may also be a bit of a put-off to more modern gamers since it is intentionally created in a low resolution, non-widescreen format to mimic the old CRT monitors some of us older gamers were stuck with nearly two decades ago. But the artwork presented in close-ups, photos, desktop backrounts, and other areas is fantastic and feels alive.\n\nI whole heartedly recommend the entire five game series. Go back to the Blackwell Legacy and pick it up from there and don't stop until you finish up Epiphany. The game is a well build emotional ride with solid puzzle mechanics fit for a good old school adventure game. From someone used to adventure games being the high-energy comedy like Day of the Tentacle, The Blackwell series was a huge surprise.

While Blackwell Epiphany was my first experience with the series, it was clear in no time that the writers at Wadjet Eye Games were raising the stakes in Epiphany higher than they ever dared to raise them before. With guest appearances by characters from way back from the first game, Blackwell Epiphany powerfully and poetically concludes a game series which has lasted nearly a decade.\n\nBlackwell Epiphany is a point-and-click adventure where players control two protagonists (Rosalinda \"Rosa\" Blackwell and her ghost sidekick, Joey) who are tasked with finding restless spirits and guiding them to the afterlife to finally find peace. While Epiphany does feature a few puzzles, a staple of the point-and-click genre, the majority of \"puzzles\" involve uncovering facts by grinding characters for information, and conducting online research through Rosa's smartphone. About halfway through the game I fell into the rhythm of searching online, checking with the police, and asking suspects about a new piece of information I had uncovered. By the end of Epiphany I felt like I was ready to be a paranormal investigator myself. \n\nBoth Joey and Rosa come with their own set of abilities which they can use in the hunt for information. Rosa comes equipped with her smartphone, which is the information hub of the game, and an always-warm cup of coffee that is used a handful of times during puzzles. Joey, being a ghost, has the unique ability to traverse through solid walls and locked doors, allowing Joey to discover information that Rosa may not have direct access to. Joey can also use his ghostly form to stir up a weak gust of wind in order to move small objects. In one case, I used Joey to blow a glass off of a table in order to distract the bartender, allowing Rosa to slip by unnoticed. \n\nThe game takes place across real-world New York, and players familiar with the region may recognize a few landmarks. Turning on the commentary feature in the options menu will illuminate many real-world inspirations the game designers had for the game. I would even recommend playing through the game for the first time with the commentary, especially if you are not the sort of player who plays through a game a second time. Hearing first-hand from the designers and developers at Wadjet Eye Games really adds a level of personality to the game that would be impossible to inject otherwise. \n\nBeyond the inspired plot settings, the game's dialog is the highpoint of Blackwell Epiphany. The banter between Rosa and Joey keeps an otherwise gloomy game lighthearted. Joey, in particular, made me wish I had a snappy ghost sidekick to follow me around through my daily life. \n\nThe great writing extends to many of the supporting characters as well. The five stages of loss (denial, anger, depression, bargaining, and acceptance) are all well represented within the characters of this game, and the voice actors present believable and at times, moving, performances throughout the entire game. \n\nBlackwell Epiphany does suffer a pretty substantial blow to its presentation in the form of a locked low-resolution issue. This issue has to do with Epiphany's game engine, Adventure Game Studio. On larger monitors, the game does not look great when run in fullscreen. A solution I found was to go to the game's properties in Steam, then to Launch Options, and type in \"-windowed\" to force the game to run in a small window. The end result looked much better, albeit it was about a fifth the size of my screen.\n\nAs a newcomer to the series, I was afraid that much of Epiphany's tension would be lost on me as I had not experienced the buildup of the previous four games. But with such likeable protagonists, puzzles that elucidated the story further rather than slow it down, and plot twist after plot twist, by the finale I felt like I was part of Rosa and Joey's story. I felt like I was right there with them at the end when...well, you'll just have to see for yourself.\n", "timestamp_created": 1398357954, "timestamp_updated": 1398357954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9915719": {"recommendationid": "9915719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083072026", "num_games_owned": 885, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398312320}, "language": "english", "review": "A supremely satisfying end to the Blackwell series.

Puzzles were complex but not so much to where I gave up, voice acting was well done, and it had a very rich story line. I love entertainment that focuses on spirit guides, death and helping others move on (Ghost Whisperer, Dead Like Me). I love how dynamic the relationship is betweein Joey and Rosa, and enjoyed watching their chemsitry grow, and really become a wonderful team. I felt engaged in what they were doing, and was sucked in pretty quickly when I was playing.\n\nHowever, I was not as happy with the ending of the series. It felt...depressingly cliche. I wish there could have been multiple endings, where you could choose a few different paths.  I was left feeling melochalonic,  and honestly a smidge angry that is how it ended.  And it left me wanting to play again, but frustrated that I can't do anything to change the outcome, which I did not like. I was also left with wanting to know more about the whole spirit guide element thing worked, meet other mediums/bestowers, what's going on with the soul munchers...Epiphany felt a little jammed compared to the others in the series.  Wacky stuff kind of came out of nowhere, and it went from \"let's save souls\" to \"let's throw in a bunch of supernatural stuff and not really explain it.\" \n\nOverall, I really loved it until about 2/3 of the Epiphany. I wasn't thrilled with how it ended, and how many questions I still have. And the ending in general...But, give it a try, regardless.", "timestamp_created": 1518507667, "timestamp_updated": 1518507667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39898151": {"recommendationid": "39898151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035541290", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517956346}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're a fan of point-and-click adventures, definitely give this series a shot. Don't play Epiphany yet, though. Start with Blackwell Legacy, then Unbound, Convergence, and Deception. This is the final episode of the series and ties together a number of plot points introduced in the earlier installations. The premise of the series is that you play as a \"spirit medium\" in NYC who helps confused souls remember their identities and move on from the physical realm. With the opportunity to watch the growth of the dynamic between the medium and her spirit partner, a gradually unfolding, tightly written story, and dry humour, the Blackwell series is easily one of my favourite point-and-click games.\n\nStory-wise, Blackwell Epiphany is a nicely written, fitting end to a lovingly crafted series. I've followed the Blackwell games since the first game came out and it's been a pleasure to watch the games and developer grow with each iteration. Even though I preordered this game, I've held off playing Epiphany for nearly 4 years since I didn't want the story to end, but ultimately I'm glad I did play and finish it and am quite satisfied with the conclusion.\n\nThe voice acting is solid, the puzzles are pretty standard for the series (ie, not challenging and quite logical). There were a few points where I got stuck in terms of gathering clues, but the in-game hint system was generally helpful. It's safe to say that if you liked the earlier Blackwell games, you'll enjoy this one as well.", "timestamp_created": 1517960500, "timestamp_updated": 1517960500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39881469": {"recommendationid": "39881469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043108500", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517895779}, "language": "english", "review": "Do NOT play this until you finish the other previous installments before this one.

On sale it was a no-brainer, but this is one of the few games I would pay full price too.\n\nIt does have a bit of a learning curve, though the exploration of how the world works is part of the fun.

A badly thought out fight can turn out sour, leaving you scraping for resources while trying to avoid enemies.\nGranted, bottlenecking is mostly the strongest strategy especially in early floors where enemies possess simple weapons incapable of piercing walls and don't have explosives. The reason why combat encounters are so dangerous is because:\n\nYou are Cogmind, the little robot that could...\n..attach parts to itself, as well as detach them, making you one versatile and dashing metal box. There is no XP, no levels, only parts. And you WILL lose them. And you will replace them. \nParts can be obtained by scavenging them off other robots, which requires destroying them, or lying around the Complex 0b10 in caches. So combat is not all bad, you get some replacement parts back, but they can be damaged or destroyed in the fight, just like yours.\nOnce you get to know which kinds of robots use what parts you can start hunting for specific robots based on your needs.\nYou will have to combine both methods of part scavenging, as neither robots nor caches alone are a completely reliable way of obtaining optimal parts. There are also fabricators that can construct parts from schematics that can be obtained by hacking terminals. It's well possible to make specialized specs, but be always ready to change up to a plan B.\nThe two obvious ways to play are stealth and combat. Playing as a big tank that carries a bunch of weapons is very easy to start off with, but destroying a lot of enemies raises your alarm level high, which makes the central AI of the complex recognize you as a real threat and send harder and more enemies against you. This means you don't want to fight every patrol you come up against, not only will you be risking your valuable utility parts but making future floors even more difficult. You can pick what to fight by using some sensors to feel upcoming areas, don't load your utility slots with only combatitive parts.\nStealth is harder to learn how to play, you will have to pay a lot of attention to how the enemy AI behaves in different situations and come up with strategies to either go unseen or distract enemies. Speed and scanners are essential for spotting enemy patrols and you can then wait them out in a room, but that is boring, goot thing the game allows for more creative stealth strategies. One of my favorite \"stealth\" strategies is connecting hallways and rooms by carving tunnels using grenades or rockets to avoid going into hazardous areas. This does cause a lot of noise and has to be timed correctly, don't want a passing patrol come investigate the explosions.\n\nThere are many other aspects to Cogmind like the floors that grow different and more difficult in many ways as you make your escape from 0b10, branching side areas that lead to new story paths, terminals that can be hacked for various useful things, resource management in the form of energy/matter/heat systems and much more", "timestamp_created": 1514425632, "timestamp_updated": 1514498288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38751994": {"recommendationid": "38751994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014442584", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 828, "last_played": 1514779913}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game and worth the price.

Your capabilities are defined by the items you acquire. There is no experience (no grinding!), you gain 'levels' by climbing to the next floor. This system makes various builds equally viable: combat, speed, stealth, all sorts of hybrids and so on. \n\nItems are not just stats +X. You will balance energy output, heat generation and support with your combat capabilities, speed and information gathering capabilities. There are over a thousand different items: weapons, power sources, cooling, propulsion, sensors, armors, shields, hackware, build and repair utilities and many, many more. Each item has a cost to use it, with more powerful items typically having bigger costs. There are various synergies and you can get some sick combos! But don't get too attached to the components you currently own, because sooner or later they WILL get destroyed. That's why you constantly need to acquire new parts (they are everywhere!) to rebuild yourself, sometimes completely respecializing to a different build type (You were a heavy tank, machine of destruction, but after a particularly tough fight not much is left of you? Time to become an ultra light jet that zips past enemies before they get a chance to act!).\n\nLevels are procedurally generated, parts you find are randomly chosen, encounters are random (reasonably!). Each playthrough will be different and you will never get bored of it. Even veterans find early levels non-trivial and thus replaying the game is interesting, challenging and fun at all times.\n\nThere is an exciting backstory which you discover as you play. With each run you find something new and new things just keep coming! It's actually really fun to hunt for these lore pieces as you play.\n\nThis game is 'turn based', but you're not waiting for your opponents to move between your turns. Everything happens immediately. If you can click fast enough, you could do a 100 turns per second. Only when you need more time to make a decision (or contemplate your inevitable doom) the game will slow down for you. Think of this 'turn based' system more like an active pause - you get as much time as you want when you want it, but otherwise game moves forward smoothly. Even better - you can fast-forward less exciting parts like exploration (when nothing of interest is found) or waiting for that patrol to pass by.\n\nI love this game: it's unique, it's challenging, I get to manage the risks I take, story is awesome and game is hugely replayable!\n\nThis game however is not for everyone and here I'd like to point out some common reasons not to buy this game (if applicable to you; you are the final judge):\n[list]\n\t[*]Randomness - there's a lot of randomness: floor layouts, encounters, parts you find. It's not a slot-machine-kind random. It's more like some card games randomness (i.e. Hearthstone). You get to make your choices and manage your risks at all times. You are guaranteed to get something and if you're versatile enough, you will get something useful. But hoping to get a very specific item will not get you this specific item most of the time. \n\t[*]Permadeath - you will die a lot and then you will need to start from a scratch. Game is designed around this, so that repeating early levels is not boring, but still challenging even after dozens of times. Having fun in such games is a matter of mindset. Remember: you are not supposed to win this game. Have fun trying out new builds and optimizing old ones. Think how can you improve, what tactics and strategies can you deploy. Learn from your loss. Try beating your previous score. I'll repeat: you are not supposed to win. Thinking otherwise will bring disappointment to you.\n\t[*]Graphics - you can see it in the screenshots and it's a common thing to drive players away from games like this one. Decide whether you're fine with it.\n\t[*]Font size - BIG WARNING HERE: UI is designed to have a certain minimum number of rows and many smaller screens (including some laptops) cannot fit this many rows of readably large font. Check this [url=http://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/ui_preview.html]link (provided in the game description as well)[/url] to see how this game will look on your screen.\n\t[*]Keybindings - There are multiple predefined control schemes, including pure mouse, pure keyboard, Vi keys. Custom keybindings [strike]are not a thing[/strike] require manually changing files and some players are complaining about it.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1514212553, "timestamp_updated": 1514242188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546006", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38404117": {"recommendationid": "38404117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263387850", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2300, "last_played": 1514224058}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1513619879, "timestamp_updated": 1513619879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38394014": {"recommendationid": "38394014", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975289532", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 627, "last_played": 1514311930}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been a casual fan of traditional roguelikes for a long time, and it's been fun to see the genre get picked up and taken in new directions, though it's often been through a mashup of genres\u2014e.g.The Binding of Isaac\u2014which results in fun and interesting games which owe a debt of inspiration to rogulikes but ultimately are something quite different. Cogmind, however, is a traditional roguelike that evolves the genre.\n\nIt has a terrific UI. As advertised the game takes full advantage of mouse or keyboard modes of input. Both modes are comfortable and it is great to see a roguelike taking advantage of drag-and-drop and right click context menus. My favorite method of input is still the keyboard. I never need to reach for the mouse and I am not missing anything. All of the contextual information and ease of use provided by the mouse has equivalents within the keyboard controls. It is really nicely done.\n\nAt its heart, Coglike is a game of exchangeable parts. You build yourself up out of the pieces of your slain enemies. (Or, sometimes the quasi-innocent bystanders that are busy doing their own jobs.) The variety of items feels expansive, and there are numerous item interactions\u2014not the charming but frustratingly opaque interactions of Nethack, but of a more narrowly logical variety; i.e. some items make other items work better. Will there be surprises? Or are the surprises reserved for the story line?\n\nWe are not told what the point of the game is. There is no Amulet of Yendor driving the action of Cogmind. We just know we need to get out, to do something, to go somewhere. Discovering what Cogmind is about is one of the mysteries of Cogmind. Who is Cogmind? What is the context and history of this world? Is it Earth? When is it? I frankly do not know whether Cogmind is a freedom fighter or an evil robot. Delicious little bits of data are dropped from time to time, like breadcrumbs leading... somewhere.\n\nThere are a couple areas where I could dream of having a little more quality of life customizability, of the kind which I can provide myself in other roguelikes that run within a terminal emulator: fonts and colors.\n\nThe Cogmind screen is dense with information. There is a map, and surrounding it are panels containing various textual elements. I prefer ASCII graphics in roguelikes because they remain crisp and clear, and are easily identifiable at much smaller sizes than graphic sprites. Tiles may be pretty, but they are less distinct and require more detail to deliver the equivalent information. At 1920x1080 on a 24\" screen I find myself wishing I could make the map font smaller and the text font slightly larger. And while I might kind of wish that I could substitute my own favorite font variants, the game does include a large number of fonts of various sizes and visual characteristics which can be used for the panels of text. The map font currently defaults to a square sci-fi themed font. That it is square is a good thing, as it makes the map tidily grid-like, but I find the letter shapes trade a little bit of clarity for aesthetics. \n\n[Update\u2014See my comments to Kyzrati re: the map font. TL;DR: Give the default map font some time. The glyphs may not have the kind of clarity desirable for reading text, but as isolated entities on a map they are really quite good and they support the aesthetics of the game.]\n\nThe other element I would prefer some control over is the color palette. When playing roguelikes in a traditional terminal emulator I typically create a profile with a color palette that has just the right amount of contrast for my monitor and for my eyes. This, again, is due to day-long work sessions staring at a screen that wants to burn my eyes out. With Cogmind I find some of the colors, particularly the lighter green, becomes a little bright and tiring after a while. And though it would probably be aesthetic anathema, I might really prefer not to have to stare at green on black. Aesthetically it is the right choice. It has the right sensibility for the game. But strictly in terms of ease of viewing, a sea of green on black can be a bit much after a long day. \n\nThese really are minor complaints however, in a UI that is far superior to any traditional roguelike I\u2019ve ever played. A lot of effort has been invested in making the game as interactive and user friendly as it is, and I do not want to appear unappreciative of this. And I suspect these are things that may be addressed with a future modding API. The developer is incredibly responsive and present in the community. \n\nCogmind is a lot of fun and I look forward to spending plenty of time with it. Maybe one day I'll escape, or transcend, or destroy the whole damned place.

You can equip your bot to be a fast flying hacker, or a tank treading missile launcher and many more!\n\nThis game does not feel like an Early Access or Beta. It is fully playable, fun, with no bugs (as far as I have seen).\nIt is an amazing traditional Roguelike with modern design and usability.\nIt is deep, full of theme, great animations and sound.\n\nPros\n- Active and transparent developer.\n- User friendly UI\n- Deep gameplay mechanics\n- Lots of surprises if you can live long enough to find them\n- Story and lore to keep you coming back to learn more\n- Very challenging\n\nCons\n- Small font might make it inaccessible to some people.\n- So far there is not much music (plenty of great sound effects though)\n- Very challenging (this could be a pro or con depending on your tastes)\n\nLong review.\nI first heard about this game on Steam and quickly starting looking in to Let's Plays and reading about it.\nI have had a hard time finding a traditional Roguelike that I enjoyed. Most had bad UI or bad controls or just did not provide enough of something new each time to interest me. I very much enjoy many modern rogueLITES (ftl, dungeon of the endless, steredenn, enter the gungeon etc..) So the ideas of traditional roguelikes are very appealing to me but most have failed to provide the experience I was hoping for.\n\nCogmind has since changed that. It provides a great focus on usability and player feedback. Animations and sounds all provide the player with the theme and feedback that makes it \"feel\" polished. Each time I play I find a bit of lore or an npc or surprise event that I have never experienced before. This really encourages that \"one more turn/floor\" feeling.\n\nCogmind requires a lot of inventory management and you will be constently making decisions on what to keep and how to \"build\" your robot. There are many \"systems\" that interact with each other and learning how everything works is a big part of Cogmind (and roguelikes in general).\n\nTrying new and weird things is encouraged by this game. After each death (and there will be many) I always think of what new \"thing\" I could try.  New robot build, new tactic, new path through the world, how do I get back to that awesome event that I just found...\n\nThe developer has been working for several years and has released a fully playable game. Why it's even early access I don't know. Just know there is more \"stuff\" to come.\n\nI feel comfortable recommending this game in Early Access at Full Price! It is well worth it. You can also check out the Gridsage game website to provide the dev with more support if you are able.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513293368, "timestamp_updated": 1513293368, "voted_up": true,

Despite nominally being in Early Access, the amount of content and level of polish is high.  You play a lone robot trying to escape from hostile territory one floor at a time.  The gameplay blends traditional roguelike elements (turn-based combat on a grid, procedural generation, permadeath) with a unique equipment and build system.  \n\nYour capabilities are basically entirely determined by the items you have equipped.  You need to balance concerns such as mobility, vulnerability of systems to damage, and heat accumulation.  Almost every item is obtained by random stockpiles or scavenged from fallen enemies, and your equipped parts inevitably get damaged and destroyed in combat.  This means that you often have to improvise your loadout based on what is on hand.  As you ascend you choose which types of equipment slots (power, propulsion, utility, or weapons) to add.\n\nLike a number of games in the genre, Cogmind is quite difficult.  There are two easier difficulty settings if you are just starting out or wanting a more casual experience, but the standard game mode is quite unforgiving.  The complex is essentially a simulated ecosystem, filled with both noncombatant and security robots.  The more disruptive you are, the more the general alert level rises, leading to more and more dangerous enemies hunting you down.  Thus, even combat-focused builds are incentivized to avoid unnecessary encounters.  Staying on any given level for longer than absolutely necessary (for example, if you're looking to enter or avoid a particular branch) is a deliberate risk. \n\nThe game is a traditional roguelike in its presentation, which is to say that the graphics options are 'ASCII characters only' and '2d tiles'.  Note that the game is fixed around displaying a certain grid size, so the game can look compressed on small displays.  My experience with a small screen is that the ASCII mode is quite readable, but if this is a potential concern you should examine full-resolution screenshots to evaluate this issue for yourself.  While the graphics aren't fancy, the green terminal aesthetic is immersive, especially combined with the excellent sound design.\n\nThe controls have two modes.  The mouse mode is intuitive and good for anyone starting out with this game or roguelikes in general, and the traditional roguelike keyboard mode is well-optimized for veterans, albeit more complex.  Customizing keybinds is an option, although it's a little arcane.\n\nDue to its unique mechanics, I recommend Cogmind wholeheartedly for anyone interested in roguelikes.  Anyone interested in a system for customizing their own robot a la Battletech should take a look as well.  The game has a large amount of content (much of it in optional branches outside of the main path of levels) and also has superb replayability due to both procedural generation and strategic depth.\n\nNote: My 'Hours Played' statistic on Steam does not account for the fact that I play the game with the Steam client inactive.  I run the game on a Mac using a Wineskin (which works well), and have over 30 hours of playtime (which is admittedly only enough to scratch the surface of the game).", "timestamp_created": 1512264955, "timestamp_updated": 1512264955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38016759": {"recommendationid": "38016759", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994311164", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508442572}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is in late stages of EA.

The setting, sparse lore (somewhat like Dark Souls the plot is revealed in small snippets and item or environmental clues, very little is forced on you), and mechanics are all master classes in design and implementation.\n\nThe game is hard, you will die a lot. When you're first beginning and are still learning the mechanics it will often seem completely random when you perish. Fret not, as soon as the mechanics start to make sense and you figure out how the gear works you'll realize that there are a plethora of resources available. If you've played Don't Starve it mirrors that beginner's experience in a lot of ways. At first it seems almost impossible to scrape through winter, or the first 3 levels of Cogmind, but after a little experience you'll see resources everywhere. Unlike the traditional rogue-likes, games like Nethack or Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, Cogmind has much better balance and there's not really any filler gear that isn't very useful. Moreover, the awesome mechanics of the game allow an insane amount of characer customization without using experince points or needing any grinding. Its a hard mechanic to describe and you'll have more fun figuring it out yourself so I'll leave it at that. \n\nThe interface makes you feel like an operator in the Matrix, the whole aesthetic is simply awesome. While the game has no music at the moment the sound effects and visual animations are excellent while still adhereing to the ASCII asthetic that the game is a clear homage to.\n\nAll in all this is a fantastic title that has managed to be the best RPG and strategy/tactics game I've played this year, the story is gripping and gives me a good reason to dive back in even if all I manage to do is unlock a couple extra lore pieces. There are also a lot of factions with different agendas in this game and ambient robot ecosystems going on that give the world a deeply immersive feel.", "timestamp_created": 1511761617, "timestamp_updated": 1511761617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37734148": {"recommendationid": "37734148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006984808", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509382685}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game with an interesting interface design that becomes better as you play.", "timestamp_created": 1511742616, "timestamp_updated": 1511742616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37705089": {"recommendationid": "37705089", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998899422", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512059537}, "language": "english", "review": "Cogmind is a tasty, quick roguelike (turn-based, permadeath) with a futuristic flavor and savory text-mode (with tileset) graphics (awesome explosions!) based not on leveling abilities but combining scavenged items to construct a winning character.

Check. Combat is very satisfying, with positioning and tactics being very important if you wish to get rid of your enemies as quickly and painlessly as humanly (or, well, [i]robotically[/i] in our case) possible, and believe me: ideally you want to be operating at top efficiency. Winning a skirmish or ten isn't going to do you much good when you have a war to win, with attrition being a very real and sizable threat, so you have to think ahead, and in order to be able to do so you'll need a very solid understanding of the way the game works, and combat mechanics are just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nGraphics? Check. Classic ASCII mode is available (and toggleable with a single keystroke) if that's your thing. Otherwise there's a very solid tileset at your disposal, as well as fancy animations, juicy explosions, and whatnot.\n\nAccessibility? Check. Tutorial and in-game manual are there to guide you, covering just about everything you need to do. You can play the game relying strictly on your keyboard and nothing else, but mouse support is there as well, and it's extremely smooth. The UI feels just right: it works perfectly well right out of the box without any tweaks whatsoever, but if you need more/different info, that can be arranged. Combine all this with I've said about the graphics, and you get something that can appease both the veteran of the genre and the newcomer alike. Finally, there's a number of difficulty settings, so if Cogmind is tormenting you a bit too mercilessly on the default difficulty, there is a way out.\n\nSetting/plot? Check. Can't say I'm fully familiar with both at this point, but I believe I've seen enough to say that whatever is going on here, it's pretty damn intriguing. Let's just say that if an NPC appeared before me, offering me either a local equivalent of BFG or a piece of lore I haven't encountered yet, it'd be a tough call to make.\n\nLong story short, Cogmind is a fantastic roguelike.

It's sort like of a perfected version of gVIM - powerful hotkeys at your disposable married with the versitility of the mouse. \n\nNever before have I been so satisfied at ASCII explosions and EM waves put together out of tile graphics. In this respect, Cogmind is top of its class. Graphical developers everywhere should take cues from how Cogmind renders game events in a way that gives both visercal satisfaction at seeing your enemies torn to shreds, as well as concisely communicating information to the keen player.\n\nThe game itself is fun, and the concept of \"put yourself back together with parts scavenged from dead enemies\" is very well applied. In fact, the entire game is balanced around part availibility from finding them in random rooms and killing your enemies, which is something quick players will adapt to easily. Your first win might be out of sheer luck after at least several failed runs where you learn more and more, but experienced players can win reliably (although going for high scores does take some luck and playing the same seed multiple times for optimal moves).\n\nMultiple branches already in the game, with more on the way. Experienced players will be able to plan out what branches they want to take, determining a large part of their build and victory method.\n\nPlenty of lore for the nerds to dig deep into.

To me, Cogmind is a true roguelike in a modern style. While you can play in ASCII and keyboard mode, the game offers a tileset that feels and stays true to its initial look along with a very well done mouse control, which can be played mouse-only or hybrid with keyboard. It takes a lot of work to implement both this well, especially by only one person creating it and I consider this a big freaking plus, because we, the players, have the option and can choose whichever we prefer. Along with a clean UI that provides all necessary information at most a press of a button away, you will rarely find this amount of polish in an EA game.\n \nAs for the gameplay, it's got the basic roguelike features of being turn-based and randomly generated maps (along with many handcrafted parts). Since it's placed in a futuristic setting, it introduces a new type of equipping yourself besides the standard head, torso, four limbs etc. gear which I found is a very refreshing idea. This also opens up the possibility for very different builds and such different approaches of playing the game. The \"true\" roguelike part however definitely comes from its hidden mechanics - Cogmind is brutally hard, many struggle just getting through the early game, but this is by design. You are supposed to learn and improve slowly until you get a feeling for what's happening, influencing it to your advantage and thus increasing the chance of survival. There is no handholding, nor will you find precise answers on how these mechanics work, you'll get hints at most. Now I do understand that this may throw people off, the main reason why I'm mentioning it and you can trust me, I have also raged at the game, many times... but that's sort of the point of a roguelike, because once you get better, it provides a rewarding experience not many games are capable off.\n \nI have around 200 hrs into the game and can (somewhat) reliably win a run, but true roguelike also means, I am merely increasing my chances, things can and will go wrong. Then again, this is not where Cogmind ends, there is a ton of optional areas available with lots of lore to be found, some of which will lead to different endings. You could consider them an extra challenge, while they do provide benefits, getting there is usually way harder than just advancing on the main path and I have yet to see them all. While every world seed has all of the optional stuff in it, they are not always on the same level, so even if you aim for something specific, you may end up somewhere completely different, which makes for quite unique runs overall. Also, if you're the completionist type, bring a lot of time, because you will need way more than what I've invested so far.\n \nIf you are concerned about the EA label, don't be. Cogmind is a complete game already, along with lots of content and a polish I'd wish some finished products would have. Yet, the developer is still improving on the game, even though being hindered by a severe injury currently, he invests a lot of time and is very responsive on the forums. Only if you're new to the roguelike genre, especially the turn-based variant (real-time is just, well... different), I'd say start with something \"lighter\". For the rest of you, I do not see a single reason why you would not get you're money's worth out of this great game.

Watching a game grow bigger as time goes on; perfecting its meta and expanding its content and personality is a really exhilerating experience. Cogmind has really mastered something that a lot of games take for granted: True difficulty.\n\nIn Cogmind you are released in the lowest levels, basically a garbage dump, with the scattered remains of failures before you being the only thing that can help you rise from perdition. The concept of building yourself up on the pieces of others is  nothing new, but Cogmind really takes that idea home. Not only do you strengthen yourself with the remains of castaways long dead, but even their pieces are expendable and tossed to the floor often before you bother thinking about where it came from.\n\nIt carries through well in a rogue-like. Perma death is a frustrating, belittling experience and repeating the \"same\" content (RNG and seeded levels make sure you never really repeat anything) can be tiresome. But you're never left feeling like the game is insurmountable. Each enemy is unique and identifiable; your particular playstyle is reinforced with each run; and skill and technique win the day more often than brute force. Cogmind is a tactical game, and if you play it with the idea of  improvement in mind (Picking up the pieces of your failures and using them to succeed) you progress more and more with each playthrough.\n\nThe graphics are stunning for such a simple game. There is no music to speak of, and I hope none ever comes since the atmospheric drawl of machines, weaponry and robots is more than enough to draw a player into the world they are playing in. Complexity abounds, and the huge number of weapons, components and computer systems make sure you would be hard pressed to say a particular build is \"the best.\" Cogmind is a game where your choices matter no matter how experienced you are, and each time I pick it up I don't think \"Here we go again,\" I think \"This time I'm gonna make it.\"\n\nIts a complicated game to review, but one I would recommend to anyone who asks.

Loading up your robot with guns and tank treads and fighting your way to the surface is perhaps the most obvious option (and an intensely satisfying one, with both the audio and visual feedback being top-notch), but loading up with light and fast parts and sneaking/running your way past encounters is a perfectly valid tactic as well - and you may find yourself switching back and forth depending on what parts you have available to you (and what parts you lose in the process!).", "timestamp_created": 1509347024, "timestamp_updated": 1509347024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36121482": {"recommendationid": "36121482", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986041158", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1514187730}, "language": "english", "review": "Seriously one of the most engaging roguelikes I have had the pleasure of playing.

Choices you make are what get you killed. You are given the information to make good decisions, there are few random unknowns. No more having to drink every potion and die just to find out what it does.\n\n[*]Multiple weapon/damage types in a sci-fi setting. A huge welcome change to sword and magic. Blast your enemies with electromagnetic weapons, melt them with thermal. Blow the whole damn room up with rockets, or smash in their face with a hammer!\n\n[*]All parts you equip (you are a robot built from the parts you find) can be destroyed but also repaired at special stations. Find new parts from fallen enemies (if you didn't use a weapon that obliterated them) or find them in storage rooms. Try any combination and discover which ones are best for certain situations because you don't have stats limiting your use. Make use of different propulsion, utilities, weapons and cores. Protect your core at all costs with exterior plating and excess parts.\n\n[*]Escape in one piece! Once you reach a new level and evolve your core is replenished to 100%, meaning just escaping with 1 core integrity won't mean you die instantly on the next level. However if your core is corrupted (through EMP or other ways) it will last unless you find ways to fix it!

What caught my attention was a post from Kyzrati detailing the development of a full version of his Sci-Fi Roguelike prototype, the very clear expectations he had set for himself, and the passion he had for the project.  Jump to today and his passion has not abated.  The added features through community discussion are numerous, yet he has managed to remain true to his vision for the game.  I played regularly during the Alpha (up to Alpha 4) and played occasionally up to the Steam release to see how things were progressing.  Seeing the game progress hugely over the years has been impressive and the current result is, in my opinion, the best Roguelike available on Steam.\n\n[u][b]The Game[/b][/u]\n\nCogmind is an ambitious game and succeeds in updating the Roguelike genre.  While the gameplay is turn-based it is not your typical Roguelike if you are used to playing Caves of Qud or Tales of Maj\u2019Eyal.  There is no levelling in the traditional sense as there are no skill trees or initial customisation for your character.  Instead, levelling is strongly tied to the equipment you find/salvage/steal and will drastically change how you play the game.  As you ascend you increase the number of pieces of equipment you can equip and your base health.  Equipment can be damaged and destroyed so you will need to adapt and upgrade as you ascend through the levels.  Mechanically similar Roguelikes would include Brogue or The Ground Gives Way.  I personally prefer this system because as soon as you open the game you are in the world, making progress, and making tangible decisions.\n\nThis is a clich\u00e9, but expect to die\u2026 [i]A lot[/i].  Regularly dying early might give you the impression that there is not much to this game.  This is not the case.  The initial levels only give you access to a limited selection of what is on offer.  There are branching paths, wild variation in a vast range weapons and utilities, a large selection of hostile/neutral/allied robots, and an extensive, well-written lore.  After only a few hours of play you will find that you can progress through the early levels in about 10-15 minutes after which the game really opens up.  I have never successfully completed a run ([i]I have come close[/i]), but there are players that regularly beat the game with a variety of builds and the developer has created the game with the intention that every run has the potential to win.  Check out [u][url=https://www.youtube.com/user/kwrkrlz]zxc\u2019s[/url][/u] YouTube channel if you want to see how it\u2019s done.\n\nYou have a choice between using the traditional ASCII tiles or a graphical tile-set and by hitting F3 you can toggle between the two depending on preference.  No matter what you choose the visuals are beautiful and destructive with accompanying sound effects that really help to immerse you in the game\u2019s world.  I use the ASCII tiles simply because I find it easier to parse the information on-screen due to the time spent with the 7DRL version.  The ASCII tile-set has a wide variation of fonts so you should be able to find one you prefer.  At this stage there is only one, official graphical tile-set, but player-made tile-sets are possible.\n\nThe lone developer has and continues to release regular improvements and additions to the game.  What is there is a complete and enjoyable gaming experience.

A Rouge LITE would be The Binding of Isaac or Magicide, a Rouge Like would be for example Sword Of The Stars: The Pit. and Cogmind fits in the Rouge Like genre, it\u2019s a turn based, RPG type, adventure game, that is hard as shit to get into. \n\nThe game starts without launching to a menu, it doesn\u2019t send you into a tutorial on your first start up it just tosses you in, tells you to go fuck yourself, and leaves. That\u2019s basically the first 30 seconds of the game. After your first crushing defeat, having no idea what the hell is going on, you start picking up on small things. Now you know how to attach your wheels, how to shoot your guns, which mind you is pretty fucking annoying, and what some of the modules do. \n\nWhile starting your first game you\u2019ll probably be overwhelmed by the UI, it\u2019s a little bit spooky and has a lot of information on it. Don\u2019t worry about it for now, it\u2019s best to just play through a couple times and slowly learn about the data and what it means instead of sitting down building a spreadsheet with all the info you have. The game isn\u2019t an entrance exam to university, the best way to learn is multiple attempts.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly difficult game to just jump into, but once you get past that initial hour you start figuring things out and can enjoy the story of this game, and jesus there\u2019s a lot of story content in this game. In a single play through you won\u2019t be able to learn about the entire world, only sections written in Terminals that you must hack to gain access to. Cogmind has an incredibly in-depth well written world. \n\nThe game has a pretty neat art aesthetic as well, it can be a little daunting again trying to figure out what everything looks like but you can change whether you want the ASCII art style, or basic textures. personally I\u2019d recommend playing in the ASCII version, I find the Textures to be a little lacking and not very interesting compared to something like Sword of The Stars. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting ways you can play the game as well, you could build yourself to be a massive tank with huge weapons shooting rockets, lobbing grenades, blowing up walls. You could also be a stealthy cheeky beaver burrowing through walls, avoiding your targets. There are plenty options for you to experiment with, you can even try being a Robot Samurai with the Katana\u2019s, though I think you\u2019ll die pretty damn quick\n\nOne problem I had was the lack of music in the game. Hopefully this is something the dev is looking at as this game is in Early Access.\n\nI do find this game to not be as in depth as Sword Of The Stars: The Pit but it is still something worth checking out.

I've never seen someone take the time to respond not only to criticism at large, but to each and every detail of any criticism posted on any site, anywhere.\n\nI got involved towards the end of the alpha cycle for this game and played a decent amount before the beta release and Steam release. I'm not very good, but getting better! And each play-through is fun, no matter what.\n\nThis is by design, but the first bit of each play-through often feels more like survival than anything else. It can be slower and the range of experiences diverge less, but once you make it out of the first few levels (and unlock a healthy number of slots to equip modules, weapons, etc.) the game definitely opens up much more. There are tons and tons of opportunities for all kinds of strategies, though those end up being sort of dependent on what types of items/weapons you find lying around. Nevertheless, the depth is there. There are so many interconnected systems at play: you can be a massively power-producing hover-bot with tons of lasers, matching battery banks, and cooling systems... or you can be a stealthy, ice-cold (literally cryogenic), katana-wielding, sneak on wheels... or a hacker who can send out drones to scout the map for you... or a huge armored tank that levels entire rooms with rocket barrages... and the list goes on. Once you begin to understand how all the systems work, you really start to see the huge opportunities for all different types of builds.\n\nHowever, my absolute favorite experiences with the game (so far) have been in some of the scripted events you can come across. One time, I stumbled onto a few friendly robots about to perform a heist, only to find myself ambushed and in the middle of a huge firefight once the heist went awry - though they had just opened up a vault full of super powerful propulsion systems and missiles, allowing me to basically become a fighter jet. Or recently, I found and booted up a group of robots that pledged their allegiance to me and helped me out of an impossible situation.\n\nThere is a lot to love about this game and the developer is very transparent and active about what is happening with the game.

You spot an engineer trudging along, rebuilding delapidated walls. You sneak up to it and attack it with a Datajack, a makeshift hacking device only usable at short range. Miraculously, you succeed in accessing the engineers inner systems - of which you have the option to gather information about the droid, attempt to overload its systems, or link it with your own, allowing you to see what it sees. You decide to try and link with it, but it fails, and the engineer quickly runs off down the corridor. You are unable to catch up to it as you are equipped with aluminium legs you acquired from dismantling a combat drone earlier, and they arent fast enough to catch the engineer before it alerts an Informer, who then alerts the combat units in the area. Positioning yourself, you wait for the drones to reach your location so you can tear the parts from their burnt, metal carcasses and use them for yourself. Seeing them approach, you open fire with your weapons - a grenade launcher, beam gun, and particle cannon. All three miss, with the grenade hitting an adjacent wall, blowing it open. Another droid emerges from the debris, and begins firing at you. Its missiles destroy two of your weapons and reduces the integrity of one of your power cores. The battle rages on, and you manage to destroy one of the three combat bots, but not before your power cores give way to the fire. You begin to run. Passing through a door, you look for an empty room to hide in, but before you can progress any further, your aluminium legs are severed by a blade trap. Unable to move much faster than a tile a turn, you decide you will wait. The room you are in has two large machines that you know from past experience are very, very volatile, and you still have your grenade launcher handy, albeit in its disrepair. \nA few turns later, after lying in a pile of broken parts and your own dispair, 5 combat droids enter the room. \nYou press F to target, aim at the machines, and fire. \n\n\nBased on a true story - this was my very first run.", "timestamp_created": 1508804689, "timestamp_updated": 1508804689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35951680": {"recommendationid": "35951680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040807162", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509164132}, "language": "english", "review": "Ah Cogmind such a wonderfully addictive game.

I've been playing Cogmind since 2015 when it was still in Alpha, so I know a thing or two about Cogmind.  This allows me to make the following statement with 100% accuracy and confidence:\n\nCogmind is an amazing roguelike.\n\nIt's really one of the best games I've ever played and I can't recommend it enough.  It's first and foremost a game of tactics and strategy like DCSS and it allows for a wide variety of playstyles and ways to overcome (or outright avoid) foes.  Unlike crawl, and like ADOM, it features a deep world full of NPCs with a rich storyline.  I won't spoil the plot, but it's so much more interesting than your standard let's save the world schlock.\n\nThe UI puts the game in a league of its own.  It's polished, its intuitive, its convenient, there's no other roguelike out there that's simultaneously this rich and this easy to get into.  If you've been holding off on playing roguelikes out of a fear that they're all convulted ASCII messes like Dwarf Fortress, this a great roguelike to be your first.  The gorgeous tiles don't hurt either.  \n\nYour average winning run lasts about 4-5 hours, so it's longer than DoomRL, but perhaps shorter than ADOM or TOME.  One thing that's great about the game is that unlike most roguelikes, the end game isn't the easiest part.  In Crawl or ADOM once you've gotten your character off the ground, you'll usually die only due to fatigue or sloppiness.  In Cogmind, conversely, the challenge doesn't nose dive towards the end.  Quite the opposite.  It takes a lot of concentration to win, and you'll feel like you've accomplished something when you do beat this wonderful game.  \n\nThis game is worth the asking price.  You owe it to yourself to pick this one up.  Trust me.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1508723549, "timestamp_updated": 1508723549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35931728": {"recommendationid": "35931728", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973820904", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508705065}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been closely following the development of Cogmind for almost four years (almost since the start, really). Don' be scared by the fact that it is early access: it already was an awesome game to play from the first alpha, and is has only gotten better since! And it is more polished and bug-free than many big-budget games are on their official release.\n\nCogmind can probably best be described as a turn-based scifi stealth-action modernised traditional roguelike. And no, \"modernised traditional\" is not an oxymoron in this context.\n\n\"Roguelike as in Spelunky?\" Well... no... that's what the \"traditional\" signifies. Explaining what a traditional roguelike would take too long - search \"Nethack\" and do a wikipedia dive. The important bit is that the focus in these games is weaving intricate, interconnected game systems together. Gameplay consists of meaningful choices, where the world built out of these systems responds to us poking and prodding it, to create a rich experience in the process. Graphics often take a backseat to that, and you need to use your imagination to immerse yourself. The richness of the game system usually makes that quite easy!\n\nThe downside of all the complexity usually is that the interface also suffers, with I-don't-know how many special commands for input (imagine a fantasy game, like NetHack. In them, you can usually use, zap, drop, throw, break, give, and even (try to) eat a wand. [i]Each of those actions has a separate key[/i], and that's just the tip of the iceberg). But not with Cogmind! The interface of this game is streamlined and user-friendly - I am an interface designer by profession and training, and I [i][b]LOVE[/b][/i] this game's interface so incredibly much: it can be completely mouse-controlled, completely keyboard-controlled, or both, and everything about it is incredibly polished.\n\nSame with the gameplay: from the player's perspective, this game is as complex as you want it to be. Instead of requiring you to read a huge manual before you can even get started, you can just start to move around, pick up some gear and equip it, and start shooting your way out, without knowing anything about the intricate systems that make the game tick.\n\nHowever, to enjoy it to the most, you should be the type to like diving into the various game systems. But her too, Cogmind makes this as easy and frictionless as possible. The whole thing is set up to give elegant, in-game access to learning how the systems work. Hovering over anything gives you information pop-ups, right-clicking gives bigger pop-ups with EVEN MORE detailed information. Want to compare two items? Right click on one, then another, and it will also show the difference in stats for easier comparison! So pick apart the stats decide when to use wheels and when to use robo-legs. Or play it like a mindless coffee-break game, pick up the first weapons you see and shoot every hostile bot that comes your way, and see how far you get until you're inevitably overwhelmed, pew pew!\n\nAnd that's just the interface! Cogmind pushes traditional roguelikes into new ground on so many different fronts: the UI, the ASCII art animations, the sound design, the game mechanics themselves. I could go on for hours praising this game!\n\nThis is all the brain-child of one man: Josh Ge, a.k.a. Kyzrati. He is very reliable and open to user-feedback. When I replied to one of his blog-entries that I am color-blind and had some trouble with the colour scheme at times, he immediately started working on ways to avoid that: adding other non-color ways of communicating status, a mod-friendly system for the color palette, and so on. How amazing is that?\n\nCarl Sagan once said \"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.\" I think he was making a philosophical point, but Josh must have mistaken it for a dare. Cogmind is the product of a person who loves a genre of games so much that he broke it down, obsessively deconstructing [i]absolutely everything[/i] about it: evaluating, re-evaluating and re-re-evaluating every design decision, every convention, basically every aspect you can think of, again and again, to get to the essence of what a roguelike [i]is[/i]. And in the process, from the ground up, he meticulously crafted this game.\n\nIf you have read his (highly recommended) devlog, I'm sure you agree with me that he has worked on this with an almost disturbing level of devotion for four years. This is a Herculean labour of love. And for what purpose? To drag traditional roguelikes kicking and screaming into modernity, so that everyone else will see what it is that he loves so much about them. In my opinion, that makes it a work of art.

I've hidden them behind the spoiler tag.\n\nWhat a great game. I love the Matrix-inspired UI and effects. While the game is as minimalistic as roguelikes usually are, the dev really used all the potential from the ASCII-style graphics. \n\nUsually I have a hard time to get into roguelikes. I've tried Caves of Qud, Nethack, Tales of Maj'Eyal and Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (among a few others I can't recall), but none of them have really grasped me like Cogmind did. Usually I want to get better at those games, but it seems like a chore. Cogmind on the other hand feels contained, solid, easy to grasp and really immersive. A lot of it has to do with the excellent UI and thought-out shortcut keys. And it has the best setting / lore that I've seen.\n\nThe best part about Cogmind is that it rewards stealth and tactical combat. Careful planning and learning how the A.I. works really pays off, and my best runs have been those where I've avoided combat as much as possible. And in the later levels (I've only got to probably -7) I love how flexible the game is build-wise. I can start playing as a flying super fast stealthbot and switch to a terminatorbot on treads because I found a bunch of kinetic guns and managed to get surrounded by enemies. \n\nWhile the combat seems repetitive and boring on the outside, the best part of it is under the hood. There are so many variables to consider and it's a fresh approach after the \"get better armor and weapons to kill higher level mobs\" -kind of games. Every time I'm about to engage or consider engaging an enemy I check the stats of my parts and try to get to a safer location to avoid getting ganged up. Do I have enough coverage on my shielding parts or will my guns be the first to go after a few volleys? Will I run out of matter or will I have enough to switch my loadout after my assault rifles get destroyed? Should I just throw away a few less important items so I could unequip my heavy storage unit, equip my flight propulsion and get away quickly from a flight I might lose? Which robot should I kill first? These are only a few examples and it only gets trickier and more complex in the later levels.\n\nI bought the game during the Alpha phase (I think..?) and got the key in an email after the launch on Steam, so I might have played a few dozen hours more than what it shows here. But I know I've only scratched the surface.\n\nBefore purchasing I'd suggest you research a bit into Cogmind and realize it's a niche game for a niche crowd. It's a game where you can never get too attached (heh, a robot pun) to gear because it might get either blown off in a few minutes or you might find something way better later. There are no classes, skill trees or masteries of any kind (I think) but your builds are determined by the parts you equip. You can, however, kind of level up by [spoiler] increasing the amount of slots for different kinds of parts by evolving between levels to suit your playstyle [/spoiler] but that's about it. These choices hardly ever feel irrecoverable, unless you [spoiler] only pump up your engine slots [/spoiler]. But I don't know why you would do that if you pay any attention to the game :D\n\nOnly con I can think of is that the game forces the US keyboard layout (I use the finnish one) and I have a hard time finding the right keys for stuff unless I keep the layout's image on the second monitor. So far I haven't tried to rebind the keys, but it's sometimes jarring to try and find the right keys if I don't have the layout open.", "timestamp_created": 1508697712, "timestamp_updated": 1508697859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35923195": {"recommendationid": "35923195", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968609909", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512178877}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing Cogmind since earlier this year, so my Steam played time doesn't reflect the 100+ hours I've pumped into this game. I'm beyond impressed with this developer and with this game. This dev took an absolutely incredible amount of time truly examining what makes a modern Roguelike work, and how to improve the experience while still staying true to the soul of Nethack, etc. The UI is a crowning achievement in the genre, and works just as well with keyboard as with mouse. The tiles are freaking scalable, and the graphics stick out heads and shoulders above others in the genre while still keeping the old school feel.

It feels like the Binding of Isaac sometimes for me - that is, unsuccessful runs tend to be a slog, while lore-filled or successful runs are far more enjoyable.\n\nI originally wrote a negative review here (preserved below). Combat felt tedious at best and each run seemed nigh-identical to the last, but response from multiple people including the developer and some community members prompted me to continue playing to see if the game held more. [b]It did[/b] - it had a lot I'd yet to see.\n\nContinued playing revealed not only more areas to explore and parts to utilize that I still hadn't seen, but random encounters I had uncovered an aspect of the game I had yet to even scratch the surface of, making interactions with various machines far more interesting and variable. Not to mention how fun the encounters themselves were - I've found two so far and both were incredibly interesting to me, largely in part because I love good lore and both events were densely packed with it.\n\nEven so, I still have issues with this game that have yet to see resolution, and while further playing may yet have them solved (and if so I will update this), they are still worth mentioning regardless. Before I dig in, however, be aware that:\n\n[b]I have not finished the game.[/b] I have reached -3 (presumably 3rd-to-last level) at the farthest.\n[b]There is surely a LOT I've yet to witness.[/b] Plenty of which could mean a number of changes to this review.\n[b]I have a lot left to learn in terms of how to play.[/b] The only build I can successfuly construct thus far is a combat one - I am still trying to create other suitable configurations, and until then any comments from me about their existance or potential should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThat all said...\n\n[h1]Things you should know[/h1]\n\n[i]+ Positive\no Neutral\n- Negative[/i]\n\n[b]+ The lore is fantastic.[/b] I'm a sucker for a quality story, and this game has plenty to offer. Everything from dialogue to stories dug up from terminals is well-written and fun to read, and I constantly find myself excited whenever I find more.\n\n[b]+ Decent atmosphere.[/b] While ambient noise is uncommon, the sound as a whole is well crafted wherever present and never becomes annoying. Additionally, the graphical style - whether you use the ASCII variant or the default - fits together nicely at all times, and I've yet to spot a single thing out-of-place with it.\n\n[b]+ There are plenty of parts and many, many options for building your character.[/b] When the game mentions its part diversity, it isn't exaggerating at any point. I am constantly finding new things to attach or try out, and even amongst those I'm already aware of I still find new uses or even entirely new builds to take a shot at.\n\n[b]o Maps are very large, and game mechanics tend to encourage leaving sooner rather than later.[/b] It certainly depends a lot on your build as to whether or not you can stick around, but more often than not it's wiser to simply leave for the next level. If you're looking to explore a lot, you need to be careful - even if you've outfitted yourself specifically to do it.\n\n[b]o Combat can become boring if too drawn out.[/b] This is another one of the issues that applies moreso depending on what kind of run/build you have. If you're more combat-oriented, odds are almost no fight will truly last unless it is a particularly tough enemy. If you run something less armed, however, you could find yourself embroiled in potentially troublesome lasting skirmishes if you aren't careful.\n\n[b]o Few builds seem effective without some level of dedication to combat, though this might just be me.[/b] As I stated earlier, I'm still in the process of designing a working setup of another type, so it's hard to tell just yet.\n\n[b]o The game can be very hard at times.[/b] This has gotten easier as I've learned more things that I can do, but can still be occasionally overwhelming. When I mentioned I got to level -3, I did so on Easier difficulty; even when toned-down, the game can sometimes be quite difficult. This used to be a negative, as easier modes used to lock some areas out, but as of Beta 3.1 this is no longer the case. [i](Special thanks to the dev for being so receptive to feedback on this!)[/i]\n\n[b]- System Corruption is too influential per-turn.[/b] A subset of the difficulty, but still separate enough to warrant its own point. System Corruption is rarely a straight-up killing factor for me, but I still find it rather annoying to deal with, as even 1% corruption seems to cause something to screw up unusually frequently. Combine this with the fact that (as far as I know) any level of corruption can cause any manner of negative side-effect, and you get problems like a weapon-misfire from 1% corruption causing a nuclear reactor to get shot and blow up in your face.\n\n[b]- Ambient sound is uncommon, and I have yet to hear any music at all.[/b] Some games can pull off no music just fine, but they usually do so by making up for it with ambient sound - generators humming, steam leaks hissing, etc. While Cogmind [i]does[/i] have this sort of thing, they feel somewhat rare to encounter and few machines actually seem to produce any noise. Put this together with other sounds only occuring on a per-turn basis and you can get long periods of silence taking away from the overall experience.\n\n[h1]In the end...[/h1]\n\nWhile Cogmind definitely has a lot of effort put in, and is certainly a well-made game, whether or not you should get it varies; I personally didn't enjoy it until I'd put in tens of hours. Hence, I'd recommend it - but only if you think it likely that you'd like it, too.\n\n[b]Old review:[/b]\n\n[i][b]EDIT:[/b] The developer (as well as several friendly community members) responded to my review in the comments regarding combat, and it seems they are right about it so far from what I've seen. Continued play has revealed evolving weaponry more makes combat less tiresome (as it ends very fast) and as I continue I am still finding plenty of new elements to improve my play style with. I'm not going to change the review score just yet as some parts still seem somewhat tiresome, but if things continue to improve I may yet do so.[/i]\n\nI'll say it straight up: I don't like this game. While I respect the effort that clearly went in to it (a lot!), the gameplay comes across as very lacking. I find myself suspecting I'm missing something that brings the charm, seeing all the positive reviews, but after four hours of play I still can't find the entertainment.\n\nThe lore is good and the sound effects hold as much variety as was promised (and then some), but this is strongly offset by repetitive gameplay. Exploring can be nice, and combat is interesting at first, but both become dull as you go on. Exploring lasts far longer however, as new items and areas show up at a good pace.\n\nCombat is another story; I quickly found myself exasperated with constant streams of enemies and every time new ones appeared I ended up sighing with frustration at the slog I'd now have to deal with. With combat almost entirely consisting of 'Press F to begin targeting, then shoot them, repeat until someone dies.', things get boring extremely fast. Worse yet, even after learning not to push things too far with terminals, enemies still seemed to pour out of every nook and cranny regardless of what I did.\n\nIn the end, while I still respect this game and its developer for all the work involved in this product, and while it still has a number of very good elements, I found this game far too grindy to personally be worth $18 (or $20 - I got it on sale). I can't say ignore this game - it has too much potential for that - but unless a good sale comes around or combat gets improved, I'd suggest holding off just yet and seeing what happens first.", "timestamp_created": 1508667994, "timestamp_updated": 1510473889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "27", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35913352": {"recommendationid": "35913352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097780693", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509269389}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely cool reimagining of the roguelike genre.

It's passive -, if it was better to have high or low movement numbers - Hint: Lower is better, but there's trade offs -, and how support and penalty factored into movement - Hint: Support is the amount of mass you can carry while penalty is the amount of movement added if you go over this amount). The rest of it was very easy to figure out quickly. I did end up reading the manual, but it was a very quick read, and doing so cemented what I had already figured out while illuminating some more obscure aspects of the game.\n\nThe swapping in and out of components is exceedingly satisfying as you build your bot into something to be reckoned with, and while there are no \"Levels\", you will go through evolutions that expand your capabilities which could be likened to leveling up.

I have at least 6,000 hours in roguelikes, half of which is Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup.\n\nInstead of leveling, you select new slots; power sources (important for energy weapons and shields), propulsion (important for movement and evasion, also total weight), utility (the one slot you can never have too many of), and weaponry. You start with 2 of each, and you get more as you go deeper. Killing enemies gives a chance for new parts, but also a high chance of a net loss. You have matter, which is used for kinetic weapon firing, and energy, used for energy weapon firing. Both also interplay with utilities, and utilities can convert one to the other.\n\nAdding parts has just enough of a cost to not be done excessively but allowing for regular upgrades. And parts themselves have two stats; the amount of HP they have, and coverage. The only way to die is to get hit in your core, and the only way to defend it is to have parts. Weapons, propulsion, and certain utilities (especially armor) contribute most to this. However, parts regularly take damage from combat and will eventually break.\n\nA main restriction is inventory space, which can only be expanded from an absolutely insufficient 4 with utility upgrades. I try to get by with +10, but +20 would help a lot...\n\n'Builds', as they are, is twofold: Selecting upgrade slots and then finding the appropriate items. However, things will change. In one game I got all my parts more or less wiped out in a big battle twice without losing the game. My core took a lot of hits, but cores recover from leveling up. So I had to piece together what damaged parts I could from my defeated enemies. I cobbled together an interesting gun-based build, then got all my parts wiped out again, and am currently doing a very successful energy weapon build. Inventory space is vital to have backups to replace in or after combat. Losing all your guns means you flee or die.\n\nNPCs are interesting and have a point. They repair level damage, gather non-stored items, and sometimes carry very valuable stuff. Still, the level is either random rooms or mines. I wish there was more variety and unique level areas.\n\nGripes:\n\nUPDATED! System Corruption is cleared when you upgrade Cogmind. If it gets really annoying, just stop looting and ascend higher. It's still exceptionally annoying, however. Firing my Rocket Array into an adjacent field of nuclear reactors while trying to sneak is the worst thing it's done to me. Or dropping my last wheel due to rejection when trying to flee... okay the last one was kind of hilarious.\n\nBuilds. I like that you tend to find plenty of random stuff, but your inventory is just too small. I would love a way to store items during a run in a terminal and be able to retrieve them later. Backup weapons and parts for when I am ravaged that I can find later would be great. The schematic and fabricate system is interesting, but is utter RNG. Some runs I find only ways to store schematics, others I find only fabricators. I'd like a way to better use what I already have.\n\nUtility slots are too good. Power only matters for energy builds. Excessive weapons build up too much heat... and the only answer? Utility slots. Armor is vital, and so is storage options. I find there is far too many vital utilities, with many very interesting ones I have to pass on due to simply not having enough. I can't handle more than 4 weapons even with 2 heat sinks for long engagements. It would be nice if things like batteries, storage and armor could be added to a new type of slot that improves once per upgrade or every other upgrade to give some more room to experiment.\n\nStill have a lot to try out, like speedy stealth builds, melee builds, and whatnot... this'll be a game I put a lot of hours in.

However, given that the other great Roguelikes on Steam are ToME4 and ADOM, this one easily ranks up there and with other up-and-comers like Qud.\n\nDefinitely a must-buy. (Indeed, I did buy quite some time ago.)\n\nAdditionally, the developer is heavily active on Twitter and Reddit and his own forums. Personally, I don't know how he has the time to do this game and participate in general Roguelike outreach, but it's a wonder to see.", "timestamp_created": 1508521052, "timestamp_updated":

gameplay with a lot of unique twists to make it standout from the crowd. Coming from DCSS as my all time favorite roguelike, some tactics apply but others don't. Basics like fighting in corridors to avoid being swarmed are crucial. However, unlike most roguelikes, item destruction is a core mechanic in Cogmind. Your equipment is easily destroyed and needs to be replaced with higher quality parts. At first this feels impossible to overcome, but you'll steadily learn tricks to sustain yourself better. The equipment system is also extremely in-depth. Managing matter, energy, heat, integrity, coverage, mass, etc., makes putting together a build feel like an addictive puzzle to solve.\n\nThe tiles/ASCII/animations are all gorgeous. It's never been as satisfying to press 'f' in a roguelike. I'm currently playing with ASCII because the tiles are a tad small on my 1366x768 laptop resolution. The atmosphere combined with the bits of lore scattered about make this world great to explore. The amount of polish in this game is unmatched by most roguelikes. \n\nI'm still terrible at Cogmind, but I can't get enough and I learn a little bit with each death.

A retro ascii presentation with modern amenities (alt. tile-set graphics as well).  TONS of raw data in the form of items, weapons, stats, etc.  Walls and walls of text that may sound daunting on paper, but is instead categorized & presented smartly, making the game feel weighty and dense with content.  Wasn't expecting it but the writing & story are high quality as well.  You talk to other robots with unique personalities, pick up logs, hack terminals for info, etc. all fleshing out the world.  Every story bit is numerically cataloged in a Log that remains persistent between runs.  Pulling up that Lore Log reveals that there's hundreds of entries to fill in.  So you keep building the narrative no matter how many times you bite it.  I understand that there's 7 unique endings as well.\n\nPlays way faster than I would have imagined as well.  Feels like BattleBots a bit in that you're always gathering up new gear (mobility, offence, defense, scouting, etc.) to equip yourself with and all those items combine to create an outer armor layer that protects your Core, which contains your true HP.  These various items degrade in combat so you're always on the lookout for something not only new and exciting but also with a high condition as it doubles as shielding.  It's a great push-pull dynamic.  Since it's turn-based it feels kinda XCOM with \"Hit %\" readouts during encounters (Pro-Tip: enable Tactical Display\" in Options for even more in-game combat data). \n\nGame may look real Dwarf Fortress in stills, but in motion it's way more flashy.  Lots of particle effects, screen shake for explosions, text & image overexposure & trails...stuff that makes it feel like a merge of vintage & modern technology.  Surprising amount of unique ambient sound files as well.  Not something you'd expect in this kind of game.

However, as time went on, some modern roguelikes managed to find a middle-ground between streamlining the interface and simplifying the gameplay, and Cogmind is the prime example of this commendable approach.\n\nThe game is extremely easy to delve into - in fact, a blind play is not only suggested, but encouraged in the game's manual. Thanks to the ease of use and clear-cut UI, the exploration of the dungeon becomes a pleasure, not a chore. The most necessary functions are always at the tip of your fingers, the intuitive drag&drop interface takes care of the bulk of your management needs, and you're left with the most important aspect of any true roguelike - strategising. And oh boy does Cogmind shine in this area. \n\nMost of the individual enemies or even enemy groups don't pose an immediate threat to you. In fact, you are quite capable of disposing of hostiles almost right off the bat. However, the mastermind behind the facility that you found yourself in thinks on a global scale - as such, your primary concern is not about immediately destroying whatever you find in front of you, but surviving the long battle of attrition as you navigate your way out of the underground complex. The alarm systems, robot patrols, enemy informers and traps are all connected on a global level. Disturb them too much - and a full-scale army invasion is imminent, in which case no amount of battle prowess will ever save you. However, should you choose to play the system, carefully manipulating the current alarm level, disposing of lone guardbots and avoiding detection, you will most definitely uncover the secrets surrounding this fantastic place - and escape with your core still ticking.\n\nIf you're tired of memorising all the possible combinations of Ctrl+, Shift+ and Alt+, can't be bothered to regulate food and water consumption for basic survival and don't care about intricate differences between picking up items comfortably, quickly or normally (which falls under \"basic\" commands in some old-school roguelike titles), then Cogmind might just be the game to try. An extremely smooth learning curve combined with a novel approach to equipment and an unusual setting set this game apart as a truly outstanding title.", "timestamp_created": 1508383205, "timestamp_updated": 1508383205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.728060", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35831144": {"recommendationid": "35831144", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970659761", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509154334}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like roguelikes at all, you will like this game", "timestamp_created": 1508381540, "timestamp_updated": 1508381540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35830988": {"recommendationid": "35830988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082984967", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509415097}, "language": "english", "review": "Just get it\nstop thinking about it\nIt's a great rogue-like I'm 25hours in and still finding out new things.", "timestamp_created": 1508380798, "timestamp_updated": 1508380798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522120", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35830728": {"recommendationid": "35830728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092727835", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508905491}, "language": "english", "review": "Have you come from yet another run into the depths of Red Rock ?

I got in early alpha, before it was on Steam, so I have many more hours logged.\nIt plays like a traditional Rogue-like, but the robot theme gives it a very different feel, and there are some key differences with other games of the genre. You don't have a 'build' or 'class' as such, you have to scavange parts and weld them onto yourself, and whatever you find dictates your playstyle, and as parts get destroyed it creates a tense, dynamic game where you're taking each encounter seriously because a few wrong moves and it could end your game. That means there aren't any trash fights, each and every move around the levels is meaningful and can have a big impact on your game, and that also makes it hard as hell. It is equal parts exciting and frustrating to have your cool toys taken away by a rough fight, only to roll into another room and find something even cooler, or a big pile of something you didn't need. And boy, the weapons in this game are cool, with beautiful visual effects for the various weapon types. There's great variety in weapons each with their own tactical advantages, as well as a ton of utility parts that mix up your playstyle as you go.\nThe difficulty comes from mastering the tactics and learning AI behaviours and so on, with the UI being polished and informative and the full mouse controls are intuitive and slick. I normally play Rogue-likes with the numpad, but I've played this extensively with the mouse and the keyboard and they both work great.\nThe graphics are beautiful in my opinion, with a lovely minimalist tileset and really great ASCII art for part schematics, and you can play the game in full ASCII if you want.\nDefinitely check it out if you like Rogue-likes, and give it a shot if you don't because it's different enough that it might surprise you.", "timestamp_created": 1508356286, "timestamp_updated": 1508356286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530562", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35823733": {"recommendationid": "35823733", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988827013", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1514126349}, "language": "english", "review": "Cogmind is a fascinating game in a very interesting world and so far I am having an insane amount of fun with it.\n\nThe biggest difference aside from the looks is that there is no XP grind, levels and classes. Everything is done with parts that you constantly pick up, upgrade and switch to adapt. Your lifeblood is your core that is partially protected by these parts. Resource management exists in form of energy, matter and heat.\n\nThe control scheme is very intuitive and works with only mouse, keyboard or both and can be switched via a single button press.\n\nWhat I like in particular (aside from general gameplay and feel) is the UI that really supports the games ideas and its design core. This has to be one of the most interesting, functional (drag&drop and a compare-item function in a roguelike) and satisfying UIs I have seen so far. Its usage reminds a bit of tiling window managers with a tabbing function.\n\nThe aesthetics are a nice blend of ASCII and tiles with some graphical effects (cool explosions, fade-ins, graphical glitches if you are corrupted, etc.). You can switch between ASCII and Cogmind-style on the fly. The interface does an awesome job of explaining everything directly or via popups so that the (spoiler free) ingame manual is not really needed. Still, if you want some formulas and examples, feel free to read up.\n\nCogmind features an extensive hacking system that even has a manual option where you can type the commmands. To complete the hacking experience, the commands are cAsE sEnSiTiVe and the console has an auto-complete function.\n\nThe robot world is alive! Destroy something and robots will come to pick items up, clear debris, investigate, rebuild walls, dig tunnels, etc.\n\nThe entire game breathes old meets new.\n\nCogmind now resides along with [spoiler] Deus Ex and Jagged Alliance 2 1.13 [/spoiler] on my \"survival thumb drive\" for the deserted island / rogue ai / robot revolt scenario.", "timestamp_created": 1508350316, "timestamp_updated": 1508451555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611307", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35822768": {"recommendationid": "35822768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023416519", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512958537}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely recommend without hesitation.\n\nCogmind is a roguelike in its own class - withOUT classes, or levels, or skills.  As you progress, you gain slots into which you install a vast array of parts, of four categories: power, propulsion, utility, and of course weapons.  This provides both an incredible amount of customization (since you choose what type of slots you gain) and a demand for careful balancing and planning: depending on your preferred means of propulsion (until it all gets blown off), you can only support so much weight before slowing down.  This means you can't fly around bristling with eleventy billion cannons unless you want to go very slow.  Slap on treatds, though...  you must also weigh the energy demands of your various gadgets - scanners, ECM, etc all take energy, as does moving, and firing weapons.  You need enough power for all that.\n\nSo, my experience thus far: scavengers are little assholes. Rocket launchers and grenade launchers make me cackle maniacally, followed shortly by mass devastation.  Watching the ensuing flurry of robots rebuilding in the aftermath is both adorable and engrossing (also tempting if the launcher hasn't gotten blown off).

The turn-based ones though, are often things I dont get along with.  Such as Nethack for example, which I've never liked (blasphemy!) with it's irritating \"your character is dumber than a stump, so every item ever is unidentified, and may explode, HAHA SCREW YOU\" sort of mechanics.  Not to mention that they're usually filled with really strange, obscure, and nearly hidden mechanics that are almost impossible to find and understand on your own.  Everything is always hidden, nothing is explained, and just... you get the idea.  Oh, and the UI is typically horrible.  HORRIBLE.  I always wanted a good turn-based roguelike that went AWAY from these concepts instead of just trying to be the 396734th Nethack clone.\n\nEnter Cogmind:  Exactly the game I've been wanting for who knows how long.  A game which keeps the very high complexity and depth of the \"core\" roguelikes, yet removes all of the problems I've always hated, and replaces them with very well thought-out mechanics of it's own that really make it stand out, and that ooze with quality.\n\nCogmind's concept is that you're this... floaty robot thing.  You start out as just a core, and you'll then assemble yourself from parts scattered nearby. Legs, treads, guns, reactors, whatever.  These items are all-important, as they define the entirity of your build as well as your abilities.  No EXP or anything here.  But while it's your core's HP that keeps you alive, much of the incoming damage will hit the parts you have equipped.  Before long, some of them will shatter, and you'll have to get new ones.  Good thing this works the other way around as well.  Wreck your robotic foes, and take THEIR parts for yourself.  Unlike you, enemy bots have extremely low amounts of core HP, so destroying them doesnt mean that most of their parts will shatter first.  Still, sometimes you might get a part that's mostly undamaged, and other times you may be stuck with a pile of gizmos that are missing some pieces.  But they'll just have to do.  Rolling with the punches is a huge part of the gameplay, and you'll need to adapt to the situation as well as what items are accessible to you.\n\nFortunately, there's alot more to it than that.  This is not a game where the RNG alone will kill you.  Finding parts isnt exactly an uncommon occurance. They are everywhere, and there's about a bazillion different types.  Weapons, power sources, utilities... all sorts of awesome stuff.  And they dont just come from shattered bots.  The facility that you're crawling through is filled with all sorts of parts lying around for you to find.  You are given many, many options, very frequently, allowing you to make choices in just how you want to build yourself up.  What's more, these parts are actually INTERESTING.  Deathrays and missile launchers and other crazy weapons are fun and all, but there's more to it than just those.  Utilities in particular can do all sorts of different things.  You might find a targeting processor, giving you more accuracy.  Or you might find a terrain scanner, capable of finding hidden maintenance doors, allowing new avenues of escape.  Or perhaps units to help you hack things, signal jammers, and many others, each more creative than the last.  All of these constantly changing parts make sure that your character and setup never grow stale over the course of the run.\n\nSpeaking of hacking, that's another major aspect.  You'll find all sorts of terminals as you explore.  Terminals have boatloads of different functions, but you're not a normal user... you're a rogue bot, and needless to say, you dont exactly have security clearance.  If you want to use these many, many functions... and you do... you'll have to risk hacking these things.  Hacks may fail, they may be detected, they may start a trace routine, leading investigation squads to your location.  But the info and services you can get from hacking is invaluable.  You may get schematics for crafting, or perhaps the chance to see the status and location of security patrols, or many other things.  You have TONS of options here, and the hacking mechanic adds alot to the game overall.  \n\nEven with all of those options though, this is one DIFFICULT game.  It's not going to murder you outright.  This isnt one of those roguelikes where some monster can come around the corner and tear you in half with one hit.  It's specifically designed so that DOESNT happen.  If you lose, it's in a non-frustrating way, and there's always a chance to examine where you went wrong, rather than going \"What the heck, how was I supposed to deal with that?\".  And that's good, because you WILL lose.  Alot.  Your enemies are extremely numerous, and the more trouble you cause, the more concerned and aggressive the central AI will become, sending out larger and more powerful squads after you.  In addition you have to deal with all sorts of traps, each more insidious than the last.  But as with everything else, you have things you can do to counter all of this.  But it's up to you to figure out how to use the tools available.\n\nOh, and I also want to mention the UI:  It is amazing.  Usually... okay, pretty much always... roguelikes get this horribly wrong, with confusing, broken interfaces that dont make much sense and are hard to even use.  But not this one.  This game goes out of it's way to make everything accessible, and to give you information in a way that's nice and easy to understand.  It's the best interface I've ever seen in one of these.  Not to mention that the game is just gorgeous.  Not just the default tileset, but... everything.  The animated explosions and energy blasts, or even the interface itself, it all fits the game and really emphasizes everything that is going on.  It also makes it easier to see just what's happening.  If a bullet you fire hits it's target, you will SEE it hit it's target, and you'll also see if you did core damage.  You dont have to stare at the combat log the whole time just to see what is going on.  I normally never bring up things like graphics when I review a game, but this one deserves a special mention... it's just that good.\n\nOverall, the game is fantastic.  I honestly cant really think of anything I dislike about it.  It's accessible yet incredibly complicated and deep.  It has an insane amount of content.  There's tons of things to do.  The combat system is fantastic.  The game world is detailed, with tons to see and lore behind all of it.  The challenge is extremely high, but you're given so many options to deal with it... the possibilities are endless, and you're not restricted to any specific playstyle.  Whether you prefer stealth, or want to crash through situations and blow up entire rooms (did I mention EVERYTHING is destructible?), you have that choice, and it's viable.\n\nThere's so very, very much more I could talk about here, all of it positive.  But Steam only allows me so much room.  An incredible game that will pull you in and not let go.  You'll die alot, but you'll love every moment of it, and you'll always learn more.

The sprawling facility is dotted with terminals that you can hack for, among other things, interesting lore. Some information is very heavily guarded, like the entry on \"Humans.\" All of the information you find is added to a log that persists between runs, so you can eventually fit all of the pieces together and understand the world of Cogmind.\n\nThe game has an ASCII mode and a tile mode, which you can switch between at any time with the F3 key. All objects are labelled when they come into view. Everything is also color-coded; for example, all hostile robots are yellow. The sound in Cogmind also really helps paint a picture of the facility in your mind: my favorite is listening to the ceiling crumble after blowing some things up with the grenade launcher.\n\nThe combat creates a lot of interesting and fun decisions. You might start shutting off systems to save energy, or run away for a little bit for your systems to cool down. Sometimes parts will get destroyed and you'll have to fight without a leg, or swap in your backup power source, or run over to some destroyed robot while under fire and attach their weapons to yourself to fire back.\n\nFinally, this is a roguelike, so every run is different. There are tons of parts to experiment with, and there are a lot of different ways to put parts on a robot brain and then use those parts to explore a sprawling complex with lots of interesting floors, machines, and enemies ;) If you like science fiction or are looking for an entry point into \"classic\" roguelikes, look no further.", "timestamp_created": 1508280960, "timestamp_updated": 1508281223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35806175": {"recommendationid": "35806175", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970805024", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509037353}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful sci-fi roguelike that strips out much of the bloat that can be found elsewhere in the genre to focus on tactical combat, extensive customisation through the wealth of components and weaponry, and stealth and hacking mechanics that allow for interesting gameplay options that feel unique in the genre.

Well, they move.  So what if we make your character a robot that you can swap in varous types of mobility, from legs to wheels to hovercraft.  A @ attacks, so how about your character can attach weapons to itself and fires them all per turn.  A @ restores energy per turn to do things, lets look at that somewhat literally, energy in the form of power generators and batteries.  A @ does all sorts of interesting utility things,  lets stick those in utility slots.  Your inventory becomes your character, and the entirety of your character becomes this sort of evolving classless microcosm with lovely, lovely stat numbers.\n\nWhat about the map?  Well, the map should be generated with a high degree of variety and excellent procedural generation mechanics.  Done.  But what if we want to make the map a living thing?  What if it's inhabited by robots which actually move around the level, expanding the map, rebuilding lost bits, picking up and moving scrap?  Lets give everyone and everything on the map a reason to be there.  Now *this* is a roguelike map with some significance!\n\nHow about the lore?  Given that all the robots on the map have a reason to be there, you emerge as a strange robot looking to understand a strange world.  Scattered throughout the level are many terminals which are very miserly with their function, but with multiple runs and lucky rolls, you can pry the story of the world out of them.  Each failed hack risks bringing down the guards upon you, but what can be more precious than secrets to an amnesiac starving for answers?  A certain satisfactory dynamic narrative emerges, not only a greater understanding of this robot-run world, but your character's place in it.\n\nDo you think roguelikes require difficulty?  Cogmind is difficult.  In fact, for the most part I would say you would be better rewarded with stealth, because the setting is one of a hostile world where you are hopelessly outnumbered if you attract too much attention.  I have played more difficult roguelikes, but I have to say I really like the balance I see here.  You will die, of course, with tradtional permadeath.  But each time, you will have learned something new, and have an interesting new strategy to consider going at it.  Like any good roguelike, being brutally returned to rock bottom is an exciting starting point.\n\nDo you think roguelikes require ASCII graphics?  Cogmind has you covered.  In fact, whether you run in ASCII mode or not, you're in for a treat of some of the finest tile-based animations to grace a parser.\n\nIt all ties together expertly, with a craftman's attention to nailing the fundamentals and implementation.  All this, well worth your $20, rock solid and playable, and he calls it an Early Access game.  \n\nOn top of that, I have to say the developer's a real nice guy.  He practically runs the roguelikedev reddit and stoicly puts up with my blathering about the things I do in Unity which can hardly even hold a candle to the magnum opus that is Cogmind.  I like to dream, but I lack focus.  But this game is a lovely reality, and an inspiration to what I might do if I can get my act together.  So yeah, maybe I'm a little biased, but that doesn't change that I have been playing games for decades and I hardly ever see them as ambitious and well-built as Cogmind.", "timestamp_created": 1508262151, "timestamp_updated": 1508263488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542393", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35800250": {"recommendationid": "35800250", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989332904", "num_games_owned": 708, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508260733}, "language": "english", "review": "I purchased this product through the creator's website and have been playing it since long before it came out on Steam, so ignore my played hours.\n\nCogmind is a complex, challenging roguelike with a focus on improvising your strategies and tectics depending on what you can find.

So maybe being stealthy might be a good thing! There's plenty of terminals to hack, which can give you information about the current security level, but also allows you to learn more lore, new schematics, repair parts, learn where the door to the next level is etc.\n\nIt's a very deep game, and it has a very extensive manual.

Looking forward to many hours playing Cogmind, happy to support it's development and it's devs.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nSome first impressions:\n\nControls: I found the controls for Cogmind, whether you're using keyboard only or using the mouse as well, work very well and smoothly, not like Dwarf Fortess or Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, whos controls take a bit of time learning and are slightly clunky (not to hate on DF or cdda, love both games!). The controls for Cogmind are very easy for newcomers to learn quickly and are well explained. UI works and looks great, and really gives you the feel of being some sort of robot-thing. Reminds me alot of the UI that Duskers has. \n\nGraphics: The default tileset for Cogmind looks good, clean, and crisp for a roguelike, but where the graphics for Cogmind really shines is it's UI (like I said earlier, beautiful and very atmospheric) and the graphical effects of weapons, items (such as scanners), explosions etc... are perfect and impressive while still remaining true to its 2D roguelike roots. Really pushing the bar for roguelikes everywhere. \n\nGameplay: Fast-paced battles while trying to stay alive and figure out what's going on, unsure if you'll even make it out of this fight. Try to stay alive, be it by fighting, sneaking and avoiding, run-and-gunning, searching for more loot to better equip yourself with weapons and items, all the while looking for answers to the many, many questions that lurk within Cogminds' setting.", "timestamp_created": 1508247925, "timestamp_updated": 1508333402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35794529": {"recommendationid": "35794529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006244202", "num_games_owned": 2125, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508710172}, "language": "english", "review": "So far, I did not have that much time for more playthroughs. But here is the end of my second run, which may give you some idea about the game.\n\nI was following an approach that was purely about going to the next floor, with no fight if possible. I had two treads carrying me, one hammer, one grenade launcher and one prototype energy weapon. Some commando robots saw me, and I tried to escape. I escaped into a deadend though. The enemy was approaching. I tried to hold the chokepoint and cludge the robots one by one as in usual roguelike fashion. It worked, kinda. Since in this game damage is not just a number, and it is distributed to your parts actually, after a while I lost all of my weapons except grenade launcher, my engine and my treads. So my body was consuming more energy than I produced which was zero. Some of the enemies had already died though, and while the others still shooting at me like I am a cyborg duck, I tried to scavange their fellow brethren so that I will have an engine. I even scavenged an armor, which helps me to protect my heart, I mean the core. I decided to use the grenade launcher at the end, but I was in melee range, so I tried to escape, except I had less and less energy. Then I decided to say YOLO and fired the grenade.

And it is fun from the start to the end. There are no boring parts. The game respects your time. It does not waste your time with time consuming mechanics (like xp-ing or grinding). You do not need to reserve long hours to play. You can play as much as you like, and even just a few minutes are enough to both enjoy the game and make a noteworthy progress in game. A few hours are usually enough to complete a full run. It has an excellent replayability which comes from a bunch of factors: a lot of unique parts you build your robot from, a lot of game mechanics you can incorporate to your playstyle or ignore (combat, stealth, hacking, allies to name a few), branched world, evolution points you distribute every level and story related decisions you make. There are additional challenge modes which turns some mechanics upside-down on top of that.\n\nCogmind is fun, plays smooth due to extraordinary UI, and has a unique game mechanics which make for interesting gameplay. This is generally what I was hoping for. What I did not expect was the story part of the game. There is a comprehensive world and a lore you slowly uncover with your subsequent runs. At the beginning I considered it a pleasant, climatic addition to the core mechanics - a garnish which is nice to have but definitely not necessarily needed to enjoy this game. The appreciation for the story was gradually growing. It is bigger than it seems. It is perfectly integrated into mechanics.

I've been playing it since Alpha 1, way back in mid-2015. Hundreds of hours. Now it's finally hit Steam Early Access, but it's fair to call it one of the most complete games to ever go through EA.\n\nYou are the Cogmind, a strange kind of robot. In your bid to reach the surface of a mysterious underground complex, you attach parts to yourself, building yourself into a stealthy flight bot fitted out with sensors, or you know, a walking death machine. It's up to you and what you find. You'll encounter many neutral robots going about their business, as well as quite a few hostile ones who seem to want nothing more than to tear your robot core apart. The combat is tactically rich, and there are definitely more reviews which go into more detail there, but I want to focus on stealth, which is really my jam in games. The stealth experience in Cogmind is raw, and gets to the heart of what I love about stealth in games: gathering information you can use to avoid enemies. If you find and attach a sensor array, you can observe the movement of nearby enemy patrols and take evasive action. Perhaps you attach a terrain scanner and spot that a nearby wall is thin enough to dig through to the other side, bypassing a corridor crawling with enemies. You can use transmission jammers to silence distress calls, optics to increase your LOS range, ECM suites to lose your pursuers quickly, cloaks to reduce the range at which enemies spot you, structural scanners to detect hidden passages... I've had some intense moments where I've been cornered, hiding behind a machine, hoping that the hunters searching for me aren't too thorough with my room. It's such a unique experience for a roguelike, and really brings stealth to a new level. I haven't even mentioned the diverse hostile robot types, terminal hacks, or some of the absolutely crazy unique items you can sometimes find, which may completely alter your strategy. Also, you can reach movement speeds so fast that sentries won't even know you've flown right past them.\n\nBefore we dig further into the game, I want to make some brief points on the difficulty and learning curve. This game is a traditional roguelike (despite the modern ideas and polish), and it has all the difficulty you'd expect of one. You're going to get brutally butchered in this game, and rightfully so. It's going to take a lot to get good at Cogmind, but the pleasure from mastering difficult games is one of the main reasons we play them (and especially roguelikes). The game starts off simply, and holds back the coolest areas, lore, and items for later. This is to avoid overwhelming the player at the start, and makes a lot of sense within the context of the game. But you'll probably still get wrecked early on if you don't apply good tactics and positioning. As the game goes on, it gets harder, and the items become more diverse and build-enabling. Cogmind has a much wider set of strategic variables to consider than other roguelikes I've played, and pure tactical ingenuity won't be enough to save you if you make grave strategic misplays down the road. If it's too hot to handle, or if you just want a more chilled game, Cogmind has two easier difficulty modes in the options. There is also a mix of challenge modes in case you really want to be stretched to breaking point. ;)\n\nStory isn't a major component in most roguelikes, and it's been a while since I've played a game with a story I've connected with, regardless of genre. Somehow, against all the expectations I had, Cogmind tells a stellar story, one that has kept me absorbed and thinking about the implications away from my computer just like the best sci-fi films do. You learn bits and pieces about the world and its inhabitants through terminal records scattered throughout the game, but the real gems of lore and story come from exploring the hard-to-reach places in the game. The story is so tightly and expertly woven into the gameplay that you can't help but get drawn into it as you play. Your choices have a large impact on the story and its resolution, and the story has a large impact on your choices. It's kind of hard to explain, so I'll leave you to discover it yourself. On a related note: Cogmind is filled with secrets, and some of them have a [i]huge[/i] impact on gameplay and also how the pieces of the world and story fit together in your mind, so I [i]highly[/i] recommend you play this game as unspoiled as you can. You have to do some proper detective work to figure everything out, and it's all the more rewarding when you do.\n\nNow let me tell you about the production values, which are immense, starting with sound. I normally keep sound disabled when playing roguelikes. Not so, with Cogmind. Playing this game without sound is unimaginable. There are sounds for [i]everything[/i], and they're so authentic. They really ramp up the atmosphere and draw you into the world. The satisfying sounds of dying robots and the deep rumble of a chain of nuclear reactors exploding just take the cake for sound design in a game. It's the little things, too, like the subtle audio cues when interacting with the interface, and the forbidding ambience of the caves.\n\nNext: the visuals. You have two ways to view the world: the tile set, and ASCII. I myself use the ASCII, which is beautiful and clear. Both options are highly expressive. The animations are grand as well. Most of the combat in the game is ranged, but between the sounds and animations, you can tell pretty much all of the weaponry apart. The explosions are glorious. Even in their aftermath, the walls have collapsed, rubble is strewn everywhere, and the floor is burnt to a black crisp. Every single item has special ASCII art associated with it, and it's phenomenal. There's even a gallery to view all the items you've ever equipped in all their ASCII art splendour, complete with item stats. Gotta equip 'em all! (there's a lore-dex for the lore you've found too)\n\nNow, for the user interface. UI in this genre is too frequently a barrier to players rather than a welcoming conduit between you and the awesome gameplay you know is there somewhere. Fortunately, Cogmind knocks this one out of the park, I mean, seriously, AAA game studios could learn a lot right here. In a game largely about items and information, the UI is vital to get right. Mouse users and keyboard users alike are first-class citizens here. I play exclusively with the keyboard, and all the controls are efficient and polished. The HUD is aesthetically pleasing too, fitting right in with the sci-fi setting of the game. All of this must've been a nightmare of work for the developer, but it's paid off dearly for the players. Lucky us!\n\nThis game is a work of art. It's remarkable that one person made all of this (apart from the tile set). You've got to check this out.\n\n[b]RECOMMENDED![/b]", "timestamp_created": 1508228272, "timestamp_updated": 1508846615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700854", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35789438": {"recommendationid": "35789438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070139566", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1513914946}, "language": "english", "review": "Please, if you want to support the dev - don't buy steam version of the game.

I started playing Cogmind back in Alpha 12, and over the course of about a year the game has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. There are just so many things Cogmind does right that it's hard to name them all in one place, but I'll do my best to touch on some of the best aspects of the game:\n\nUI:\nCogmind has the best UI of any roguelike in existence. It's entirely mouse friendly (though can be played with only a keyboard as well), displays TONS of data transparently (so much that many people are overwhelmed at the sheer amount, though this can be turned off), and has popups for everything (if you have any questions about a UI element, simply hover your mouse over it and a popup will tell you all about it). The UI is so fantastic and innovative that it's hard to play other roguelikes after playing Cogmind. \n\nArt Style / Animation:\n10/10. Whether you play in ASCII or Tiles you will not be disappointed with the look of the game. Cogmind makes excellent use of colors to help the player clearly identify friend from foe, and even distinguish difficult enemies from easy ones. The animations are also out of this world... pick up any explosive launcher and fire it to see a spectacular explosion of vibrant color, making large scale battles really amazing to see. Some animations even affect the UI, which I think looks absolutely awesome.\n\nSound Effects:\n10/10. No other roguelike comes close to matching the quality of sound in Cogmind. Every weapon has a unique sound, most explosions have unique sounds, there are unique ambient sounds throught the levels... even the stationary machines make sounds! The sound effects really bring the game world alive, and add a level of immersion that I didn't realize I was missing with traditional roguelikes.\n\nStory:\n10/10. I really don't want to say much here (as cogmind is very spoilery and I'd hate to ruin that for anyone), but *wow* is the story good. There are secrets *everywhere*, so much lore to find, and all kinds of things that make you rethink what you think you know about the game. There's even a *huge* twist that most people will never know about... Only the truly dedicated will figure out who's pulling all the strings ;) I've already said too much, so please do yourself a favor and discover this stuff yourself.\n\nGameplay:\nThe last category, but also the most important category, is gameplay... and Cogmind excels here as well. There are so many different ways to play through Cogmind, mostly differentiated (but not entirely) by the different propulsion available to you throughout the game. Flight often means stealth (real stealth, btw, no fake mechanics... you stealth by actively avoiding enemies and staying out of their sight), whereas legs or treads often mean combat (guns and explosions, hurray!) Due to Cogmind's extensive use of item destruction, you are not stuck to any type of build throughout the game... rather, you'll find that your builds will evolve as you find things / lose parts. Item attrition is a major component of whether a run will be succesful or not, so it very important to plan carefully. \"Do I enter a midgame branch and risk my current parts for the possibility of reward, or do I quickly run through main levels and risk becoming underpowered?\" These are the types of questions you will ask yourself as you play. Without giving too much away, I can assure you that the game is exactly as challenging as you want it to be; play it safe and a normal Access win shouldn't be too difficult, but take on some branches / extended and the difficulty will ramp up fast. \n\nI also want to mention that one of my favorite aspects of Cogmind is the ability to \"comeback\". Since you're characters power is largely determined by the items equipped, should you lose all those items it may seem like all hope is lost... but it's not! Cogmind can very easily run from most situations and rebuild from parts found around the complex, leading to some really spectacular comebacks. Just earlier on stream today I lost all of my flight propulsion to EM traps, and managed to rebuild just a bit later w/ some hover units I found, saving the day! This mechanic really makes for some dramatic and tense moments, which I find exhilarating. \n\nOverall:\n11/10. Cogmind is a Masterpiece. If all of that isn't enough to convince you to buy the game, then the final thing I will say is this... Kyzrati, the Developer, is an amazing person who has done wondeful things for the Roguelike community. Check out his blog (http://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/) or the subreddit's he moderates (roguelikes.reddit.com and roguelikedev.reddit.com) to see just how much of an impact he makes. The gaming industry needs more dev's like him, and that alone is worth supporting this amazing game in my book.\n\nBUY THIS GAME. You will not regret it.\n\n(PS: Want to talk with me, other Cogmind players, or Kyzrati himself? Come join us at the /r/roguelikes Discord server (the official Cogmind Discord server)!

If you like rogue-likes then you will most likely enjoy COGMIND.\n\n\"ASCII evolved: Most advanced terminal interface ever\" & \"Thousands of particle effects and SFX\"\nI love the UI for this game. Everything is very nicely done, and I love the ascii art in the item descriptions. I have never had any crashes or issues  running/playing this game. Not only is the UI nice in-game, but Options are well thought out. I prefer to play with the ascii display and only use my keyboard, but you can play with any combination of keyboard and/or mouse. There is a graphic tile set available in the Options (and is the default selection, I believe). There are like 30 combinations of size/font for playing in ascii. \n\n\"Dynamic character development without XP/grinding\"\nWhen the store page says you can be a slow well-armed tank, or a fast-moving flier, or a stealthy assassin/hacker, or whatever else; you will probably be at least two or three of those options per playthrough if you live long enough. Because you scavenge all your parts to upgrade youself with, you have to adjust based on what you find available. You will die a lot, so you'll get to try a bunch of options. :)\n\n\"Dozens of robot classes, each with unique behavior within the ecosystem\"\nYup. Obviously many will outright attack you, but some will hinder you in other ways that you might not notice at first, some are just going about their business and will leave you alone if you leave them alone, some will like you and travel with you, and some will frickin' steal your loot too. Since they are all robots, they are all also hackable to some degree. :)\n\nYou can do a lot of hacking of Terminals and other machinery as well. Hacking has so many uses in this game (simply opening a vault door, acquiring lore and schematics, crafting, sabotage, etc.) The Complex has a mind of its own and it is tracing and tracking you down too while you do it. Fortunately although you can to a lot with it, it is also not required to make progress in the game, at least in the early levels. \n\n\"Procedurally generated world combined with hand-crafted content\" & \"Fully destructible environment\"\nYes, everything can be destroyed, if your weapon if powerful enough. You can dig your own tunnels if you want, either via explosives or mining lasers. You can beat that power generator with your sword until it blows up and kills you if you like. There's only one thing in COGMIND that I think you can't destroy and that's the stairs to the next level, but I could be wrong. \n\nI like that there is an overall story to what's going on in this world too. Thankfully progress in the area of world lore saves and as you find bits of lore and discover new items and such they become available for viewing in the Gallery. Many items have ascii art, but some things are your usual little text snippets of information.\n\n\"Seven different animated endings to uncover\"\nOf which I have found none yet. After a year of playing I can still only make it like 10 levels into the Complex before getting killed, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

Every detail feels tangible and can be leveraged to your advantage. Maps and areas and items are amazingly well generated (maps are procedurally generated each playthough obviously).\n\n2) Developer involvement. The one-man team behind Grid Sage Games, Kyzrati, is an amazingly friendly and engaged developer. On every roguelike chat forum he is always willing to share tips, update the playerbase on new development directions, and even compete with the top players. He maintains a policy of open development, with a great blog over on his website. Cogmind is his work of love and he's already put in over 8,000 hours of work into making this game the best it can be, with even more planned.\n\n3) Polish. You won't find a roguelike with this good of an interface or fluidity of play. As I mentioned earlier, everything feels connected, everything believable. I love it. Don't let the Early Access label turn you away, this is more complete than most games that get pushed out into the mainstream these days.\n\n4) Lore and worldbuilding.

I've got many hours in this game unlisted as a result.\n\nCogmind is one of those beautiful gems you didn't think you'd ever find. Appearing at first to be a regular ascii roguelike, where you have to learn VIM or use unintuitive numpad controls, memorizing a bunch of keyboard shortcuts, it soon becomes apparent that it's much more than that. I'm new to the turn-based roguelike genre, but if you're looking to get into them, or are bored of playing every \"shooter roguelike\" that releases, THIS IS THE PLACE TO START.\n\nCogmind is beautifully complex, but presented simply. It's easy for a newcomer to the genre to understand (like myself), but from my understanding, it's complex and difficult enough for even veterans to enjoy. You can use mouse controls, keybaord controls, or a combination of the two to control the game, so it is instantly playable by anyone. There is barely any tutorial, but akin to games of old, encourages you to explore the interface and world, discovering the different ways you can interact with your equipment, the environment, and other robots, as well as with different playstyles.\n\nTo someone new to the turn based roguelike genre, it feels much more like an open world RPG that has permadeath than any other roguelike I've dabbled with.

While the game is less demanding than Brogue (from the perspective of simply winning, which is still quite challenging), with less seed variance (an approach with pros and cons), the game has effectively managed to appeal to me in a similar manner, in consistently providing decisions with satisfying amounts of complexity that can lead to some very interesting results. There is little in gaming that has been more fun to me than designing various killer-robots consisting of over 20 salvaged/found/fabricated parts in the lategame, with a similar amount of items in inventory, constantly modifying the specific layout based on finding better parts or simply replacements/alternatives to damaged ones, getting some actual pusback from the Complex such that even the best bots still have to think about their actions.\n\nI would recommend the game to anyone with an appreciation for challenging and complex game mechanics, and Cogmind gets a lot of bonus points for presenting that complexity in a way that is viscerally satisfying, this is the one clear advantage Cogmind has over Brogue and similar games: it's rare to get such strategic depth [i]and[/i] astonishing sound effects, beautiful ASCII art for over 800 items, lore entries that add a lot of flavor to exploring the world, and an actual interesting story to discover, even if it is difficult to fully discover, being sort of in the background and featuring challenges beyond simply making it out of the Complex alive.", "timestamp_created": 1508207711, "timestamp_updated": 1508253556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35785107": {"recommendationid": "35785107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107371645", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510456185}, "language": "english", "review": "As of this writing I have less than an hour of in-game time listed for Cogmind \u2013 though I have quite a bit more with previous versions of the game.

Permadeath. Procedurally generated content. Easy to learn, difficult to master but rewarding every step of the way. I've gotten in early here with a review on Steam but I strongly suspect you're going to see a huge mountain of Positive reviews as people start catching on to just how good this is. Been playing this one for about 6 months in Beta and I have to say... IT'S ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!\n\nFirstly there's a lot to be said about how tight the design is: I'm learning to make games at the moment and this one has been on my list of \"must examine this because it's brilliant\" for a good six months. \n\nHere's some of my thoughts:\n\n1. This is easily one of the most gorgeous looking roguelike games out there. The glowing graphics and animated effects (yes, even in ASCII) are bright, colourful and evocative of the machine-run sci-fi world the game so beautifully represents. The sound effects are solid yet unintrusive, and add a huge amount to the feeling of being drawn into the world around you. This is why we play games with ASCII or simplistic tilesets right? To let the imagination take hold too. The graphical ingenuity in this game never detracts from that imaginative immersion. You can seamlessly flick between the great tileset graphics and the ASCII mode, and this effect is used to great effect in transitions between levels, amongst others.\n\n2. The story is introduced subtly and revealed through exploration. I gather you can play through the game and happily ignore it, although I've found that a combat mechanics focused game like this is only vastly improved with fluff. The fact the lore comes in pieces only adds to the atmosphere. There's a cool story there if you look for it. Just when you feel overwhelmed by the mammoth task ahead of you, you'll suddenly find an oasis in the desert... moments like these are wonderful when they come.\n\n3. The combat mechanics are complex but so well hidden that you don't have to stare at mountains of data in order to perform well. This game will delight stat nerds and people who fear numbers in equal measure I think. There's a game of monsterous complexity under the hood, but the extent to which you interface with that is largely up to you. Everything is tool-tipped, which leads to the...\n\n4. ...superb User Interface: roguelike developers the world over need to look at how good the UI is on Cogmind. It's almost perfect. Menus and game critical information is easily accessed (or, very importantly,  hidden from view) with a single key-press. The game can be played perfectly well with just the keyboard, with just the mouse, or a combination of both. The menus are animated to look like what a Unix operator tripping on acid in the 70's probably thought Unix would look like in the year 2000! \n\n5. Anybody with an appetite for monsterously large amounts of gear to blow up, assimilate and use are going to be in 7th heaven. There's a seemingly endless amount of different guns, legs, reactors, scanners, data hackers... you name it, there's probably about twenty of whatever you named in there. And yet the game doesn't seem to suffer any loss in design elegance for all this \"stuff\". It never feels bloaty and everything in the game (that I've come across so far) has a use in one of the many custom builds you'll find yourself exploring.\n\n6: There are so many ways to play though. Stealthy airborn data analyser who spots threats way before they spot you then hacks their way past danger? Check. Massive firepower tanky bulk-lord who can literally roll over your foes, guns blazing? Check! Burrow your way through walls to avoid trouble? Check! I could go on...\n\n7: Still reading? Go buy this game and play it!\n\nNegative points? Hmm... as with a lot of roguelikes, it can be very difficult, but the learning curve is actually quite well balanced. Like all good games, when you do die, you know why, and it's always your fault. That being said, you can sometimes feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of enemies that the game throws at you, even at the start. This might put of casual players, but you very quickly learn how to avoid trouble until you're ready to deal with it. \n\nIt's worth stating that you do need to know what you're getting yourself in for with this game. It's tough, and it's big. It requires repeated efforts to learn, but that never feels like a chore.\n\nThis is a CLASSIC dungeon crawl roguelike game updated for the 21st Century. Kyzrati has nailed every aspect of this game and raised the bar for the innovation you can get into a genre that has a tendancy to stagnate through dogmatic adherence to outdated ideas: Cogmind is infused with a superb reinvention and execution of the all those classical roguelike features that kept people playing those games in the first place. Cogmind is futuristic in every sense, it's immersive,  technically brilliant, tactically engaging, endlessly replayable and great fun! Buy!\n\nEdit: just to add, how many developers do you know who would think of something as helpful as making a page for potential buyers showing off how the game will look in a range of popular screen resolutions? Seriously man, Josh Ge is a dude, he's thought of everything. One wonders what Nethack would be like if he'd been the lead designer on it?

It is enjoyed by those who are willing to adapt to different playstyles on the fly.

Slice and dice with your katanas, blow \u2018em up with your rockets, sneak your way using sensor array, or mind-control your enemies with your hacking suites.\n\nHowever, despite all the cool things you can find, Cogmind is not for everyone. The game does not reward grinding. It has no skill trees, no permanent items, no XP, no easy way to win. You need to develop strategy and tactical skills through time, experience, and persistence, but it is well worth it!\n\nThere is also a hidden gem in its well-told storyline.

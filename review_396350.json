would like to point out I started with bleed 1 on xbla ages ago before I owned a gaming pc.

Sure, some may say the game is super short, but who ever said that's a bad thing? This game is AMAZING for speedrunning and replayability! It's as if the game was created for the singular purpose of speedrunning (but can also be played casually for those who would like to, of course). \n\nDifficulty scales from pretty easy to EXTREMELY challenging (Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, [spoiler] Too Hard Mutator [/spoiler]). For starting out the game, I'd recommend going straight into the story mode on hard difficulty. It gives the game a fair challenge to start the game out with. When you mess up, it's almost never the game's fault. You may get hit too many times taking silly and easily avoidable hits or you're simply running/dashing into bullets, but you know you can do it if you keep going at it. Yes, sometimes RNG can screw up runs, but that's expected, since it's random, but it also adds differences to every playthrough. In some runs, you may not see all of a certain boss' possible attacks so that adds replayability, along with the unlockable characters, weapons, and abilities for tons of different play styles. For example, while some may use the bullet-time to better react to enemies' attacks, others might use it as little as possible to get a faster time. If I recall correctly, the story has some subtle and some funny changes for all of the different characters.\n\nThe bosses are the main portion of the game, as many can tell you, (though the platforming sections can be just as intense) and each one of them has a great amount of detail worked into their movement patterns, attack patterns, and designs. If you are familiar with Cuphead, then you should be familiar with bosses giving off special warnings before their attacks. Bleed 2 has the same kind of system. The difference however, is that as the difficulty is risen, boss patterns become quicker, giving you less time to react before they dish out their attacks or move across the screen. Projectiles on screen also become much more common and move faster in the higher difficulties.\n\nThe soundtrack is outstanding! All of the tracks are extremely catchy and they're fun to jam to while you play or even on the go. The art style is a perfect balance between retro and modern styles. \n\nThe controls are much more fluent, customizable, and generally better than they were in the first game. Mobility is fast, easy to get the hang of (even with a controller), and incredibly smooth. Something that I wish I had known during my second run of the game is that you can equip up to 5 different weapons at a time (some characters do not apply because of their unique weapons).\n\nWith 70 hours, and counting, I am still finding new little things to appreciate in Bleed 2, including references or throwbacks to the first game, secrets, and other Easter eggs. In order to get everything out of Bleed 2, yes, I would recommend you play through the first game, but it isn't completely necessary to understand the story. Bleed (1) can go as low as $1.24 during Steam sales, so keep an eye out for it.\n\nI would recommend Bleed 2 without a single doubt! 10/10\n\n(Technically I did get this game for free on its release date, thanks to a wonderful online friend of mine)", "timestamp_created": 1512708765, "timestamp_updated": 1512708765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38060770": {"recommendationid": "38060770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144799249", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "last_played": 1513948932}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub54c\ub9b0\ub2e4! \ud295\uaca8\ub0b8\ub2e4!\n\uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub290\ub9ac\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4!\n\nMADE IN HEAVEN!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1512405922, "timestamp_updated": 1512405922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37989347": {"recommendationid": "37989347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038132383", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512171564}, "language": "english", "review": "Although the game is fairly short ( finished my first playthrough on hard in around 1 hour), as with it\u00b4s predessesor a lot of your time will be spent learning and perfecting the multitudes of boss fights for those sweet S ranks. \n\nFeels wonderful to play and I would definetly recommend it to those who enjoy boss-rush games. \nPs.

It's unfortunate that it's so short!\n\nBleed 2 takes many lessons from the previous game in the series and builds up an incredible, explosive, triple-jump, slow-motion, boss-rushy journey that captivates and entertains. This 2D twin-stick shooter essentially plays like a inglorious child of Bayonetta, F.E.A.R., Gunstar Heroes and bullet-hell games. Gameplay flows and transcends the player in the game that will satisfy most demanding action junkies out there.\n\nThis game is also much more polished that its predecessor. The presentation is now improved with much cleaner graphics and very good rock music this time around. That few lines of dialogue that are considered \"story\" here aren't that stupid as in Bleed 1. Even the game overs flow much better and push you faster back into action, still keeping that 4th wall breaking charm. What didn't really need any improvement and still was tweaked even higher, is the quality and quantity of the bosses. Those are bigger, faster, more creative and all-throughout enjoyable no matter the level and design. Excellent work.\n\nAs I said in the beginning: The only drawback of Bleed 2 is that it literally ends after an hour of intense action. Are there higher difficulties? Yes. Unlockable characters? Yes. Additional modes? Yes. Those will make those self-improvers and S-rank chasers extremely happy, but I'm still hungry for more levels with this type of gameplay. I had a blast playing this and it's a shame that it doesn't come in the bigger package.\n\nThat being said, I believe you should help this dev out getting as much money as possible. He created a action-gameplay monster that deserves more recognition that it has right now. Buy it, play it and tell your friends.

After seeing the original Bleed on a video for XBLA Indie Store's [i]actual[/i] games, it became one of my top games of 2014 (the year I played it). A twin stick platformer / shmup with some realy unique combat mechanics due to the triple dash making for a very creative game. When I suddenly discover there's a Bleed 2, I knew what I'd been spending my afternoon in.\n\nThis game is amazing! There's much more emphasis on boss battles compared to the first one, because of this the platforming and enemies during the off sections feel very basic. A new parry action has been added, and not being able to parry all shots makes it quite a challenge (it appears that 2P can parry all, haven't tested it myself). All the bosses feel creative and fresh, it's going to get very interesting trying to beat the harder difficulties.

Bleed 2 is extremely fast paced, incredibly fluid and unbelievably fun.\n\nBleed 2 is a fast paced twin stick shooter. The player character, Wryn, is remarkably mobile, being able to jump using the right trigger, and then consecitively air dash 3 more times before touching the ground. Moving the right stick causes her to slash with a katana, after which she will immediatelly begin firing an endless stream of bullets from twin pistols. You can also hold down the left trigger to enter bullet time, which consumes energy. It's very useful for when things get really hectic.\n\nThe major new mechanic added to Bleed 2 is the reflection maneuver. As mentioned above, when you initially press the right stick in any direction, Wryn will very quickly slash with her katana before firing with her guns. This katana slash is imperative, as it will send any purple colored projectiles sailing away in the direction you hit them at high speed. This single new mechanic alone adds a ton of depth and opportunities for extremely badass moments.\nI can't think of any other indie game that made me smile with as much glee as Bleed 2 did, when a boss threw a car at me and I entered bullet time, air dashed through a hail of mid air projectiles, smacked the car with my sword and sent it careening right back into the boss' stupid face.\n\nNaturally, the game will reward you for pulling off tough maneuvers like this, as not only will reflected shots deal extra damage to enemies and bosses, but skillful play will also fill the in game style meter (Think Devil May Cry) with grades ranging from D (worst) to C,B,A, and S (Best) to better contribute to your rank at the end of the stage.\n\nThe gameplay is super responsive, controls beautifully, and is just awesome to experience. The pace is very fast, the game rushes you from one awesome setpiece to another as you mow down countless mooks inbetween. Completing the game also rewards you with unlockable characters and new weapons as well as \"mutators\"- special little twists to the game that can be individually turned on and off (things such as showing hitboxes, eliminating all gravity, having infinite bullet time, etc.) Activating these mutators does disable achievements and saving until you relaunch the game, but they're a fun curiosity nonetheless.\n\nThe only major complaint I have for Bleed 2 is the short length. The game, even on your first playthrough can be beaten in 40 minutes to an hour, easily. However, Bleed 2's saving grace is its high skill ceiling, and the way it encourages you to always get better and to always shoot for higher ranks and scores. You WILL want to beat this game on every difficulty and unlock every character and weapon, you WILL want to S rank every stage, and you WILL want to get all the achievements. Why? Because the core gameplay is just that damn good. It makes you CARE enough to actually want to do all of those things.\n\nI hope and pray that we get a Bleed 3 in the future, and it has a way bigger budget and more resources.

I am happy to say Bleed 2 fixes every problem I had with Bleed. \n\nIt's kinda sad though, as I can no longer see Bleed as an amazing game, at best it's good when compared to Bleed 2. I find it best to compare the games to Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2, SMG was an amazing game when it came out by when SMG2 came out it just shat all over SMG and the same thing happened to Bleed and Bleed 2, Bleed 2 is just so good it makes Bleed look like a crap game in comparison.\n\nSo with that being said is Bleed worth playing? Yes. Bleed is an alright game and playing it before Bleed 2 makes the game so much better. \n\nAlright, let's get on with the main part of this review. Bleed 2 is a \"Platform game\" but I prefer to describe it as a bullet hell-like 2D side scroller, the game takes place after Bleed, Wryn is playing games when an alien ship begins to attack, she hops into action and takes down the villains with the help of her rival, pretty basic plot but this is meant to be arcade-like so I can forgive it, what really matters is the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is great, they removed most of the guns in favor of buffing the good ones from Bleed and giving you and option to use both the katana and guns at the same time, allowing you to quickly switch from shooting to parrying without having to switch weapons and it flows really well, the game is as smooth as butter and unlike Bleed I didn't feel most of my hits were due to how weird the air dash felt, in this game if you get hit it's your fault and that makes the game a lot more enjoyable. \n\nHowever there are some cons which I will list in this nice little Pro/Con section for all those who want quick, digestable points to help push you over the edge and buy the game.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n+Pretty sprites\n+Nice animation\n+Fun combat\n+Fluid movement\n+Fun and useful weapons\n+Replayability\n+Fun, diverse characters and modes\n+Cheats\n+Fun and original bosses\n+Parrying mechanic\n+Taunt button\n+Old bosses made new through new mechanics\nP\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n-Every single Bleed boss is reused (Yes this is a pro and a con, I like and dislike it)\n-Makes Bleed look bad \n-I have to wait god knows how long for Bleed 3 \n\nA great indie game made by a

This game is an absolute blast, and what it does well, it does REALLY well. It controls are tight, its gameplay is solid, and the soundtrack is amazing. The game revolves around you making use of several key mechanics as you run/gun and fight bosses: first, you have three air dashes that you can use to dodge around before landing. Second, the ability to reflect attacks using your katana and good timing. Third, the ability to slow time for a few moments so you can make good use of those first two things! \n\nAs for the levels and bosses themselves, I thought they were very enjoyable. I'll admit I would have liked to see a bit more variety in the level portions (there's more of a focus on the bosses than in the original), but the boss fights are very well designed. There's a good amount of variety in each boss you encounter, and while the game is difficult (especially on the harder modes), it never feels cheap or unfair; you can identify your mistake, keep in mind how to dodge that attack for next time, or time that reflecting slash just a little bit better.\n\nThere are only two gripes I have with the game: First, a few of the bosses are recycled from the first game (Only a few; it's not terrible, but I'd have liked new ones more). Second, the game is short. There's replayability that comes from playing with new characters and unlocks, but each run through the game will probably only take you about an hour (longer if you're struggling with a harder difficulty, or much much shorter if you're good at the game and can speed through). \n\nEven with those gripes, this game is well worth a look. If you're skeptical or concerned about value, wait for a sale; but I think if you give this game a shot, you'll be more than glad you did!", "timestamp_created": 1501013369, "timestamp_updated": 1501013369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33787320": {"recommendationid": "33787320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061587046", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508786021}, "language": "english", "review": "[i][b]Bleed 2[/b], in a nutshell, is a twin stick shooter and platformer mash-up with some bullet-hell-y elements, mostly focusing on boss fights with some connecting areas, trying to always keep you on your toes.[/i] It emphasizes and improves on everything that made [i]Bleed[/i] great...\n\nYou play as Wryn, the Greatest Hero Of All Time (as she killed all the other ones in the prequel), who uses her katana-dual-gun combo and ability to dash through the air with terrifying precision to avoid attacks and fight the evil of the world (or that blonde guy). She can also use her katana to reflect (purple) bullets back at her enemies. And let's not forget the time slowing mechanic which allows her to pull off even sicker maneuvers.\n\nLet's be real: If you can manage to do all of that to some degree, it's gonna be super satisfying to play and go on.\n\nStory-wise, there's not a lot going on: Valentine, who is trying to become the Greatest Villain Of All Time, invades planet Earth (or at least wherever Wryn lives) and attacks with her army. Therefore, Wryn stops playing video games and instead decides to lay waste to everybody and everything in her way to stop those diabolic plans.\n[i]I think you may already know how this story ends, right?[/i]\n\n...\nOh, by the way: There's also a couple of unlockable weapons, characters and... air dodges which may really change the way you play the game.\n\nThe game in itself is also really short (less than 40 minutes in most cases) but is really supposed to be played repeatedly...

BUT ALSO because just a little bit of people bought the game and making the analysis in spanish will make that no one would see it,(but anyways someday i will do a second version of the analysis in spanish because i want to have all my analysis in my main language) AND as always i made a RESUME at the final of the analysis that also works like a CONCLUSION to the whole analysis. By the way, if i misspell some words or phrases let me know with a comment because im still learning the language :D\n\nBleed it's good but Bleed 2 it's just great!!\nBleed 2! The hero returns to give us a great sequel! A new villain appeared making chaos with it's robots and WRYN is going to stop her.\n\nIm going to analyze this game more as a sequel than an individual game (take in mind that the first bleed sold more than this, so im going to suppose that who are seeing this analysis played the first one) and im going to separate the analysis in themes:\n\nCONTROLS - BOSSES - REPLAYABILITY - IMPROVEMENTS AS A SEQUEL\n\nCONTROLS: What the... how? How did they do even better controls than the first bleed? IT'S AWESOME!!! Now you have the NINJA KATANA at the start AND equipped with the pistols, and to change what weapon you want to use is just by PRESSING the left click to use the NINJA KATANA!!! (with one pistol) and to use the pistols you have to KEEP PRESSED the left click. Also remember that with the katana (ninja) you can reflect bullets? Well in Bleed 2 you just can reflect SOME types of bullets BUT now you can reflect attacks with it, the PURPLE attacks can be reflected and the YELLOW attacks can NOT be reflected.\nThis makes the fights even more FAST and FUN, and makes the creators able to do more creative attacks with the BOSSES.\n\nBOSSES: My impression with the bosses are literally the same as the controls... Yeah...\nNow the strong attacks of the bosses are made better, they give you like 1 or 2 seconds to ummm.... REACT making like a noticeable noise and an animation which it will have a colour (purple or yellow) and depending on the colour you can: evade the attack OR reflect it with the NINJA KATANA making to the boss MASSIVE DAMAGE!!! So despite all the chaos there is in the boss fights now with this little detail makes you to UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING!!! \nALL i mean ALL the bosses in this game (except for the spammer in my opinion, because it's really easy and the only thing it does is... well... spamming things) are AWESOME!!! \nOh and also why when you get to a checkpoint you don't get healed, and this is BAD... WHY? y'know because THERE IS NO NORMAL WAY TO GET HEALED  you can heal only until you die or end the level, i just hate when i beated a boss like a PRO being at 1 hp and then appears another boss. So basically the game rewards you from dying (also there were some of those situations when i just decided to suicide because i was bad in life)\nWell that's all from the bosses, the other amazing things that make the bosses THE COOLEST PART IN THE GAME were ALSO in the first Bleed.\n\nREPLAYABILITY: This game (like the first one) has a really short duration but it compensates with the replayability making to appear MORE enemies being MORE agressives in harder difficulties. And NOW instead of having to buy the weapons like in the first Bleed, you unlock the weapons, characters AND new DASHES by finishing the game in different difficulties for example: beating the game in hard or higher difficulty. Which is something really good because this game it is meant to be played over and over and OVER!!!\n\nIMPROVEMENTS AS A SEQUEL: Let me explain this part a little bit, it is just some improvements that Bleed 2 made better than the first one that i wanted to mention and could not think on putting them on a specific theme (my brain couldn't handle it) or were too short to make them an entire theme. \nTHE GRAPHICS: REALLY GOOD! Just look at my profile image, it is a sprite of Wryn just LOOK AT HER! SHE IS ADORABLE!!\nTHE SOUNDS: Also REALLY GOOD they improved a lot the sounds too and made the characters to have VOICES... And how glad i am that they dont talk and it is just  for the moment like for example when you use the NINJA KATANA Wryn makes a HYAH!!! yell.\n\nRESUME: If you liked Bleed you will LOVE Bleed 2.... JUST BUY THE GAME ALREADY!!!\nBy the way writing this in a different language was kinda hard and took me more time than usually takes me making an analysis, but i had fun making it :D\nOh yeah, also give me a thumbs up, it takes you less time than finishing the game at your first time :D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAND NO!

Bleed(1) \u00e9 uma excelente mistura do estilo de Megaman com a velocidade e o bom humor de jogos como Metal Slug e uma mec\u00e2nica mista de platformer com twin-stick shooter em fases bem elaboradas que me convidavam a novas tentativas com armas diferentes ou tentando bater seu tempo anterior.\n\nA m\u00fasica \u00e9 melhor e tamb\u00e9m o gr\u00e1fico (do jogo, a arte do menu e das 'cutscenes' poderiam ser melhores). Mas o jogo parece muito compacto e n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito convidativo para zerar novamente. A mec\u00e2nica dos melhores personagens jog\u00e1veis \u00e9 basicamente a mesma (uma diferen\u00e7a \u00e9 poder rebater determinados proj\u00e9teis com a katana). Bleed(1) n\u00e3o \u00e9 longo, mas tem o necess\u00e1rio para entreter o jogador enquanto ele passa por conte\u00fado j\u00e1 experimentado. Fases n\u00e3o s\u00e3o longas, mas tem alguma varia\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00ednima de situa\u00e7\u00f5es at\u00e9 os chef\u00f5es. J\u00e1 Bleed 2, por algum motivo, parece extremamente compacto.\n\nAlguns percursos at\u00e9 o pr\u00f3ximo chef\u00e3o s\u00e3o interessantes, mas acabam r\u00e1pido demais. A impress\u00e3o \u00e9 que voc\u00ea passa de um chef\u00e3o para o outro quase que imediatamente. E \u00e9 apenas em batalhas contra chef\u00f5es que o jogo exige alguma habilidade. Inimigos ao longo das fases s\u00e3o praticamente inofensivos. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 surpresa, muitos deles parecem apenas adapta\u00e7\u00f5es de inimigos do primeiro jogo sem qualquer inova\u00e7\u00e3o relevante e tamb\u00e9m alguns dos chef\u00f5es s\u00e3o repeti\u00e7\u00f5es de chef\u00f5es do primeiro jogo com alguma m\u00ednima adapta\u00e7\u00e3o mec\u00e2nica.\n\nSe voc\u00ea ainda n\u00e3o jogou o primeiro e quer jogar Bleed2 por metade do pre\u00e7o, pode imediatamete comprar Bleed(1).

It the same genre, same gameplay style you would expect from the first game without being a blatant copy/paste. If you striped the game down to textureless hitboxes, it would still work. My following criticisms don't concern the gameplay and don't detract from the overall experience nearly enough to scare me away.\n\nThe music is satisfactory, just like the first game. It complements the gameplay well but none that I found myself humming in the shower, except for both games' title screens.\n\nThe story is like Duke Nukem Forever in the way Wryn starts as a beloved hero, and suffers in a similar way. For this and the previous game the story was never a make or break factor. If you did pay attention to the story in the first game, Wryn aspiring to become a hero was a nice goal to keep you going, even though you played for the gameplay anyway. In this game you start at the top and have nowhere to go; the events kinda happen just because. Duke Nukem Forever had a litany of problems on top of the story, but you should want your game to have as many strong legs to stand on as possible. If, say, the plant newscaster guy was more skeptical of Wryn, or she had something to fight for, this wouldn't be as much of an issue.\n\nMy last critique is that some character designs, especially the Wryn close-ups, look weird. I can't put into words exactly why, just some change between how she was drawn between games makes something tick in my brain.

Hard.\nIt's so bad, that some bosses are essentially unbeatable if you pick the \"wrong\" character, meaning that you might make it through most of a level fine (or even several whole levels) and then suddenly get stonewalled.\n\nThis is compounded by just how freakin' many bosses there are (often three or more in one level), and so you have to be able to beat *all* of those bosses with the character, or else there's no point in beating any of them since you won't be able to beat the level.\n\nThis is *even further* compounded by the fact that the health and energy upgrades from the first game are gone, meaning you have *basically no health or energy* on harder difficulties, even though Bleed 1 let you get around twice as much as you have in this game.\n\n*And if that wasn't bad enough*, the two characters with the most unique playstyles *require* a few quiet moments of setup to be able to use their special abilities, which means you *literally cannot use those abilities* during many boss battles, because there's *no down time at all* in them.\n\n\n\nOn a different topic, the levels seem more boring than in Bleed 1. I think they're simpler and shorter, but it's been a while since I've played the original, so I can't say for sure what's different.\n\n\nI love most of the new characters, and the new weapons and dodge abilities for Wryn are really neat to have, but the extra characters seem frustratingly neglected considering the various little bits of custom text for each character, as well as the few custom cutscene images added for them, and the game seems poorly paced.\n\nHopefully some of these things can get ironed out, because the game has a lot of potential, and a lot of good moments underneath the frustrations.", "timestamp_created": 1490342860, "timestamp_updated": 1490344277, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565799", "comment_count": "15", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30678755": {"recommendationid": "30678755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119573273", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490916918}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh my GOSH, I love this game! If you were a fan of Bleed 1 you will absolutely love this game. I'll just go through a few pros and cons and give a quick summary at the end. \n\nPROS:\n-Better Level Design\n-Better Music\n-Better Music\n-Wryn is even cuter than last time\n-Better story\n-More replayability \n-Gameplay is wayyy better\n\nCONS: \n-Shorter than Bleed 1\n\nSUMMARY:\nI was a huge fan of Bleed 1. I beat that game in one sitting and spent even more time trying to unlock the others weapons and characters. I honestly didn't think anything could top Bleed 1. However, Bleed 2 takes everything good and bad about the previous game and makes it about 1000x better. The music was the first thing that really popped out. The first thing you hear in the game is the original theme from Bleed, but instead on electric guitar. All of the stage music is super catchy too, I've been humming the final boss theme for a while now. The graphics are also noticabley better. Some of the characters still look a bit off, mainly Wryn and the rival, but all of the backgrounds and enemy sprites look amazing! The level design is also way better. In Bleed 1, you spent a lot of time in corridors with BS obsitcals and enemies put around every corner. In Bleed 2, all the enemies are put in spots that force you to kill them, overall bringing up your score and your cool factor B). The controls are just as good as it was in Bleed 1. One really cool new addition was the katana. In the game, you can flick the right stick (Or click the mouse) to swing a katana. This katana can deflect any purple bullets or enemies. This makes for some really interesting enemy design, making some of the bosses really fun. The levels also flow very smoothly as they all follow one quick and satisfying narrative. Unlike in Bleed 1 where all of the levels were just... there. There was really no transition between levels. The only problem I have with this game is its length. It took me about 3 hours on normal mode to beat Bleed 1. Bleed 2 took me under 2 hours on the hard difficulty. However, the game kind of makes up for it by having a ton of unlockables, however you can just get them all at once by beating the 'very hard' difficulty. Overall, Bleed 2 is a huge improvement over Bleed 1.

The controls are tight and responsive, and the levels are built to allow (and encourage) the player to keep moving at all times -  There are no unfair or cheap enemy placements.\nThe main portion of Bleed 2, however, is the boss fights, all of which are fun, interesting, and unique in their own way. Each of them have a different playstyle. There are very few frustrating or \"Ugh, THIS asshole\" bosses in the game. they each have unique attack patterns to get down, which adds to the replayability of the game, which we'll get to later.\n\nPresentation is another nail that Bleed 2 hits right on the head.The 8-bit art style has also been abandoned, which is nice because I feel it didn't suit the first game too well. each stage is vibrant and colourful, with their own unique style and colour pallette. The soundtrack is intense and metal as fxck, and the soundscape consists almost entirely of shouting, gunfire, and explosion. Long story short, the vibrant and bouncy art style and high-octane soundtrack compliment the thrilling, fst-paced gameplay perfectly.\n\nBleed 2 is a \"short and sweet\" type of game, (I finished my first playthrough (normal difficulty, not too many deaths) in just under an hour) But the multitude of unlockable characters, weapons and abilities, along with the multiple difficulty settings, and ranked arcade mode, will keep you busy for a long time. Each boss has certain weaknesses and strategies, and it feels super rewarding to master each level on higher difficulties and start climbing up the leaderboards in arcade mode.\n\nIn conclusion, If you want a fast paced, metal-as-fuck action platformer, You will definitely enjoy Bleed 2.", "timestamp_created": 1490037344, "timestamp_updated": 1490037344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30631067": {"recommendationid": "30631067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050115280", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494091092}, "language": "koreana", "review": "[h1]2D \uc561\uc158 \uac8c\uc784\uc778 Bleed 2\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.[/h1]\n\n[b]\uc7a5\uc810 :[/b]\n3\ub2e8 \uacf5\uc911 \ub300\uc26c, \ubd88\ub9bf \ud0c0\uc784, \uc30d\uad8c\ucd1d, \uce74\ud0c0\ub098\ub85c \ucd1d\uc54c \ud295\uaca8\ub0b4\uae30 \ub4f1 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\ub9ac\uc2dc\ud55c \uc561\uc158\uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc870\uc791\uac10\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uace0, \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ubc15\uc9c4\uac10 \ub118\uce58\uace0 \uc990\uac81\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ubcf4\uc2a4\uc804\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\uace0,  \uac8c\uc784\uc624\ubc84\uc758 \ubd88\uc774\uc775\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc11c \uc7ac\uc2dc\ub3c4\uac00 \uc790\uc720\ub86d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n[b]\ub2e8\uc810 :[/b]\n\ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \uc9e7\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 45\ubd84\ub9cc\uc5d0 Normal \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub97c \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\ud588\uace0, Very Hard\ub97c \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4 \ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc5d0\ub3c4 1~2\uc2dc\uac04 \uc815\ub3c4\ubc16\uc5d0 \uac78\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ubb34\uae30 \uc885\ub958\ub3c4 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac01\uac01 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\uac00 \uc5b8\ub77d \uc870\uac74\uc774\ub77c \ucc98\uc74c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \uce74\ud0c0\ub098+\uc30d\uad8c\ucd1d\uc774 \ubb36\uc5ec\uc788\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubb34\uae30\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uac15\ud574\uc11c \ud2b9\uc218\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uc81c\uc678\ud558\uba74 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubb34\uae30\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc801\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc774 \ubb34\uae30 \uc5b8\ub77d \ubc29\uc2dd \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 (\uc2a4\ud3ec\uc77c\ub7ec)[spoiler]\uccab\ud68c\ucc28 \ub77c\uc774\ubc8c\uacfc\uc758 \uacb0\ud22c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac19\uc740 \ubb34\uae30\ub97c \ub4e4\uace0 \uc2f8\uc6b0\ub294 \ub290\ub08c\uc774 \ub35c \ud574\uc11c \uc544\uc26c\uc6e0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\ub9cc\ud07c\uc740 1\uc774 \ub098\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4...[/spoiler]\n\n[b]\uc885\ud569\ud558\uba74 :[/b] \n\uc57d\uac04 \uc544\uc26c\uc6b4 \uc810\uc740 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc798 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc561\uc158 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c,\n\uac00\ubccd\uac8c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc544\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \uc561\uc158 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc6d0\ud558\uc2dc\ub294 \ubd84\ub4e4\uaed8 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n[h1]Bleed 1\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uba74,\t[/h1]\n\n\uac8c\uc784 \uc790\uccb4\uc758 \uc644\uc131\ub3c4\ub294 1\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc544\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\uc801\uc758 \ud0c4\ud658\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \ud295\uaca8\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub428\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc26c\uc6cc\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ubb34\uae30 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \uc790\uc720\ub85c\uc6cc\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\ub9cc, \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4 \uc774\ud6c4\uc5d0 \ubb34\uae30\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5b8\ub77d\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc2a4\ub4e4\uacfc\ub294 \ubcc4\uac1c\ub85c 1\uc758 \ubcf4\uc2a4\ub4e4\uc774 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0,\n2\ub97c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud558\uba74 \uad73\uc774 1\uc744 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud560 \ud544\uc694\ub294 \uc5c6\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n1\uc744 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc168\ub358 \ubd84\uc740 2\ub3c4 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc2e4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1489994915, "timestamp_updated": 1489994915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507024", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30613604": {"recommendationid": "30613604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031239937", "num_games_owned": 610, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489922000}, "language": "english", "review": "On it's own Bleed 2 is a great game with thight controls and fast paced action.

Felt like i ran through them, easy to dodge, and large, projectiles. Maybe all games are, but i think the bullet hell/platformer genre is specifically a challenge of pattern resolution. When the \"patterns\" are made up of large objects, and sparse in number, not only does the there seem to be little or no pattern, but i don't even have to look for the problem, or solution, to overcome it. Just fly through. That being said, there are certainly some of the MOST unique bosses i've ever seen in this game. The ones that aren't rehashed from the first are very interesting. Things i would personally never think of. Brilliant in that regard. Very creative level design as well, seriously some awesome stuff. I recommend this, but damn, wanted a lot more after the first one, seems like a cop-out of sorts, as if they needed a paycheck quick.", "timestamp_created": 1487049711, "timestamp_updated": 1487049711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29912422": {"recommendationid": "29912422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019550271", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487992780}, "language": "english", "review": "Its like the first bleed, but somebody said make it only boss battles.\n\nI kind of miss having levels, but its a great throwback to the fun I had with the original game.\n\nThe difficulty is a little sporadic, with the second hardest boss in the game being pretty early (the metal boss that blocks all damage until the core needs to change sides.)\n\nBut its good.", "timestamp_created": 1487036441, "timestamp_updated": 1488230082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507949", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29912321": {"recommendationid": "29912321", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998117014", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495859831}, "language": "english", "review": "Update:  Even though this game will feel short if you've mastered the controls of the original, it has huge replay value.  The new characters you unlock are really fun to play the game with, and most of them have their own style of gameplay.  The unlocked weapons are alright, but they don't compare to the convenience of having the katana immediately available to reflect attacks.  The different jump actions could use a bit of work at the time of writing this.\n\nStill, I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys platform shooter bullet hell katana-reflecting-bullet 4th wall-less games.  Especially people disappointed by Mighty Number 9.\n\n---- original reaction ----\n\nIncredibly fast-paced and fun.  A must-buy game for fans of the original and people who enjoy difficult, rewarding, insanely-paced platform shooters.  It seems like they switched from having you earn points to buy things to doing play modes to unlock things.  I've just finished the first playthrough (75 minutes) and am looking forward to seeing what these new things I unlocked do.  The game will likely be longer for people new to the series.\n\nIt's looking like a short game with heavy replay value rather than something redundant and drawn out.  I'd say I wish the game was longer EXCEPT that I have not seen if the new things change the game upon replay.  Regardless, it's worth the money, because I expect to replay it many times.  It's hard to say which I prefer at this point, but this game definitely feels like the original did.  Every level has some new game mechanic, style, fight, or obsticles to deal with, giving the game a sense that it's never just a rehash of something you just finished but with more durable/damaging enemies.\n\nSorry if this review is all over the place.

Several difficulty modes allow the game to be a blast across almost any level of player which keeps the game rewarding, but accessible. I cannot say that I am a hardcore gamer, so I am unsure if it speaks to the top 10% of ultra-experienced platformer veterans, but I had an absolute blast with this game. The music and sound design are also very notable. One of the only games in recent memory that I tend to crank the volume while I am playing. Bleed 2 is not incredibly lengthy, but the multiple difficulty levels which affect enemy/boss speed, power, and reaction time, several unlockable characters, and the option for couch co-op allow the game to remain substantial. \n\nFor what it's worth, the developers of this series are incredible people and I would highly suggest supporting them.

Boy what a few hours those were, turning into at least 10 hours within the first couple days. 10 hours doesn't seem like much to an outsider's perspective, but when you consider the game can be beaten in around 30 minutes, then it must be doing something right. Hidden among that shorth length are some of the most memorable blazing fast encounters I've experienced from games in quite some time. I wasn't a big fan of side-scrolling shooters in the past, but I think this game has sparked my appeal to the genre.\n\nIn this game, you play as Wryn, the \"Greatest Hero of All Time\" triple-jumping back into action to stop an invasion from a powerful being named Valentine. Each level lets you shoot, slide, slash, and slow time to better your odds against several returning and unique new enemies. You'll face robots, rivals, and revenge-seeking loyalists while running from explosions, rising on missles, and ricocheting around space ships too! The variety is incredible. Despite this, the story follows a more linear route as opposed to the hit-list from the last game, and yet manages to have many more unique and fun bosses to fight (with some from the previous Bleed game returning)\n\nThe biggest thing that jumped out at me though were the minor differences from its predecesor. For starters, Your default weapons are the pistols AND katana, which allows you to both shoot reflect certain colored projectiles back at enemies, or even reflect the baddies themselves! This creates a great new gameplay dynamic were shooting is no longer the only method to thining the number. The plethora of cosmetic changes (better sprites, better bullets, and better sound effects) only adds to the presentation. On top of all that, the change in soundtrack was a big step in the right direction. Rock 'n' roll action tunes seem to fit the pace and setting better than Bleed's chiptunes.\n\nMy only real complaint is its short length, which can be forgivable given its tight focus on mechanics and replayability. I find the difficulty settings on the whole to be a touch easier than the last game, but much more fair, a similar sentiment I share with the arcade mode, where you play through the whole game on a single life bar. I admire the small features like replay recordings and challenge modes, all which simply serve to enhance the original game. Even now I feel like going back this second to shoot more robots and reflect missiles.\n\nI've seen a few people complain about the games pacing. On the contrary, the pacing seems even better in this game than the last, since its very fast-paced and action packed. As of time of writing, I have yet to try the multiplayer mode, a situation I plan to aliviate soon. I doubt it will disappoint, as the rest of the game has passed will flying, pink/purple colors!

I'll note right away that this is a very score focused game, much like the original. No RPG mechanics, barebones story, no fluff - my first run through story mode took about an hour on Hard. \n\nHowever, what is here is absolutely nailed - so far I'm enjoy this just as much if not more than the original. The stages are fairly short but each boss is satisfying to fight and none overstay their welcome. The unlockable characters in particular (and weapons, to a lesser extent) are excellent for adding a bit of variety to each run, as each offer unique abilities - and every character feels well equipped to deal with each stage. There is noticeable consideration taken towards making sure the game is still challenging and fun with all of them.\n\nPretty much the only downside I can note at the moment is how there's very little feedback when you take damage. Sometimes amidst the chaos it's hard to tell when I get hit, and paying attention to your HP bar is equally difficult. While it may get easier to notice with practice, it makes learning how to avoid certain attacks early on pretty rough.\n\nDespite that minor gripe, this is an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoyed the original, and if you haven't played that, I recommend both if you enjoy fast paced score attack type games.", "timestamp_created": 1486860447, "timestamp_updated": 1488247777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29853853": {"recommendationid": "29853853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063935491", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499588628}, "language": "english", "review": "Frantic, fulfilling and fucking fun.

YOU felt what she felt: the challenge. The challenge of getting your teeth bashed in by each boss and kicking you in the head, eventually triumphing with a smile that was wider than the Joker's. you could spend hours perfecting the original bleed, and you could BUY WEAPONS THROUGHOUT THE STORY (more on that later on). you weren't stuck to a stream of bullets and a quick purple bullet popper of a katana. you could snag a flamethrower for dispersing crowds that jumped you, or pick up akimbo pistols for a southpaw sort of challenge. the bosses were memorable, the levels were long, dense, and harder than ten miles of titanium. this is why i have such a problem with bleed 2.\n\n\nBleed 2 was short. if you played on hard, and happened to be rusty like i was, you would've cleared the entire main story in roughly an hour. the main story has no real reward system via cash or in game \"here's a badge, champ, go get em.\" type of thing. it was just a forcible, all in one sitting style of game. im sure you could have quit the game to stop, but there were no natural pauses in it. \n\n\nMy personal biggest bitch of all: this game locks off every single other, truly unique playstyle until you finish the game. it's like finishing a bicycle race in first place with a shitty, scrapyard, DIY bike, then having the guy who organized the race to give you his personal array of bikes, from mountain bikes, to cruisers, to everything under the sun that has two wheels only. you can't enjoy a free playstyle until you've beat the game.\n\nthe challenge has also left, leaving you with weak transitions into tedious bosses with boring attacks, and simple mechanics, at best. MANY old bosses are repeated, as a slight pinch of salt into what may very well be a wound that shouldn't be there. Meeting the classics was sorta fun, but it felt genuinely lazy because now it was maybe five or six (rough guesstimate) new bosses/boss concepts. the only justified reuse of bosses was [spoiler]when you're finally facing down your classic, golden haired rival and he pulls out some old stops to give you a flashback and some old air that felt fresh, in a way[/spoiler]. Back onto mechanics: the only the most unique mechanic was in the final bossfight, which involved . [spoiler] the final boss is the  blue haired chick, and you can only defeat her with taunting and taking off massive fuckin chunks of health[/spoiler].\n\n\nAll in all, the game is not the sequel i was hoping it would be. i wanted more dirty fighting that involved unfair challenge that i could overcome through sheer will and focusing, the kind that piss you off and dare you to come back for more abuse till you knock it flat on its ass and jump in the air with angry excitement, only to dread the next level that was even more daunting; and i got a short story with an ending message that feels like it's from a 90s television show for kids. yes that IS wryns personality, but it felt much more fake this time: you were taken on a ride instead of driving the car. thats another personal bitch about it, but thats just what i personally feel. I wanted to be a daring, rising hero again, the kind of hero that really earned her reputation as the number one of the entire world, but all i got was a quick trip into defeating a much less impactful feeling villain's lair, and [spoiler]an old rival turned forced gaming buddy[/spoiler]. I do have to admit, the ending chunk was cute because of the personal feeling to it, and you really felt the stakes raising higher than before. you got the sense of tension that wryn sorta felt, and it was great having an old titan of fightin to go up against, another chance at a classic fight moment to really bring back the old memory of playing bleed 1. but if the best bleed 2 can capture of bleed 1 is a passing memory... is it really worth it?\n\n\nTL;DR: short, easy, boring boss, cute end bit, no true arsenal altering until you win, but overall just not what i expected from the sequel to the game that makes you bleed internally, bleed.", "timestamp_created": 1486810772, "timestamp_updated": 1486810772, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560265", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29844418": {"recommendationid": "29844418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082626069", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487396114}, "language": "english", "review": "very nice\ntight af", "timestamp_created": 1486810134, "timestamp_updated": 1486810134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29838895": {"recommendationid": "29838895", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983782187", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491600541}, "language": "english", "review": "I was (and still am) a huge fan of the first Bleed.

And I can proudly say that the sequel was worth the wait.\n\nFirst off, the combat. Although it doesnt have quite as many weapons as the original Bleed, it makes up for it due to the versatility of the weapons themselves. The default Blade+Pistol combo allows for the action to focus a lot more on reflecting attacks, a feature that I personally thought was underdeveloped in the original. Also, now that you can have more than 2 weapons on your equip wheel, you'll be able to get to your favorite weapons faster than going into the menu, going to weapons, and swapping out one of the slots for it like you had to do in the original bleed.\n\nNext, the level design. The levels in Bleed 2 are more of a segway towards your next miniboss/boss, compared to the majority of the experience like in the original. Although it allows for most of the time to be spent fighting bosses and understanding new patterns, I think that the stages could have had more obstacles. For example, one of my favorite non-boss moments from the original Bleed was the beginning of the Dragon stage, where you had to quickly dash through mini platforming-puzzles before it moved down to the next area. Meanwhile, in Bleed 2, none of the stage hazards were nearly as challenging as the Dragon one. Also, I miss the occasional foreshadowing of what each boss would be (Gibby and Stu hopping around in the background, etc.)\n\nNow, for the most prevalent aspect of the game, the boss fights. Due to them being the new focus of the game instead of the levels, I was able to enjoy the new mechanics used by the bosses. Compared to the original Bleed, the boss fights are much more interactive, as there are many more options on how you can dodge/conter attacks. \n\nLastly, the replayability. Although the game is very short (1 hour, 1:10 first playthrough), the post game unlocks will keep you coming back until you've gotten them all, as they allow for new playstyles and challenges compared to the base experience.\n\nOverall, I would reccomend that you play Bleed 2. Even though the levels aren't as challenging, the boss fights and the refined mechanics make the experience more focused and unique. :wrynhappy:", "timestamp_created": 1486781426, "timestamp_updated": 1486781426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29837166": {"recommendationid": "29837166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056593608", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500085894}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this the moment it came out.

I suspect I will be playing entirely too much of Bleed 2 as well.\n\nFor those that aren't familiar, Bleed 2 is a run and gun action game, not so dissimilar from old arcade titles from the 16/32-bit days of video games.  You play as Wryn, a woman with the ability to dash multiple times in mid-air, deflect projectiles with a katana, shoot a never ending stream of bullets, and slow down time.\n\nBleed 2's story mode is a direct continuation of the original.  It's a stage based campaign with very focused, linear levels. While it lacks the humorous twist of the original, and has less input from our heroine, it's still a fun and humorous trip that goes for roughly an hour.  This game removes the ability to spend points to level Wryn up, but does give you new weapons and types of dashes to use whenever you beat one of the difficulty levels.  Personally, I like this decision as it removes the incentive to repeat stages for the express purpose of grinding, and can instead be designed around a specific amount of HP and \"slow down time\" meter.\n\nThe overall presentation is drastically improved over the original.  The colors are bold and make it easy to pick out what's a threat to you and what isn't, the animation looks very good, and the music is pretty solid.  The set pieces and environments are well done too.  I would also like to mention a couple of very helpful visual cues added to this game.  One is that any projectile/object you can deflect glows Wryn's color.  So if the object is purple you can deflect it, which takes all of the guess work out of defending with the katana.  Another nice addition is that when you've used up all of your airdashes, Wryn's boots leave a puff of smoke instead of the usual trail, making it easier to keep tabs on when you need to touch the ground again.\n\nIf you played the original you'll see some familiar faces, sections of levels, and enemy patterns, but it's not so much that it feels like a rehash.  Each encounter has enough content added onto it that they still feel fresh.  There were even a few moments where I found myself getting hit by attacks simply because I assumed that they would follow the same pattern as the original.  There's definitely plenty of new stuff to warrant a revisit from fans of the original, even if it does sometimes feel a bit too familiar.\n\nMuch like the original, increasing the difficulty expands what the enemies can do.  This is something I'm pretty happy about as many games simply crank up enemy HP and the amount of damage you take.  Going from Normal to Hard still gives you good reasons to stay on your toes and keep an eye out for new attacks which help keep things interesting.\n\nArcade mode also returns, allowing you to take a straight shot through the entire game in one go cut scenes and continues excluded.  One new addition to Arcade mode are health pickups.  In the original, you had the one health bar for all of Arcade mode so it's nice to be able to refuel between stages.  What is especially smart about this addition is that the extra health is usually slightly out of the way, thus adding to your time, and it resets your Style meter.  So the more casual player can get a breather, and those aiming for the fastest times and highest scores still have some risk/reward to contend with.\n\nThe incredibly silly Challenge mode is back as well.  This mode lets you hop into an enclosed arena and fight up to three bosses... all at the same time.  Is it reasonable? Not at all, but it's a fun \"what if\" style mode that's definitely worth trying.\n\nBleed 2 is a fantastic little game.  It may be short, but it also never over stays its welcome or feels like it has any filler.  It looks good, sounds good, plays great, and has plenty of replay value for those that enjoy what it has to offer.  If you're a fan of old-timey run and gun 2D shooters, I highly recommend it.\n\n- Update:\n\nSo it's been a couple of months and I haven't played it as much as I thought I would, but I stand by my recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1486768422, "timestamp_updated": 1492970639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29833429": {"recommendationid": "29833429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144386771", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486767642}, "language": "english", "review": "It is one of the games i would buy instant a dlc for it", "timestamp_created": 1486764156, "timestamp_updated": 1486764156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29833286": {"recommendationid": "29833286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026234938", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486755649}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game but also really short.

A boon to late-game arcade mode play.\nIt also incentivizes co-op and parrying far more than the original with its color-coded parrying system, on top of condensing parry and fire into one action.\n\n10/10 would recommend, with a friend.", "timestamp_created": 1486711730, "timestamp_updated": 1486711730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532710", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29817179": {"recommendationid": "29817179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092033007", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506856665}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing.\n\nIt's a 2D bullet hell shooter that's so fast paced that they have to give you the ability to slow down time.\n\nGreat level design amazing soundtrack brilliant pixel art and a crap ton of cool boss fights.\n\nThere are at least 3 boss fights in every stage.\n\nOnly downside it's abit short finshed it in abot 40 mins but it was worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1486706540, "timestamp_updated": 1486706612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543930", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29816892": {"recommendationid": "29816892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038736822", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1514583419}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing game, but unfortunately short.

At its core,  it's a very solid experience.  The systems are excellently designed, the new additions (such as sword swipes occuring with trigger pulls and reflecting certain attacks) are brilliantly thought out.  I can't stress enough how well the game's control and interaction was thought out.... but it feels like, after this was perfected, the developer realized he needed a game to use it on and kinda just filled up the levels with mostly forgetable minibosses and extremely lackluster platforming.\n\nLength & Value:  Bleed 2 is a very short game.  Very short.   It's an arcade styled title at its heart so it clocks in at around... 40 to fifty minutes for your first time (including quite a few deaths), if that?  Unless this is a game you see yourself playing repeatedly, you should wait for a sale.\n\nDifficulty:  Honestly, Bleed 2 is a lot easier than the first game.   I wouldn't even rate it as very hard as far as the genre goes.  The minibosses in particular are painfully simple at times and they become the bulk of the gameplay (more on this later).  Big bosses however are really special and interesting to fight, it's a polished experience, but they feel like they take too much damage.  It's a fairly short affair.\n\nPacing: This is where Bleed 2 falls apart, at least in my eyes.  It has a massive issue with its overall pacing compared to the first game.  In Bleed 1, you would platform and shoot through a short-ish level. During this time, the boss you'd soon fight would sometimes act as a distraction or an enviromental hazard.  This lead-up really allows you to feel the Protagonist's power level as she zips around the traps, projectiles, and enemies.  The experience of the levels was a liberating one, and allowed the player to savor the (often claustrophic) duels with bosses far more.\n\nBleed 2, does not have this.  Instead you will have miniboss after miniboss with short, FF13-esque corridors between them.  We're talking, thorugh the first level, it's only a handful of seconds between each of the bosses and really destroys the flow of the platforming.    The level sections are also very lackluster.  Usually it's just a few floating platforms to hop between with enemies (seemingly quite a few recycled from the first game).  And then you get to the minibosses, who are pretty spongy, and lock you into a small room for a duel and stop your forward progress for a while. \n\nIt's baffling that the platforming wasn't more fully realized, especially when the game is very short as it stands.\n\nBoss quality:   The game's Furi-esque focus on bossfights wouldn't be an issue if they were fun. They aren't.  After twenty minutes I had to take a break because of how boring it got. It's  largely just one bulet-sponge boss after another, eadch with their own little gimmick, but not a very trying one.  There's a few exceptions with stage end-bosses but even then it doesn't really offset the lesser encounter.   It would've helped if there were interesting interaciton with the enviroment, or lots of boss-stages, or transfomrations- something to increase the interactivity.  But there's not much.\n\nAll in all, the experience left me lethargic rather than empowered.  It wasn't what I had hoped out of such a long awaited sequel.  That's not to say the game is terrible, it's just... not one I'd really recommend.  Your mileage may vary.\n\nAnd first negative review for the title, huh?  Comments section isn't gonna be pretty.\n\nEDIT:  One thing I forgot to add is how weapon unlocks work.  Remember in Bleed 1 how you could buy weapons throughout your first playthrough? Not anymore. Now it's done by beating the game on (whichever) difficulty level.\n\nSo you better enjoy the dual handguns+Katana, because it's all you get for your first playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1486696992, "timestamp_updated": 1487877511, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633919", "comment_count": "18", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29815327": {"recommendationid": "29815327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159679170", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509833897}, "language": "english", "review": "Music: 100/10\n\nGameplay: 100/10\n\nEverything else: 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10\n\nGrand total: 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200/30", "timestamp_created": 1486696750, "timestamp_updated": 1494106452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29814696": {"recommendationid": "29814696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081990964", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486646591}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game :D i havent played the first one but great game guys i am a gameplay on my channel check it out when you get a chance :D", "timestamp_created": 1486693878, "timestamp_updated": 1486693878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29813801": {"recommendationid": "29813801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027851006", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486767733}, "language": "english", "review": "The linux port is smooth af.", "timestamp_created": 1486689669, "timestamp_updated": 1486725548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29812827": {"recommendationid": "29812827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046916719", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499011895}, "language": "english", "review": "Rather than just provide more of the same, the dev stepped up their game and made the sequel even more awesome than the original.

I highly recommened this game to anyone who's a fan of sidescrollers such as Mega Man X, Contra, Metal Slug, Rocket Knight Adventures etc.", "timestamp_created": 1486665107, "timestamp_updated": 1486665262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29807004": {"recommendationid": "29807004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021021584", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487086831}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0442\u0438, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u044d\u043a\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0430! \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0451\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u0438\u0438\u0438\u0437\u0434\u044b \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0443, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c! \u0417\u0430\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0451\u0442! \u0418 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u0435\u0451 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0441. \n\u0423\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439, \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439! \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435, \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u044f! \u041f\u0440\u044b\u0433\u0430\u0439, \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0439 \u0438 \u0430\u0445\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0439! \u041c\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u044d\u043a\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0430! \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e, \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e! \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d: \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0449\u0451, \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0438 \u0435\u0449\u0451! \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433 100%! \u041f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u043a\u044c\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0441!", "timestamp_created": 1486664063, "timestamp_updated": 1486664063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29806637": {"recommendationid": "29806637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030145876", "num_games_owned": 512, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486926093}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the *definition* of quality over quantity.

What this had done was essentially that it created a sort of genre that had previously not existed and it did this very well.\n\nBleed 2 did not disappoint at all. With the tight controls that platformers deserve and new working concepts that the players deserve, this game is truly something special. On top of the unique quad air dash and bullet time from the first game, a Katana was added to bring a whole new aspect to the gameplay. The katana provides a very organic way of deflecting projectiles that works so very well. This game's scoring system like many older arcade games has unlimited replayability.\n\nWith added customization, localization, and play modes- this game has it all. It captures the old nostalgia of arcade games with an indie game that is worth more than it costs (in my opinion as a fan of the series), Bleed 2 is a must-own title for anyone who enjoys: Platformers, Action Games, Twin Stick Shooters, Arcade Games, Bullet Time, Boss Fights, Story/Campaign Play, Couch Co-Op OR Bullet Hell games. I use the work OR instead of AND because this game can appeal to a massive variety of gamers for a large variety of reasons.\n\nFinally, this game has the feel of Megaman X as you start the game and proceed through the first level. The music, the style and the action successfully re-create the general feel of excitement and anticipation that Megaman X made me feel as a child. The game starts strong and the gameplay remains strong throughout the entire game. With adjustable difficulty, this game is for anyone who likes video games and I highly recommend it to everyone. Definitely a gem of 2017.\n\nOne last mention... this is the only game I have (besides Bleed) that controls equally well with the Mouse and Keyboard, PS4 or Xbox One Controller AND the Steam Controller (which is my personal favorite way to play this game). The developer was nice enough to create a Steam controller binding for Bleed 2 that handles the game perfectly.", "timestamp_created": 1486627916, "timestamp_updated": 1486628226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29795444": {"recommendationid": "29795444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000218897", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486619025}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game but its a bit short. i will recommend this game but just know it doesnt have much to it. i really hope that there will be more added to it.", "timestamp_created": 1486618849, "timestamp_updated": 1486618849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29795343": {"recommendationid": "29795343", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961071902", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487370216}, "language": "english", "review": "Just beat the story mode on Normal, playing co-op with my brother.

That might sound like a bad thing, but it's not. The original Portal was short too - because only the absolute best quality gameplay was included. No filler, no wasting your time. It's the same here.

It's utterly beautiful how well this game sucks you into the flow state and keeps you there.\n\nThe technical execution of this game is much improved over the original Bleed. The sprites are prettier, the sound is fuller, the entire game is just jucier - it's a real treat to play. The mechanical aspects of the game are an improvement as well. I won't go into that part as not to spoil it, but there are some really clever things done that take the Bleed paradigm to a whole new level. \n\nOn top of that, the game doesn't really end at the end of the campaign. With an action game like this the real name of the game is mastery through replay. Changing the difficulty vastly changes the game, and I will be re-playing the heck out of it, honing my skills each time, and trying to unlock all the things.

When one comes out, the entire community jumps on the chance to play them because it's likely there won't be many more throughout the year. Bleed 2 caters to that audience with flying colors. It takes the first game's refined gameplay and improves it even more, all while not wasting your time. Many games like this pad out the experience with minigames and/or long walks to the next piece of action, but Bleed 2 is basically an arcade game; fast, short, to the point, and almost no downtime. I played through it in one sitting (about 45 minutes on Normal with a few deaths) and felt immersed the whole way through. The new bullet reflect mechanic adds an interesting dynamic to the core gameplay from the first title and also keeps things fresh.\n\nMuch like an arcade game, most of the replay value will come from self-imposed challenges along with the healthy amount of unlockables. This game won't satisfy anyone looking for a meaty 6-8 hour experience, but is a great fit for any other action game fan. With the refined gameplay and lack of rough spots in the campaign, it will offer many hours of fun to anyone willing to unlock everything and attempt to go for high scores.", "timestamp_created": 1486604651, "timestamp_updated": 1486604651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29792814": {"recommendationid": "29792814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078130521", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497634068}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1486603851, "timestamp_updated": 1486603851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29792629": {"recommendationid": "29792629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037499511", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486615635}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Fast Paced Shooter and an Excellent Sequel\t[/h1]\n\nShort review, if you loved Bleed 1, you will love Bleed 2. \n\nBleed 2 is a fast paced twin stick shooter with some minor platforming. The most important thing in a challenging game like this is control, which thankfully like the first game is precise. I do recommend playing with a controller though. The character can double jump, dash, slow down time, and new feature reflect bullets.\n\nThe characters are once again charming, and well animated. The boss fights once ag\nain are legendary and a lot of fun.\n\nThe game is short, but honestly each level is so much fun and action packed that the price didn\u2019t bother me.

Taking place after the events of the first game, Bleed 2 has you control Wryn again to deal with an alien invasion.\n\nStory wise there really isn't much to say, Bleed was never really known for its story but gameplay wise I think Bleed 2 makes many great changes that improve the game's overall appeal of fast-paced action and tough boss fights that keep you trying over and over again, especially on harder difficulties. \n\nSome of the bosses are new, some come from the original Bleed but most of them are tough because of the low margin of error in their attack patterns and the speed at which they output moves. It's not always possible for you to tell what attack is coming before it's already making it's way to you, which is where the ability to slow down time comes in handy. This is a game that tests the reflexes for the hardcore player looking for a challenge but its lower difficulties also accommodates the more casual players with an abundance of health and checkpoints in all the maps. \n\nThe progression element was taken out in Bleed 2, instead now you only unlock items once you've beat the game on a certain difficulty but since the double pistol and katana combo would only be less ideal to use than other weapons in select few circumstances, the lack of a progression system isn't as bad as one would think. \n\nI don't know if I'd recommend this game for someone looking for a casual time, but if you want a challenging 1-2 hours, give Bleed 2 a try on very hard difficulty.

As a matter of fact, I still haven't beaten the Arcade Mode in it...and with Bleed 2, that's going to have to wait.\n\nFirst of all, Bleed 2 is a single-player game. Many look at this and say \"Is it gonna be worth it? There's not much to do, right?\" But I argue against that. Bleed 2 is a game where its main goal is not just to beat the Story once and to get all the achievements, it's to really master the game itself so that you can beat it with ease. If you've played Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Metal Gear Rising, or...well, Bleed 1, you're gonna like this.\n\nA quick run on Hard (that's assuming if you're good; please keep in mind I played the original, which probably helped me out a lot) got me some unlockable characters, weapons, AND different abilities for Wryn, so once you master the game with the standard moveset, you can find ways to break it with all of the new characters and abilities you've got. The original Bleed had a shop system where you bought items as you gained more points; this has been removed in favor of (I'm assuming) beating the story on its various difficulties and completing Arcade Mode (one life only).\n\nThe atmosphere of this game is also really great. Despite the name, it's not as dark as it seems. Wryn is an incredibly cheerful protaganist in a world filled with cats shooting her with rockets, a cowgirl blasting projectiles everywhere, and a flower guy reporting her actions on the news as she marches on to defeat the villains of this colorful universe.\n\nAlso, the music is astounding. While the first had chiptune based music, this one has a full-on soundtrack, filled with guitars and some electronic undertones mixing. It's done by the same musician who did the Nuclear Throne soundtrack, so if you liked his work on that, this soundtrack is even better (they don't sound the same though, not by a longshot, and that's a good thing).\n\nWhile I haven't even scratched the surface of Bleed 2, I just wanted to take a moment and say how great this game is thus far. If you want an indie game that's ACTUALLY a game, one that clearly is about having fun over trying to give you a life lesson or being some crummy Kickstarter scam, Bleed 2 is the place to b(l)e(ed).", "timestamp_created": 1486584803, "timestamp_updated": 1486584847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29788600": {"recommendationid": "29788600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018773479", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488326463}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0411\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0442-\u0445\u0435\u043b\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u0442\u0432\u0438\u043d-\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430.\n\u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043a \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u044b\u043a\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c.\n\u0423\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0442\u044f\u0436\u0451\u043b\u0430\u044f, \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 ~\u0447\u0430\u0441.\n\u0421\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f.\n\n\u0412\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432: \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0438\u043f\u044b \u0438\u0445 \u0430\u0442\u0430\u043a, \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0443\u044e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0438\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1486584725, "timestamp_updated": 1486584819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560753", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29788524": {"recommendationid": "29788524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070406437", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506798483}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a great sequel to a great game :D\n\nOmg i just noticed i got the game before it was on sale XD idk how that happened", "timestamp_created": 1486584475, "timestamp_updated": 1486584514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29788508": {"recommendationid": "29788508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024478548", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486584352}, "language": "english", "review": "Outstanding sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1486584427, "timestamp_updated": 1486584427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479005", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29788315": {"recommendationid": "29788315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001507954", "num_games_owned": 1976, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 1519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486577329}, "language": "english", "review": "The pink-haired hero is back, the world renown bad-ass and beloved hero now going for a promotion to Greatest Hero of the World. Wryn returns with her slick, stylish acrobatics and her rapidfire dispensers of justice, and brings some flashy new reflecting mechanics to the table in the sequel to Bleed. The surprise sleeper-hit Xbox indie title has come a seriously long way since its debut five years ago with even tighter and more refined dash controls, a way sharper visual style with much more fluid animations but the same great retro feel, and an even wilder journey into the very cosmos itself.\n\nWhat was once energetic and fast-paced gameplay is now full-on hyperactive chaos due to the addition of the color oriented bullet-reflecting mechanic. The same satisfying three-stage air dodging is here but the addition of a quick-slicing sword that attacks at the quick tap of an attack adds an entirely new layer of depth to the already face-melting combat of Bleed. The adorably and diabolically designed enemies populate your screen with each transition and unleash a hail of bullet-hell patterns\n\nThe bosses are what really seal the deal in Bleed 2. Like some kind of Treasure inspired Alien Soldier boss battle onslaught they seem to come endlessly between frenetic sections of platforming that whip by you in a flash. Each ridiculously imaginative boss and their intuitive attack pattern tops the last in terms of sheer genius. Intense chases on the tops of missile-launching trucks, careful parkour through the skies across streaming rockets, and careening mechs that are gargantuan in size and chase you through crumbling city streets are only some of the backdrops for these incredible showdowns.\n\nBeautiful bright and poppy compositions from the fantastic and legendary Jukio Kallio grace each stage, with a bit of seriously ferocious energy when needed. Some serious guitar riffage for the hectic chases through city scenes and some serenely kosmiche synth sounds for the more introspective ventures into otherworldly scenery. Songs that sound like they'd be fitting in some kind of a bad-ass 90's anime epic, there couldn't be a more fitting soundtrack for the cartoonish yet tough and stylish world of Bleed 2.\n\nI'm blown away by what has been accomplished with Bleed 2 since its predecessor. My expectations have been more than surpassed, I've already spent a good 10hrs replaying the different modes and I'm still not totally confident with my parrying and dodging skills. It's also incredible what a world of difference Jukio Kallio's soundtrack makes, I'm completely infatuated with it as I have been with his past soundtracks (particularly with doseone for Gun Godz). Bleed 2 easily ranks in my top sidescrolling action games of all time, holding a spot right between various Treasure classics. (I definitely get a Dynamite Headdy vibe from some of the almost theatrical set-ups for boss fights)\n\nBleed 2 comes packed with some great extras and unlockables. There's multiple extra modes to tackle before or after the story, including an Arcade mode with multiple playtstyles to chase you score through the whole campaign in one go and an insane Challenge mode that pits you against multiple bosses at a time. With a whole arsenal of new and unique weapons to tear through stages with and some familiar faces that appear as playable characters to unlock and even bring with you into some co-ordinated co-op.\n\nWith so many new ways to play, such a fresh and sharp new look, and an incredible soundtrack that brings the series even more to life than ever before Bleed 2 beats out its already legendary-status predecessor ten-fold.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=859812651", "timestamp_created": 1486583717, "timestamp_updated": 1486585895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766311", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29787586": {"recommendationid": "29787586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060772977", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488159426}, "language": "english", "review": "Ian, you really did well.\n\nI just finished the storymode and I absolutely loved every second of it.\n\nCan't wait to spend the next month playing it non-stop!", "timestamp_created": 1486581122, "timestamp_updated": 1486581122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29787513": {"recommendationid": "29787513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006575550", "num_games_owned": 669, "num_reviews": 190, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486563966}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so much fun, the mechanics are great!

If you're a fan of old Treasure games such as Gunstar Heroes and Alien Soldier, don't sleep on this. \n\nWhile playing the original Bleed is recommended, it is not required.\n\nFans of the original Bleed will be happy to know that its successor is improved in nearly every way. There's a lot more attention to detail, visuals and audio have improved considerably, the new color-coded parry mechanic adds another layer of strategy and the difficulty settings, particularly Very Hard, feel much better.\n\nThe game is not without its shortcomings, though. The weapon variety in Bleed 2 feels smaller and less relevant than it did in Bleed, due in part to the necessity of keeping your katana close at hand at all times. The variety also doesn't quite feel as fun as it did in Bleed; unlockable weapons largely just feel like visual twists on the existing \"projectile\" and \"melee\" weapons. Apart from the default weapon (combo), the only weapon I really used beyond experimentation was White. Granted, the default weapon combo of Katana/Pistols felt so good that everything else felt more like a gimmick.\n\nThe story, while cute in its own right, didn't have the memorable twist of the first, either. It's told in a much more engaging way, but the story itself is more straightforward with fewer surprises.\n\nThere's also no \"shop\" in Bleed 2 for better or for worse; you unlock characters, weapons and abilities by fulfilling objectives (eg beating the game on such-and-such difficulty) so those who enjoyed replaying levels for currency to upgrade Health/Energy no longer have that option.\n\nIn terms of length, Bleed 2 feels more or less the same length as Bleed, but each second of gameplay is far more action-packed than its predecessor, and has more than double the number of bosses. Triple? I don't know. There's a lot more bosses.\n\nIn terms of polish - while Bleed was an excellent game, Bleed 2 is a much more polished, and much higher quality experience.\n\nIt's a tight, action-packed experience that I wholeheartedly recommend.

(Counter argument: there are different difficulty levels which make the game more challenging, but respawning still remains the same)\n\u2022\tOne playthrough is extremely short (might be an advantage for some)\n\u2022\tIf Joystick is connected, it will be shaking (even if you are playing from keyboard)\n\nI personally suggest playing the game with mouse + keyboard, but apart from the gamepad controls and dying, there\u2019s not much else. Other than that \u2013 the game is awesome. I absolutely love the game and really recommend grabbing it right away. I\u2019m serious. Never have I been as positive about suggesting a game as this time. Hell, my girlfriend liked the game and she normally avoids arcades with lots of shooting like plague. \n", "timestamp_created": 1486578121, "timestamp_updated": 1486578121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542144", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29786736": {"recommendationid": "29786736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020399744", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484554848}, "language": "english", "review": "GREAT game.

Not only did this game surpass it's predecessor, but it's much faster paced, and polishes it's prior game's mechanics to a shine. (Well done, developer!)\n\nSo what is \"Bleed\"? Bleed is, what I would call, a twin stick shooter on a platformer plane (A run-and-gun, kind of boss-rushy game). The game stars a girl named Wryn, of whom has the ability to not only slow down time, but reflect appropriately colored projectiles back at her enemies. She boasts dual wielding pistols with seemingly unlimited ammunition, and a sword. (With more weapons as unlockables, in addition to more playable characters.) Both this game, and the original game, start with fairly short run and gun style stages before running you up against various boss fights, sometimes (almost always) multiple boss fights in a single stage.\n\nThe main draw for me, as a player, is just all the little moments of \"WHOA, I FEEL LIKE A BADASS\", or \"I JUST DID SOMETHING COOL\". To get that feeling from just playing the game is not something easily replicated by games in general. Most titles nowadays will try to wow you with flashy cinematics or cutscenes and make you think the character's awesome, when in this one, all you have to do is really just learn how the game works, get a feel for it, and you'll get that little burst of \"Whoa! I just did that!\" pretty frequently.\n\nMy only complaint with the game is that it is too short, at least on the easier difficulties. (Though I believe the price point is fair [only $10!] for the shortness). I kind of understand due to the fact that the harder difficulties significantly increase your play time by at least triple, and that beating the game itself on certain difficulties is how you unlock more characters, but I just kept wanting more. There is definitely a feel-good emotion associated with playing this game, and that feeling does make you want more.\n\nBecause the mechanics of the game are so incredibly tight and extremely solid (Again, WELL DONE developer!) , it's absolutely no surprise that the difficulty settings really are tailored to the fairly high skill ceiling of the game. The game on the easier difficulties is not difficult at all, and does fairly space things out for you, whereas the harder difficulties will test your skill to the limit and really test how well of a grasp you have on how the mechanics of the game work.\n\nIf you're looking for an adrenaline pumping, run'n gun, boss-rushy game, I cannot recommend \"Bleed 2\" enough. It's only $10, it's a great game, and in an oversaturated indie market, I really think it deserves higher praise.\n\nI strongly hope the developer has more of the \"Bleed\" series in store for us, especially after introducing some new bosses/characters to the series.", "timestamp_created": 1516328269, "timestamp_updated": 1516328324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

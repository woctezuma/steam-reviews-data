It is really cool. Its not like a flash game, it actually is in HD and has an amazing concept. This game is awesome, and supports different platforming styles, you can use your keyboard or use your xBox controller! It is definitally worth the 99 cents, because its definitally NOT a flash game!\n\n\n[h1] Edit [/h1]\n\nFixed where I said the part about it being 2 dollars (It was another game) and replaced with my achievement thing. Which is good because its challenging.\n\n\n[h1] Final Review [/h1]\n\nWhen I made this review I hadn't finished the game. The ending is very heartwarming and explains unfolds a lot about the story. [b] Spoiler Alert! [/b] [spoiler] I love how it unfolds, that she basically had amnesia and she didn't want to leave because she didn't like her owner. [/spoiler]\nI also like how they didn't remove the spam water to go down fast, but fixing bugs with it. This makes it easier to speedrun the game which I will do soon, bascially what im trying to say is they make it fun for everyone and not removing player-found tricks. My final grade/impression on this game is 11/10. You guys really did a great job making the game itself, and the storyline, the only thing (that doesn't change anything) is that there is 1 or 2 soundtracks per world, a suggestion would be to add music fitting to the world and the situation (Using trigger events and the part of the level your at), but making the music transition smoothly as well, which could be hard to do. Again, thanks for making this game I loved it!\n\n\n[h1] Final Ranking [/h1]\n\n[b] 11/10!

So of course, he was way ahead of me so, his videos would come out like 2 worlds ahead of me. Then, his final episode. The End. *SPOILER HERE!!!* I found that the cat locked herself in the world, and couldn't escape no matter how much she wanted. She wanted to get away from life, but she wanted to get out of the world she enveloped herself in. Her face disappears, and it starts to get weird. At the very end, she explains why she is there, she knocks the exit door off of a cliff and just before you see the spikes crush her, the screen goes black and the credits play. It made me sob and weep for half an hour, and I wanted to stop. I wanted to keep the memory away. Of course, I watched the scene again, just to see if I would cry like I did before, but I didn't, but it was still sad.

Everything about it I love so much; the simple gameplay, the atmospheric music, and the simple, yet heart-crushing story that leaves so many questions. But that's not a bad thing: the game leaves a good chunk of what's happening up to the player's interpretation and because of that, you begin to think and theorize about what's exactly happening in this world that the game presented to you because it doesn't spoon-feed you the answers that you want - you have to think. \n\nGameplay is by far the simplest part of this game: 2D platforming, but with a few unique twists to the generic formula. Sure, the game's primary method of transportation is jumping, but you also have the ability to turn into a liquid (Hence the name of the game) to squeeze through small passages in the walls, turn into a gas (Pretty clever in my opinion) to float around levels, use bombs to blow up special walls, and funnily, the most significant ability, utilize a gray square to press buttons in places you can't reach normally. The game builds significance around these abilities and gives care in making sure that these abilities aren't one-off and used once then forgotten. (The game makes you FEEL the importance of the abilities later in the game.)\n\nThe game's music is truly something to behold. The simple, escalating tunes that play as you go level to level help build the world and it's atmosphere, setting the mood for what's to come. I would totally buy an OST of this game if it were available. From the gentle, curious tones of the first few levels to the heavy, depressed theme of the Reset levels, the music is perfect.\n\nI could keep going, but I already have an essay, so in conclusion, Cats are Liquid is a wonderful experience, and absolutely worth the 99 cents. (Even though I personally think the game is worth more) Thank you, Half Quarter Studios, for this wonderful game. Can't wait to play it again and cry, smile and ponder.

Communism , Here is the life of Mao Zedong\n\n\n\nMao Zedong or Mao Tse-tung  December 26, 1893 \u2013 September 9, 1976 also known as Chairman Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary and founding father of the People's Republic of China, which he ruled as an autocrat styled the Chairman of the Communist Party of China from its establishment in 1949, until his death in 1976. His Marxist\u2013Leninist theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism or Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.\n\nBorn the son of a wealthy farmer in Shaoshan, Hunan, Mao adopted a Chinese nationalist and anti-imperialist outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. Mao adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism while working at Peking University and became a founding member of the Communist Party of China (CPC), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Guomindang (GMD) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land policies and ultimately became head of the CPC during the Long March. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the GMD under the United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u201345), after Japan's defeat China's civil war resumed and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the Nationalists who withdrew to Taiwan.\n\nOn October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a one-party state controlled by the CPC. In the following years Mao solidified his control through land reform campaigns against landlords, and perceived enemies of the state he termed as \"counter-revolutionaries\". In 1957, he launched the Great Leap Forward campaign that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from an agrarian economy to an industrial one. The campaign contributed to a widespread famine, whose death toll is estimated at between 15 and 45 million. In 1966, he initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements of Chinese society that lasted 10 years and which was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts and unprecedented elevation of Mao's personality cult. In 1972, Mao welcomed American President Richard Nixon in Beijing, signalling a policy of opening China, which was furthered under the rule of Deng Xiaoping (1978\u20131992). Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976, dying in that September, aged 82. He was succeeded as Paramount leader by Hua Guofeng (1976\u20131978), who was quickly sidelined and replaced by Deng.\n\nA controversial figure, Mao is regarded as one of the most important individuals in modern world history, and is also known as a theorist, military strategist, poet and visionary. Supporters credit him with driving imperialism out of China,modernising China and building it into a world power, promoting the status of women, improving education and health care, and increasing life expectancy as China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million during the period of his leadership.In contrast, critics consider him a dictator comparable to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin who severely damaged traditional Chinese culture, as well as a perpetrator of systematic human rights abuses who was responsible for an estimated 40 to 70 million deaths through starvation, forced labour and executions, ranking his tenure as the top incidence of democide in human history.", "timestamp_created": 1472513644, "timestamp_updated": 1472513644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25238575": {"recommendationid": "25238575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153493964", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510885933}, "language": "english", "review": "5 stars.", "timestamp_created": 1472512040, "timestamp_updated": 1472512040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25232009": {"recommendationid": "25232009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112669681", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 186, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472489542}, "language": "english", "review": "topkek", "timestamp_created": 1472489567, "timestamp_updated": 1472489567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436919", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25230696": {"recommendationid": "25230696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031214470", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469653149}, "language": "english", "review": "GOTY", "timestamp_created": 1472485258, "timestamp_updated": 1472485258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25224258": {"recommendationid": "25224258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016966432", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469492068}, "language": "english", "review": "Really cute little game, i've played more of it then i've played games i've paid 30 bucks for.

Unfortunately, it's bogged down by more gimmicks than your standard indie platformer, most of which are useless outside of when you specifically and clearly need it to proceed, and one of which breaks the game wide open for as long as you have it, as well as hilariously janky physics.\n\nFor basic controls, your blobcat can jump by pressing up, or turn into a liquid by holding down, in addition to moving left and right. Turning into liquid allows it to move through narrow spaces, but it also gives a speed boost, which can be used to reach incredible speeds for long-distance jumps. Oddly enough, jumping - the staple of almost every platformer - is the messed-up core mechanic here, since you can jump any time you are in contact with a surface, or sometimes just in midair for no clear reason. Jumping increases your upward speed, even if you are already moving upward at the maximum speed from a previous jump, allowing you to scale walls incredibly rapidly, or fly through the air by jumping from under a physics object, pushing it up with you and guaranteeing you have something to continue jumping against.\n\nLater on in the course of the 90 levels of the main game, you get the ability to turn into steam, which makes you move much slower but you slowly float upward instead of falling downward, summon a weighted companion square which can't do anything but move left and right, but which can't be harmed by a lot of hazards and can press switches only designed for it, and drop bombs that destroy small diamond-shaped walls. On top of the liquid form, this is a relatively large amount of gimmicks for an indie platformer, most of which only have one major player gimmick. While that's not bad by itself, the weighted companion cube and bombs are never useful except in the situations where they're specifically called for (walls of fire you can't walk through with switches on the other end, and small diamond-shaped walls, respectively) and the bombs are basically never used in any interesting fashion. Flying with steam, meanwhile, lets you ignore basically every hazard or difficulty for the entire time you have that power, making it far too useful. The only reason I didn't use it more is that it's fairly slow, and I wanted to be done with the game faster even if it meant running my cat into hazards a few times.\n\nThe collision detection is also pretty bad - as I mentioned, there were a few times where it seemed like I could jump despite not touching anything. This also unfortunately applies to hit detection sometimes, and while you have to take three hits from most things in order for your cat to respawn at the start of level or a checkpoint, some hazards will send you back to the start instantly. It wasn't all that frustrating, especially due to how quickly most levels could be solved if you knew where the hazards were ahead of time, but it still didn't leave me with a positive impression of the coding.\n\nThe 30-level Companion Square campaign, on the other hand, was more typical of indie platformers, given that in each 10-level section, your companion square has one special ability: boosting its speed in the first ten, jumping vertically in the second ten, and stopping in place and becoming unaffected by physics and objects for as long as you want in the final ten. The companion square's indestructibility in the core game carries over, so instead these levels are timed, with new purple hazards either draining your time or sending you back to a checkpoint or the start. While these levels were refreshingly different, I found the first twenty kind of limited in what they offered, and only the last set were interesting. Also, the time limits were not well-implemented - your time continued ticking down if you were sent back to the start, until you ran out of time (which also sent you back to the start, even if you'd hit a checkpoint) or manually restarted the level. This meant that I had to manually restart Companion Square levels fairly frequently, because being sent back to the start with only half of the time remaining was pointless.\n\nFinally, while it's not a major part of the game, I was a bit bothered by the story in Cats are Liquid. It starts off cute, but ends on a note somewhere between depressing and horror, which wasn't exactly what I expected going into this. It didn't really make coherent enough sense to me to register as anything other than a sad creepypasta or something, but... eh!\n\nIn the end, I went into this expecting a silly $1 cat game.

I presently need time to clear my head so I can give this gem a proper- or, half-decent, at any rate- critique. Until such time, I want it recorded as having my up-vote, and I will simply say here a sort of abridged review, from what little I can gather from my preoccupied and scattered thoughts; I shall return to expand on it later. Please note that this has slight spoilers, as well, and I would advise caution if you'd prefer the story to be with as little pre-set expectation as possible.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a very engaging game. The story is mysterious, very creatively told via lines of text set in the environment[spoiler], and, while bearing much levity in terms of choice of wording, ultimately powerful- if you moused over the above-warned line, you can probably tell that I, for one, have been strongly affected by it[/spoiler].\n\nThe gameplay, in my opinion, is amazingly fun. The protagonist herself is comprised of a collection of malleable orbs which stick together in a sort of cloud; movement consists of an assortment of different methods, including rolling, sliding, wall-jumping, and another ability that you can discover early on. On that note, there are some abilities you can discover which add welcome elements of variety to the gameplay. The character moves fluidly, her locomotion and transitioning between different states to be flawless.\n\nI find it rather difficult to describe, but the gameplay involves a great deal of potential skill ceiling, and in my opinion would lend itself very well to speed-running- so much so, that I am surprised, and I must confess slightly disappointed, that there is not an option for an in-game Timer. I hope I might be able to afford explanation to this point regarding speed-running at some point in the future, if/when I am able to return to this. \n\nThe soundtrack... ties in with the happenings of the story, such that I fear to comment on it would spoil more than I alrady have. However, I can say that it is very surreal, and oddly pleasant, although very eerie, to listen to. I've much the same to say regarding the graphics, if one replaces \"listen to\" with \"look at\".\n\nI, for one, heartily recommend this game, if you are fond of physics-based platformers.\n\nMind you, I have only played through the game once, and, again, have written this with a clouded mind.

Music is calming, some level designs are unique and creative and the artstyle is nice for the eye.\n\nPros:\n-Artstyle, simple, yet charming music.\n-Simplistic gameplay.\n-Long game with cheap price.\n\nCons:\n-The biggest problem of this game was the steam powerup that could let player pass the 70% of the levels, making it less challengeling and boring. Making this power depletable and rechargable at specific points/checkpoints might balance it out.\n-The story had no actual base, no clue what it was supposed to be, wasn't sure if \"she\" was reffering to the cat or the owner anymore. Repetive, obvious, pointless sentences. Would be glad if it was written from the scratch.\n-The balance between checkpoint placement and the instant kill objects, have to pass the long, boring and easy part just to get killed instantly and do this part again.\n-The bug where you get under a specific object and holding jump button makes player and the object fly upwards.\n\nHate to give this game such a negative review, considering it has a lot of potential, but it definitelly needs patches that would make the gameplay enjoyable.\n\nAlso the God Mode achievement is just impossible to do, considering you have to beat 90 levels without a single damage where some obstacles are impossible to dodge, if there was an option to play God Mode difficulity, it would be more like playing with only 1 health point, not only 1 try and play the game from the start again, but some obstacles definitelly need some tweaking.", "timestamp_created": 1470073537, "timestamp_updated": 1470075093, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503611", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24654645": {"recommendationid": "24654645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112407689", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 7287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497653431}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good and cute game.

I hope more level packs will be added to the game. 5/6", "timestamp_created": 1470051592, "timestamp_updated": 1470051592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24650655": {"recommendationid": "24650655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141276637", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470049358}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6709\u60c5\u6000\u3002\u4ece\u5173\u5361\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u65c1\u767d\u91cc\uff0c\u80fd\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u4e00\u9897\u60f3\u8bb2\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u60f3\u4f20\u8fbe\u611f\u60c5\u7684\u5fc3\u3002\n\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u8c10\u3002\u5e73\u9759\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u53ef\u7231\u7684\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u7b80\u6d01\u800c\u5bcc\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684\u753b\u98ce\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u5c0f\u6e05\u65b0\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002\n\u8fd9\u7b97\u662f\u503c\u56de\u7968\u4ef7\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u666e\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u4e0d\u591f\u3002Standard\u73a9\u5230\u7b2c\u4e94\u5173\u6211\u73a9\u4e0d\u4e0b\u53bb\u4e86\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6211\u4e0d\u662f\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u53d7\u4f17\u5427\u3002\u6bcf\u5173\u6709\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u5230\u540e\u671f\u4e5f\u9010\u6e10\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u7f3a\u5c11\u53d9\u4e8b\u611f\u3002Cat\u60f3\u8981\u9003\u8d70\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5462\uff1f\u6211\u4e0d\u660e\u767d\uff0c\u6211\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u5173\u53c8\u4e00\u5173\u5730\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u770b\u4e00\u4e9b\u6211\u4e0d\u592a\u770b\u5f97\u61c2\u7684\u6587\u5b57\uff08\u4e0d\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u82f1\u8bed\u4e0d\u597d\uff09\u3002\u5176\u5b9e\u80cc\u666f\u6666\u6da9\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\uff0c\u53ea\u8a00\u7247\u8bed\u4e32\u8d77\u6574\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5927\u4f5c\u6709\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u64cd\u4f5c\u8981\u6709\u5feb\u611f\u554a\uff01\u64cd\u4f5c\u65e0\u804a\uff0c\u5173\u5361\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u89c4\u4e2d\u77e9\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u6210\u957f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u771f\u73a9\u4e0d\u4e0b\u53bb...\n\n\u91cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5f88\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6b7b\u4e86\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u65f6\uff1f\u6216\u8bb8\u662f\u6545\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u538b\u8feb\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u611f\u89c9\u8d1f\u9762\u6253\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u5927\u4e8e\u6b63\u9762\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u662f\u4e2a\u4e0d\u592a\u597d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1470050867, "timestamp_updated": 1470050867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556509", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24649211": {"recommendationid": "24649211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215280451", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471066368}, "language": "english", "review": "When I opened the game, I was instantly underwhelmed by the simplistic design.\nSome games can do very well with no details, but this game just didn't.\nSo, I think I'll give it a chance. \nThe gameplay is slow paced and boring.\nSometimes it feels like the creator of the game forgot about the abilities in the game, and made obstacles without taking them into consideration.\nAll in all, it is a poorly designed, ugly boring game. 2/10", "timestamp_created": 1470044005, "timestamp_updated": 1470044005, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494837", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24645321": {"recommendationid": "24645321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042471236", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470019260}, "language": "english", "review": "Well i gotta say, for a $1 game, this is pretty fun.

I know that no matter how much fencing I put up, or how careful I think I am when I open the door, sooner or later I will find my cat in the neighbors yard.  The fact that cats are liquid is really the only rational explanation for this.\n\n Here though, we finally have proof that this is true.  As you guide your cat through the levels of the game, you can clearly see the ability to become liquid, or even gaseous, is the primary way cats navigate through narrow areas or over wide gulfs.  This educational documentary presents these facts in an entertaining format that is simple enough for children to understand, yet amusing enough for adults.\n\nThe idea is made very plain.  Navigate your cat to the exit of the level, while not touching anything orange.  Wise use of the ability to transform into different states of matter allows travel in any direction, and skillful play is rewarded with, well, a cat that is still alive.  That should be enough though, since we must watch over our cats, and not let them perish in a pit of lava.  That's what we call bad cat parenting.\n\nAt least it isn't terribly difficult to keep this cat safe.  While the simple geometric graphics may remind you of some of the more brutal platformers out there, Cats are Liquid, at least as far as I've played, is a much calmer experience than games like LOVE, or VVVVVV.  Think Thomas Was Alone, but with a cat, who really is alone.  I mean, Thomas wasn't really alone all that long was he?\n\nAnyway, I find Cats are Liquid a casual platformer, something that you could easily play with your kids.

The thing that became a continuous bother to me was that the game didnt get harder as it went on, it was just a spew of inconsistant difficulties that made progressing in the game annoying and making it feel more like a chore. Along the way you get 3 super cool powers that are awesome at adding new mechanics, but the game goes ahead and takes the major one away from you later in the worlds.

Everything, it seems, is all one or two colors. Pretty early on, a third color is introduced, orange, which hurts you. It's pretty simple. Boringly simple.\n\nIt's insane the amount of speed you can get in this game. Holding down turns the cat blue into some sort of extra watery form and you can speed by horizontal sections simply by hugging the ground with your watery cat body, and you can fall quickly by repeatedly tapping it. The cat can also slowly climb up verticle surfaces, but I discovered pretty early that you can exponetially speed this up by tapping jump.\n\nThis led to me speeding through the boring levels as fast as I could avoiding anything orange, which amused me for some time, but eventually wore down into monotony. After about a dozen levels, the cat gets a new power up which allows it to sloooowly float upwards as a gas cloud. Also boring when hopping up walls is three times as fast.\n\nIt doesn't help that this game's idea of ramping up difficulty seems to be adding things that just kill you in one hit. When the game introduced lava, it made sense, but later on you get jumping blocks that kill you at a touch, even if it hasn't crushed you.  Around the same time as that, it also added springy blocks that often push you into orange objects or the one hit kill hazards. A proper platformer would likely have them as trampolines but with such a boringly versatile moveset that the liquid cat has, the only thing the bouncy blocks can be is annoying. It was around there that I just said 'fuck it' and left the game.\n\nMost levels also have a copius amount of writing on the walls, most of which is uninteresting or stating the blatantly obvious. I sped by two or three blocks of text in my efforts to get through the game as quickly as possible and I doubt I missed much. At one point, the text states the cat is getting tired of going through the mazes, a sentiment I wholeheartedly agreed with. At another point, it said 0/10 would not recommend. I had to wonder if it was self aware or if the text actually thought it was being charming.\n\nUltimately, Cats are Liquid feels like a first game project. It's something somebody made in a month or two after learning Unity. It's fine. Nobody's good at making games when they first start.

Most platformers I play have their individual quirks that you have to get used to at the start of the game such as a slightly delayed jump or unusual movements. As soon as I climbed up a wall (with controller) it just felt right and natural, the jumping and floating had exactly the right amount of speed and responsiveness, it was a joy to play in that respect.\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\n\nYou are a 'cat' navigating a maze of physics obstacles. Your movement is like that of a water-filled balloon, hence the 'liquid' in the title. You can ooze through tiny gaps, hop up high vertical walls and float up/along as a gas cloud. Later in the game you can use bombs to break walls or release and control a square on a time limit to move ahead and unlock a passage for the cat. You play as only the square in the Companion levels, under time constraints.\n\nA couple of hours after playing it I can't even remember what the background music was like, it was so unobtrusive, which is a good thing. Likewise the graphics are minimalistic and functional, nothing wrong with that. There's a loose story written in the background based on the cat being trapped and complaining about the prolonged journey (she has a point!)\n\nThe \"90+30 levels\" claim is a bit cheeky, it's actually 9+3 levels each with 9 waypoints where your 3 lives are topped up (or time reset).\n\n[h1]Glitches[/h1]\n\nFrom the levels menu the escape key doesn't work so you have to start a level and exit from there in order to close the game. Took a while to work that one out.\n\nOn completion of both Standard and Companion the screen fades to black and everything becomes unresponsive so the only way you can get out is by forcefully crashing the game. Perhaps this is intentionally consistent with the storyline, who knows!\n\nI've definitely completed Companion because I reached the end credits but 22/30 of the levels remain locked. I've repeated many levels (by starting at the last unlocked level) to double-check but no, still locked.\n\nI'm on Linux if that makes a difference. Maybe if the developer reads this review the bugs will be fixed by the time you read it. None of it affects the actual gameplay anyway.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Opinion[/h1]\n\nExperienced platform players should be able to complete the game in their sleep with very few retries - for much of Standard you can effortlessly float past most obstacles. The Companion levels have time constraints but are also easy.\n\nThe consistency of the game mechanics unfortunately extends to the predictable, monotonous gameplay and many of the levels are identical but played with different abilities. There is no innovation here, just the usual elements you've seen in countless other platformers.\n\nI completed Standard in 4 hours and Companion in 1 at medium pace. I may attempt the 2 clean-run achievements later to 100% it but probably not. I'd say the quantity of gameplay is very good value for the price.\n\n[h1]Achievements[/h1]\n\nThese entail completing each level and then playing the whole thing again in a perfect uninterrupted run. Pretty unimaginative, but then again there are no remarkable gameplay features to warrant an interesting achievement. I still don't have the 'Always There' achievement so I don't know what it is. I'm happy it has achievements at all anyway, and the developer has just said he's considering trading cards in future.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nMost of this review may seem negative but that's not the case at all. I did enjoy this, it's just that lately I've been playing very challenging and unique physics games like Portal, Nihilumbra and Metamorphic, so this seemed pedestrian by comparison. If it's a casual experience you're after then I highly recommend this, especially at the rock-bottom price.

It has a surprising amount of content for such a small pricetag, and is definitely worth the purchase. Looking for something to spend the evening on? Just want a cute little platformer to play? This is your game.\n\nThere are of course a few downsides, which, while annoying, don't seriously detract from the game. I'm cherrypicking here really, this game is pretty darn good.\n\n1. Keybinding. There isn't any way to rebind your keys, and when the controls are wasd with q and e being very frequently used, it makes using the q based power somewhat awkward and causes strain on your left hand over time.\n2. The levels are pretty long. This is great for padding out game time, but it feels just a little too drawn out sometimes as you're waiting for the next new mechanic to pop in. This of course isn't too big an issue, it won't kill your play, but it is noticeable in places. \n3. Hazards. The hazards in this game come in two major types: ones that hurt you and ones that instantly send you back to the start. The problem with this is that whenever you encounter a new hazard you can't tell which kind it is. Should I run through this or be super careful? You can't tell until you test the new hazard. \n\nOverall I would definitely reccomend this game.

I like the concept at its most basic level: a platformer with wierd physics and a protagonist with the ability to transition between the three major forms of matter. That's pretty neat. The game also reminds me quite a bit of Thomas was Alone, right down to the title. However, where Thomas had a charming character-driven narrative and lovely music, Cats doesn't really have anything and the self-depracating nature of its narration tended to wear on me quickly. \n\nWhat this game feels like is a personal project, something that was made for the developer's sake, so they could practice at making an actual game. I feel like the developer was fully aware throughout development of their lack of experience and I can appreciate the selfawareness on display here. However, since I am required to say whether or not I'd recommend the game, I have to take a que from Cats' own narration: \"Not fun. Would not recommend.\"\n\nUpdate: The game's only positive feature previously was that it hadn't given me any reason to hate it. Things have changed since then.

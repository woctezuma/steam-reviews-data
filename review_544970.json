Her determination is put to test when she receives an unexpected visit from above and embarks on a journey that will confront her with the cruelty of others and the emptiness of her own personal past.\n\n[h1]General Impressions[/h1]\nWoven in rimes and delightfully pixelated graphics, [i]Milkmaid of The Milky Way[/i] reads and plays like a cup of hot chocolate on a chilly night. Although the story can sometimes be more akin of the uncomfortable cold of not wearing enough jackets outside, the writing, the characters and the final questioning note of story surely feel like arriving back home and wrapping yourself up in your favorite blanky. If you fully embark in [i]Milkmaid[/i], it unsettles you enough to take you out of your comfort zone, but doesn\u2019t leave you desolate and freezing outside when it\u2019s time to go home.\n\nIn essence, story-telling wise, [i]Milkmaid[/i] doesn\u2019t disappoint; even tough it stumbles here and there when it comes to mechanics and puzzles, it doesn\u2019t let that overshadow its deceivably simple plot.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[i]Milkmaid of The Milky Way[/i] is a game I recommend to anyone seeking high quality point-n-click adventures devoid of that \u2013 oftentimes despised \u2013 \u201cold school\u201d clunky feel. It\u2019s a refreshing and modest take on an old genre, and is even more strongly recommended discounted at 20% or more, due to its brief playtime that I gather can be offensive to some.\n\nTo those with an already acquired palate for similar games, this one receives a strong recommendation, as [i]Milkmaid[/i] has mixed what it has learned from its predecessors with its own personal blend of the charming and the wistful.", "timestamp_created": 1513799131, "timestamp_updated": 1513799131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38395669": {"recommendationid": "38395669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176773722", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513332653}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u7d75\u3060\u304b\u3089\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u4fae\u3063\u3066\u306f\u3044\u3051\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\n\u3068\u3066\u3082\u8868\u60c5\u8c4a\u304b\u306a\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u3092\u6700\u5f8c\u306f\u53ef\u611b\u304f\u601d\u3048\u3066\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u60dc\u3057\u3080\u3089\u304f\u306f\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u77ed\u3044\u306e\u3068\u3001\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u7a81\u98db\u3059\u304e\u3066\u7f6e\u3044\u3066\u304b\u308c\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u306e\u3067\u3001\u611f\u60c5\u79fb\u5165\u3057\u306b\u304f\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3002\n\n\u8b0e\u89e3\u304d\u81ea\u4f53\u306f\u8272\u3005\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3059\u308c\u3070\u52dd\u624b\u306b\u89e3\u3051\u3066\u3044\u304f\u306e\u3067\u305d\u308c\u307b\u3069\u8a70\u307e\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u3001\u4f55\u6545\u305d\u308c\u304c\u6b63\u89e3\u306a\u306e\u304b\u5206\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u6240\u304c\u591a\u3005\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u7406\u4e0d\u5c3d\u3055\u3092\u611f\u3058\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u6700\u5f8c\u306f\u30cf\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u306a\u306e\u304b\u306a\uff1f\n\u3082\u3046\u5c11\u3057\u767b\u5834\u4eba\u7269\u50cf\u3084\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u5206\u304b\u308c\u3070\u697d\u3057\u3081\u305f\u306e\u306b\u306a\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u7279\u306b\u3001\u5973\u738b\u306f\u3042\u3093\u306a\u4e8b\u306b\u306a\u308b\u307b\u3069\u60aa\u4eba\u306a\u306e\uff1f\u3068\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u307b\u3069\u60c5\u5831\u304c\u5c11\u306a\u3059\u304e\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u78ba\u304b\u306b\u60aa\u3044\u4eba\u3060\u3051\u3069\u30a6\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u611f\u3058\u3067\u5c11\u3057\u6d88\u5316\u4e0d\u826f\u6c17\u5473\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\uff08\u5b9f\u306f\u30d0\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u306a\u306e\u3060\u308d\u3046\u304b\uff09\n\u82f1\u8a9e\u3092\u81ea\u5df1\u7ffb\u8a33\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u5358\u306b\u82f1\u8a9e\u529b\u306e\u554f\u984c\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\n\n\u5143\u3005\u9ad8\u984d\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3057\u3001\u30bb\u30fc\u30eb\u306a\u3089\u304b\u306a\u308a\u5b89\u304f\u306a\u308b\u306e\u3067\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17\u304c\u6c17\u306b\u5165\u3063\u305f\u3089\u662f\u975e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\n", "timestamp_created": 1513588607, "timestamp_updated": 1513588607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38374625": {"recommendationid": "38374625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042831386", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 478, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509526518}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Short version: 85%[/h1]\nStrictly speaking, this is just a simple two-hour pixel art adventure game written in rhyme, but the creator\u2019s enthusiasm and the surprisingly charming and calming storyline make it stand out of its peers.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nSometimes it takes effort to find something noteworthy in the current sea of retro pixel art games, but Milkmaid of the Milky Way is one such item.\nOf course, one can easy to skim past it, especially considering this is just a simple point \u2018n\u2019 click with a somewhat outlandish premise: a Norwegian milkmaid ends up on a spaceship of suspiciously human-like aliens and helps them to overthrow their despotic ruler.\n\nThe gameplay is also as simple as the art style.

From the beginning to the end I pronounced the rhymes aloud just to hear them and come more alive. This is the biggest pro the game has and what gives it it's true charasteristic over all other games.\n\nAlong with rhymes I loved the story. The beginning was truly wonderful doing everyday tasks and getting used to Ruth's life in past and in present. In the middle I was little confused but the story suck me in and I was totally in the story at the end. I have a habit of shedding a tear while watching touching animations or listening to music when things get emotional. But I have never shed a tear while playing a game - until Milkmaid. Seeing Ruth's apple of her eye ravaging and seeing the result I was blown away. If a game can awoke emotions like I felt there is something quite powerful in the story and it must have been well told.\n\nI loved the soundtrack. Sometimes I went in to a room just to hear a certain song :)\n\nThe puzzles in the game were straightforward enough to keep me interested in the story rather than get me frustrated. I enjoyd every minute of this game. I hear people usually telling that the game was too short. And I think that may be the case with Milkmaid as well.  I really can't understand this point of view. I believe that when the story is told it is time to end it - may it be novel, movie, song or a game.\n\nWhat can I say. This is one of the best games I have ever played. Maybe there is a little nostalgy involved because the graphics reminded me of the golden 80's but of course Milkmaid was retro not vintage.\n\nAnd one more thing: I liked the idea of Age machine and the mechanics of it.

It has charming retro pixelated graphics, an interesting story and some nice puzzles. Two things bothered me though. First of all the main menu lacks a quit/exit/stop option so I had to use ALT-F4 to exit the game. The other thing is more troubling and it's the rhyme. I bought the game because I liked the art I saw in the screenshots and I have a weakness for science fiction. And ever since I discovered the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, also for fjords. But I was wondering whether the rhyme would really add something to the game or if it would be nothing more than a cheap gimmick. Unfortunately it's the latter. \nIn my opinion the game would have been better if they hadn't tried to make every two sentences rhyme. While the sentences do in fact rhyme (most of the time at least, there is some weak and false rhyme here and there) there is no meter at all. Sentences that rhyme are of different length and have different rhythms. I'll use the rhyme visible in one of the screenshots as an example.\n\n\"The trail up here will someday be my death\", Erlend said, short of breath. \n\nI'll visualise my problems with this rhyme by using italic text to note unstressed syllables and bold text to note stressed syllables:\n\n\"[i]The[/i] [b]trail[/b] [i]up[/i] [b]here[/b] [i]will[/i] [b]some[/b][i]day[/i] [b]be[/b] [i]my[/i] [b]death[/b]\", \n\n[b]Er[/b][i]lend[/i] [b]said[/b], [b]short[/b] [i]of[/i] [b]breath[/b]. \n\nYou can see that the first part of the sentence contains 10 syllables and the second part only 6. Instead of having a steady rythm of stressed/unstressed or unstressed/stressed syllables, there is little to no rythm in the stressed and unstressed syllables especially in the second part of the sentence. If you would have to read all of the text in this game out loud, it would be almost impossible to make it sound natural.\n\nThis could have been fixed by slightly changing the text to something like:\n\n\"[i]The[/i] [b]trail[/b] [i]up[/i] [b]here[/b] [i]will[/i] [b]be[/b] [i]my[/i] [b]death[/b]\",\n\n[i]said[/i] [b]Er[/b][i]lend[/i], [b]be[/b][i]ing[/i] [b]short[/b] [i]of[/i] [b]breath[/b].\n\nIt's still no prose, but now both parts of the sentence have 8 syllables and there is a more natural sounding rhythm of unstressed and stressed syllables. If the entire game would have used proper meter like this, the sentences would have flowed better and the rhyme would have added something to the game.\nUnfortunately this isn't the case and almost all rhyming sentences exhibit the same problem throughout the game. It makes the text hard to read and often it's clear that words were chosen not because they made sense but merely because they happened to rhyme. \nIt's not bad enough to give this game a thumbs down, because I did like it overall.

One of the game's special features, is the rhyming in every sentence. In the beginning, it can be funny or a bit annoying, but one gets used to it after a while.\n\nThe game itself isn't too hard, yet not too easy. It's just perfect, making you scratch your head at times, and have an \"Eureka!\" moment once you solve the puzzles.\n\nThe game's price isn't too high, but it could yet be a little bit lower, in my opinion.\nAll the achievements can be reached in a single play-through.\n\nI even met the developer, Mattis Folkestad, at EGX Rezzed in London on Saturday 1th of April.

You hear strange noises and find things go missing. This is always helpful in adventure games as it provides instant puzzles! Find your items, take care of your herd and make the dairy products necessary to sell in town. Well, sort of. It appears that sales aren't all they used to be. Still, another day but now your herd is gone. Kidnapped by aliens. The only thing to do is hop on board and figure out what is going on.\n\nThe game does all the dialogue in rhyme (I'm not clever enough to do the review that way, for I'd soon run out of things to say). The interface is easy and the goals of the puzzles are pretty straight forward. The game is not totally linear in that you can explore as you want and pick up objects as you find them, not in some particular order. The story is a classic good vs. evil presented in a straight forward but not frightening or dystopia like mannner.\n\nThe colors are bright, the artwork is simple and lively and care went into creating characters with personality.

The immeasurable success of Milkmaid of the Milkyway, therefore, lies in the pure orchestration of each of its elements composing a singular, beautiful whole which draws you in from the moment you begin your journey unto its wonderful, emotional conclusion. From the moment I started playing this game until its finish, never once was I not entranced by the sheer beauty of its small, yet beautifully crafted world, or the light, soothing symphonies of its background tracks. \n\n  Everything out of MotM oozes a charm and an aura of peace. Even playing it fullscreen, the simple style of its pixellated form does nothing to draw you out from the realism of the world; instead, you become engrossed by the soft fluidity of its motions, and the surprising depth it affords its small, yet dynamic cast of characters. \n\n  The dialogue in the game is no different, and it is clear from every minor interaction, every misstep and recourse inherent in point-and-click adventures you make, that a lot of thought and care went into designing each and every element and interaction in this game. Having not known upon entering it that the entire script was written in rhyme, I found it a hearty surprise, and could not stop smiling to myself at what was at first a stripped down yet serene locution of the world of MotM; later on, I found myself even laughing out loud at certain pocketed moments where the game displayed its more raunchy side. \n\n  All in all, if you're someone looking for a break from the fast-paced, adrenaline-filled and flashiness that populates so much of video games today, and instead are looking for a simple yet profound, story rich game which will leave you with a lingering sense of tingling happiness to take with you into the night, this is definitely the game for you.

Despite the delicate tone, it never shies from emotional or serious moments. And the artwork! The artwork is straight out of a storybook, with lively animations that are surprisingly detailed for chunky pixel art. A lot of effort went into giving the characters a sense of personality and uniqueness, and it always shows.\n\nThe main criticism I would level at this game are the puzzles: they're commonly average at best. Neither clever nor challenging. Not ridiculous like point-and-clicks of old, but poorly signposted if not very awkwardly designed. They're not hard puzzles; just awkward. There's not much satisfaction in overcoming them, but the story and artwork make it all worth it.\n\nEDIT: An update adds mouse-over animation to interactive hotspots, which I think vastly improves the experience. My older review, which is now mostly irrelevant:\n\n[My last criticism is minor. The user interface is strangely dead for such a beautiful game. The cursor never, ever changes. So when you mouse over the scene there is zero feedback to the user, thus there is literally no way to tell if something can be interacted with. No highlighting, no text labels, nothing. You don't know what's clickable or not. The game is still highly functional without this sense of feedback, but there is a deadness to the interaction. There is no \"game feel\" to the navigation, which takes away some sense of coherence in how I explored the environments, which in the end affected my immersion.]\n\nAll in all, if you like point-and-clicks then I think this is a must-play for the charm and personality it exudes, as well as for the few but surprising turns the story takes.

But like the film industry we've seen more and more gems pop up on the radar in recent years with games like Through The Woods with its exploration of Norse mythology and the thoroughly impressive art design of Owlboy.  \n\nThe newest installment in this halfhearted renaissance of Norwegian indie adventure games is the delightfully charming Milkmaid Of The Milky Way where even the recipes for butter and cheese are written down in rhymes. You play as Ruth, a young woman living alone on a farm in a remote fjord in Norway where strange things are happening to her farm at night. It's up to Ruth and her best friend Lykke, a cow she's raised from birth, to unravel a mystery that will change her life forever.  \n\n\n[h1]THE HERO'S JOURNEY[/h1]\nVery early on you start to realize that you're playing the classic hero's journey. Ruth is someone who's down on her luck and in a bad place in her life. Eventually she's confronted with some kind of obstacle or struggle she's got to deal with and the action in the story is her fighting against opposition. Eventually she overcomes her struggle and ends up in a place ahead of where she started off at.  \n\nThis classic structure is prominently featured throughout the game and it creates a pacing that's close to perfect. Not even during a frustrating pixel hunting section in the beginning was I ever bored playing the game and I was genuinely interested in exploring the world and its characters. In the beginning it might be a little jarring reading the text in the game since it's structured like a poem and you wish there was some voice acting to compensate for it but I got used to it very quickly and eventually I realized that if the game had been filled with voice clips reading out the dialogue it would have taken away from the atmosphere created by the music.   \n\nThe game starts off in a completely unexpected way where both the music and atmosphere are heavily reminiscent of John Carpenter's The Thing with 80's synth music giving off a deeply unnerving sensation that something really sinister is out to get you. It's absolutely wonderful in the way it can go from an old fashioned mouth harp to 80's synth without it feeling weird or out of place and the reason for that is the context in which it is presented.  \n\n\n[h1]THE CALL TO ADVENTURE[/h1]\nThe game's difficulty is not something I considered very much playing through it because the puzzles you have to solve are all directly related to the dialogue in the game. If you don't know what to do you can get a vague idea through talking to people and clicking on items and not once is something placed on screen purely for the sake of esthetics. Everything has a purpose, be it for solving the puzzles or world building and character development, and you'll find yourself not really thinking about how to solve the puzzles but more about how to reach your goal with the tools you have at your disposal.  \n\nThis is something I wish was done more in other genres of gaming where things are put in front of you purely for you to have something to do instead of having a direct impact on the main narrative of the game. I can honestly say I was never bored playing this, not even during my 15 minute pixel hunt in the beginning trying to find way into the spaceship because I desperately wanted to get inside and continue the story.\n\nThere are some big twists revealed in the second act of the game that you absolutely need to experience for yourself but I wish I could tell you more about them because they are as unexpected as they are imaginative. As you trek your way through this 1960's sci-fi looking spaceship with your cow buddy and a mind for science, kicking ass and taking names you'll find yourself lost in its simple but likable characters, nefarious villain and engrossing atmosphere.", "timestamp_created": 1483633124, "timestamp_updated": 1483633170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29032036": {"recommendationid": "29032036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240116316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483616493}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "I Milkmaid of the Milky Way spiller vi ei ung jente ved navn Ruth. Hun lever p\u00e5 en avsidesliggende g\u00e5rd som klamrer seg til fjellsiden et sted dypt inne i en norsk fjord. \u00c5ret er 1929, og det er vanskelige tider for Ruth. Begge foreldrene hennes har g\u00e5tt bort, og hun st\u00e5r alene igjen med alt ansvaret p\u00e5 g\u00e5rden. Folkene i bygda nede i dalen vil ikke lenger ha sm\u00f8ret hennes, og foretrekker margarin fra butikken i stedet. I tillegg skjer det mystiske ting om natten, og det kan virke som om noen er p\u00e5 jakt etter kuene hennes.\n\nDet er ikke noen stor spoiler \u00e5 si at disse \u00abnoen\u00bb er av utenomjordisk karakter, men s\u00e5 voldsomt mye mer skal jeg ikke nevne. Poenget er at det som starter som et rimelig rolig spill med hverdagslige gj\u00f8rem\u00e5l, raskt utvikler seg til noe litt mer eksotisk. Og selv om du sikkert skj\u00f8nner hovedkonseptet allerede, er jeg rimelig sikker p\u00e5 at du ikke kommer til \u00e5 forutse spillets sentrale vri. Der fikk i alle fall jeg meg en stor overraskelse.\n\nMilkmaid of the Milky Way fungerer som et tradisjonelt, todimensjonalt pek-og-klikk-eventyr. Du utforsker fargerike, h\u00e5ndtegnede 2D-milj\u00f8er, der du l\u00f8ser g\u00e5ter og leter etter ting som kan hjelpe deg videre i handlingen. Du vet kanskje ikke alltid hvorfor, men som i eventyrspill flest gjelder det \u00e5 plukke opp alt som ikke er spikret fast (og i alle fall \u00e9n ting som er det).\n\n[...]\n\nMilkmaid of the Milky Way er ikke bare et imponerende stykke arbeid fra \u00e9n person, men et spill jeg tror de aller fleste tilhengere av eventyrspill vil sette pris p\u00e5. Det er ikke et tjuetimersspill med g\u00e5ter som krever at du trekker frem notatblokka, men et spill som vil gi deg en kveld eller to med trivelige opplevelser i godt selskap. Jeg storkoste meg, og h\u00e5per at dette ikke blir siste gangen vi h\u00f8rer fra Ruth og de nye vennene hennes.\n\nLes hele artikkelen p\u00e5 Spillhistorie.no: http://spillhistorie.no/2016/11/29/forsteinntrykk-milkmaid-of-the-milky-way/\n\n(spillet ble testet p\u00e5 skribentens egen Steam-konto)", "timestamp_created": 1483616913, "timestamp_updated": 1483616954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569536", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29031227": {"recommendationid": "29031227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031396909", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483616771}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful, relaxing experience.

You play Ruth, the aforementioned milkmaid, in 1929. She lives alone with her cows that she loves, and is wrapped up in an adventure that\u2019s\u2026. please forgive me\u2026 out of this world.\n\nThis entire game is delightful. The art is on the lowfi side of pixel art (lower resolution than a Wadjet Eye game, for example) but it is still absolutely gorgeous. The color palettes of the different scenes and settings are so strong, and the character animation in this game is incredibly provocative. I was shocked at how well the characters\u2019 reactions read with so few pixels. There\u2019s this one animation in particular of Ruth in high wind - her hair and her clothes flap about in a way that looks so good and so right that I can almost feel the wind, too. There\u2019s a lot of work and artistry in this that makes this game look so special.\n\nThe soundtrack helps, too. There\u2019s a few soft piano pieces that, paired with the idyllic setting of the fjord, made it feel like I\u2019m walking around a Studio Ghibli movie. The only thing I would have liked was a liiiiittle bit more detail in the background - it\u2019s very colorblocky and bare. More grass blowing, more flowers bobbing, etc.\n\nIt also plays like a charm - Ruth is pretty fast so it\u2019s never annoying to have her trek back and forth across several wide map scenes (although having to walk back and forth so much in the second half\u2019s world pushed it a bit). The story goes places I wouldn\u2019t expect, got me to be emotional in ways I didn\u2019t expect, and included something I didn\u2019t expect but wished more adventure games did: you eventually have to save the day by fixing something that is the result of you solving a puzzle from the first half of the game. I thought that was great! That puzzle wasn\u2019t even a big deal at the time - it was a great touch that made the world feel real and grounded.\n\nI\u2019d rate this game higher and put it on my close-to-my-heart list but for one thing:\n\nThe whole couplet-rhyme-thing doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThe actual textual writing is by far the weakest of the game. The dev constraining himself to writing in rhyming couplets shackled him in a way he couldn\u2019t overcome - it was clunky, awkward, and in a lot of places just poorly done. One line stuck out to me - \u2018I should hope I do not give you displease / but I have to go make my milk and cheese.\u2019 I - what? Bad. There are another half-dozen stinkers like that one, and the vast majority were varying degrees of \u2018meh\u2019.

I hope the next game by this maker will be a bit more challenging and hopefully less rhymed. :D", "timestamp_created": 1518265386, "timestamp_updated": 1519490012, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479452", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39884688": {"recommendationid": "39884688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093831749", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517912754}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub108\ubb34 \ud3c9\ubc94\ud574\uc11c \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\ub9cc\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud560 \uac83\uc774 \uc5c6\uc74c\n\uad73\uc774 \ud558\ub098 \ucc3e\uc544\ubcf4\uc790\uba74 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub300\uc0ac\uac00 \uc6b4\uc728\uc744 \ub9de\ucdb0\uc11c \uc4f0\uc774\uae30\ub294 \ud588\ub294\ub370 \ub0b4 \ubaa8\uad6d\uc5b4\ub3c4 \uc544\ub2c8\uace0 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub044\uba74 \ubabb\ub290\ub08c\n\ucd94\ucc9c \uc548\ud558\ub824\ub2e4\uac00 \uac1c\uc778\uc774 \uc560\uc815\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uac9c\uc774\ub77c\uc11c \ucd94\ucc9c\ub4dc\ub9bc", "timestamp_created": 1517912985, "timestamp_updated": 1517912985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39873550": {"recommendationid": "39873550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015324296", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517856348}, "language": "english", "review": "[i][b]Milkmaid of the Milky Way[/b][/i] is a nice little adventure game. \n\nA storyline out of the ordinary and somewhat moving (mildly sad in the end), dabed with some light and funny features here and there. \nIt's the story of a young orphan farmer living alone with her cows in the Norwegian countryside. On a clear night she makes a strange encounter that will give her life a new course. \n\nThe music is relaxing. \nThere is no voice acting, only some reading but nothing tedious. \nDialogues are written with a bit of poetry.

Its strong points are the atmosphere (it reminds of Loom) and the graphics. It has animated grass, animated leaves, and this adds a lot to the immersion. Also, there is an animated graphic overlay filter that makes everything feel more alive. The music is good. The idea to have all dialog in rhyme is great: first, it produces a very unique and dreaming atmosphere (again, it resembles Loom); second, it makes clues less obvious. You don't know if something is a clue or is there just because it is needed for a rhyme. Very good idea for an adventure game, where one of the challenges is to disguise the clues in dialogue. The difficulty increases very gradually. It starts very easy, but becomes hard in the end, so I had to look for a solution to a puzzle (I had to use the needle on something). The puzzles are nonlinear, like in classic Monkey Island style game. The only downside is that the puzzle quality is not Ron Gilbert level. The game is also fairly long (finished in 32 hours), so well worth the price. It would be worth triple the price, for that matter.

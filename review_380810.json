The graphics and 3D style are fantastic.  Beautiful and unique.  I've never played anything that looks and feels quite like it.  The soundtrack is fantastic, and is nicely integrated into the main story.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about it is that it really does flub the opening.  The game opens with a confusing sequence that doesn't really offer you anything to grab on to, and once that ends, you're dumped into a sequence that hints that the entire game will be some sort of a dry, retconed, alternate history that projects modern progressive values back onto the year 1851.  Making progress past all that feels like a bit of a slog, and doesn't give the player much reason to assume the entire game won't be more of the same.  But when the story finally gets moving, it REALLY gets moving.  You can actually feel the first moment when something interesting happens, because it's so striking.  \"Wait, what?  Does that mean what I think it means?\"  From then on out, the game is SOLID.\n\nIn fact, from then on out, the game moves so smoothly that the next thing you'll think to complain about is the cliffhanger at the end, as we wait for the conclusion.\n\nIn summary, you should absolutely play this if you're a fan of point & click adventure games with a strong story.

For the most part I know the series of events and the main people involved but not exact dates of everything . And when most of our questions, both multiple choice and essay, have us pinpoint an exact date it does not go well for me. Despite this I love period pieces. Especially with the amount of research that goes into it and how it shows. Hearing possible ways the world would of been if certain events did not play out as they did is even more interesting, especially since there is a history book that is dedicated to showcasing it. With Herald: An Interactive Period Drama being alternative history, I just had to play through it.\n\nToday we go back to an alternative 19th century in the shoes of a young man named Devan Rensburg. Opening up to him being in the hands of a mysterious woman who introduced herself as The Rani. Who, of which, also seemed to of saved him from drowning. Directing Devan to recount his story from his journal and why he is wearing the Protectorate blue captain coat. Not only paving a way for us to have an intro to the story but the structure the inner narrative will be from Devan. We do spend most of our time in Devan\u2019s retelling. Being aboard the merchant ship HLV Herald with the help of the second officer, Aaron Ludlow, hand selecting him and eventually track down his parents when they get back on land. \n\nAs most of Devan\u2019s surroundings is either the boat or the ocean it is not surprising we are around the same characters and slowly introduced to the different parts of the boat. Luckily the characters are strong enough to carry this weight. You get the sense of every character and you know they each have their own pasts. And with this having choices on what you can say, you also sculpt how Devan is. Is he one for change, does he become concerned, will he help others? \n\nNot only are characters deep but they have great art and voice actors behind them. Each character had a great choice in a voice actor and I did not leave dissatisfied by any of the performances. When the characters talk a 2d drawing of them is put on screen, leaving the 3d model to do the body movement and not worry about facial expression. The art they show is great as well, with a little animation added, to show various expressions. And trust me some are hilarious. \n\nI do like how they decided to do the conversation choices on the boat. We get the usual wording in The Rani scenes but we get more of \u201cI decided to\u2026\u201d on the boat. It\u2019s something little, but it goes in line with him recounting it to The Rani. This also goes into his narration on the various objects you can inspect. Doing it more as telling The Rani rather than thinking about what he saw. There is undoubtedly no way he can remember everything but they do balance it out somewhat with Devan\u2019s journal. I can only assume our first tab, mostly used to tell you your objectives, would be more towards a diary deal. With the second tab just being quick notes and backstories on various subjects such as items and people, and the last tab being the map of the HLV Herald. Though the map is a tad confusing.\n\nA huge thing with games giving you choice is how it handles them, with Telltale games commonly being brought up in this aspect. With Herald: An Interactive Period Drama, most of the decisions made have immediate, or almost immediate, consequences. Only some choices having a more long term consequence that will come into play in the last two books. And as of now they do seem like these decisions matter, especially with how the characters will probably react later on. Of course there are plot points it has to hit no matter what, but you still get some choices around those that do hold some significance. Some even are brought up as little jabs showing that characters will remember what you say.\n\nThis also focuses more on telling a story rather than the usual point and click aspect plays into the game as well. Bringing in more of a relaxed experience. Letting us look at the environment and focus on the characters and the story. There is really no challenge, other than finding your way around the boat, and most of your interactions other than with characters will be walking through the environments and giving items to various characters. The 3d world is somewhat lacking in terms of the character models, but they do try, and succeed, at filling the ship realistically. Also compensating with their soundtrack at the right times. If it was not for the 3d world we walk in, I would say this would be a visual novel.\n\nOne of the things I do wish is for the autosave to be brought to attention as I did not know if the game saved or not till I looked it up. I do totally get why as your choices seem more set in stone, but I wish it told you that it will autosave at every chapter. I do also wish we got more than three save slots. As we are eventually getting the last half, there are multiple combinations I can see happening and setting one down makes me reluctant to restart if I have all three slots filled. The replayability is there, but there are only a few save slots to use.\n\nEven though the whole story has not been revealed to us yet, I do think the plot twist we were given at the end of book two happened too early. You can kind of tell the hints that supported it after you find out, but I think the want to know how Devan got to wearing a captain\u2019s coat, how he ended up floating in the ocean, and other things that happened at the end of book two. With book three and four still to be announced, time will only tell how the reveal is handled and if it still seems too early.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n+ Voice acting \n+ Art\n+ Well written plot and characters\n\n+/- 3d models can be better\n+/- Inspecting using a controller can be annoying as some items are so small one flick can go past the hit box\n\nHerald: An Interactive Period Drama only contains the first two books out of the planned four, but even without this the experience seems like a full one. Everything is smoothly handled and nothing seems like they were trying to pad out the game with meaningless objectives or conversations. I do hope for the rest of the story to be released soon and highly recommend this.\n\n[code] [url=http://saveorquit.com/author/ripwitch/] \ud83d\udc9c Check out my other reviews at SaveorQuit! \ud83d\udc9c [/url][/code]", "timestamp_created": 1500902902, "timestamp_updated": 1500902902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619892", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33617597": {"recommendationid": "33617597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065857063", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494356799}, "language": "english", "review": "The below review is taken from my original post at www.gamesfreezer.eu\n\nThe trailer of Herald exudes style and genuinely feels like something a little different. As far as I know I\u2019ve never played a video game developed by a Dutch team with the exception of Killzone back on the Playstation 2 which obviously differs greatly from the visual novel genre. \n\n\nUpon starting Herald, the craftsmanship on offer is clear and the fact that this is coming from a small development team of only four people is astonishing. \n\n\nWispfire has been working on Herald since 2014 and I\u2019m pleased to say that it was worth their time and it is definitely worth yours.\n\n\nThe thought of playing an interactive period drama was instantly alluring to me as it felt such a unique premise, the period and place in which Herald is set is relatively unknown to me and so I was looking forward to broadening my knowledge.\n\n\nAfter a brief introduction to the main character Devan Rensburg, who is being held \u2018prisoner\u2019 by a lady known as The Rani, the game flashes back to the beginning of Devan\u2019s voyage and it is in this timeline that the majority of the game takes place.\n\n\nThe graphics continued to astound me as I played the game, the portraits of the characters that popped up when in the conversation were incredibly detailed and each portrait shimmers and moves to give a feeling of life to each person in the game, it\u2019s a technique that adds an extra layer of involvement to the gameplay. \n\n The in-game character models themselves are presented in a stylised way which reminded me of Escape from Monkey Island, which as everyone knows is a good thing. The backgrounds of the game and all animations are smooth and match the lulling, unobtrusive music which couches the game-play.\n\n\nHerald is fully voice acted to an extremely high standard. Due to the nature of the game, there is a lot of dialogue but it is all handled well and I noticed no mismatches of speech to text which can sometimes be an issue in this genre. \n\n The game uses a mostly static camera with occasional sweeping flourishes during cut scenes, this ties in nicely with the point and click gameplay with the focus being heavily geared towards dialogue choices which are well-constructed. \n\n Whilst there are usually only three choices you can make, I found they were varied enough for me to always answer in the way I wanted to. In this regards the game reminded me of Deus Ex: Human Revolution as that game also had the knack of giving you dialogue choices that suited your style of play.\n\n\nNarrative-wise, the game's\u2019 focus is on moving forwards and telling a story as opposed to challenging the player with puzzles, this makes for a very breezy gaming experience in which you can focus on the tale being told.\n\nThe game has a lot of hot spots to click on but these are more for informational purposes to add to the thoroughness of the game world, these are interesting and give an insight into life at sea at the time. As you progress through the game, various items and areas are added to the in-game encyclopaedia which can be accessed by clicking on the top of the screen.\n\nIn-game objects of interest are highlighted when you roll the mouse over them, this avoids pixel hunting issues, which is a nice touch.\n\n\nThe game being set on a boat keeps the story tight and focused, each character also has a separate personality and voice actor which makes it easy to distinguish between them. Whilst the game is set in a time during which I\u2019m sure there were intense class division and hardship, Herald exists in a world where that divide is somewhat romanticised. In the game there is no bad language and each character is quirky and has their own foibles but whilst there is the insinuation of racial and sexual divides, they are not the main thrust of the narrative.\n\nSummary:\nHerald is a wonderfully realised game and it\u2019s branching narrative offers replay value. I completed the first chapters in a little over two hours and I would like to point out that there aren\u2019t many puzzles in the game, as it focuses instead on plot and atmosphere but in my personal experience this can be preferable over forced sliding / lock-box puzzles to artificially extend a game. \n\n If an interactive visual novel is something that floats your boat, I\u2019d suggest getting a brandy ready and tucking into Herald.

Some beauty knows no language. But, this beautifully animated point & click choice based drama crosses language and race barriers with issues that we struggle with today like suicide, faith, racism, gun control, interpersonal relationships, & slavery; all set in the 19th Century.[/h1]\n\nIt seems that, in Herald, I am everyman and every woman. The script draws us in to experience the motives & thoughts of each character. The narrative, characterizations, art, & voice acting are incredibly well done. \n\n[b]Gameplay Mechanics:[/b]\nThe game plays out via simple p&c mechanics, where you use a mouse click to move through the ship. Controller options have recently been patched in, and are still being tweaked. The narrative is revealed in textboxes, where in parts it is just dialogue advanced by clicks, interspersed with sets of choices. Dialog is followed by cutscenes that are enjoyable and advance the story. I never got bored even after multiple games. The save system is convenient, making it possible to reload the chapter if you feel you made bad choices.\n\n[b]Graphics & Sound:[/b]\nThe soundtrack is lovely! One particularly haunting tune that appears in the theme is played on the piano by a character in one scene, who sings the words. This means a soundtrack would definitely be a plus.\nEven with a good machine, the framerate never went above 30 fps for me. I felt like this was intentional, as it creates a not quite slow-mo effect, lending a dramatic flair to each scene. If lower framerates bother you, this may not be the game for you. \nMost of the animations were done well, if simply. Most character movements seem true. There is one point where a character walks through a door, and then the irritating movements of the doctor helping a patient. Almost comical, the doc\u2019s eyebrow moves side to side in one conversation.  But, in most other scenes, it is almost entrancing to see that simple can be elegant.\n\n[b]Where Herald Succeeds & Fails with Choices:[/b]  \n\n[u]Mystery/ Foreshadowing[/u] Herald is a mystery in its whole. At this point, only the 1st 2 books are released, so there is much to work with here and the writers seem to have taken full advantage of that, succeeding in every account. \n\u2714  There is a revealer in the final scene of the 2nd book that changes what you thought you knew in very early scenes. This leaves you with a cliff hanger of sorts. \n\u2714  Even multiple play-throughs add to and expand your opinions of different characters. Some things are never answered for us, but we are left to form our own opinions. \n \u2714  Some apparent mysteries are left open at the end, hinted at only by shadows and shapes in the artwork. \n\u2714  Ultimately, characters are left to being human with various interpretations of their behavior still being available after several replays.\n\n[u]Complexity of Choice[/u] \nI rate the choice in Herald a solid 8 out of 10. I played Choice of Robots, an excellent choice game that was totally text-based. I would rate that as a perfect 10, because your choices changed everything. The choice web was intricate, creating literally hundreds of outcomes. But, games like Firewatch, which I also loved but would rate a 5, presented only cosmetic changes with the choices. The players were all drawn back into the original plot line at collection points, so that ultimately your choices did not really change the story in Firewatch. \n\u2714  In Herald, there is one story. The narrative rules as a mystery which you will reveal over the course of not only these current 2 books, but future books. But, your choices can affect the interplay of characters, and the outcome of scenes, and the appearance of different dialog trains. Information which you have not revealed is not later available in a conversation. \n\u2718  Many decisions often affect only that immediate tier, and sometimes only in the emotional feel of the dialog. For example, whether you offer to do Ian's job for him or not, you get to do it. Regardless of how you respond to the Rani in the prologue, the results are the same. And, with the captain, navigator, & senator, I was accused of taking so long whether I stalled or took the direct text options.\n\u2714  Numerous choices can change whether a character lives, dies, or is in the brig. Some characters can appear earlier in a scene, or in the place of another character, if your responses change. Interestingly, if you choose to start at the scripted start of the 2nd book, instead of in the 1st, I discovered that the script goes with the option of no characters being dead.\n\u2718  No choice seems to have an effect beyond its immediate scene, with the exception of whether certain players exist or not. Because of this & the save system, it is possible to exit to the menu and restart a book multiple times, to get multiple achievies at once. Basically, some crucial decisions will pop one of 3 different achievements. No achievement requires more than one scene\u2019s set of responses to resolve, with the possible exception of Mad Discourtesy, which requires probably 2 scene\u2019s answers.\n\n[u]Replayability[/u]\n\u2714  Despite the save/ reload ability, multiple playthroughs will probably be needed to get all achievements. Also, you won\u2019t get all info in the mystery without at least 3 plays. My 1st play took about 8 hours, with reading everything, even the letters that are unlocked at the end and the credits. The 2nd play took 4 hours, still reading choices and popping some achievements. After that, additional plays took about a half hour per book with skipping dialog & quick choices. So, after experiencing everything the story has to offer thus far\u2026 in every nuance, I have almost 16 hours. \n\n[u]Dev Support[/u]\n\u2714  The dev team has made the art available in the trading card collectables.\n\u2714   A large collection of concept art was made available free in earlier release notes. They don\u2019t seem to be attempting to monetize every bit of data, as many devs are doing. \n\u2714  They are responding quickly to comments and or email. \n\n[b]Suggestions for Improvement:[/b]\n1. The log is helpful in-game, but access to what you\u2019ve accumulated after the game would be a great addition to the menu. \n2. Voice acting could be added for the letter collections in the menu. (Only half of them seem to pop after these first two books.)\n3. Having musical options & even a musical library in the menu, as with the letter archive, would be even better. Alternately, a soundtrack would be a plus.\n\n[h1]With a storyline as deep as the ocean, & several currents relevant to any age, Herald is so much more than a lovely journey between the sea & the stars. As a choice-based p& c adventure game, Herald provides hours of mystery drama for fans of gaming narrative. I highly recommend the game, and I look forward to the exciting upcoming books.[/h1] \n\n[b]UPDATE:\nI contacted Wispfire with some questions, & got a detailed response from the writer, Roy van der Schilden. I wanted to pass along a few of those details here.\n\u2022\tLady Tabatha\u2019s song, Vows, was composed by Bart Delissen.

The genius of Herald is the way it blends everything that's almost comfortingly familiar about adventure games and comes up with something entirely fresh and exciting. Many of the character archetypes (stern statesman, whiny cabin boy, underappreciated officer) are immediately familiar, but as the story unfolds every single character is given depth. The plot surprised me at multiple times (especially the end of Book II, loved it!), but it never felt forced because there were always clues laying the groundwork for every reveal. It seems you are bound to go through the same basic plot, but your choices certainly matter in some significant ways, some choices opening up or closing options later. And both books so far end with high stakes conversations with dramatic effects. I was surprised after I finished playing to enjoy reading the archives (letter and document style backstory pieces), which add further depth to several characters and help to explain their motivations. This is a rich story with lots of detail accessible to flesh it out, but even if you skip clicking around the ship for extra information, there's a lot to enjoy. \n\nTechnically speaking, you can see the graphics from the preview videos and screenshots and they're nothing special. I love the character portraits though, which are very detailed and dynammic. The changing of expressions and general movement of the portraits during conversation helps to give the already good voice acting a visual component to play off of. For a game like this where the soul is in the dialogue and choices, I think this works very well. \n\nI definitely recommend this game! Be aware that it deals with a variety of issues and topics of colonialism from several angles, so if you are sensitive to some content (violence, slavery mentions, racism) you may want to check for warnings to prepare yourself.

The writing is excellent, the world-building is top notch, but most prominent of all: the game is extremely well paced. No meandering, no filler gameplay, no plot-jamming characters. This gives the game a forward momentum that makes you want to finish the two episodes in one sitting.\n\nRegarding gameplay: it is much more of a story-telling based game than, say, a point-and-click adventure. Expect to find the challenge in making decisions in the storyline (which can be quite challenging!) than within puzzles. This game is for people interested in roleplaying & interactive storytelling.\n\nThe biggest downsides are that the visual style may need some getting used to & some of the voice acting of some of the side-characters sound odd in compare to the main characters. Because the game relies on telling a story based on your choices, you may occasionally encounter a plottwist and only then realise you didn't gain the full picture before.\n\nBesides this, I do wish to highlight some other aspects too: The feeling of the setting is communicated quite well through some really good directing and audio work. The ship feels like a ship, especially when things get a bit more tense (and things do get tense!).\n\nAn semi-obligatory disclaimer: I was a kickstarter backer and I played the DRM-free version. Back then I backed a few other games which turned into mostly disappointments (I'm rather picky with games that claim to have good stories or narratives). So while I appreciated the intention of the creators, I was a little more than sceptic when I started playing. It feels good to be proven wrong.", "timestamp_created": 1488548220, "timestamp_updated": 1488548266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642679", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30265765": {"recommendationid": "30265765", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969386268", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488397736}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played the game at the Gamescom 2016 for the first time and it got me hooked because of the setting, the art style and the music. Therefore I had to buy it right after it got released.\n\nAs you can see from the 4 hours of playtime, the two books can be played through quite quickly, yet you can (and should) replay to see what happens with the story in an alternative savegame.\n\nThe game emphasizes on the decisions you make, similar to the Telltale adventure games. However, you don't have quicktime events, multiple savegames for one story line or endless dialogues. There's an automatic savegame mechanism in place, which saves the game usually when entering new locations after important scenes or conversations. There's no other way to save your game, so you have to stick with your decisions or start from the very beginning. With the 3 available savegame slots you can create 3 different story lines. The conversations are good in length and content, the story related dialogues are all voiced and sound really great. I wished to have all dialogues voiced, but that's only a minor issue.\n\nAlso this game should not be confused with a typical Point and Click adventure game. It is what it is: An Interactive Period Drama. Interactive regarding your decisions, period regarding the game's general setting (just listen to the music!) and drama because of the story's content and presentation. When I talked with one of the creators at Gamescom, he said the emphasis is the story (and your decisions) and now I can say it does deliver till the end of Book II, which has a cliffhanger with many questions left unanswered, so I can't wait for book III and IV to be released.", "timestamp_created": 1488396469, "timestamp_updated": 1488396469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30260485": {"recommendationid": "30260485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208066220", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487941571}, "language": "english", "review": "Great to see this fine effort for a point n' click adventure with some truly inspiring content.\nAtmosphere of the game is great and so are the visuals.\n\nIf you are looking for humor you'd better steer clear of this though!\n\nKeep up the good work people!\n", "timestamp_created": 1488376522, "timestamp_updated": 1488376522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30252492": {"recommendationid": "30252492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177699033", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488335198}, "language": "english", "review": "this game me stressed in a good way", "timestamp_created": 1488335248, "timestamp_updated": 1488335248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30227626": {"recommendationid": "30227626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030151051", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489300314}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a little over halfway through the current content and it's pretty good.

I have to agree with others that the voice acting is very well done. You can really hear the ancestry of the NPCs you meet. Good job on that.\n\nThen there is the branching. The branching of the story feels like it actually branches more then games from like Telltale (Walking Dead, Batman, Wolf Among Us), where the choices are usually 'fake'. I got different cinematics based on my choices and characters still reference choices I made much earlier in the story.\n\nOn the downside it is rather short, I finished it in 1.5 evenings and part 2 (book III & IV) is not out yet.

First, the visual. The Herald, it's crew and its passengers are all a perfect blend of authentic 18th century culture and their alternate world where the Protectorate is law. From the rich blues of the officers to the dour, flemish-looking finery of its wealthier passengers to the traditional Indian clothing of the Rani. Second, it's lore. Herald takes the fairly plausible possibility of Oliver Cromwell remaining in power and uses it to show us a world where Britain is considered the centre of the free world and also a global empire simultaneously. And that is a very important phrase in Herald 'the free world' and all it means. \n\nAs an outsider to this world we see that the protectorate is a Republican Empire (Republican in the sense that it has no king, I'm not criticising the GOP) masquerading under the notion of freedom. Non-white/ non-western people are stepped on and even those who are citizens of the Protectorate are always worse off than their white counterparts. We also see the incredibly stratified and confining class system expressed in the ship's protocol. Through the lense of the Protectorate we are encouraged to consider these issues, race, class and imperialism as they aply to our own world and our own history of exploiting other nations. In the end we are made to ask if we can truly claim to be living in the 'free world'. But the message is always subtle and always interprative. Herald never tells us we are wrong, it asks us to consider if we are right.\n\nThe dialogue and characterisation is also spot on. It strikes an excellent balance between convincing 19th century speech and behaviour and making these figures relatable to our 21st century viewpoint. There are no evil people just a cast of opponents and allies that all think they're doing what needs to be done or who believe they are acting justly. All the major players manage to be likable and believable enough to keep us interested in them.\n\nThe gameplay, I think is this game's biggest let down. Whilst the talking heads are beautiful and this cast of relative unknowns do an absolutely excellent job of breathing life into a well written script there is no physical acting to compliment the conversations and the graphics are extremely antiquated. Put together it feels like the physical part of the actors performances are missing which undercuts their impact.\n\nCompared to other games in the genre, Herald lacks puzzles or QTEs.That said, Herald is a slower paced game that is more focussed on making decisions while you get into the character of Devan and his world on the Herald. But in all it is a joy to play through.\n\nIn conclusion I would highly recomend a play through of this game and it's a must buy if you catch it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1488054624, "timestamp_updated": 1488214938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30148919": {"recommendationid": "30148919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018339579", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500045028}, "language": "english", "review": "Herald Game is a rich, colourful visual novel that captured me from the demo.

This doesn't come as a huge surprise, due to it having a controversial nature and possessing sometimes, convoluted politics. With Herald, it's nice to see this historical material implemented in an interesting way and communicated in a manner that engenders the player with a sincere enough interest of it.\n\nA shipwreck is always an effective start to a story. Here, it sets the scene nicely and quite quickly has us questioning the main character's journey and motives. Devan Rensburg is being held prisoner in what appears to be the Indian colonies. I use the word 'prisoner' relatively loosely, as he is being held captive in a room, furnished luxuriously with items of eastern design whilst at the same time being questioned by a woman known as The Rani; a Hindu title denoting Sovereignty. His story is one that he appears to have told her once already, judging by her demands that he tells her again \"truthfully\", what he is seeking in the colonies. Her suspicions are, however, understandable. Firstly; Devan is a young man of mixed heritage. He explains that his father is from the protectorate and his mother, is originally from the colonies. Secondly; he was pulled from the sea wearing not the garb of a standard crew member, but a captain. It's these unusual set of circumstances that pave the way for the player to not only unravel Devan's nautical story but to contribute towards it too.\n\nTold via flashbacks the game jumps from the regalia enriched room to the ship itself - Herald; a merchant vessel on the Indigo route on which Devan is the steward. Further to the opening section which contained mild interactivity, the UI and simple mechanics are explained in a tutorial set piece with the main protagonist and some of the crew. Straight away we're given a bit of a conundrum which has us wondering if our relationship with the hierarchy could go as salty as the sea air, from the outset. Shortly after, the tour of the main deck and some interactions with other crew members inform us of how to navigate the area and takes us through Devan's journal. Events, objectives, historical nuggets of info and map of the Herald are all recorded here in his pocket sized encyclopedia.\n\nAn Officer And A Cabin Boy:\n\nBeing someone who leans more towards the rustic nature of a print publication for a straightforward story, I was glad that Herald: An Interactive Period Drama introduces some nice choices, ultimatums and conversational pathways, not unlike a standard point 'n click adventure. Dialogue trees seemed to offer a nice amount of scope for fleshing out Devan's personality. This is always welcome and allows me as the player to emotionally engage with the plot and characters further. Becoming involved in disputes between other crew members, clashes of ego's and possible incidents of a darker and grubbier nature are all matters that Herald delivers within book 1. The seedier subject matter which is hinted at, seemed to be something, in my opinion, that could've possibly been handled in a slightly more artistic manner. This could well be the case further down the line but the kicker here, is that I didn't get to find that out.\nUpon firing the game up again to play through Book 2, I was rather dismayed to notice that my save file, which remained perfectly intact through two previous sittings had vanished completely. Try as I may to recover it, I had to concede that the only way to get through Books 1 & 2 in their entirety would be to start over. Although save game issues are problems that do unfortunately occur with Beta titles, or those simply within their teething stage, I'm not prepared to spend the time going through all of it again as I really shouldn't have to. A shame! After a bit of a slow start I was getting quite hooked by the story and indeed some of the personalities that developers Wispfire have provided for us.\n\n\n\nA Well Scrubbed Deck:\n\nAida, the Art Director has done a fantastic job as the game is very pleasant to look at. Character animations are nothing that I'd describe as detailed but the art work is effective enough. Basic in some places and pretty in others, especially on the character portraits during the dialogue scenes. Fine art style brushstrokes and some bold outlines create some lovely visuals. The sound also plays its part well. Aside from very occasional discrepancies with the voice acting; articulation being slightly off in places, the characters are brought to life nicely. The background music appropriately compliments each section and ambience such as the creaking of the Herald itself sets the scene in an evocative way without being intrusive.\n\nSuffice to say I quite enjoyed what I played of Book 1 (It felt as though I was coming to the end) and may return in the future. Developers Wispfire have created a nice mix here, of choice driven adventure and visual novel. I'm confident that fans of either genre, will be interested in seeing how things unfold for the enigmatic Mr Rensburg.", "timestamp_created": 1487786281, "timestamp_updated": 1487992652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437347", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

It's a good, solid HOPA with great visuals and a variety of HO style scenes to mix things up. \n\nAfter playing a rash of disappointing HOPAs, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. \n\n[h1]The Good Stuff[/h1]\n+ [b]Great art.[/b] \nThe 3D cutscene animations are a bit stiff, but the scenes, backgrounds, objects, and even effects are stunning. \n+ [b]Variety of HO styles.[/b] \nThere are 3 kinds of hidden object scenes: the usual text list form with some two-step items, the \"find then use\" silhouette mode, and a pair-matching mode where you're given a handful of items to place or use in the scene with objects they typically go with (put a weight on a scale, use a matchbox to light a candle, add a boot/sock/glove to make a pair, etc). It takes a bit getting used to, but it's nice to see more than just lists all the time. All the scenes are nicely rendered, and objects are logical and scaled well for their surroundings.\n+ [b]Decent puzzle difficulty.[/b] \nNot too easy, but not overly challenging. Difficulty falls into that comfortable middle ground that suits most casual players.\n+ [b]Good use of sound.[/b] \nI never found myself wincing at SFX or music. They're fitting to the point of barely noticing how much they affect the ambiance. Some of the SFX for finishing puzzles or actions like \"hooray, you placed that thing in the right spot!\" were actually pretty satisfying.\n+ [b]Good voiceovers.[/b] \nWhile nearly anything qualifies as a good voiceover after you've played [i]Dreamatorium 2[/i] (*twitch*), in this case the VOs are more fitting and impressive than I've seen in many other top-tier HOPAs. They aren't overused either, and no unnecessary audio commentary for every single thing you click on.\n+ [b]Likeable characters.[/b] \nI found Uri and the lake/cave spirits to be quite charming. The way they were written, voiced, and animated gives them a particular kind of appeal.\n+ [b]Text is clear.[/b] \nI only spotted one or two insignificant grammar errors, and a single instance of a mislabelled item (\"needle\" when it should say \"tongs\")\n+ [b]Multi-use tools.[/b] \nOne of the biggest frustrations of HOG players is the \"one-use-crowbar\", or blades that break after cutting a piece of yarn. But in this game the dagger and owl you find at the beginning stay with you and are usable throughout the entire game. \n+ [b]Precise map and hint system.[/b] \nWhile you may want to avoid the map and hints if you're going for those achievements, they're a lot more useful than I've seen in other games. Unlike the typical HOPA hint that just points to the exit of the scene you're in, here it actually opens the map and circles where you're supposed to go. Fast travel is also lag-free, at least in my experience.\n+ [b]In-game strategy guide.[/b] \nI normally keep a walkthrough on hand in case I get stuck (or impatient), so it was nice to have the official one available via the UI itself at any point in the game. It's especially useful for the various collectibles.\n+ [b]Excellent bonus chapter.[/b] \nIt's a common joke by now that Collector's Edition bonus chapters are the laziest and most unfinished part of HOPAs, riddled with errors, bug/glitches, and horrendous mistranslations. But Lost Lands is one of they VERY few I've seen with a bonus chapter just as good as the main game. It's like someone actually put thought into the whole package. Shocking, I know.\n+ [b]Easy achievements. [/b]\nIf you don't mind playing on Hard difficulty from the get-go, you can get 100% in one playthrough.\n\n[h1]Iffy Stuff[/h1]\nI honestly don't have anything bad to say about this game, but here are a few nitpicks that don't necessarily detract from gameplay (except the first one a tiny bit):\n- [b]Bonus Chapter bug[/b] (I think).\nIn the bonus chapter there's a point where you have to go to the \"Old Forest Entrance\", but there's no conceivable way to get there other than through the map/fast travel. You can move [i]backward[/i] from that forest entrance and end up in the first underwater area, but unless I missed something obvious I couldn't find the reverse entry hotspot no matter what I tried. It's a good thing that bug isn't in the main chapter/game, because it would make the \"use the map less than 5 times\" achievement impossible.\n- [b]The Alchemist.[/b]\nThe animation for the alchemist is weirdly out of place. It's a completely different style of art, with none of the fluid movement of the other cutscenes. It looked like someone took their side project of a talking claymation sorcerer and just plopped it in as a supporting character. It wouldn't be the first time I've seen devs use existing assets from their minor projects to supplement a bigger game, but they could at least have made the art style fit a little better. Not really a \"problem\" obviously, but as an artist those things tend to pop out at me.\n- [b]No technical replay value. [/b]\nI say \"technical\" because I can see myself replaying this at some point for the whole experience. But puzzle layouts/difficulties and hidden object lists don't change at all between Easy/Normal/Hard. Objects are not randomized and lists don't rotate, so every game will be [i]exactly[/i] the same. \n\nOverall though, I'd rank [b]Lost Lands: Dark Overlord[/b] in the top third of my HOPA recommendation list, alongside titles like Dark Heritage: Guardians of Hope, Eventide: Slavic Fable, and Nearwood. \n\nJust go ahead and play it already. :p", "timestamp_created": 1469221893, "timestamp_updated": 1469223148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649415", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24330980": {"recommendationid": "24330980", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988012862", "num_games_owned": 3745, "num_reviews": 230, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468575410}, "language": "english", "review": "Dark Overlord is a solid hidden object game.\n\nWith 3 difficulty levels, it can be quite casual, but on hard and not using the map to see places that have actions (achievement!), it becomes an exercise in hunting: you need to find the leaf which hides that object that is missing for you to proceed.

The game features three types: conventional list-based, item matching, and sequential (find objects to uncover more objects).

However, this game is quite interesting as the minigames are easy to solve and the hidden objects scenes are divided in three types: placing the object at the right place, finding the object corresponding at the silhouette and the traditionnal list of objects. However, each scene contains a close-up of a part of it - without forgetting the objects hidden in the scene that will require an action.\n\nThe graphics are correct, the backgrounds are also beautiful but after one moment, it was kinda long.

Some of them are quite hard to obtain despite the description - like the HO list without misclick. Given the nature of the list scenes, it's easier to unlock it in the bonus chapter, at the last HO because there was only one red item (hidden object). Also, I don't know why the painting games without misclick didn't unlock the first time as I never did a mistake.\n\nAnyway, the bonus are also good: puzzles, minigames to replay (and unlock achievements you may miss although the paitings ones isn't working), concept arts, etc..\n\nThe bonus chapter is set after the main chapter, though there is a little problem: your character has now long hair.... but in the cutscenes, she has short hair again as part of recycling movies.\n\nAnyway, the game is pretty good. It's a good and enjoyable one. I can recommend this one eyes closed.", "timestamp_created": 1452589555, "timestamp_updated": 1452589555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19783792": {"recommendationid": "19783792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141404871", "num_games_owned": 636, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453639621}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing is more effective then a tenacious mother looking for her child.\n\nStoryline: Jimmy (3-5 years old) is lured away from his mother's side by a softly calling voice while she is speaking on the phone. (I would assume they are at home or she would have not taken the call I am sure.)  Susan, his mother, realizing her son has wandered off into the woods, goes after him only to see him being pulled into a mysterious swirling, glowing vortex in a tree trunk.  Before she can reach him he disappears in the tree trunk leaving only his teddy bear behind.  What does a concerned and tenacious mother do, she goes after him, of course.  Once she reaches the Lost Lands, as her new found dwarf friend explains, he also tells her an ancient evil has tainted the lands and in order to retrieve her son she must defeat this dark and evil presence.  Sure, no problem.  And with teddy bear in hand, she proceeds to do just that.\n\nGameplay: Mostly a point and click game but with enough hidden object scenes to keep it a hidden object game and plenty of puzzles.  Nothing too hard and the puzzles relatively easy. (Matching, sliders, circles, logic, color, recipe)  The game moves along in a relatively open world yet extremely linear fashion.  How can it be both, one may ask?  The linear movement of the story line moves along quite rapidly, however, the open world part comes into play because there are bottlenecks.  To get past each bottleneck the gamer must complete all the tasks needed to get past the bottleneck, which can be done in any order the gamer choses though limited to found inventory items.  Actually all the bottlenecks can be opened even before all tasks needed to complete the game are accomplished.  For an experienced HO gamer this should send up a little red flag that says 'backtracking', which there is a lot of if one missed something or the item in question can not be gotten yet.\n\nOn the subject of back tracking, there is a fast travel map.  But wait my friends, especially my achievement hunting friends, there are penalties, lots of them.  There are penalties for map use (and by default fast travel), for misclicks, for hints, for everything really, so pay attention to what one does or one will be playing the game more then once.  Ah yes, you read that correctly.  This game can be totally completed and ALL ACHIEVEMENTS EARNED in a SINGLE playthrough.  No forced second playthrough here, especially since there is a built in strategy guide in case one gets stuck.  So go ahead and play on the hard level the first time through.  There are even ACHIEVEMENTS IN the BONUS CHAPTER and some missed achievements can even be earned in the bonus chapter.  (Now that is a first for me, who has played HO games for 10+ years and owns well over a hundred HO games.)  Kudos to the developers, I really like that feature.\n\nA warning and caution for my achievement hunting friends, I suggest you actually read the achievements before playing because there are achievements 1) that are missable, 2) if over zealous and one only partially completes the puzzle (usually to get the stuff out of inventory) then leaves the puzzle the achievement is lost  (finding the shells immediately comes to mind ~ bonus chapter ~ ALL NINE shells need to placed on the 1st TRY and without any misclicks), 3) misclicks (One can lose several achievements over this. The fore mentioned one being one of them.) and 4) map use ~ limit 5 uses.  Advise: DO NOT USE THE MAP or one will be playing the game again.  \n\nThere are extra hidden objects (with attached achievements, of course), four sets: snails, pine cones, skulls, and snakes.  These extra objects change as one progresses through the game (and the change can be used as an area marker) and overlap between area sections. (There are basically 4 areas: town, mine, castle, wizard's tower.)  These objects are easy to see and easy to find.  But they are also easy to miss if one forgets or in a transistion zone.  Fortunately there is a \"tracking\" button one can click on to see how many are needed or left to be found in the \"area\".  \n\nEasy and challenging at the same time.  Fun, despite the backtracking.  Comes with built in strategy guide, has extras like wallpapers, concept art, music, plus 4 picture puzzles to do.  Well worth the price, plus it has a sequel game (Lost Lands: The Four Horsemen).  One last thing, I like the fact Susan wears glasses.  An unusual detail that stands out to me as both a cost to the developers and as a personal trait for the character.", "timestamp_created": 1450538989, "timestamp_updated": 1450729400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643003", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19507817": {"recommendationid": "19507817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076629224", "num_games_owned": 733, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449334438}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0430 \u043d\u0430 Nearwood, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u0432\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435. \u0418 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0446\u044b, \u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u0433\u043d\u043e\u043c-\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0435.\n\u041d\u043e \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438: \u0431\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u044f, \u0448\u0430\u0445\u0442\u044b \u0433\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0432, \u0431\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a. \u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c, \u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435\u043f\u0442\u044b \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435.\n\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 -

Lots of point and click aspects mixed in with hidden object scenes. The added Steam achievements create even more challenge if you're on a mission to collect them all. You also have a short, but still entertaining bonus chapter at the end of the main game. My biggest issue was the amount of back tracking. As one of the achievements is not use the map over five times, this leaves you endlessly going backwards then forwards a lot.

The background art is really nice; they pay plenty of attention to background details, and most of the areas are really beautiful. The models and characters are pretty decent, but them, as well as the voices given to them, suffer from lack of expression. The characters \u2018smile\u2019 by hardly moving their mouths in an upward fashion, the mother\u2019s re-encounter with her son goes only as far as a half heartfelt \u201cOh, jimmy.\u201d and overall it\u2019s just not the best. However, it\u2019s also not the worst I\u2019ve encountered, and you can kind of tell there was an attempt at giving some sort of emotional intonation to the text.\nThe cutscenes were alright too, though there were a couple \u2018transitional\u2019 ones that I\u2019m not sure were really needed. The music was nice, soft enough that I was not bothered by it, and seemed to fit the setting.\n\nThe game has various difficulties: Easy/normal/hard plus a slightly custom one as you can select how fast or slow hints take to recharge and what you want \u2018help\u2019 with or not, which was a really nice addition.\n\nOnce in, you\u2019ll find it also has many collectables to find throughout the areas in the main story, all of which were quite easy to spot - I\u2019d think this lowers the replayability quite a bit, as completionists will surely not miss them on the first play through and thus would have no reason to go back and replay it. \n\nThere are several things I really enjoyed about it: \n\n+ It has a decent map system with fast travel - clicking on a map location takes you straight to it. The map also has the typical hints of where something needs doing and where you are, as well as an added hint of where you haven\u2019t found a collectable yet (but only if you play it on easy, normal, or custom with those selected).\n\n+ There was a little \u2018pet\u2019 you find that helps you with getting certain items. I always enjoy when they add little companions because it somehow makes you not feel so \u2018alone\u2019. \n\n+ The customization choices for the difficulty (which I took full advantage of).\n\n+ The great variety of puzzles. \n\nThough most of the puzzles were a little too easy, I did enjoy playing through most of them. Lost Lands: Dark Overlord has a great variety, having only a few hidden object scenes (a couple by list, a couple by shape), some \u2018logical pair\u2019 scenes (flower with vase, etc), and puzzles ranging from slider to swapping to connecting and rearranging, to repair and/or reassemble the machine and a few recipe-based \u201cmake this item\u201d, which I really like\u2026 It kept the game fresh not to have too many repeats. \n\nAnother interesting feature was that, in some of the puzzles where you first needed to find everal of an item, you would usually find most of those together in one single location. Some you still had to find separately, of course, but not having to find every single glass shard of a stained window, for instance, was actually quite nice. \n\nSomething I would have liked to have was for more of the \u2018press things in a specific order\u2019 puzzles to have the ability to put the little piece of paper with the order nearby to see it as you could in some of the rearranging puzzles. It got a bit tiresome having to open the book every time if you couldn\u2019t recall the order.\n\nThe hidden object scenes were also rather easy, as some of the items stood out a bit too much (I seriously ended up getting at least half of them without even reading the list first). \n\nThere were no outstanding bugs through my gameplay, though my game did crash once (when I tried to switch from full screen to window in the middle of the game) and froze another time (for no reason whatsoever). Fortunately, it seems to have a pretty sturdy auto-saving system for I went back both times exactly to where I had left off and I was able to play on without major issues. \n\nThere was one thing that was a bit bothersome though, and that is: when you start the bonus chapter, on the initial sequence when she dreams about being needed, her hair is longer than on the main story; yet when she\u2019s going through the portal and afterwards her hair is shorter again (and she\u2019s wearing other clothes, too) as the cutscene was clearly reused from the main storyline. While I can see why the scene was reused, it was a bit of a sloppy thing that removed consistency in the storyline. \nI\u2019m also confused as to why the initial dream sequence seems like it\u2019s setting up the bonus as a horror story when it\u2019s not, haha. Maybe that last was just me reading too much into it, though. \n\nI was lucky to get the Collector\u2019s Edition to review. As usual, these come with a bunch of unlockable extras (wallpapers, concept art, etc), the choice to replay puzzles 8without having to replay the entire game), as well as the main story + bonus story (in which you go back to help some underwater beings from being extinct). The main story is fairly short, and the bonus is even shorter. With just around 3 hours of gameplay between both, Lost Lands: Dark Overlord might not be challenging or overly original, but it\u2019s still fun to play.\n\nI\u2019ll be looking forward to see how

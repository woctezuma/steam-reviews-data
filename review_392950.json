There are a variety of NPCs to provide dialogue to explain why you're searching each location. The puzzles have multiple settings for where objects might be hidden to provide some variety and make it less about rote memorization. Each location has an energy cost to explore that goes up as you level the location.\n\nIn addition to the HOPs, there are several different puzzles for the opening of four different types of chests. Chests, which also use energy, contain various types of objects that either provide access to locations, unlock boost locations, or complete collections. Most of the collections are parts of quests, though not all.\n\nIf it were *just* an HOP game with some tweaks, I'd give it a solid 9 rating.\n\nHowever....\n\nThis is a fremium game, and the puzzles are gated by energy, the standard roadblock of fremium games everywhere. \n\nThat said, as of yet I haven't run into any actual paywalls, just the frustration of having to stop just as I'm getting on a roll.\n\nThe energy recharges a bit slowly for the energy costs to explore locations, but you can still play a couple of times per day. Energy can be restored by using items that provide additional energy and are sometimes rewarded for completing quests or objectives.\n\nThere are also various non-HOP locations that can be repaired provided you have enough of the necessary materials, which are given as rewards as well as acquired through the opening of chests. Some locations increase your maximum energy, others increase the speed at which it recharges or reduce the time required, while some provide various types of items.\n\nOne type of item that can be acquired a variety of ways are access keys. Some of the locations require that you have items in order to access them. This is a bit of a roadblock at first, but I've found that after a while, you end up with a surplus of the item in question and it stops being an issue.\n\nThe graphics are standard and display well, and the music is pleasant without being obtrusive or jarring. The sound effects for interacting with creatures can get a little repetitive if you have a mission to deal with more than just a few of them. Also, the intro dialogue will start playing every time you launch the game, though it is skippable.\n\nAlso, there is an audio glitch that happens to me every so often where the volume is much louder than I've set it. If I stop and restart, it then plays at the correct level.\n\nAltogether, a solid HOP+ game stuffed into an irritating but not game-stopping fremium framework.\n\nPros:\nSolid HOP gameplay\nItem locations vary within sets\nA few other puzzles for additional variety\n\nCons:\nEnergy required to do almost anything\nLocations gated by items to encourage spending money\nSome sounds can be repetitive\n\nFinal Score: 7.5", "timestamp_created": 1520906319, "timestamp_updated": 1520906319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40775645": {"recommendationid": "40775645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119481337", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 369, "last_played": 1521247961}, "language": "german", "review": "Netter Zeitvertreib, nur die Energie ist zu schnell leer.", "timestamp_created": 1520896771, "timestamp_updated": 1520896771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40769772": {"recommendationid": "40769772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134811939", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 458, "last_played": 1521775562}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

purturbed spirl of disapointment.

After you master all locations the collection drops from locations seem to suck. Plus after completing all the quest, the game play becomes a few levels of boring and you lose sight of the thing that kept you playing it.\n\nOver all, I did not spend an absolute dime on the game to get as far as I did. I would go farther if the game allowed, due to whatever kept me playing.  Ya, as you progressed through the game they up the anti- as you gain levels, so does everything else. Longer energy refill times, more energy needed to gain entry into locations. I am sad to say that without additional quest/locations/collections the thrill of the play is gone... gone...gone.\n\nBy the way... To those who are intrested in playing the game...

The game shows a high standard of art and contains an array of puzzle types to keep it varied and interesting.\nAs a casual game it shows the usual techniques to keep players returning, from daily log in rewards to energy points that replenish over a set period.\nAs a free to play game, and a single player game, it doesn't require you to spend money unless you are impatient and want to progress faster. Of course this impatience requires you to spend more as you progress and I assume this is how they allow the game to make money. It feels more like a mobile phone game with this feature than a steam game but nevertheless the gem packages are not so intrusive as to be annoying. What is annoying is the highly intrusive marketing for BN-Games's paid games, with no option to remove this. It flashes at you at the beginning of the game and demands you must click on it before moving on into the rest of the game. There is no option to remove it.\n\nThe artwork is usually gorgeous and the environment and locals are beuatifully staged with a variety of positions for each object and the objects have various forms that allows them to blend into the background.\nThe character portraits are slightly weird though. The character anatomy is poor (especially on the female characters) and the movement is unnatural and unsettling rather than more close to life.\n\nThe puzzles are delivered in the form of chests to unlock, and exhibit a variety of types lifted straight from mobile games. This is not a bad thing though as it is pleasant to have the different types to change the game every now and then, and choose a different skill to exercise. \n\nThe story is apparently unfinished, with no support seeming to come from the game developers to continue it further, however the games content as it is, holds plenty since progression is fairly slow (I didn't pay to progress). This might be the major factor not to recommend the game, that is is indeed quite slow and in doing so may feel repetitive despite having strategies implemented into its design to prevent this.\n\nAs a free-to-play game I definitely recommend this despite the various flaws.\n", "timestamp_created": 1518759999, "timestamp_updated": 1518759999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40094380": {"recommendationid": "40094380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029586957", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519629087}, "language": "czech", "review": "Dobr\u00fd", "timestamp_created": 1518678784, "timestamp_updated": 1518678784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40078022": {"recommendationid": "40078022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082041369", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 194, "last_played": 1521665646}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this is my first puzzle game on Steam, and it's quite catchy", "timestamp_created": 1518645477, "timestamp_updated": 1518645477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40054844": {"recommendationid": "40054844", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987351248", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 786, "last_played": 1521780125}, "language": "english", "review": "so far so good.

I will say that I like the game, the plot is good, the maps(?) are interresting and detailed. Items normally, but not always (I am looking at you fountain), appear in places that make sense for them to be there. The missions are simple to figure out and if you forget there is a goto you can use to do whatever is next.\nThe problems that stop me from giving a higher mental rating are first the energy system.\nGiving the game a night to recharge   EDIT (A full night to recharge is not enough once you get about half way through) END EDIT   will mean something like three maps before you have to wait again. This is the main (maybe only) way that the game lasts more than a few days at most to complete (I admittedly have not finished the game but if my progress with the energy system is any indication just by official time played alone I should have long finished the game). I hate the energy system, it is an annoying gimic that prolongs the game and has absolutely no benifit whatso ever.\nThe other problems are less pervassive and mostly easy to over look. So problem two is that some items leave a \"shadow\" the biggest offender so far is the slingshot at the fisherman's hut. Basically what happens is the items have multiple spots they show up, sometime an item will appear in a secondary spot but leave in the main spot a less clear but still able to identify image. While annoying it is not as bad as the main problem. \nProblem three is two parts, in the game there is more than one way to find out what you are searching for, by name and by shadow outline. The shadows are confusing some of them you could swear are not what they are supposed to be (pumpkin, skeleton and what ever that plant is) as it is a shadow outline what you think is a container or at least a cyclinder will turn out to be something completely different. (The skeleton looks nothing like its outline, there is no way aroung that one.)  The problem (easily argued a feature) with the names is that certain items which make sense in context also have the same name as completely different items. What this means is that you may be looking for an item that you have seen in other parts of the game, then after not finding it and time running out use an item which is difficult to get without paying real money and find out that the thing that you have glanced right past multiple times (and looks nothing like waht you were looking for) is the item you need. The name is valid and not even unusual it just trips you brecause you have been looking for the other item all this time then suddenly get this other thing instead.\nThe game also experiences freezes when they try to sell you stuff. Leaving the game either by opening something else or just waiting is enough for it to fix itself but it is still annoying. \n\nFinal say is that it is an OK game, just scrap the energy and the game freezeing sales and good to go.

Yes, it is free but after some time it just turns into an annoying grind that repeats the same picture over and over and over and over again.\n\nCurrent sample:\nI had to visit the smithy twice at night. Now there are three modes and night mode is rare (or maybe it just feels that way because the two other modes look pretty similar) so you have to visit the smithy a lot to get the two night visits. When that one finished it immediately opened a quest to now visit the smithy four times during the day. Luckily the next four visits all were in day mode (illustrating the rarity of night mode). So now I get a quest to visit the dwarfen castle. To unlock it I need a medaillon which I only get from - again - the smithy. So one more visit.\nThese repeat visits wouldn't be so bad, BUT: to actually visit the smithy you each time need to bring two pieces of coal. Coal you only get from the stone quarry or the old town or that one monster whose weapon is the most expensive or the one box whose riddle I am not good at. Now doing any of those doesn't grant you a piece of coal. So you maybe need to visit one place 3-4 times to get one piece of coal. So for visiting the smithy one time you first have to visit the old town (lowest energy costs) 5-6 times for those two pieces of coal. I had to visit the smithy now 15 times in a row in quests which means I had to visit the stone quarry / old town about 100 times. Both areas are level 5 by now (even though my steam achievements don't show it) and they repeat the same few hidden object games. This is no challenge anymore. It's just boring. I know were every object is. The only good thing about it was that I now have so much building material that I immediately could repair the building producing a piece of coal every 8 hours. The only two building materials that I don't have enough are ropes and nails. Otherwise I could repair the entire island.\n\nThe only good thing to say is that it is free. But the whole way this game is designed is to encourage you to spend real money to move a bit forward. The 30 pieces of coal I needed for the 15 visits to the smithy would cost 30 crystals which in RL currency is 2,67\u20ac. And I really caught myself about thinking to spend this money just to escape every day looking at the same few things. Then I remembered that right after the coals there are the arrows I need to access another area and until I unlock it I don't yet know what I will need to actually access the dwarfen castle. So it's 3\u20ac here and 3\u20ac there until suddenly you have spend more on this free game than on games with a real story. \n\nBecause that is another minus point. The story sucks. It was interesting at first but by now it is more like \"hey, I have opened this zoo for animals so please go and catch this dragon or this fish, oh and each time you visit bring two pieces of meat\". There was a time when meat was rare and I had troubles accessing the area, but because the old town also gives you meat I now would also have enough to visit that place 15 times. Also in those times of having troubles getting meat I repaired the slaughterhouse that gives you one piece of meat every 8 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1507123416, "timestamp_updated": 1508231359, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35470066": {"recommendationid": "35470066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198428939751", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 28012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516213363}, "language": "romanian", "review": "....", "timestamp_created": 1507119774, "timestamp_updated": 1507119774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35467355": {"recommendationid": "35467355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220114895", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 229, "last_played": 1521778066}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting game If you like looking for hidden objects to finish quests.

Il ne repose pas sur le m\u00eame principe de jeu d'aventure m\u00ealant point&click et \u00e9nigmes.\n\n\nC'est l'histoire d'une ville elfe qui vit en paix depuis des si\u00e8cles quand un jour le mal s'abat sur elle sous la forme de nuages noirs. Les habitants d\u00e9sertent et parcourent les oc\u00e9ans \u00e0 la recherche d'un nouveau lieu de vie mais ils traversent d'impitoyables temp\u00eates dont seuls quelques survivants en r\u00e9chappent et \u00e9chouent sur une \u00eele d\u00e9serte. Ils ont avec eux un sarcophage qui, selon la l\u00e9gende, renferme l'Elu qui saura sauver son peuple de sa terrible destin\u00e9e le temps venu. C'est alors qu'il se r\u00e9veille...\n\nC'est apr\u00e8s cette introduction que commence le jeu et on se retrouve avec \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran une vue a\u00e9rienne sur un village dans ce qui ressemble \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e0 un petit jeu de strat\u00e9gie ou de gestion de ressources.\nOn a un capital de pi\u00e8ces d'or et de cristaux, des points d'XP, un niveau, une jauge d'\u00e9nergie. On a \u00e9galement acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un grand inventaire divis\u00e9s en plusieurs cat\u00e9gories (potion d'\u00e9nergie, coffres, amulettes, cl\u00e9s, outils, armes).\n\nCertains b\u00e2timents du village sont inaccessibles car ils n\u00e9cessitent d'atteindre au pr\u00e9lable un niveau minimum, d'autres peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9s/construits si on poss\u00e8de les objets requis et on peut explorer les autres si on a un niveau suffisant d'\u00e9nergie.\n\nL'exploration d'un lieu consiste en une SOC (avec liste de mots ou de silhouettes) en temps limit\u00e9. On a des bonus \u00e0 disposition en cas de besoin (indiquer un objet, d\u00e9voiler tous les objets ou b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire). Plus on la termine rapidement, plus on gagne d'XP. Une fois compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, on gagne un objet et le lieu passe un niveau d'am\u00e9lioration.\n\nIl s'agit donc bien de collecter divers objets, de g\u00e9rer l'XP et l'argent \u00e0 disposition et de d\u00e9bloquer progressivement de nouveaux lieux et de nouveaux objets. Il y a toute une liste de choses \u00e0 trouver pour confectionner ou obtenir en \u00e9change d'autres artefacts. Il y a aussi la possibilit\u00e9 de faire des achats \u00e0 la boutique selon notre budget \u00e0 disposition.\n\n\nPr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme \u00e7a, le jeu peut sembler sympa, surtout pour un titre gratuit. Mais une fois pass\u00e9es les premi\u00e8res minutes \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir le gameplay, c'est la douche froide!\n\nOn d\u00e9pense de l'\u00e9nergie lors de chaque action et elle ne peut \u00eatre remont\u00e9e que de 4 fa\u00e7ons :\na) Avoir recours \u00e0 une potion de  notre inventaire.\nb) Utiliser les cristaux en notre possession pour acheter des potions \u00e0 la boutique. Mais une fois d\u00e9pens\u00e9s les cristaux dont on dispose au d\u00e9part, il faut forc\u00e9ment... d\u00e9penser de l'\u00e9nergie pour en gagner d'autres....\nc) Payer avec de l'argent r\u00e9el !\nd) Attendre que l'\u00e9nergie remonte automatiquement et gratuitement. Lentement. Tr\u00e8s lentement. Tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s lentement.\n\nEvidemment, nos potions sont vite consomm\u00e9es et nos cristaux enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9pens\u00e9s.

The chests have some fun little mini-games required to open them so that hidden object scenes are not the only puzzles you get to play.\n\nIt does take a few days or so to get the hang of how the game plays out, but as it is free to try, there is no reason not to give it a whirl and see if this title is for you.

A lot of people will probably get put off by the fact that you have to wait for you energy to refill before you can take an action, so you'll have to regularly revisit the game for relatively short amounts of time at a go to get anywhere. You can bypass this by investing actual coin in the game, which I guess is the point: having a game where you can plausibly make progress by putting a lot of time into it whilst at the same time not being so satisfying that you wouldn't not be tempted to throw money at it. Personally I felt that the game went a little bit over the line with pushing the money option. At one point I had about five limited time offers ticking away on my screen...\n\nBeyond time wasting the game isn't exactly balanced. Progressing through the game you can unlock sixteen different hidden object game locations. These are challenging the first time or two, but after repeating them numerous times you get used to where the different objects are hidden, and they can easily be completed with full points and time to spare. Even the first few times mostly aren't that difficult because you amass plenty of 'tools' that will help you solve these puzzles. I even ended up using dozens of surplus tools [b]just[/b] so that I could get the tool use achievement.\n\nIn addition to the hidden object portion, there are also about seven different chest opening minigames with difficulties ranging from solve instantly/solve every time to pretty much impossible. There was one variety of minigame that most of the time I could only solve using a minigame skip tool (but you could also look up the solutions in the game guides on Steam). \n\nProbably my favourite part of the game was progressing through the story. With each location that you unlock a new character who will give you quests. Unfortunately you're only able to see these characters when they give you quests and for some reason, though most of the characters do have names, they're only tagged with their job/race descriptions (e.g. Hunter, Healer, Fairy, etc). I think that it would have been great if there was an in-game journal or cast page to give a bit more access to the flavour text side of things, otherwise it's just screencap it or forget it.\n\nReally there's not much all the [i]objectionable[/i] about the game, but I would say that it's probably not worth the time that you need to invest in it. I wouldn't have invested so much time myself if not for the fact that I'd already invested plenty of time in it and wanted to see it through. ^_^;", "timestamp_created": 1499248756, "timestamp_updated": 1499248756, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33259699": {"recommendationid": "33259699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204768017", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513778039}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game to relax!", "timestamp_created": 1499228223, "timestamp_updated": 1499228223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33237725": {"recommendationid": "33237725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001676243", "num_games_owned": 1386, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "last_played": 1521733129}, "language": "english", "review": "I wasn't really sure what to expect from a F2P hidden object adventure game, but it seems to be done fairly well. The objectives are easy to track, and the HO scenes get rearranged once you've done an area enough to level it up a couple of times. There are also variations to the scenes as well, which makes doing the same few scenes repeatedly in the early game more interesting than it sounds. The art and the music are both good as well.\n\nBecause it is a F2P game, it does have grinding elements and timers. So far in my play time I haven't really found the grinding to be punishing. Each scene location and each wandering enemy have specific rewards that you can get from them that are clearly listed. Additionally, when looking at the list of things you need for an objective, clicking on something you don't have will show you everywhere you can get that item. I've also found so far that rewards seem to prioritize items that you need for an objective. As for the timers, they don't seem particularly punishing either. You have an energy meter with the maximum amount of energy being determined by your level. Each scene and each enemy use a specified amount of energy and your energy slowly regenerates over time. Your energy also gets automatically refilled when you level up. While the regeneration of energy is rather slow, it's not unreasonable for a F2P game. If you don't want to pay for energy renewing items, you just need to do something else for a while and you'll have a full bar again.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes hidden object adventures and is fine with not being able to just blaze through everything in a sitting or two like most non-F2P HO games.", "timestamp_created": 1499185686, "timestamp_updated": 1499185686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33227013": {"recommendationid": "33227013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326299758", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501438270}, "language": "english", "review": "Tons of new stuff to unlock.

Anfangs 2 Minuten, jetzt bereits 5 f\u00fcr einen Energiepunkt bei einem Maximum von 150 (150*5)/60=12,5 Stunden um den Balken voll zu bekommen. \n-Schamloser Cashgrab\n-RICHTIG schamloser Cashgrab\n\nFazit:\nExtrem langwieriger und langweiliger Tablet-Wimmelbild-Kram mit vielleicht 45 Minuten Spielzeit pro Tag. Mal abgesehen von der zeitlichen Begrenzung in den Wimmelbildern und Minispielen gibt es quasi keine Herausforderung. Man klickt vielleicht 5-10 Wimmelbilder pro voller Energieleiste durch und sammelt in den ewig selben Maps die gleichen Items und bekommt dann zuf\u00e4llig Rohstoffe, die man dutzendfach braucht um die Wartezeiten marginal zu verk\u00fcrzen. W\u00e4hrenddessen wird irgendwo eine Story erz\u00e4hlt, die man aber leider bei der ganzen Wartezeit schnell wieder vergisst. Irgendwas mit einem Elfenk\u00f6nig der von der Insel runter will? Ja irgendwas in die Richtung war es. Nur was f\u00fcr Leute die viel Geduld und sonst alle Wimmelbildspiele auf Steam durchgespielt haben, alternativ nur was f\u00fcr Menschen die gerne Geld f\u00fcr M\u00fcll bezahlen wollen. \n\n#Extratipp\nEinfach, wenn die Energieleiste leer ist, das Datum in eurem Windows um einen Tag nach vorne Stellen und schon k\u00f6nnt ihr weiter machen.

The first time is usually impossible to beat, but it gets easier as you become familiar with it. Playing these scenes earns you items which are required to complete quests and unlock new areas. Finding a treasure chest allows you to play a different minigame with logical elements, to unlock the chest.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are weak in content compared to others I've played, and are more challenging due to the short time you have to finish.\n\nThis game uses a facebook-type energy system which forces you to quit after completing a certain number of actions, and wait until your energy replenishes over time. This makes the game enormously frustrating because you can't play as long as you want.

It's not horrible, but it's not great either. It is free, thank goodness, and it's an ok time waster, however the energy system leaves a LOT to be desired. You will average about 4 hidden object scenes before you are out of energy; give or take a few depending on how far you have maxed out your energy bar. I think my biggest gripe about this game, though, is that the hidden object scenes are timed...yep, you read that correctly...they...are...timed. Now, from what I've gathered about most of us HOG players, we don't really want to be rushed. Add to that the fact that the graphics aren't so great, and some of the items you are looking for are TINY, well, it turns into a bit of a rushed, not so fun adventure. \n\nPROS:\n*Storyline\n*FREE ( best pro ever :) )\n*Different types of HOG's (Silhouettes, Night-time, etc.)\n*More than just HOG's ( puzzles, quests, non-combat monster kills, etc.)\n\nCONS:\n*Energy System\n*Timed Hidden Object and Puzzle scenes\n*Hard to find objects in the Hidden Object scenes ( could just be my computer, as I'm on a laptop, but I can't discount it.)\n*Too much hand-holding during the tutorial, including making you spend hints and blue gems (premium currency) with no way to opt out\n\nAll in all, it's a free game folks, so if you can get past the fact that you will only play around 10- 15 minutes at a time ( for free) then it's not all that bad. I will continue playing to see if my mind changes, but at this point I'm going to have to stick with a Not Recommended, mainly for the timed scenes, no way to bypass the energy system ( like letting us pay an amount to \"buy\" the game) and most of all, the tutorial that forced me to spend a hint and premium currency...that's a no-no in my book. It should be up to the player whether they need that much of a tutorial or not, thank you very much developers.

It has some other puzzles as well (and they are quite a lot of fun!), nevertheless it's the same story you hear in other games like this: to play you need energy, to get energy you need to wait, if you don't want to wait - you have to buy in-game currencies. \n\nAs in many cases, it's actually a really fun game... when you can play it (and for the first couple of hours you can play it for quite a long time without many pauses, what can get addicting). But for most of the time, you can spend on it only a couple of minutes and then wait half a day or even a day before you can play again. The game obviously uses a lot of mechanisms trying to lure you into buying additional energy, but you would have to spend hundreds of dollars to actually get to the end of the game.\n\nThe main problem I have is the endgame. The costs of making various actions get insane and dice rolls such as \"will I get an item I'm looking for?\" are getting crucial and unpleasant. The most annoying part are the missions such as \"explore area X 5 times during a night\". But since the game never lets you know if it's a night or a daytime, it, again, is just a bunch of frustrating rolls and misses. \n\nIt could have been a fantastic game if it would be redesigned into a single 10-20 USD purchase and would let you play as long as you want.\n\nBut since it's freemium and uses all the bs freemium mechanics designed to make a profit out of 5% of the playerbase, it constantly suffers from the needless limitations. \n\nI didn't get to the end of the game. I got bored.\n\nEven though the core story idea was pretty fun, silly but self-conscious as well. And it had some beautiful graphics.

I like the building experience points and correlating difficulty of the game, and i love the collections required to repair things/get things done. I do NOT like that I just started playing twenty minutes ago, and I'm constantly running out of energy (points needed to play a level). Couple that with the fact that I need diamonds, not gold, to buy items to replenish energy, and it makes me think I won't play this game much more. There doesn't seem to be a way to convert my seemingly-useless gold into diamonds, so I'm supposed to spend real money on them, or wait for my energy to replenish?? There are so many facets of this game that are incremental that work to enrich the experience, but having an energy bar isn't one of them. It replenishes so slowly over time, it seems the point is to turn the game off. I understand that I'll get rewards for coming back day after day, but I'd really appreciate playing for a more than a half hour at a time. \n\nSo in reality it seems this \"Free-to-play\" game should be labeled \"Pay-to-play\", if you have more of an attention span than a ten year old.

This way the player doesn't get bored, even though the very nature of this genre is repetitive.\nThe game itself is quite high class. As you can see on the screenshots, the colors, the contrast and the object placing are very good. This means fun and not mindless pixel- hunting.\np.s.: there are also quite a few puzzles, too (9th and 12th screenshot, e.g.).

By that I mean- in the time it will take to unlock achievements (in free to play - and probably even pay to play) you could have instead been able to have finished a long game of say: Assassins Creed or a Final Fantasy game (including the extras/bonuses)! So - it's laid out like a casual game - but if you're hoping to unlock achievements it becomes more of a time waster and the opposite of a casual game. It can literally take about 50 hours to unlock just one of the achievements- check out the global statistics to see how many people noped out of completing the game because of the crazy amount of game play you have to wrack up to feel like you've achieved anything. And the extra elements of new locations aren't quite unique enough to keep you interested by that point.\n\nBut if you love hidden objects games and find a lot of them too short for you this can be your answer to that- as this game is pretty much impossibly long considering how simple it is. I'd recommend checking out a steam walkthrough for some of the treasure chest puzzles (as some are a lot more difficult than others)  and maybe a walkthrough on how to best make use of your energy so you can be smarter about how you use it.\n\nIt's games like these that make you wish there was a 'maybe recommend' button instead of yes or no. Similar to other games by this group they are designed to take a long time to fully complete - but in the end I would probably say a storyline based RPG would be much more engaging than spending time on this game. Get out while you still can :O - like Candy Crush this is designed to look like a simple casual game but it just doesn't seem to end.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n* A hidden objects game that you won't find too short.\n* At first with the energy limitations it's paced out slowly enough that you won't get bored straight away.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n* It tries to have a storyline but I'm unsure if it's even possible to get an ending because by the way it looks it seems like you'd need to get 150 hours of gameplay to get there.

As a supposed 'free' game that requires 'in-game' purchases it is clear that the developers of this game don't want people to play if they're not willing to spend money. Ironically, I'd be fine purchasing this game for a few dollars outright--but I absolutely won't get sucked into spending money on an ongoing basis simply for a hidden object game. And, after a few days of play, it is obvious that the developers of this game  have coded it in such a way that if you don't spend money, eventually you stop getting credit for your game play. You can still 'play' but you can't progress. As of day 4, I stopped getting credit for any solved 'quests'. I thought it was just a temporary glitch. As of day 5, when I logged in, the daily bonus counter said that now I was only on 'day 2' and gave me bonuses only for that day - even though the day before I had been on day 4.  Finally, I should've known better and been wary about any game whose nerdy and clearly socially inept developers designed the images of women so they look like something right out of a porn movie.

Another negative is that when you move up in levels, which opens new areas to explore, it requires certain items to unlock these areas. Most of these items require chrystals to get them.

You want the double energy for a day to prolong? not going to happen, wait out the entire day!\nEvery level nets you an offer to pay 10 bucks for useless items, that stays on for 24 hours.\nAchievements are terrible, not just LOOOOOOOOOOOONG, but also, completely spaced out. Finished all the area's. Now go kill 150 out of the required 200 kills on each monster.\n(reading the last few reviews also: The game is a little bit easy. as in: When I finished the entire game, I had once actually managed to time out a hidden object scene. Also, there are many \"helpful\" things, such as hints to where things are. They build up fast, since you don't need them (but they have achievements, so just click on use anyway, since...dumb achievements)\nAll items have the uncanny ability to take some time popping up. Chests give you time to click on another creature, then when you try to cancel them, open the chest instead, certain items that find objects for you, are \"wasted\" because you click on it and all items it found the first item use, are mysteriously still in transit and \"found again\".

Man sollte sich t\u00e4glich ca 1 bis 2 mal Mindestens anmelden um gro\u00df weiterzukommen, aber das st\u00f6rt nicht.\n\nF\u00fcr ein einfaches, kostenloses Spiel ist das sch\u00f6n gemacht, tolle Musik und sch\u00f6ne Grafik. \nMan Wimmelt auf Zeit, aber man muss immer wieder die selben Gegenst\u00e4nde finden und nach einer Zeit hat man sich die Position der Gegenst\u00e4nde auch eingepr\u00e4gt.\n\nZwischendurch findet man auch verschlossene Kisten und Schatullen, die man nur durch knifflige R\u00e4tsel \u00f6ffnen kann.\n\nFazit: F\u00fcr ein Free to Play Spiel ganz gut gemacht.

Like all energy based games, patiences is the key.  Following are a few tips that may be usefull :\n\n[u]Cash Items[/u]\nIf you want to spend money on it (wich is fine, devs gotta live, right?), I'd recommend the hint giving item so you learn every object location in every stage. [strike]There seem to be about two image placement type per location.[/strike]  Playing the game this way will help you build your memory, and speed up your process.  Avoid spending money on energy as it replenish over time and at level-up.  Your energy also increase by 10 at each level-up.  There are a few structures that act as free level-up, or that decrease the energy cooldown.\n(edit : my bad, more then two item placement layout, but those come later when you \"level-up\" a location.  the number is still fixed so initial comment still hold.)\n(edit : when I mean speed up you process, I mean it... actual locations take a few tens of seconds at most when you get around to it)\n\n[u]Play regularly, but briefly[/u]\nPlay this three times a day (morning, lunch and evening), or more if you have the time, then switch to something else while your energy build back up. There are also structures you may repair that will yield various bonus (experience, energy, building materials, chest, etc) after a specific amount of time.\n\n[u]Be smart about leveling-up[/u]\nLeveling up fully refill your energy (anyone is getting the MAA feeling yet?).  It may be good to delay (waiting on quest rewards) or speed up (kill a few mobs) your leveling depending on your remaining energy and/or time left to play.\n\n[u]Did someone say puzzle?[/u]\nOne of the best part of the game are the chests. They also need a small amout of energy to use, but unlike location, the cost does not increase with continuous success. They will contain various type of loot depending on the type.  The puzzles (mini-game) involved in opening them are fun and all involve spatial cognition, such as : linking dots of various color without crossing them, moving stones to let something through, linking gems with a beam of light, etc.  They are somewhat easy, but made more challenging by the time limit you have.\n\n[u]Loot[/u]\nIf you understand the basics of the game, including leveling up locations (they will give one additional drop per level, up to +5 from the basic 1... at least that's my guess for now), you'll find it's not that grindy of a game.  Use the structures and log in reapedly briefly (as stated above) to maximize your profit.\n\n[u]A word on achievement[/u]\nYes, they seem to be more difficult to get then it's Mahjong counterpart.

Nicht nur das langsame Aufladen der Energie (wovon man im sp\u00e4teren Spiel immer mehr braucht) und die daraus resultierende immer l\u00e4ngere Wartezeit zum vervollst\u00e4ndigen der Aufgaben, sondern die inzwischen auch ziemlich aufdringliche Werbung beim Starten des Spiels und auch im Spiel selbst st\u00f6ren mich doch erheblich. Das Ganze h\u00e4tte man anders l\u00f6sen k\u00f6nnen, aber nun ja\u2026.\n\nDas Spiel an sich finde ich pers\u00f6nlich sch\u00f6n gemacht; man befindet sich auf einer Insel und kann erst nur einige wenige Orte erforschen, bis man nach einigen Quests weitere Orte freischalten kann. Dazu spawnen auch nach und nach verschiedene Monster auf der Karte, die man mit speziellen Waffen \u201abek\u00e4mpfen\u2018 kann. Auch kann man Truhen finden und durch ein kleines Minispiel \u00f6ffnen.\nMan bekommt mit der Zeit verschiedene Items f\u00fcr das Erforschen von Orten, durch das Besiegen von Monstern oder indem man Truhen \u00f6ffnet. Mit diesen Items kann man wiederum Sammlungen vervollst\u00e4ndigen (ist auch des \u00d6fteren mal eine Questaufgabe) und bekommt Belohnungen in Form von Gold, Erfahrungspunkten und/oder diversen Gegenst\u00e4nden, die einem das Spiel f\u00fcr kurze Zeit erleichtern.\n\nLeider kostet Orte erforschen und Truhen \u00f6ffnen Energie, und das nicht zu knapp. Dazu erh\u00f6ht sich der Bedarf an ben\u00f6tigter Energie jeweils um 5, je \u00f6fter man einen Ort erforscht. Die Quests, die man l\u00f6sen muss, beinhalten dann auch noch Aufgaben wie \u201eErforsche diesen Ort f\u00fcnf Mal\u201c oder \u201eBesiege dieses Monster zehn Mal\u201c. Dann hei\u00dft es warten, bis sich die ben\u00f6tigte Energie wieder aufgeladen hat, was allerdings nur sehr langsam passiert (ca. 20 Energiepunkte in einer Stunde).\n\nEs gibt nat\u00fcrlich auch Gegenst\u00e4nde, die die Energie zumindest zum Teil wieder aufladen k\u00f6nnen, jedoch sind diese nicht gerade leicht zu bekommen und kosten als Ingame-W\u00e4hrung Kristalle. Davon bekommt man bei einem Levelaufstieg 5, und wenn man sich brav t\u00e4glich einloggt, nach den ersten f\u00fcnf Tagen 6 (danach alle sieben Tage). Und nat\u00fcrlich kann man sich die Kristalle dann auch f\u00fcr echtes Geld kaufen, wenn man denn gewillt ist.\n\nAnsonsten hei\u00dft es warten, bis man wieder gen\u00fcgend Energie zusammen hat, um die n\u00e4chste Aufgabe zu l\u00f6sen\u2026\n", "timestamp_created": 1461423998, "timestamp_updated": 1461423998, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526815", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22587814": {"recommendationid": "22587814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272681988", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462647531}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo legal", "timestamp_created": 1461418317, "timestamp_updated": 1461418317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22585095": {"recommendationid": "22585095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078298197", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482554096}, "language": "english", "review": "Good!", "timestamp_created": 1461408807, "timestamp_updated": 1461408807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22583884": {"recommendationid": "22583884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006942690", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461492098}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very pretty point and click game.

However, here, you take in your hands the destiny of the Elven Nation, crashed on a lost island, rebuilding their civilization and ready to set sail elsewhere if only a magical storm wasn't preventing them to do so.\n\nThis is the first free-to-play released by Five-BN. The second one, Lost Lands: Mahjong, shares the same story, the same quests and the same mechanics. It means that apart the core gameplay (hidden objects - mahjong), nothing changed when the second was released. I've played Mahjong first because I love the solitaire version of this game and A Hidden Object Adventure came after. It also means that the majority of this review will be identical to the one I did for Mahjong.\n\nThe gameplay itself is to find objects in different locations: a list of words, a list of shapes, with also a cycle of day and night as some quests required a \"night\", in other words, the scene will be only partially visible, as if you were carrying a torch. Generally, the scenes can be done easily, even if objects are changing places. It's pretty rare to be out of time.\n\nQuests, while needing explorations for anything (weapons, tools, ressources, etc..), can also involve \"fights\" with enemies, repairing buildings or using tools. Also, the more you're earning experience, the more you're leveling up and the more you're unlocking. There are also chests you can open, with various minigames (and not always easy). Everything is timed and the explorations, as the chests, cost energy.\n\nAnd that's bothering me, the energy regenerating slowly unless you buy some potions with the crystals you're earning. Crystals are pretty rare but there is the easy way: spent real money to acquire them (or to acquire more golds). Gold is mainly used for weapons for example. Here's an idea for the cost: 10 crystals = 0.88 euros - I've checked the next price and it's already nearing 10 euros). \n\nI don't mind having quests to do and I don't mind the level up system to access new locations. Even the shop isn't really bothering, as far as you can use the gold you're earning. However, preventing me to play a game because of a decreased energy on Steam, that's something I can't imagine. For me, that kind of gameplay is reminding me of my Facebook games time. Weirdly enough, it would have been on Facebook, I would have find it normal. Here, on Steam, I'm not at ease with the concept. Ubisoft released games about CSI and Assassin's Creed on Facebook, yet, the main series were totally different.\n\nYou'll probably find it weird that I'm bothered by the Facebook-like when the game is a free-to-play and that the concept of the energy is also there to push you to buy some (the game is also released on Android and iOS devices). But that's my feeling. Many people will feel that they're trapped and will want to advance. However, I tend to use a simple thought to avoid spending money: there is no rush. You're there for fun (I'm not reading the story though).\n\nAs for the rest, the graphics are acceptable and pleasant, the soundtrack being the same. If you played any other Lost Lands, you'll be in an familiar setting.\n\nAs I love hidden objects, I can overcome easily the energy bar and the game is still enjoyable. It's free basically, so try it but DON'T FALL INTO THE \"NEED ENERGY\" TRAP. If there are indeed micro-transactions, don't fall in that pit of addiction. You don't need to go forward immediately. Just quit the game and come back later. It's the best way to play these kind of games, because after all, you're not going to be attacked by another player, your quests aren't timed and besides, why would you rush?\n\nLast for all, why did I thumb up both games when only the gameplay changed?

\nyou're better off just paying for a game with some decent reviews than to play this one for free, unless you're only interested in some hidden object scenes and only want to do a few every day.\n\nPro:\nYou need to search different areas and look for the listed objects within a certain amount of time. It is nice that sometimes the objects change place or you get different items to look for as the quests require you to search the same area over and over again. \n\nCons: \n-It's free to play so enter the micro-transactions! It would be nicer to just pay for a game and getting to enjoy it.\n-every hidden object scene costs \"energy\" (at least 20). Considering it takes a whopping 5 hours to restore 100 energy you are initially given you won't be playing this game for that long per session.\n-it even costs energy to open a chest, which is an actual reward after a hidden object scene!\n-quests usually require you to collect items you get as rewards but you don't always get your item or you only get 1 while your quest requires 5. Imagine a quest that requires you to get 5x \"nails\", 5x \"wooden board\", 3x \"rope\". Your quest will take days.\n-There is no other thing to do here than hidden object scenes (oh and waiting offcourse)\n", "timestamp_created": 1458074814, "timestamp_updated": 1458074814, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21858648": {"recommendationid": "21858648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072943355", "num_games_owned": 413, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461499621}, "language": "russian", "review": "You can pass the time.", "timestamp_created": 1458074147, "timestamp_updated": 1458074147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21857572": {"recommendationid": "21857572", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971655436", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "last_played": 1521461697}, "language": "french", "review": "fun to play", "timestamp_created": 1458070148, "timestamp_updated": 1458070148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21857180": {"recommendationid": "21857180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031883026", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476987067}, "language": "russian", "review": "2", "timestamp_created": 1458068670, "timestamp_updated": 1458068670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21856238": {"recommendationid": "21856238", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967685186", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458662303}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, like that it has more to do than just find hidden objects", "timestamp_created": 1458065324, "timestamp_updated": 1458065324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21853154": {"recommendationid": "21853154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279564822", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506787565}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun  game to pass the time.\n", "timestamp_created": 1458053896, "timestamp_updated": 1458053896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21852721": {"recommendationid": "21852721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065660528", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475699575}, "language": "english", "review": "addictive", "timestamp_created": 1458052263, "timestamp_updated": 1458052263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21852160": {"recommendationid": "21852160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028467855", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463150305}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent", "timestamp_created": 1458049760, "timestamp_updated": 1458049760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21850909": {"recommendationid": "21850909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127412511", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458825315}, "language": "english", "review": "its alright!", "timestamp_created": 1458043702, "timestamp_updated": 1458043702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21850469": {"recommendationid": "21850469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192964249", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460752274}, "language": "german", "review": "Gutes Spiel...

I dont know who would apriciate a counter above his or hers  head while he or she is tryng to play somthing. The game is very good -especially the option to reproduce gems and gold by quests suprised me pleasantly -only to disapoint me even more when i hit the paywall of it. What i really dont like is it takes real money to be able to participate in the game and progress normaly in it that is a huge downfall for this game, there is the option to wait and all but that takes ages (to make you pay). A very well made game and i hope it will get a better gameplay concept then actual paying for another step or time in the game. But still there is alot of effort putten into it and the makers are obviously looking for a way to earn their invested money back and profit at the same time-which is normal.- But basing the whole gameplay on that is rather to say the least anyoing to players that are actually interested in this game, and undermines the real value or enjoyment of the artstile by monetasing it.  But the game is fun and interesting and very well made and chalenging.

So after you play out all your energy points you have to stop and let the energy build back up or use items that regenerate energy that you find as treasure (also available for real $ in the store).  What ended up happening was I would use my energy up and then I'd play something else.  It was great for 5 minutes here and 10 minutes there!

The story is actually pretty interesting, and there are a lot of unique elements to the world it is set in. HOG and puzzle game play is nicely done, and they change the placement of items often enough to ensure playing at the same location many times does not feel stale. \n\nThat said, I am never enthusiastic about these kinds of energy based games. You spend 9/10ths of your time waiting for your energy bar to fill up, and even with level up increases, I still only get enough energy to play 5 (very short) rounds before I have to wait again.  This is immersion breaking, and frustrating. I would happily play a purchasable version of this game to bypass that painful mechanic, but as it stands, the only way to avoid constant waiting to continue is through micropurchases, which falls into the trap of feeling extorting. This is the kind of flaw that gives the F2P genre a bad name. \n\nI'm giving this a 'recommend' because it is, overall, a well made game. But I am very unsure how long I will be playing it due to the frustration of the waiting game. And I'd be much quicker to support the makers, monetarily, if it didn't feel like the game style penalizes you if you don't.

I also think we should be able to trade in some access tools for others.  Also, if things in the store cost x number of gems OR y amount of coins would be nice.\n\nIf there were more of these games on STEAM, then we could rotate through them until our energy regens....", "timestamp_created": 1454983487, "timestamp_updated": 1454983487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21066228": {"recommendationid": "21066228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028852581", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469470708}, "language": "english", "review": "i like this game for the fact that it puts a time limit on how long you play. i like the find it games as the help keep my mind active", "timestamp_created": 1454982886, "timestamp_updated": 1454982886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21065731": {"recommendationid": "21065731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273236729", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466023957}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Only one major complaint: Once you unlock the Potions location, which dispenses a potion every 12 hrs or so, 9 out of 10 potions are the type that you can't use to boost your energy.  What is up with that?  Very misleading. Also, if you're just logging in after being away for several hours, and your energy is back to being full, don't click on your Energy dispensing location, which dispenses 10 energy every hour. When your energy is already full, this does not add 10 to your total. It's wasted. The board and locations are vivid and colorful, the objects are fairly easy to find once you've played that location a few times, though it does rotate through 5 or 6 different object placements scenarios.

It's actually NOT pay-to-play if you don't mind waiting, which is my case. There is absolutely nothing in the game that cannot be gained unless you pay money. Everything is accessible.\n\nIn my case, I play this game about 10-15 minutes a day. That's all I need to spend all my energy, have a little fun, complete a quest or two, and then that's it. I come back the following day, my energy is full, I spend it, open a few chests, and close the game again. And so on.\n\nPersonally, I have absolutely no problem with this type of games, especially if it's not pay-to-win. It doesn't matter if others pay for gems and you don't, because it's not putting them above you, making them stronger than you, or anything. It's a single player game. You go to your pace, and that's it. I don't care if some people has finished the game 15 times faster than I did because they paid real money. I like this game, and I don't mind waiting for energy; I go and play something else once I'm done with my daily energy and that's it.\n\nPlus, and this it important: every time you log in daily (whether you spend all your energy or just log in), you progress in the daily rewards table, and that table gives you 6 gems every 6 days. So stop complaining about real money, you CAN get gems just by logging in. You can get all locations, all items, all achievements for FREE. You just have to play 10-15 minutes a day until you get there.\n\nIf you like hidden objects games and don't mind the wait, then this game is very well done, and I plan on getting another from this series once I'm done with this one. It's free to play, so how about you just get it, try it, and judge for yourself?", "timestamp_created": 1454935268, "timestamp_updated": 1454935268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21050414": {"recommendationid": "21050414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120009337", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459533723}, "language": "french", "review": "he is cool but a bit short and a the end game many item are really useless", "timestamp_created": 1454934578, "timestamp_updated": 1454934578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21050217": {"recommendationid": "21050217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277623964", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473080454}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game, pretty basic but good boredom killer", "timestamp_created": 1454933816, "timestamp_updated": 1454933816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21049323": {"recommendationid": "21049323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032767895", "num_games_owned": 1129, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464938609}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun game but the achievements are hard to get", "timestamp_created": 1454930305, "timestamp_updated": 1454930305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467290", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21048926": {"recommendationid": "21048926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181901314", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501233602}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Leuk spel, wel jammer dat je per beurt zoveel energie nodig hebt, dat het lang duurt voordat je verder kunt spelen.", "timestamp_created": 1454928787, "timestamp_updated": 1454928787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21048723": {"recommendationid": "21048723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098714241", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507247919}, "language": "english", "review": "The game does have paid transactions if you want to buy energy or gems, but as long as you don't mind waiting for energy to build up there is no reason to spend money on the game.

The energy bar is small and most game sessions you will only get 4 or 5 HOG scenes per play session consisting of about 10 to 20 minutes. However, part of the jackpot of some of your victories is a puzzle chest (about 8 varieties), and very little energy is needed to play those chests. Thus you can usually always end a play session playing a couple puzzle chest extending your play time. The chest themselves are for the most part challenging.\n\nAs far as the HOG scenes, the hidden objects are nicely illustrated and all but a couple are named correctly. (flute is misnamed and one object gets a name change 2/3 of the way thorugh, and one oject takes advantage of synonyms), interestingly, since this extended play game involves going to all the HOG scenes (about 15) multiple times it eventually morphs from a  Hidden object game to a memory game.  This is the only HOG I have ever played where I did not mind the timer clock. Eventually it became fun for me to beat the clock at the first stage, trying to remember all the hidden spaces. My guess is that an object will have about four hidey holes within an HOG scene. So its never a matter of replaying an HOG scene and going to the last hidey hole.\n\nThe music is excellent, the graphics are great, but the story telling is lame. The way they tried to tell the story did not work at all for me. It bascially felt like they tagged on a story after they created the game world. The story was totally uninvolving and I ususally just clicked through the text.\n\nOTOH, the game achievments and game collections drove me to put dozens and dozens  of hours into this game. If you are a completionist, this game will drive you like no other HOG. However, the designers negleted to put in about 4 game pieces so it is impossible to get 100 % on the game collection part.\n\nI got a lot of hours and enjoyment out of this game and bought something for 2 bucks just as a nod to support the developers.

The graphics are very lovely; the puzzles are appropriately difficult when needed, very fun, and there is a lot to do in this game. Truthfully, though, there is too much. Too much to do. Too much necessary to unlock achievements and new areas. Too much use of energy to perform tasks. Granted, I haven't done much in the game at this point but I feel like I am limited by not paying to increase my ability to play longer. Given the content I feel I could invest quite a bit of my time in larger chunks, but that pesky energy reserve dwindles fast. Too fast to get anything done for more than a handful of minutes at a time. Especially at low levels. \n\nThis is frustrating, because I love, dearly, hidden object games. I understand that this is a free game and that money coming in for the developers efforts is from paying real money for ingame items. I get that. I've played many mobile games with this feature, without ever paying for items due to my patience with them and limited time to access them. However, I think this game could have benefited from a fixed base selling price for revenue, and let the game unlock and develop at its own pace per the player's usage, with additional payments being a luxury or to enhance gameplay, not advance it. I also feel that because there is a crippling limit when not paying for playability that the achievements take far longer than necessary to complete. If the game was more open and already paid for, then working toward each achievement would feel more like an acomplishment than a burden. \n\nI may change my mind later on, giving it more time to develop, before I settle either way definitely. For now though, I find more annoyances and cons than fun to recommend to others.

Es ist durchaus zu empfehlen. Es hat so seine Problemchen hier und da, aber im Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen ist es ein sch\u00f6ner Zeitvertreib.\n\nFangen wir mal mit dem \"gro\u00dfen\" Negativpunkt an, den sehr viele Reviews hier anbringen. Ja, das Spiel erinnert sehr stark an die Handygames oder Facebookgames, wo man pro Tag nur ein paar Level machen kann und dann darauf wartet, dass die Energie sich wieder auff\u00fcllt. Das kann auf Dauer schon nervt\u00f6tend werden, jedoch muss ich sagen, dass ich Spiele mag, die ich nicht innerhalb von ein paar Stunden durchgespielt bekomme. Hier sitzt du halt wirklich l\u00e4nger dran, weil du warten musst. Nat\u00fcrlich kannst du das ganze beschleunigen indem du Geld investierst. Aber das ist nun wieder nur ne Sache f\u00fcr Ungeduldige :P\n\nDann wurde sehr oft angebracht, dass das Spiel schnell langweilig wird, weil die Objekte immer an derselben Stelle sind. Was nicht ganz korrekt ist. Denn ab und an wechselt alles und du musst die Objekte von Neuem suchen. Ich glaube 1 Level hat immer 3 verschiedene Settings (zumindest was ich bisher gesehen habe).\n\nWas mich leider doch etwas st\u00f6rt ist die ganze Idee mit dem \"Du brauchst dieses Objekt jedes Mal wenn du diesen Ort erkunden willst.\" Die ersten paar Orte kannst du ohne weiteres erkunden - da brauchst du lediglich die Energie. Aber ich bin momentan an einer Stelle wo ich viele Orte, die ich erkunden muss f\u00fcr Gegenst\u00e4nde, nur mit Gegenst\u00e4nden betreten kann. Um zb. die Schmiede erkunden zu k\u00f6nnen brauchst du 2 Erze. Diese bekommst du zuf\u00e4llig in der Alten Stadt. Also grindest du die Alte Stadt in der Hoffnung die Erze zu bekommen. Sobald du diese hast gehst du zur Schmiede in der Hoffnung dort das Item zu bekommen um das n\u00e4chste Level zu \u00f6ffnen. Was ja ansich wirklich nicht so das Problem w\u00e4re, aber leider sind manche Gegenst\u00e4nde echt eine Plage. Wenn du Gegenst\u00e4nde per Quest finden musst, werden diese bevorzugt gedropt. Aber wehe dem du m\u00f6chtest etwas bekommen was nicht per Quest gesucht wird - dann richte dich drauf ein schonmal ein paar Tage nur zu grinden.\n\nAuch die ganzen Zusatzorte, die du reparieren kannst sind halt nicht immer hilfreich. Denn zu allererst brauchst du f\u00fcr einen Gro\u00dfteil davon so viel Gegenst\u00e4nde und einige Gegenst\u00e4nde brauchst du um jeden Ort zu reparieren. 10 Fl\u00e4schen oder 3 Seile pro Ort bedeuten schon echt ein Grindfest vom feinsten. Und nat\u00fcrlich gibt es auch da wieder die Regel mit \"Nur wenn du einen Gegenstand f\u00fcr eine Quest brauchst, bekommst du ihn. Ansonsten grinde mal ein paar Tage ohne Hoffnung.\" Und man muss halt sagen, dass der Nutzen der Zusatzorte irgendwie nicht mit dem \"Preis\" f\u00fcrs reparieren im EInklang steht. Ist halt die Frage ob es wirklich lohnenswert ist zig Gegenst\u00e4nde tagelang zu farmen um alle 8 Stunden 1 Erz zu bekommen.\n\nEin weiteres Problem sind die Truhen. Anfangs sind die wirklich noch recht einfach zu l\u00f6sen, aber nach 3 bis 4 von denen findest du dich in einer Minigameh\u00f6lle wieder. Denn nat\u00fcrlich sind die R\u00e4tsel zum l\u00f6sen etwas schwieriger aber du hast auch noch zus\u00e4tzlich Zeitdruck. Und nat\u00fcrlich brauchst du Energie um die Truhen zu \u00f6ffnen. In meinem Inventar habe ich momentan \u00fcber 30 Truhen, die ich nicht ge\u00f6ffnet bekomme, weil ich die R\u00e4tsel nicht gel\u00f6st bekomme. Was halt ziemlich bl\u00f6de ist, weil ein Gegenstand um die R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen 10 Diamanten kostet. Bei \u00fcber 30 Truhen je 10 Diamanten ausgeben. Und das wo du pro Level-Up 6 St\u00fcck bekommst....Nichts f\u00fcr mich.\n\nMan muss halt auch leider sagen, dass die Preise f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack zu hoch sind. 10 Diamanten f\u00fcr son Schl\u00fcssel, 2 Diamanten f\u00fcr 30 Energie. Aber man muss die Diamanten f\u00fcr sowas ja nicht verwenden.\nWas ich irgendwie gut finde. Denn das einzige was Diamanten dir bringen ist eine Beschleunigung. So brauchst du halt nicht warten und kannst gleich weitermachen. Jedoch ist alles auch ohne den Einsatz von Diamanten (und damit Geld) machbar. Nur du brauchst halt extrem l\u00e4nger.\n\nIch muss halt aber auch sagen, dass das Spiel doch sehr viel richtig macht. Die Grafik ist angenehm, die Wimmelbilder sind sch\u00f6n anzusehen, die Gegenst\u00e4nde passen sich teilweise so genial in ihrer Umgebung an, dass man doch schon genauer hinschauen muss, die Geschichte ist ganz nett und die Questgeschichten sind auch irgendwie passend und interessant. Man m\u00f6chte diesen Leuten irgendwie einfach helfen, weil sie sympathisch sind. Die Dev sind scheinbar auch dabei Bugs zu fixen und sind im Forum aktiv - was jetzt auch nicht jeder von sich behaupten kann.\n\nIch kann dieses Spiel Leuten empfehlen, die etwas haben wollen womit man l\u00e4ngere Zeit verbringt. Also quasi dein Facebookspiel oder dein Handyspiel aber hier auf Steam. Es hat ein paar kleine Macken und Spielmechaniken, die bei mir so manches Mal auf Unmut treffen, aber ich komme trotzdem regelm\u00e4\u00dfig wieder um die Quests dann doch zu l\u00f6sen und weiterzukommen.

The story isn't necessarily compelling, but for me that wasn't an issue as the enjoyment I got out of this game was found in the various activities which were made available.\n\nBefore continuing, it needs to be stated that this is a free-to-play game with optional paid services. It follows the same formula that many Facebook games do, which is that you have only limited play-time available to you before you need to let the game \"recharge\" your access to it. This is represented in \"Lost Lands\" as energy and almost any action you perform will consume it. Instead of waiting for it to recharge naturally, you can opt to use premium currency to in turn purchase in-game items which will return energy to you.\n\nSo that opens the door for two types of real-money purchases that you can make. The first is that you can purchase the premium currency under a multi-tier pricing model. The second is that after you gain an experience level you are rewarded with the option of purchasing a deeply discounted set of items for real-money, which most of the time will include the premium currency. Of them the second option seemed to be the better value based on my play style.\n\nFrom the start of the game, NPCs will be appearing to present you with quests. These quests come in the form of exploring hidden-object scenes, solving puzzle chests, completing item collections, killing roaming monsters, or repairing the Lost Lands. All of these actions will grant you with items that will be recycled into completing more of the same activities. Additionally you will be earning experience points and gaining levels. Gaining levels will instantly recharge your energy meter as well as permanently extend it. Higher levels will also unlock gated hidden-object scenes.\n\nQuesting will be the mechanism used to drive you through the core of the game -- 15 unique hidden-object scenes. Each scene has the potential to be leveled up as well, and upon doing so will basically unlock a new configuration of hidden-objects within it. This will add to the variety and keep you on your toes. \n\nHaving played through the majority of the game, I've never come across a situation where I was forced to purchase premium currency to progress. While I did spend some money, it was never necessary to do so. Everything the game has to offer can be reasonably obtained by playing normally with the recharge meter.", "timestamp_created": 1450915413, "timestamp_updated": 1453150503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.998750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19886261": {"recommendationid": "19886261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198225026544", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505506130}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u8010\u73a9\uff0c\u65ad\u65ad\u7eed\u7eed\u73a9\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u6708\u3002\u6bcf\u59292\u6b21\u5427\u5927\u6982\uff08\u628a\u4f53\u529b\u503c\u8017\u5149\u5c31\u64a4\uff09\u3002\n\u4f18\u70b9:\u603b\u4f53\u611f\u89c9\u6bd4\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u673a\u7684\u89e3\u5bc6\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u753b\u9762\u90fd\u597d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u60c5\u8282\uff0c\u80fd\u5b66\u82f1\u8bed\u3002\u6210\u5c31\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f88\u5168\u3002\n\u7f3a\u70b9:\u6e38\u620f\u592a\u957f\u4e86\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u6210\u5c31\u9700\u8981\u6162\u6162\u82b1\u65f6\u95f4\u5806\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5230\u4e86\u540e\u671f\u9700\u8981\u7684\u4f53\u529b\u503c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u627e4\uff5e5\u6b21\u4e1c\u897f\u534a\u5c31\u5341\u51e0\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e0d\u80fd\u73a9\uff08\u7b49\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u56de\u6ee1\uff09\u3002\u540e\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u524d\u671f\u652f\u63f4\uff0c20\u7ea7\u523021\u7ea7\u5347\u7ea7\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8854\u63a5\u4e0d\u4e0a\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u505a\u5b8c\u4e86\u6bcf\u5929\u53ea\u80fd\u5237\u5237\u7bb1\u5b50\uff0c\u81ea\u5df1\u60f3\u529e\u6cd5\u6323\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\n\n\u6682\u65f6\u5c31\u73a9\u5230\u8fd9\u91cc\u4e86\uff0c20\u7ea7\u534a\u624d\u89e3\u5f00\u4e869/48\u4e2a\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u6211\u5c31\u60f3\u770b\u770b\u5565\u65f6\u5019\u80fd\u5168\u7a0b\u5c31\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1450903610, "timestamp_updated": 1450903610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501591", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19880130": {"recommendationid": "19880130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161758080", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444054912}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1]1.[/h1] [b]\u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442[/b]: \u041c-\u043c, \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0443\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u044b \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0443 \u044d\u043b\u044c\u0444\u043e\u0432. \u041d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043a\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432.

I'm a little sorry that it has this many negative reviews, because it's a game that is chill to just take 10 minutes off, and do something that is not very taxing or adrenalinerushing.\n\nPeople who are looking to play this game from scratch need to look at it in either of two ways.\n1. A game that I will spend a ridiculous amount of money on - like really - an obscene amount of money on - to complete it in the fastest way possible.\n2. Make it a part of my daily routine for 10-20 minutes every day, and make it a slower progress.\n\nFor acheivement hunters: This game will take a while to complete. Not in terms of playtime, because the investment is not really that much, but in terms of real time, where you will daily log on to play this for a short interval.\n\nAs of now I have logged into this game daily for 3 months with only 40 hours play as of writing this review. I only have 8% of the acheivements, since they are logged in a wierd way. You proceed in stages, which are tracked in the game's internal acheievement system, so it's not like it will then take me another 27 months to get all the 100% acheivements, but it will definitely take some time, if I want to do it without spending any actual, human money on it.\n\nI have gathered that initially there were quite a few problems regarding acheivements and typoes in the chat that gave the game a rather unprofessional appearance. But this is one of those games where the devs are fixing errors reported by the community.\n(For example there is an acheivement that requires for you to spend gems, which are bought with real money. The community didn't like that you had to pay to get acheivements. In response, the game now awards a small amount of gems every 5 consecutive days logged in, and upon levelling up, which makes the acheivement possible without actually spending any money)\n\nThis is a good game that you do not just complete overnight.

It far exceeds expectation.\n\nI just the game partially based on this: ooo looks great, music is great, it plays on a toaster and has easy achievements..woot - then I play it....\n\nThis game is clearly modeled after casual social media games. Everything you do requires either energy, or certain object acquired through playing certain hidden object levels, which, yep - require energy.\n\nEnergy: this fills up automatically - at 1 energy per 2 minutes. There are spots you can build up to reduce this time, bridge mainly, but they are costly and only take away 30 seconds totally. If you are lucky to get a talisman that halves that, then it could be bearable, but only if it was the norm, and not just a 24 hr drop.\n\nThe game map is made up of these little homes/towns that, when you click on them, you can do your hidden object levels. But each on cost a certain amount of energy, and as you progress the levels require more and more energy.\n\nAchievements: Now this is funny. Some achievements don't work, aka aren't in sync. You will see the majority of all the achievements are made of a statistic out of 5. 5/5 = achievement done. Seems great, right? For any given level, to get 5/5 you really have to complete it 150 times. For monster deaths, 5/5 =200 times.\n\n150 repeats x 30 energy cost ( assuming all the levels have been \"leveled up\" to rank 5, then that will be the least amount of energy required, some are 70 energy)  = 4500 total energy for the lowest costing level. \n\n4500 energy x 90 seconds ( recharge time for 1 energy) = 405,000 total seconds for the lowest costing level = 6750 minutes = 112.5 hours of time.  Just let that sink in for a second. Yeah. Compound on that fact when some of the levels are 70/75 energy each. \n\nOn top of that the achievements are faulty for me, showing me that i have 5/5 but on steam it shows a perpetual 4/5:\nexaminer\nexplorer\nexperienced\ntrader\nfan of chests\nrich man\n\nNow many of the levels and monster defeats are calculated correctly, but if you haven't started this game already, then it's really not worth all the time and effort and the huge drop in your achievement percentage (if you are a steam completionist/achievement hunter). \n\nIf you are like me, who started this game when it first came out, I would use some developer tools/memory tools and just give yourself 99999 energy and money. Personally for me I have to see the game through, and I will probably have to decompile and recompile certain aspects of the game - just to get my achievements, which are still stuck at lvl 4 despite being completed for weeks now. \n\nIf the developers could fix these issues the game would be great, even now the graphics and music are still amazing enough to make it almost bearable.

The only way to get past this is by buying into one or other location with crystals, which you don't get many of. This may end up forcing you to buy crystals and so forced to spend money on a \"free\" game.  To get around this you simply need to make sure that you don't spend too many of the crystals that you get when you go up a level, you get 5 each time and you need 20 to acess a locked level without the requirements.

"english", "review": "Lost Lands: A Hidden Object Adventure has received quite a lot of negative reviews during the first days after it was released, and this because of 2 main reasons: on one hand, the game had a lot of bugs of various severity (from typos or bad translations to crashes, achievements unlocking and the impossibility to start the game on some systems); on the other hand, the game featured two achievements that were obtainable only by investing a huge amount of real money (around $200) that attracted the anger of a lot of people, including myself.\n \nHowever, the feedback that the community received from the developers is quite impressive \u2013 not only they changed the paid achievements but they also started to fix the major bugs and they are currently working on fixing the minor issues too, and all this in a very short period of time.\n\nThe game itself is not entirely bad, it\u2019s quite repetitive but at the same time it was designed to hook you up, just like the standard smartphone/Facebook games. The fact that you have a limit to the actions you can do in one play session might or might not make you revisit the game next day, to progress some more.\n\nThe gameplay consists mainly in solving hidden object scenes that award some items used to complete the quests or collections or unlock additional bonuses. The fact that you have a most 15 locations (depending on your level, 1 - 15) that you visit over and over again adds to the monotony of the game \u2013 but on the bright side, after you solve 3-4 times the same hidden object scene, you learn exactly where all the objects are which makes it much easier afterwards.\n\nAdditionally, you can receive some chests from killing mobs, but unlocking them proves to be a real challenge \u2013 the puzzles are timed and most often of high difficulty.\n\nFor those that want to 1-click solve a chest puzzle or a hidden object scene, there is an in-game shop from which they can buy items in exchange for real money. The shop also provides all the objects needed for unlocking new locations or completing the collections. However, in comparison with most of the other pay-to-win games, all these items can be acquired also by playing the game, without spending a cent of real money, but of course these drop in small amounts so one is expected to invest a lot of patience and time to finish this game.\n\nThe objects in the hidden object scenes and the whole artwork is designed in the style of Artifex Mundi games, meaning that overall the artwork is nice and with vibrant colors; the objects are quite visible but at the same time hidden strategically so that they blend perfectly into the background, making them harder to be spotted, which is by definition one of the characteristics of this genre.\n\nAt the moment of writing this review, I think that the biggest complaint from the community remains the long time to achieve 100% - in order to do that one needs to revisit every location a few hundred times and all of this require energy; the energy pool is quite small and limited, allowing you to play only 4-5 hidden object scenes in a single play session - this will probably make people loose interest in the game quite quickly since they will not be able to enjoy the game for more than 10 minutes at once. Hopefully, the game parameters will be adjusted in the future.\n\nI decided to give this game a positive review, not only because it is an enjoyable experience (despite the long grind for 100% achievements) but also because of the constructive attitude from the developers, that are actively working on improving our gaming experience.\n\n[quote]More reviews on the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11354094]Lilly's Corner Curator page[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1444575361, "timestamp_updated": 1521292678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826432", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18429028": {"recommendationid": "18429028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039667599", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482520631}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432,\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f.\u041c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c.\u041d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043a \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0434\u0451\u0448\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1444574862, "timestamp_updated": 1444574862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18425520": {"recommendationid": "18425520", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986316421", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517075732}, "language": "french", "review": "sympathique, dans la lign\u00e9 des jeu face book.

(Seriously? What is this Facebook?)\n- Bugs that instead of being fixed just included a work around in the changelog. (Really you want me to do bad on purpose to slow the game progress even further, not just once but repeatedly?)\n- Energy costs to explore levels rises disproportionably to the rate your energy rises so you can play less the further into the game you progress\n- Puzzle variation, Each zone only has 3 places max that each object is placed, so when exploring the same zone over and over as required by the game the objects will always be in the same place.\n- Repetitive I don't want to explore the same screen 50+ times if not only do the objects only exist in 3 places but it's always the same objects.\n- Level Entry Item cost. Not only do levels require energy to enter many levels require multiple items (Example: Coal) to enter, so to get into said level you need 50 Energy, but oh wait you also need 2 coal go farm this other level for 50 energy each time twice and hope to get a coal each time. \n- Game originally introduced with steam achievements you actually had to pay real money to get (not a small amount either.) Those have since been removed but all achievements still are not attainable unless you are willing to do bad at each puzzle over 50 times, with the energy system this is ridiculous. \n- Game pace, I don't want to be playing this weeks from now let alone months or years from now. I want to beat it and move on, Current design will take months if not years to complete playing 10 minutes at a time twice a day.\n\nPro and Con:\n- Music, this could be considered a pro because it's relaxing, but there is no variation. Do you really want to listen to this same music for the years it takes you to complete this?\n\nOverall score: 4/10 I am basing this score only in comparison to other hidden object games, and honestly it's only that high because of the amazing artwork. If you can't a non energy based hidden object game or like playing the same facebook game for years try this. If not just buy a better hidden object game. \n", "timestamp_created": 1444156343, "timestamp_updated": 1444156343, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706490", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18353230": {"recommendationid": "18353230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016750292", "num_games_owned": 1600, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444133369}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing is for free.", "timestamp_created": 1444133900, "timestamp_updated": 1444133900, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496032", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18345273": {"recommendationid": "18345273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141404871", "num_games_owned": 640, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 9117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518386947}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, simple and easy to play.

each scene a LOT)\n- The scenes themselves are not bad, and are decently varied\n- Different scene modes (silhouette, names, and \"night mode\")\n\nThe Bad:\n- The game really doesn't benefit from the cash gating. Energy and microtransaction items being pretty much required ends up being a frustration. Coins being your main currency for most things, but all the energy items and other \"boosters\" requiring gems, for which your only reliable source is exchanging real money.\n- Annoying in-game pop-up style ads advertising limited-time \"deals\" on cash shop items get ludicrous. I'd been playing on and off for less than a day, and had a good half dozen of them on screen. You can't dismiss them, only wait for the timer to run down.\n- The story is pretty weak, generic fantasy fare. I really couldn't bring myself to care about what was going on.\n- Characters are all generic fantasy stereotypes. Elves are all stuck-up and condescending, Humans are greedy, etc.\n- The intro cutscene would be much better off being a one-time thing when you first start, rather than playing every time you load up the game, which, due to having to wait for energy regen, is likely to be several times a day depending on how you play. And, due to the weak story, I didn't care the first time. \n- No way to choose your scene mode, which is frustrating when you're given a quest to play a scene in a specific mode (I.E. Night mode).\n- Achievements are ridiculous. You have to complete the top tier of the game's in-game achievement system for it to count towards your Steam achievements. As mentioned, some of those require spending hundreds of real dollars to complete.\n\nOverall, this could be good, but it's hindered by the usual port-from-mobile BS.

For anyone like me, worried that they'd accidentally buy something; Steam overlay pops up wanting you to confirm the purchase, with a convenient cancel button. Works well for me too. I will probably buy something to support the developer when I'm done with the game (though not more than I'd pay for any other HO game). He deserves some money for the care put into it. And it's fun.\n\nThe energy needed to play the scenes recharges at a good rate, and exceeds max while sleeping. Plus, levelling up refills to max (sadly not more if you already have max or more energy).\n\nThere are various locations, more and more unlocking as you progress. They are re-used, but as you progress the items to be found get more and more, only a handful to find at a time that are renewed as you find them. I don't think random clicking would get anyone anywhere. On the other hand, objects often enough have the same locations (I have not figured out yet what has the placement change - it's a surprise when they do), so some are easily found if you remember where they are. I do like the way the game does these. (Btw, each scene has a limited time. Not being able to evade that would seriously spoil my fun.) \n\nThe graphics are very nice, much care has been taken to create the locations and the map, and put the items to be found into sensible spots. \n\nSo far I've seen 3 different modes for hidden object finding: by words, by silhouettes, and by words or silhouettes with only small part of the scene visible (a circle you can move around). Which you get seems to be random (with the quests to do at night - the small-part-only-visible version - it might take several attempts to get that mode).\n\nThere are also minigames/puzzles for opening chests with useful stuff. I rather like that (though would enjoy that more without timer).\n\nThere is even a point to rummaging around locations for random junk, though the actual hidden objects and the things you're digging out of the locations story-wise don't match. \n\nThere's also monsters to beat, special items to put together, and buildings to be repaired, for which you have to find (in the HO locations), or purchase (with in-game gold or gems that you earn by playing) different things. Another nice way to add different activities. Plus, you collect stuff that adds various bonuses, from faster energy recharging to getting more xp from quests. And there are enough free hint/solve items dropped (at least for me - I prefer not to use them if I can help it at all).\n\nThe quests you get for progression and unlocking more locations have that 'just one more' effect on me. Maybe for some people it would be hard to resist buying stuff with real money to continue rather than waiting a bit. Only you know how good a grip you have on your wallet. :)", "timestamp_created": 1443234243, "timestamp_updated": 1443234667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475781", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18195039": {"recommendationid": "18195039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062749545", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443233110}, "language": "english", "review": "You play a recently revived elf dude who needs to save the world by completing really mundane tasks like finding a fishing net and repairing a wall. \n\nMusic isn't bad.

And while that's freakin' weird for a hidden object game, the shop itself seems reasonably priced (as far as these things go). Packages of currency ranging from $1 to $20.  Skip to 3:30 in this video for the cash shop info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66TLki6J83w&feature=youtu.be\n\nThe graphics are actually quite lovely- they animations of the hair and faces of the characters is top-notch. The music and sounds are calm, relaxing, and fit the atmosphere. The menus and text do look a little plain or 'cheap', but that's a minor issue for me. The game attempts to put a serious RPG skin over the hidden object gameplay, and it succeeds. It reminds me a LOT of 'Puzzle Quest' in that regard. \n\nIf you're a fan of the hidden object genre (I'm not, really), and don't mind the slightly unnerving presence of a cash shop and energy system, I see no reason to not suggest checking this game out. We'll have to see long-term how the energy system works out, though. That might flip this review to a thumbs-down with time.", "timestamp_created": 1443125618, "timestamp_updated": 1443129478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568553", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 3342, "total_negative": 376, "total_reviews": 3718}}

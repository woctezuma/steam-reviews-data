There's no indication it's coming. There's no resolution to what you see in the game, no explanation, nothing resembling a story beat. There's no indication of why the game ended at that point. It really is like they just ran out of money and decided \"well, let's ship what we've got even though the game ends half-way through a level\".\n\nSecondly, there are a couple of incredibly frustrating bugs. Firstly, there are many spots where you can get inescapably stuck on the level geometry, and then you have to restart from the last checkpoint.

Our robot character is equipped with a tractor-beam which he can use to move objects about his environment and the physics involved are really quite nice and feel accurate.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SOGzgb_W4Sk\n\nThe game isn\u2019t very long, its maybe somewhere in the three hour range to complete.  There are a couple of puzzles that might cause a few problems, one that caused me a problem was one near the end that I completely overthought.  I started making a spreadsheet in an attempt to calculate the logic behind it.  This wasn\u2019t necessary, I just wasn\u2019t thinking simple enough!!  In general the difficulty starts easy and ramps slowly towards the end making it an extremely pleasurable journey.  Due to this and combined with the nice feel to the game I can see myself replaying it.\n\nThere is an extra DLC which seems to be included at no extra cost and provides an extra world to play.  I have yet to test this part of the game.\n\nGraphics are nice and the screen zooms in and out depending on the environment or puzzle being attempted.  Everything is nice and smooth with the game being made in Unreal Engine.\n\nThe developers have managed to capture quite an excellent atmosphere throughout the game with a great selection of ambient sounds which at times border on actual music being played.\n\nThe menu system is quite basic and doesn\u2019t cater for higher resolutions than 1080p or advanced graphics settings.  This can be changed in a configuration file (check the forums) if you need to.  I played through on 1080p mode wishing I could play on my native resolution of 1440p and then discovered this workaround afterwards.  Bleh!!  \n\nI give Unmechanical a strong recommendation to anyone that enjoys puzzle-platform games.

The game was also later ported to the iOS due to it's popularity on the PC platform. \n\nI am normally not a massive fan of puzzle type games like this as I just find my self aimlessly trying to figure out what to do for hours on end. Thankfully Unmechanical offers puzzles whilst challenging, but also offer a logical resolution to them unlike other games in this genre. You can often work out what you need to do on each puzzle within a few minutes of analyzing the surrounding scene. The puzzles can range from light reflecting puzzles, to memory puzzles. In fact, I have to say, I can't remember (ironic) the last game I played which had memory puzzles in, this game actually made me write notes down on a piece of paper in order for me to progress which again, is something which is commonly not needed in this day and age. \n\nThe graphics and art style in Unmechanical are lovely. It has that mechanical look to it, with some really nice looking textures in the environment, and the animation of everything is just so smooth and faultless. \n\nUnmechanical also offers various endings to the game; which is something I only found out after I had finished the game. Thankfully you can easily access the other endings of the game due to the last save point being just before you make the choice so, allowing you to see them all if you so please. \n\nI wouldn't say Unmechanical is a difficult game as such, you can work out all of the puzzles if you think about it for a few moments, none of them have crazy resolutions that make no sense, and a couple of them are only skill based too. \n\nA playthrough from beginning to end of Unmechanical took me about five hours which is exactly the sort of length I look for in this type of game. I think anymore and it would start to feel drawn out more than it should. However there is no replay ability to it, as I said, you can easily access the other endings, and once you have done all the puzzles once, there is no need to play it again. Thankfully though, the prices reflects this, sitting nicely at \u00a36,99 - which is just the right cost for a game of this length. \n\nI didn't have any technical issues whilst playing. Whilst the graphics look really nice, this game will be able to be played on pretty much any setup.\n\nI'll certainly recommend Unmechanical, if you aren't normally a fan of puzzle based games I would still recommend it, because I'm not normally a fan, but I had a really good time whilst playing. Hardcore puzzle fanatics may well find the puzzles to be a little too easy, but it's still worth the couple of hours of your time to experience this awesome game. \n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n[b][u]3) Recommended[/u][/b]\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's built on the Unreal engine, once again proving to still be one of the most superior as the graphics are top-notch and the mechanics are simple and fluid. Not jutters, not frame-rate issues,  just smoooooooooooooooooooooooooooth.\n\nYou play as an adorable little flying robot, who I nicknamed \"Ohm\" (based on the small noise it makes when it bumps into things), and one day as you're flying about with your family, an odd-looking pipe sprouts out of the ground and sucks you in. After a very long ride down a very long pipe, you wake up in a very strange underground bio-mechanical nexus, and you need to find your way out and reunite with your loved ones. As you venture forth, solving puzzles to pass through obstacles, you will find this place to have a dark and sinister secret.\n\nUnmechanical encourages exploration and outside-the-box thinking as it challenges you with a combination of traditional and environmental puzzles that test your memory and reflexes. Anyone who has ever played games such as Portal, Machinarium or Limbo will feel right at home with this one. It's not very long, though that can depend on your puzzle-solving skills. The game is solely based on its puzzles, so there aren't any enemies to stop you. Much like Portal, you either solve it, or be trapped. \n\nIf you're like me and like a challenge with environmental puzzles like those in Oddworld, Limbo or Portal, you'll love it. If you're more of a traditional puzzler who often plays Sudoku and puzzles those of the likes of Machinarium, there's plenty for you as well. If you consider yourself an expert puzzler who utterly destroys puzzle games though, Unmechanical will probably be pretty easy and you'll breeze through it in an hour. It really depends.\n\nI suppose the only fair criticism that can be thrown at this game is its lack of narrative. The description I gave at the beginning is really just my own interpretation. It's rather ambiguous and interestingly enough, the game has two endings depending on this one action you may or may not decide to do near the very end of the game. Otherwise, you can simply consider it a story about escape. It's kind of like Limbo but you have a clearer idea of what your ultimate goal actually is.\n\nIf you're into any of the games I mentioned above, I recommend this one.

Cute and Short Little Physics Puzzler[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Genre: 2D Physics Puzzler. \n[*]Developed & Published by: Talawa Games & Teotl Studios\t\n[*]Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, PS4, PS3, Xbox One. \n[*]Business Model: Cheap Base Game.\n[*][i]Copy Purchased by Myself[/i] \n[/list]\n[b]Overall Gameplay Thoughts[/b]\nUnmechanical is simply an exploration game with physics puzzles that often tie themselves together. It\u2019s also really short, clocking in at around one to two hours. Side note, the exploration is fairly light as there\u2019s no real dead-ends or open-ended areas you can look around in. It\u2019s just a lot of connecting corridors. But the game doesn\u2019t really direct where you should go or what you need to complete next. It expects you to figure it out. There isn't much of a story to be found in Unmechanical either. Your little flying robot simply gets taken by an arm in a cutscene where it\u2019s shot down a tube into a strange world for it to explore. The majority of the game is focused on completing the various physics puzzles. While the controls are pretty simple, it\u2019s probably better to play this game with a controller. The controls can be a little bit frustrating otherwise. \n\n[b]Puzzle Difficulty and Thoughts[/b]\nPuzzle difficulty is reasonably challenging. Most of the challenge will come from dealing with the physics and the slow response you\u2019ll get from your character because of said physics. There are a few mind-benders puzzles that I had difficulty back when I first played it though I\u2019m not sure they would confuse me again if I tried playing this game new now. I will say that this game completely lacks replayability. You\u2019re in for the one journey and one journey only on this one. \n\n[b]Extended Edition[/b]\nAfter three years, Unmechanical gets a surprise free update to include support for Linux and Mac, as well as a new hour long campaign. I got about an hour long in my playthrough so I can't complain. It's a nice little addition where two little robots get sucked down and they have to work together to get out of where they are at. It's not co-op or faux co-op though, just a fun story through another cavern filled with physics based puzzles. It definitely has a much faster pace to it and the puzzles aren't nearly as difficult as they were in the original campaign. Apparently this edition was exclusive on consoles until recently released on PC. \n\n[b]PC Settings and Graphics[/b]\nPC settings are ok but lacking a lot of fine control I would have preferred. You have resolution options, windowed mode on/off and a graphic setting quality slider. If you want to edit FOV, AF, AA or V-Sync, you have to go into the game\u2019s .ini files in order to do it. While the game isn\u2019t particularly demanding nowadays, I\u2019d prefer to have these settings readily available. Just in case. Other than that, I didn\u2019t have any problems with the game when I did my run. No crashing, bugs or other problems. \n\nThis was one of the first indie titles to really use the Unreal 3 engine to great effect. It\u2019s a beautiful, atmospheric game where you explore a sculpted technological and organic world. The amount of detail and animation work that went into this game is impressive. And the soundtrack makes sure to keep you immersed though it isn\u2019t anything special. \n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nTo me, what's most surprising about Unmechanical is how very few people actually played it. It came out right when this type of game was all the rage and it just didn\u2019t get a lot of attention. I can't figure out why. You'll only get around couple of hours out of Unmechanical and I think you\u2019re better off getting this on sale. It\u2019s a fun, short little game that doesn\u2019t oversell itself. The story is threadbare but the puzzles are reasonably challenging and it\u2019s a great looking 2D game. It\u2019s a pity that the developers haven\u2019t done anything since, I\u2019d like to see what that would have been.  \n\n[b][url=http://wp.me/p4fZDz-2lW]Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1436414062, "timestamp_updated": 1448499288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16671085": {"recommendationid": "16671085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055220281", "num_games_owned": 485, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449045428}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u636e\u8bf4\u662f\u62ff\u865a\u5e7b2\u5f15\u64ce\u4f5c\u7684\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u662f\u5f88\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u89e3\u8c1c\u662f\u5f88\u96be\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6211\u770b\u4e86\u653b\u7565\uff08\u6211\u667a\u5546\u4e0d\u884c\u554a\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u667a\u5546\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u667a\u5546\u4f4e\u4e8e105\u7684\u9700\u8981\u770b\u653b\u7565\u624d\u80fd\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u667a\u5546\u4f4e\u4e8e90\u7684\u5c31\u4e0d\u8981\u73a9\u4e86\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u592a\u7b28\u7684\u4eba\u770b\u4e86\u653b\u7565\u53ea\u6015\u4e5f\u901a\u4e0d\u4e86\u5173\u3002\u6211\u518d\u8865\u5145\u51e0\u53e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4e4d\u770b\u4e4b\u4e0b\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u5267\u60c5\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u4ed4\u7ec6\u7422\u78e8\u4e5f\u662f\u6709\u5267\u60c5\u7684\uff0c\u5927\u5bb6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u90a3\u4e2a\u5c0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u539f\u672c\u81ea\u7531\u81ea\u5728\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u7740\uff0c\u5ffd\u7136\u6709\u4e00\u5929\u88ab\u53e6\u5916\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5145\u6ee1\u673a\u5668\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u57ce\u5e02\u91cc\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5c0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5c31\u60f3\u9003\u51fa\u53bb\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5c31\u4e00\u8fb9\u89e3\u8c1c\u4e00\u8fb9\u5f80\u5916\u8dd1\uff0c\u73a9\u5230\u6700\u540e\u5c0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u628a\u90a3\u4e2a\u6293\u4ed6\u8fdb\u6765\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u70b8\u6b7b\u4e86\u3002\u8fd9\u65f6\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u662f\u5c0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u628a\u81ea\u5df1\u6539\u9020\u6210\u90a3\u4e2a\u6293\u4ed6\u6765\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08\u90a3\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5730\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u57ce\u7684\u4e3b\u4eba\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u5730\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u57ce\u7684\u65b0\u4e3b\u4eba\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u5229\u7528\u90a3\u4e2a\u88ab\u70b8\u6b7b\u7684\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5c38\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u94a5\u5319\u9003\u51fa\u53bb\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1435137939, "timestamp_updated": 1435207308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504536", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16570214": {"recommendationid": "16570214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075718004", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398377167}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Bulmacalar\u0131n zorluk derecesi ger\u00e7ekten iyi ayarlanm\u0131\u015f. karakter ve ortam\u0131n sesleri keyif verici.

Built in the Unreal Dev Kit, it looks fantastic and is let down only by its short length. Billed as a puzzler, it's more about exploration, but happens to tie its universe together by letting you interact with different new discoveries, which happen to include many puzzles elements.\n\n[h1]Highlights[/h1]\n\nIn any other game, lack of lore, history or story would be a let down, but they help add charm to Unmechanical. It never pretends to be anything more than a short fun exploration of a cool, atmospheric world.\n\n* Fantastic use of the Unreal Engine, lighting and the great looking 2.5D elements add tone and depth\n* Pleasant simplicity and a well designed little robot, almost relaxing at times, without being boring\n\n[h1]Mistakes[/h1]\n\n* It's common to not know what the game wants you to do next, or how to progress\n* Some people will be disappointed by a short playtime and an abrupt ending\n\n[h1]Recommendations[/h1]\nUnmechanical is \u00a36.99/8.99\u20ac/$9.99 on Steam and has a short playtime of around 3 hours and very little reason to play through more than once. If getting more for your money is important to you, wait for a sale, where it goes up to -90% and is a bargain for a buck.\n\n* Built using Unreal Dev Kit, you can access all the usual Unreal options using the console using the tilde key ~\n* [spoiler]Unmechanical has two slightly different endings you might have missed https://youtu.be/nRcojdDiQr0?t=224[/spoiler]\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/211180", "timestamp_created": 1432737915, "timestamp_updated": 1432737915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542927", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15976362": {"recommendationid": "15976362", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972147252", "num_games_owned": 1388, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432437772}, "language": "english", "review": "beautiful puzzler that I added to my library a while ago, had forgotten about, and was glad I rediscovered.", "timestamp_created": 1432437827, "timestamp_updated": 1432437827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15930238": {"recommendationid": "15930238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107385672", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460598030}, "language": "english", "review": "Hopefully if game works on the machine of the customer I can tell from the beginning this game has a promising sweet immersive atmosphere and without technical problems is more than totally worth it on discount or not in my tastes.", "timestamp_created": 1432231100, "timestamp_updated": 1432231100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15784530": {"recommendationid": "15784530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045149740", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 270, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1379037487}, "language": "english", "review": "[u]What I liked:[/u]\n[list]\n    [*] Nice physics puzzles\n    [*] Good looking graphics for a small game\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know:[/u]\n[list]\n    [*] Puzzles aren't that hard, but fun\n    [*] Short game\n    [*] Some puzzles require memorization\n[/list]\n\n[h1]My Score:[/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $3[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 2 hours [/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Trine\n    [*]Mushroom 11\n    [*]Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons \n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1431333346, "timestamp_updated": 1485214846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483776", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15778476": {"recommendationid": "15778476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072586558", "num_games_owned": 679, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431285649}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0422\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438-\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0438, \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438. \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0439 (\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441 \u0425\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0448\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0432\u044b\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435);

Worth every cent despite the criticisms I'm about to level.  Firstly, the game has a very annoying tendancy to make you complete the same puzzle several times before allowing you to continue (eg. making you carry five rocks to a button when one or two will do). This tends to undermine the puzzle aspect and replace it with useless tedium at times. Secondly, it is far to easy to make a mistake and lodge a physics object in a place where it is impossible to recover it. In Portal, for example, you had to put in some serious effort to actually lose a cube because, in most cases, the dispenser would simply provide a replacement; this is not the case in Unmechanical. This issue is compounded by the fact that there is no manual save system, and no way to restart a level from a particular point. It is therefore, very easy to create a situation in which you will be forced to start again from the begining because a rock has landed itself in fron of a door or gotten stuck underwater. \n\nDespite these issues, do yourself a favor and buy this game.

And this is exactly what the game designers for Unmechanical did unbelievably right with how they designed their puzzles.  I have been developing this theory about puzzles in games as having a line dividing them: on the one side are inductive puzzles (puzzles that implicitly communicate their parameters to the player via the environment and leave the player to discover the solution) and deductive puzzles (puzzles that explicitly communicate to the player the rules that govern the parameters of the puzzle and leave the player to deduce the solution).  Now why did I use the word discover with inductive puzzles yet deduce with deductive puzzles?  Could I have used induce instead of discover?  Yes I could have.  Should have I?  No.  Why?  Because discover is much more engaging of a word.  That is exactly the attitude you need when attempting to solve inductive puzzles.  You need to engage every....... single...... goddamn...... object......... because sometimes you never know which one will lead to the solution.  Now I must admit that this strategy is used predominately in adventure games with what I call pixel treasure hunt.  But Unmechanical did an \"amazing\" job at implicitly communicating the expectations of its puzzles using solely elements from the game.  (If it weren't for this puzzle I would be able to take that amazing out of the parenthesis but leaving the player to figure out how to solve a puzzle can have some backdraft if not properly designed into the environment, as I will now address.)\n\nThe only issue I have seen with the inductive form of puzzle design is that heavy reliance on the environment to communicate the parameters of a puzzle means the designers have to heavily rely on solid environmental design.  It is very easy to make mistakes here simply because humans are not accustomed to this form of communication.  Imagine this: You need to tell your GF that you are going to be late from work.  You can either call her and tell her directly (deductive) or devise a way for her to figure it out as she interacts with her environment (inductive).  The latter is MUCH MUCH MUCH more enjoyable from a game design point of view...IF DONE CORRECTLY!!!!!  However, nothing is more frustrating than knowing the game wants you to do something before progression in the story in allowed yet having no clue what to do.\n\nIn the end though, I applaud the design team behind Unmechanical for taking the inductive route of puzzle design simply because I don't see it often.  Don't get me wrong, both forms of puzzles are wonderfully fun in their own right but too many developers take the easy route of writing a story for a game, then jerking the gamer out of that story every time a puzzle is introduced to explain the rules behind it.  The rule of thumb I would have towards whether a game should have inductive vs deductive puzzles would be - respect the gamer's expectations.  If you have inductive puzzles put every single drop of design juice into the environment to ensure that the gamer is communicated clearly what is expected of him to solve the puzzle without ever being jerked from the story.  If you have deductive puzzles then take advantage of them by making puzzles with interesting rules that require back door logic, or crossword thinking to solve.  DO NOT make a game that doesn't know what it is because the gamer will immediately know it and hate you forever for it.\n\nHere is my Playalyzation of this game:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYBJxdpXNnt6LMk0EpgQ2gitOjWTd-jXm", "timestamp_created": 1414635730, "timestamp_updated": 1414635730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12648688": {"recommendationid": "12648688", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997934680", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1374346262}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly a wonderful little puzzle game.\nIn the same vain as Limbo and other such puzzle games, the silent protaganist in a big daunting world, going around solving puzzles trying to find your way to wherever you're going.\nThe puzzles are fantastic, the world is pretty and the character is adorable.\n\nFully worth the money.", "timestamp_created": 1414360239, "timestamp_updated": 1414360239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12510319": {"recommendationid": "12510319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044905315", "num_games_owned": 1333, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413462930}, "language": "english", "review": "Outstanding puzzler.

It's a brief, ambiguous journey that leaves a lot open for player interpretation (occasionally too much), but accomplishes a great deal through context and the brilliantly imaginative environment around you. I had no idea what I would be getting when I first started it up, but by the end was immensely glad I had given it a chance.\n\nThe first surprise came in the form of the fantastic visuals, which put Unreal Engine 3 to use more effectively than I've seen from some AAA games. Gorgeous lighting, a creative and evocative art style, and some very clever use of cinematography make moving through the dark mines a beautiful affair. It also helps infer a lot of the narrative, that without any exposition is impressively well realized if you take the time to take it all in. I do wish the ending was a bit more substantial and obvious when it was coming, but being able to quickly reload and see both alternatives put them both in better context (even if they still feel a tad rushed).\n\nThe second surprise was that despite my prior assumptions, Unmechanical isn't at all a standard physics puzzler. Instead, every puzzle is contextually placed throughout the world making them more meaningful and the world more engrossing, and avoids falling back on the same types of puzzles as each is unique to the area it resides in. None of them are particularly challenging or involved, but the way the all fit so well within the world and manage to loop back around to each other is brilliant, and shows a level or forethought by the developers that's often missed in a lot of games.\n\nMy only real issue is that Unmechanical does a very poor job of conveying where and what you need to do next. Half of this is intentional, as it allows the player to discover things on their own instead of being spoon fed along a linear path, but the other half is simply poor design as paths are often obscured or off screen without any indication you are meant to go back and look for them. This mostly meant I had to rely on the hint system a good deal more than I would have liked, but even then it wasn't entirely effective at guiding me to the next area when I got stuck, which more often than not required me to stumble around and explore every nook and cranny until I found a tunnel I'd missed or a door that had become unlocked.\n\nAside from that frustration, Unmechanical was remarkably enjoyable. Nothing about it is especially memorable, but I was engaged the entire time through and disappointed when it ended so soon. Though it seems to have flown under the radar for most, I hope that this isn't the last we see of Unmechanical, as for the developer's first major release the quality is already impressive and would likely only improve in a more expansive sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1407778521, "timestamp_updated": 1407778521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724153", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11620594": {"recommendationid": "11620594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047838896", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1373854032}, "language": "english", "review": "Good puzzle game", "timestamp_created": 1407621580, "timestamp_updated": 1407621580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11600649": {"recommendationid": "11600649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043620579", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422719967}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein cooles, kleines R\u00e4tsel-Spiel, dass einen dazu bringt mal seine grauen Zellen anzustrengen.

The environments are rather interesting and do try to tell some story but without a single hint of dialog, it's rather hard to tell exactly what's going on.\n\nWhat puts this on a \"recommend when on sale\" level is that the game sets all these physical system up and then barely uses them. The game can be easily completed in one setting, maybe about 2-3 hrs at most, depending on how stuck you get in some of the puzzles. The puzzles tend to be singular matters, using only one or two of the physical aspects they've stuck in there, so there's little overly complex - which is good in that no puzzle takes forever to solve but also leaves you wishing they had more in there.

Charming visuals and simple, good controls make this a solid and enjoyable game.\n\nAs a puzzler, the most important part of the game is, well, the puzzles, and Unmechanical does it well with a variety of different kinds, including pattern recognition, memory, physics-based, and a few arcade-y bits. The difficulty is on the easy side, but not annoyingly so--I would make steady progress until I would get stuck, exit, and the next time I played I would generally solve it right away.  There are no in-game instructions, but they aren't needed; just go and explore, observe your surroundings, and you'll figure out what to do.  (There is an in-game hint system, but I never used it so I can't comment on its helpfulness).  It took me just under 4 hours to finish, but would be quicker for some folks.\n\nBut why rush through the world? Unmechanical has a cool visuals, including rundown industrial areas mixed with oddly organic environments, not to mention the previously noted adorable main character. The simple controls also let you relax and enjoy the atmosphere: use arrows to fly, and hold down one button to use your tractor beam. I found the controls worked very well, and when picking up objects they felt appropriately \"weighty\".  \n\nMy only complaints are that controllers are not fully supported--they can be used in-game, but the menus require a mouse--not a big deal, but a little annoying as I usually use a tablet and so my mouse isn't always handy. I would also have liked to see more of the underground robots to make the world a bit more alive, but that's just my own personal preference.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game if you're not looking for a big challenge, but rather a nice world to explore while putting on your thinking cap :)", "timestamp_created": 1393221042, "timestamp_updated": 1393221042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9211052": {"recommendationid": "9211052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059401222", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1378181147}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really good little underrated game, little over demanding specs wise but still good.", "timestamp_created": 1393027023, "timestamp_updated": 1393027023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9190673": {"recommendationid": "9190673", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967658060", "num_games_owned": 1444, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1372111519}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is clunky but a fun time killer, pick it up during a sale.

Cute little puzzler with no instructions that relies solely on your capacity to pick up visual and logical clues to solve the challenges. ...Allright, there's always the F1 key to give you a small hint, but the game rarely is too difficult as to require you to use it (plus you will miss out on an achievement as well... you wouldn't want to do that..)\n\nThere might be a bit too much saving for my tastes, so that I always knew when I'd done something right. So subjectively, I never had a hard time with the puzzles, but solving them still felt rewarding. I somehow expected a little more out of the latter parts of the game, but the difficulty never really ramped up. I would have liked more physics-based puzzles, for instance. Maybe that is because of the overly simplistic game mechanic (only 1 action throughout), which limits the possibilities of interacting with the environment? I don't know.\n\nBut then I think that it's allright, because I gained the impression that the game places more emphasis on the great atmosphere created by the setting and music than on the actual puzzle challenges. Stunning visuals and good effects, I like. I had a great time indeed from the get-go, which isn't necessarily self-evident with such a premise. I did therefore hope to get a lot out of it, but my first playthrough took me a bit over 4 hours, and the second one only about half an hour to get all the leftover achievements.

(no reused puzzles/solutions) The enviroment and level design are well made and follow the game's atmosphere nicely.\n\nGame can be finished in about an hour at a casual pace, easy to put down and pick back up to if you need a break. Recomended mostly for it's quirky charm rather than deep puzzle solving. I think the only caveat was that the ending seemed fairly abrupt lacking a big finale, I thought I was only moving on to the next area then credits started rolling.\n\nWASD/arrow keys to move, spacebar/enter/Ctrl/Mouse1 to use your magnet for manipulating objects/switches.

Slightly buggy as you can get stuck particularly when carrying objects but meh, nothing a quick reload can't fix without losing pretty much anything.\n4. Felt most of the puzzles were too easy.

What a great puzzle game. Got so into it, so blown away by the beautiful and creative level design that I actually completely the entire thing on one pass, something I don't believe i've ever done before. There was one moment where I was quite tired (it WAS like 3am) and exited, but once I saw an achievement I knew i'd easilly be able to complete, I popped back into the game and ended up going on till the end. 4 Hours total ... which I find is a bit short for a game with such wonderful features. I know it was hard to create and all, but now what? I MAY be able to play the game another time or two, but other than that I'm done. It's all over. I can only hope the game gets good reviews and attention and the studios decide to continue on to a second installment. But that is doubtful considering the genre.\nThe ending was a tad anticlimactic, it didnt even have the wonderful atmospheric music that was at one point in the middle of the game very prominantly featured in a 'scene' that was hinted to in part of the trailer for the game. My point, THAT scene was COOL, and the ending should have at least been that cool or better.\nThe character you control has certain lifelike characteristics, likely part of the idea presented in the title for the game itself. Even the ending had me at least TRY to commit a 'humane' act prior to commiting to something more ... utilitarian? I gather this is exactly what was expected by the game creators. Bravo to them on a great game that makes you think.\nLevel design was phenominal!!! The atmosphere was moody and the special effects, especially when you went under water or into the dark, were an absolute delight and an outstanding use of the technology at hand (running on the impressive Unreal engine). Though a 2D platformer style game, the 3Dimensional effects of the environment was impressive and at times very deep and detailed.\nMusic was atmospheric and beautiful.\nPhysics is an absolutely integral aspect of the game, and it did not dissapoint. I dont know if a PhysX engine (via an Nvidia card) would have introduced anything extra into this game (if they even put extra support/effects for PhysX), but it ran beautifuly on my moderatly powered AMD A8 APU based laptop.\n\nIf you have any love for quality puzzle based games, this game is absolutely a wonder to behold. Though a tad short and questionably lackluster ending leave you wanting more, as a whole I'd say \"wanting more\" is a very good alternative to anything less.", "timestamp_created": 1373715059, "timestamp_updated": 1373715059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2146928": {"recommendationid": "2146928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003019731", "num_games_owned": 989, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1373425843}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00c0 primeira vista, Unmechanical parece um cruzamento bizarro de Machinarium com Portal 2.

Mas a obra independente consegue ir onde Q.U.B.E.  n\u00e3o foi, conferindo empatia ao seu personagem principal e algumas interessantes perguntas sobre o estranho complexo onde ele foi aprisionado.\n\nEm sua estrutura, Unmechanical \u00e9 formulaico: um protagonista capturado \u00e0 revelia e trancado dentro de um lugar onde cada sala \u00e9 um puzzle l\u00f3gico. Ao contr\u00e1rio de seu parente mais velho e maduro da Valve, este n\u00e3o tem um artefato surpreendente que resolve todos os problemas. O jogador s\u00f3 usa cinco bot\u00f5es, quatro direcionais e um para ativar o raio-trator que o robozinho possui. Para superar cada desafio, \u00e9 preciso uma farta dose de racioc\u00ednio, uma eventual coordena\u00e7\u00e3o motora e o uso inteligente de objetos espalhados aqui e ali.\n\nEnt\u00e3o, onde reside a riqueza de Unmechanical? No forte contraste entre a fofura e o horror. Mesmo sendo um t\u00edtulo onde \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel morrer, h\u00e1 mais suspense aqui do que em muitos survival horror modernos. O fr\u00e1gil her\u00f3i rob\u00f3tico \u00e9 apenas uma crian\u00e7a, prisioneiro de um lugar que remete aos por\u00f5es da Aperture, um espa\u00e7o vasto onde maquin\u00e1rio e formas org\u00e2nicas convivem em um casamento profano. A trilha sonora acentua o desconforto e recursos de ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o surpreendentes para um jogo indie t\u00e3o um tom quase g\u00f3tico ao ambiente. \u00c9 um jogo de terror para crian\u00e7as, uma f\u00e1bula interativa de Neil Gaiman com pitadas de Giger. N\u00e3o por acaso, em alguns momentos, meu filho confessou estar com medo. N\u00e3o por acaso, um dos dois finais poss\u00edveis \u00e9 desconcertante.\n\nNeste universo sombrio, a explora\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 incentivada. E \u00e9 not\u00e1vel a aten\u00e7\u00e3o aos detalhes colocados por seus desenvolvedores. Ou as pequenas pistas do prop\u00f3sito desta estrutura subterr\u00e2nea. Ao t\u00e9rmino da aventura, respostas esclarecedoras n\u00e3o s\u00e3o fornecidas. Foi uma viagem fant\u00e1stica por um lugar para ser visitado apenas uma vez.\n\nOriginalmente publicado em: http://blog.retinadesgastada.com.br/2013/07/jogando-unmechanical.html", "timestamp_created": 1373426422, "timestamp_updated": 1385488425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1353057": {"recommendationid": "1353057", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991952668", "num_games_owned": 3431, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1372456965}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a cute little game with nice clever puzzles.

The level design, the puzzles, the lighting, the controls - everything feels perfectly right here.\n\nTalawa Games seemed to aim at a casual yet challenging puzzle experience. There is no health bar and no enemies in the game, so you can entirely focus on exploring the world of Unmechanical and solving the puzzles, which sometimes are challenging but never get frustrating.\n\nIt's an easy-to-pick-up game and doesn't require reading the manual to get used to the controls - you just need 5 keys throughout the whole game. You steer the cute little robot with WASD/left thumb stick and activate your tractor beam with Space or X/LT/RT on your controller.\n\nUnfortunately, the playtime is only about 2-4 hours depending on your puzzling skills and getting some of the achievements is actually a bigger challenge than solving most of the puzzles in the game. Even though it would be great to see more of this game with new levels and puzzles, I feel that the length of the game worked out perfectly. Other games tend to repeat puzzles over and over to artificially stretch the playtime - fortunately, Talawa Games didn't do this with Unmechanical.\n\nUnmechanical is a casual and extremely relaxing game and the ambient music adds a lot to this, so it's the perfect game to grab a controller, sit back and enjoy some puzzling.", "timestamp_created": 1357500249, "timestamp_updated": 1385420694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3620369": {"recommendationid": "3620369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025309441", "num_games_owned": 902, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1357459200}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet, the puzzles are challenging but feel just right.", "timestamp_created": 1357462152, "timestamp_updated": 1357462152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2188793": {"recommendationid": "2188793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003726789", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472099209}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a short, fun puzzle game.

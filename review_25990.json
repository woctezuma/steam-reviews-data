You basically take the role of a GM and try to cajole your band of heroes into actually finishing the main quest already, while they would rather gamble, drink, and flee in terror from the assortment of horrible creatures that infest Ardania.\n\nThe big feature is that the NPC's are not controlled by you, and have their own particular likes, dislikes, and motivations based on their class roles and the game's lore background. Rangers are gonna range and explore the map for you, but the  unarmored melee specialist barbarian followers of the god Krolm allied with them in the past and saved their repective temple/guild so their AI has them forming a supportive adventuring duo that covers the others' weaknesses. The game is ripe with multiple interctions of that sort, and each class is fully voice acted, and it is charming and humorous as hell. There are so many interactions of this sort, most of the game is figuring out what works and doesnt, with every mission having multiple ways to finish them. There are no optimial builds for every mission, and it leads to tons of replayability. \n\nThe voice acting and music is superb, and my brother and I to this day, still use some of the lines as punch lines to our lame inside jokes. It all gets in your head in a good way, and fleshes out the NPC characters.\n\nThis game can be hard as fuck, but it is extremely fun and charming, and they just do not make games like this anymore. It's $10, take a chance and you'll be very surprised to find a one-of-a-kind game that has never been topped or surpassed nearly 20 years later.", "timestamp_created": 1516050357, "timestamp_updated": 1516050357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39131771": {"recommendationid": "39131771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105951052", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509579810}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was a childhood staple of mine and I played it for hours on end (beating every quest myself!), and it's aged remarkably well.

Not having to micromanage everything lends some novelty, as you desperately yell at your heroes to get out of the gambling hall to protect your castle from a horde of goblins since, as the king, you're stuck inside having to tell them what to do.\n\nOverall, this game is still amazing 20+ years after its creation, and there's certainly enough game there to be worth $10 since it includes the Northern Expansion for free!", "timestamp_created": 1515274099, "timestamp_updated": 1515274099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39068942": {"recommendationid": "39068942", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965071512", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515115284}, "language": "english", "review": "Played twice, crashed both times 15 minutes in. \nCinematics are just a black screen.\nOutdated graphics.

There are early peaks in how quickly you go through the tech tree in Majesty, and don't have anything left to do. You can build several Fairgrounds with Royal Gardens and Temples all around for fun while using the cheat to spawn waves of rock golems and dragons, but eventually, your heroes reach incredibly high levels, so nothing can challenge you. This usually happens within an hour or two of playing a mission, so the replay value is very small aside from completing scenarios.I bothered to write this since I got this game in a bundle with Majesty 2 just to see how that game is. Ultimately, the only reason to buy this is if you're just that curious to see what the game's about. I loved the game and bought this so I could play it at 1080p. Practically unplayable and stuck at slowest speed regardless of maxing out game speed. Would not recommend to anyone unless they fix this mess.

However, it does stray from RTS convention in one major aspect and that was enough for its developer, Cyberlore Studios, to have considerable difficulty finding a publisher even during the great RTS glut of the 90s.\n\nTo fully appreciate Majesty, you need to talk about RTSes in general. Now, the term Real-Time Strategy itself is a little generic -- Crusader Kings II, for instance, is real-time and it is a strategy game but no one would confuse it for an RTS. When gamers use the term, they're referring to very specific types of games -- games like Blizzard's Warcraft II and Westwood's Command & Conquer, the two titles released in 1995 that inspired the RTS glut.\n\nThese games required both speed (measured in actions per minute) and efficiency (through optimised build orders) and you needed tight control over proceedings for both. Control was important to such an extent in those 90s RTSes that your army would sit idly while the enemy was marching close by simply because you hadn't given your troops the attack order.\n\nMajesty's major deviation from RTS convention was to give its Dungeons & Dragons-inspired units autonomy and personality. Your units weren't manufactured goods and you didn't have total control over them. You barely had any. Instead of commanding and conquering in this game, you cajoled and hoped for the best. To entice your \"heroes\" to do what was required of them, you provided them with financial incentives attached to flags. You'd plant a Explore Flag with 200 gold to encourage exploration of that distant area of the map or plant an Attack Flag with 400 gold on the head of the Troll assailing the marketplace. This indirect approach could both be delightful (when the \"heroes\" performed unexpectedly heroic actions) and exasperating (when the \"heroes\" demonstrated precisely why sneer quotes were necessary).\n\nMajesty charmed enough gamers with its unusual approach in 2000 to warrant an expansion pack the following year and Majesty Gold bundled both together in 2002. By 2007, the game had sold an impressive 500,000 copies. While there was enough demand for more Majesty, Cyberlore once again had trouble finding a publisher. The developers sold the rights to Paradox which then tasked Russian developer Ino-Co to work on the sequel.\n\nReleased in 2009, Majesty 2 was an honest attempt to improve the design but the designers erred in giving the player greater control over the heroes. In doing so, the designers brought the game closer to conventional RTSes rather than taking the design further down the sim path.\n\nIt's perhaps telling that Paradox felt compelled to release an updated version of the original three years after the sequel was released. More remarkably, Majesty Gold HD was patched five years later by a Cyberlore developer who's apparently working on the game in his free time. Something about Majesty does seem to inspire loyalty and affection from everyone who's encountered it.\n\nThe key question, however, is whether anyone who's unfamiliar with the game could be tempted to play it today. The visuals are dated, the interface primitive and the core concept -- the \"D&D ant farm\" -- has been expanded upon by the likes of the brilliant Dwarf Fortress and its derivatives. All things considered, Majesty Gold HD's appeal today would mainly be to players of the original looking to revisit an old favourite.\n\nYet there could still be a place for a Majesty 3 or a spiritual successor to the series. A Sim D&D with Majesty's eccentric charm might strike gold even in today's cluttered market and if there's one lesson Majesty has imparted, it's this: when there's a sufficiently large financial incentive involved, someone will come along to claim that flag eventually.\n\n[b]Recommended for[/b]: anyone whose preferred pronoun is \"Your majesty.\"", "timestamp_created": 1486885696, "timestamp_updated": 1486928316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815491", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29578475": {"recommendationid": "29578475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168447825", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485724480}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just as wonderful as i remember it as a kid.

Basically you're the king of a kingdom and instead of controlling things directly, you control what happens by creating buildings such as guilds for heroes and marketplaces, creating heroes from those guilds, and then creating rewards for tasks for those heroes that they may or may not pay attention to. Basically, placement of buildings, micromanaging the research, production, and upgrading of different things, and planning on a high level are what wins the game.\n\nPros:\n- Funny dialogue from characters.\n- Different missions that require you to approach the game's mechanics in different ways.\n- An interesting set of buildings with unique mechanics.\n- The game is challenging but always fair. I have been attacked by dragons in the first 30 seconds of a mission and pulled through just fine.\n\nCons:\n- Dialogue repeats too much sometimes.\n\nAt first, it seems like the heroes don't do what they're supposed to, but you'll see that this is logical. If there is not enough reward, the task is far away and the hero is caught in the middle of something, or the task is too dangerous to get to alive then there is no way that it will get done.

It also allows for mods to be implimented into the game, which will either add levels, or that will change mechanics to a point.

worse.[/h1]\n\nIt is an old game, from 2001, which still works on windows 10 but with some problems.\nFirst you have to know that you have to install the HD version.\nBut the review can be only written for the original old version. So I had to install both in order to leave a review here.\n\nI experienced some minor problems so far:\n\n[list]\n[*] If I alt-tab, the window is resized and shown with false colors. I need to restart the game to repair it.\n[*] after playing more and based on comments, this is a feature: [strike]There is a mission where elves are your enemies. However, because they are normally your allies (units you can produce) they can enter my market to buy healing potions. First I thought that is a realistic approach :) But later when I placed a reward on their buildings, to encourage my fighters to destroy them, they also attacked their own buildings. But if they meet my units, they recognize them as enemies and they fight each other. I cannot say if this happens always because I noticed it only at the end of the mission when the bounty was increased and I was about to finish the mission anyway.[/strike]\n[*] Rogues can loot the gravestones of the fallen enemies. However, I got three rogues looking to my Mausoleum like hypnotized cats because they detect my buried heroes but cannot reach their graves. Again this is not a game breaking thing because it is cheaper to resurrect your heroes with spells before they are placed into the Mausoleum or if you have the money, you can save the game and by trial and error to resurect the one which was targetet by the rogue. Then the rogue will loot the living hero and  will continue with other activities.\n[/list]\n\nThe game seems to be difficult until you learn how each building and spell works.\nI tried to play it and I gave up, possibly being pulled away by other games.\nMany months later I tried again and now I like it.\nI recommend the game for those who like strategy games where your units have their own will.\nIf you have doubts, buy the game on sale, as I did.\n\nedit: added the bug with the rogues", "timestamp_created": 1471818174, "timestamp_updated": 1474208729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592582", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24767535": {"recommendationid": "24767535", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998105505", "num_games_owned": 3473, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1347174000}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've never played a pen & paper RPG in your life, and would like to know what it feels like to be a game master, then Majesty: The fantasy Kingdom sim will give you a taste of how it can feel.\n\nMajesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim is an old RTS (originally released in 2001) where you don't have direct control over your units. Instead you need to treat your units like you were the quest giver from an RPG, in other words, you need to bribe them into doing whatever you want them to do.\n\n[b]Graphics & sound[/b]\nThe graphics in Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim was considered to be sub-par back in 2001. The HD edition does not do much for the graphics, other than zoom out a bit further, and it's still not exactly a looker. That said, unlike many 3D games from 2001, the graphics in Majesty has not aged much. The detailed 2D art looks relatively appealing, far more so than the crude 3D graphics in many of its contemporaries.\n   \nIn terms of sound, Majesty won't set your world on fire. A single song loops in the background, and after a while you won't even notice it. The sound of units attack each other or peasants building things is not anything wrong write home about either. It works, but it's not great.\n   On the plus side, the voice acting is entertaining. A Sean Connery impersonator reads the mission briefings with enough conviction for it to work, and he also acts as the announcer during the missions. The game would not be the same without this voice actor, and it helps giving it a lot of personality. All units have their own voice lines as well, and they do a good job at conveying the personality of the units.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nMajesty does not have much of a story. You're the king of Ardania, and it's your job to make it prosper. Each individual mission does have its own backstory though, and while they are not \"good\" in the traditional sense, the mission briefings can often be quite entertaining to listen to.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nIn Majesty it's your job to build a typical fantasy village/town. You start with a castle, and then you build the kind of buildings you often see in fantasy RPGs, like market places, warrior's guilds, rogue's guilds, temples to different gods, dwarven workshops and so on. Most buildings are used to recruit heroes, while some offer services that the heroes can use, and at the same time generate some much needed money that you then can use to build more buildings, or recruit more heroes.\n   The heroes have wills of their own, which often aligns with their classes. A rogue is a greedy coward, so he's easily attracted to bounties, but if the going gets tough, the rogue will run away. A paladin on the other hand is brave and selfless, and while try to protect the weak, so she will go out and slay monsters on her own. A wizard is bookish, and prefer to read books in the library rather than fighting, and thus might need a really big bounty for him to take notice. There are plenty of different heroes, all with their own strengths & weaknesses, and some are mutually exclusive (sun worshipers won't work with moon worshipers, and paladins won't work with necromancers), so deciding what heroes to use is a strategic choice you need to make for each level.\n   The heroes also gain experience and level up. Fighting enemies will always give them experience, but certain heroes also have their own activities that will make them level up. A ranger that is exploring the map will for an example gain experience that way. This makes keeping your heroes alive really important. \n   Sadly the game is not perfectly balanced. Some heroes are better than others, and it's really easy to fall back on the same strategy for most levels due to this. Paladins for an example, while expensive, tends to be really powerful and thus are a better investment than necromancers. \n   Most of the game comes down to managing your economy. As long as money keeps rolling in, you can recruit more heroes, build more buildings, and cast certain spells. These spells are the only thing you can use to directly influence a fight, and they tend to cost a lot of money. But money spent on keeping your high level heroes alive tend to be worth it.\n   There's no linear level progression, instead you get to chose from almost any level right from the get-go, with only some levels requiring you to have beaten some other levels first. All the levels are randomly generated, based on certain parameters for each level, so there's plenty of replay value, even if the level layout can often feel a bit generic, due to its randomly generated nature. Majesty is also not a very hard game. Between the core game and the expansion, there are really only 2 levels that can be considered \"hard\". Many levels give the illusion of difficulty, but as long as you don't panic or give up when things look bad, victory won't be far off.\n\n[b]Final thoughts[/b]\nI love Majesty. Yes, it's a game with its share of flaws, but it's really fun to watch the heroes try to accomplish things. As someone who used to play pen & paper RPGs, I recognize the behavior of my old gaming group, they used to be just as bad at noticing the obvious as the heroes in Majesty are. ;) Fun is actually how I would describe the entire game, because while it might not be the deepest strategy game on Steam, it's one of the most entertaining ones.\n  \nSo if you like strategy games or RPGs (be it CRPGs or pen & paper RPGs), make sure to give Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim a try, you won't regret it (and don't forget that you can increase the game speed).\n", "timestamp_created": 1470608000, "timestamp_updated": 1470608000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24767482": {"recommendationid": "24767482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285764326", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468385414}, "language": "english", "review": "Great time waster in my opinion.

That Roman War game we got from our Kellogs Nutri-Grain Cereal (on a side note: Best marketing scheme ever. Nutri-Grain will always be my favorite cereal because of it) that I enjoyed summoning a bunch of Cars equipped with Rocket Launchers. Since this looked similar, and the man in the shops said it was, she bought it in hopes I'd enjoy it.\n\nI had mixed feelings with Majesty when I first aquired the game; I couldn't control where my people went and it was a lot harder than Age of Empires... even with cheats. As I grew up, I didn't have the best time in school (blah blah blah) so I spent a lot of my weekends and afterschool time in a cold room with only the 'family' (let's be real, it was mine. No one else used it because it was for 'nerds') Windows 2000 to keep me company. I listened to music, wrote a fantasy book - which was fueled with inspiration from Majest, Deltora Quest and Pokemon - and played MAjesty. As I grew up, I used cheats less and less, I began to enjoy the challenge a lot more.\n\nYears later I torrented this game onto my Compaq computer to play with for nostalgia sake in 2013, and loved everything about it. Nostalgia aside, this game is actually one of the most unique RTS games out there. It's nothing like Age of Empires or Starcraft, it's different. You can't choose what your NPCs do, or where they go. That's their job if they want armour, if they want to go potion shopping, or if they want to explore. You got to set rewards in the void of the unknown and on your opponents. That adds a challenge like no other to me, and for that I really enjoy Majesty although I don't play it much anymore.\n\nThe soundtrack is bliss too. Even if you're not going to play it, at least give it a listen. It's beautiful.\n\nThanks for keeping me company Majesty when I was younger xx", "timestamp_created": 1466072283, "timestamp_updated": 1466072283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661576", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23201485": {"recommendationid": "23201485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201386495", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 89427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505294024}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0451\u043b \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432. \u0418 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e.\n(\u0421) \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0435 MAJESTY.", "timestamp_created": 1464183175, "timestamp_updated": 1464183175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464963", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22989531": {"recommendationid": "22989531", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997282183", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 86400}, "language": "english", "review": "Played ages ago before Steam...such an innovative concept.", "timestamp_created": 1463276112, "timestamp_updated": 1463276112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509978", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22683581": {"recommendationid": "22683581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114650828", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464668605}, "language": "english", "review": "Majesty is a classic simmulator style builder/adventurer style game.

Majesty was developed by Cyberlore Studios. Majesty was released in 2001, Majesty Gold Edition was released in 2002, and Majesty Gold HD was released 2012.\n\nBefore people start typing up comments: the version you're getting covers all the predecessors, originally Majesty only had the bottom half of the levels you'll see in the single player game, Majesty Gold Edition included an expansion for the \"Northern Expansion\". Majesty was re-released in an attempt to be more compatible with windows 7 machines, two additional quests, and other minor bug fixes and improvements.  I'll elaborate on this later in my review, my apologies for making the -Quick Review- section too long.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662954883\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] Greetings Majesty! I am your cryer, I've been with your family through multiple generations, and..... What's that? I see... Yes... mmhmmm.... Sorry to cut the pleasantries short Majesty, but the kingdom is in ruins and only you can fix it, because you're the only one with the almighty power to instruct the peasants to build stuff!\n\nBy this point, most people are used to being the only competent operson in video games that can issue orders, and in strategy games it's typical practice. On that note, Welcome to Majesty! A game where [u]you don't control any characters, npcs, avatars, etc directly![/u]\n\"Woah, Woah, Atratzu!\" - I hear you exclaiming. - \"What kind of game are you ever talking about? If I can't do my 360 no scope's, or press A to jump, I don't think you're really talking about a video game.\" - Well never fear, my dear reader! I shall teach you the way of Majesty!\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] You play from the perspective of the \"Majesty\", you have 3 types of serfs: Tax collectors, Peasants, and Guards. You have some control over these characters, but you can only issue commands and they'll follow [i](except guards, they only patrol. But don't worry; their AI isn't that bad they're zealous zealots for you.)[/i]. In addition to serfs, the Majesty can issue several different commands, you can set bounties, order spells to be cast, and set building foundations [i](which the peasants will then go build)[/i].\nThat's it! I've actually covered the only powers the Majest has... crazy huh? \"Stop baiting us, Atratzu. You only write reviews this way when you really like a game.\" Wow! What a bunch of astute reader you all are!\n\nWe next move on to the mechanic that will MAKE or BREAK the game for you: Heroes. There are many different types of heroes, and I'll spare you a 'tutorial-review' explaining the differences, mainly these are different types of AI creatures running around and doing their own things. But as the Majesty you have some say in what they might do.\nFor example, say you have a blacksmith, and marketplace, if your hero has enough gold, he or she might purchase armor upgrades, or potions, or both if the hero has enough money. But which will the hero prioritize? I don't know, you'll need to watch them!\n\nIn a Way I feel like a Queen Ant [i](Don't look into this analogy too much, mmmmk? It's too late isn't it. *sigh*)[/i], I set up my nest, and then all my little babies run around doing stuff. While I myself am quite boring, I get to watch and see the adventurers the little ones are having!\n\nBefore someone dismisses my obviously nostalgia blinded perspective, the game challenges you by giving you different objects and restricting certain buildings to be built in certain missions. You might need to beat a mission using only archers and warriors. In one Expert-Difficulty Mission you cannot build ANY-GUILDS [i](You need to build guilds to hire heroes)[/i]: you can only hire heroes and pray to the Ardania gods that the Monsters don't melt your kingdom before you can explore enough to get help! So in a way, you could say Majesty is a combination of a \"puzzle\" and \"strategy game\", with many randomly generated elements.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662957053\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] There are no Steam Achievements for Majesty Gold HD. Sad really...\n\n[b]Price:[/b] Majesty Gold HD is priced at $9.99, actually... I think I still have my Majesty Gold Edition CD somewhere around my still packed up game library in my apartment. Majesty can be a pretty big time sink, since there's a lot of RNG going on in the background, which might make your play through more difficult or easier, you can easily sink more then 10 hours into the game, thereby making the price 1 dollar per hour [i](my value system is: I like every dollar to go towards an hour of gameplay.)[/i]\n\n*[b]Multiplayer and Optimization[/b] I don't normally care about Multiplayer, but I've noticed a handful of negative reviews complaining about it, and a lot of forum posts asking for help setting it up. Honestly I never cared to play multiplayer, it seems that some really tech savvy people in the community have come up with methods to play multiplayer, I'll include some links to articles if you want to do some reading and downloading to get it working. [i](It does seem that playing on a LAN would be easiest and the least painful, but not everyone has that option)[/i]\nRegarding Optimization, Majesty Gold HD may be more compatible with windows 7, but it sure didn't show up on my computer [i](I begrudgingly upgraded my gaming rig to windows 10. Don't get me started; I hated windows 8.1 on a desktop more)[/i], I had to make changes to the launch of the game so I could stream it over twitch, and get it into window mode. I've poked around and saw there are other suggestions for optimization, you can chose your favorite.\nRegarding the windows 7 optimization, I downloaded Majesty HD to my Win 7 laptop [i](Which is getting kinda old)[/i], Majesty Gold HD worked beautifully! So at this point I can say this much; Win 7 it works fantastic, Win 10 it works but not nearly as smoothly, and may require file tweaking or launch editing. [i](the Launch Edits that I did were: \"-useddblit -blitmovietobackground -w\" without the quotation marks)[/i]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662960961\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] I think it's pretty clear I love this game, as I mused to myself over twitch: \"Part of my love definitely comes from the flood of memories when I played it in the summer of my high school years, remembering the summer vacations away from school playing Majesty Gold Edition and listening to the radio... mom coming downstairs telling me 'DON'T YOU DARE SPEND YOUR WHOLE SUMMER INDOORS'.\" *sniff* brings a happy tear to Atratzu's eye.\n\nIt's clear *I* love this game, [b]but the real question is: Will you?[/b] The good news is that Majesty has been on sale for 75% off in the past, so you can wait until it's pocket-lint-price before trying it out. But if you're a very careful spender, you'll want to remember the key points of my review: You don't control, or do anything very direct. You Build, you cast spells. You're basically playing Fantasy Sim City. If that sounds fun, try it! If it sounds like a pain, might want to skip it.\nMajesty has aged, there's no doubt about that. Has it aged well? I think it has aged decently so far, because the sprites are more cartoon styled, but this game definitely isn't for everyone. I would suggest Majesty Gold HD to anyone whom enjoys older games [i](I should start calling them \"seasoned\", sounds more sophisticated!)[/i], strategy games, puzzle games, and fantasy game genre's. But, if your purchase will hinge on multiplayer and you're not willing to go through the work and jump through the hoops to get it... skip it.\nThanks for reading my review!\n\n*This is not a standard category added to Atratzu Reviews, but was found necessary to add for further clarification for the Majesty Gold HD review.", "timestamp_created": 1460320234, "timestamp_updated": 1460320234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699369", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22206444": {"recommendationid": "22206444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026669793", "num_games_owned": 607, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434658496}, "language": "english", "review": "Although titled the Fantasy Kingdom Sim, this game is in fact an RTS.

You have two types of banners: attack banners and explore banners that will reward your heroes with an amount of gold you set for attacking a monster or monster den or exploring a location, respectively. While this may sound hard to juggle, it really isn\u2019t and Majesty does a tremendous job of creating missions that are both challenging and fun.\n\nOne of my favorite games of all time, I can\u2019t tell you how many hours I spent playing this as a kid.

I played this game when I was a kid over winter break and had a lot of spare time to waste in randomly regenerating maps just because things went wrong.\n\nThese days, my time is more valuable. It's very annoying when your heroes make stupid mistakes like not attacking the ratman who's chasing your tax collector with 2000 gold right outside your palace, or when the dragon attacks you on day 2 or 3 before your palace is even developed and you don't even have a shot at winning unless you get very lucky right away with wizard blasts making contact as they dodge the dragon's breath.\n\nAlso, the game really isn't a \"Kingdom Sim\". There are early peaks in how quickly you go through the tech tree in Majesty, and don't have anything left to do. You can build several Fairgrounds with Royal Gardens and Temples all around for fun while using the cheat to spawn waves of rock golems and dragons, but eventually, your heroes reach incredibly high levels, so nothing can challenge you. This usually happens within an hour or two of playing a mission, so the replay value is very small aside from completing scenarios.\n\nI bothered to write this since I got this game in a bundle with Majesty 2 just to see how that game is.

The heroes will explore  the map on their own. They fight and gather items, and if the enemy they're facing is too strong they flee.

I have fond memories of playing it as a child, many times doing so for hours on end. The game brings with it a sense of wonder and magic and introduces you to fantastic lands, courageous heroes, and frightening monsters. It is truly one of a kind.\n\nWhere Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim shines is in its gameplay of indirect hero control, where instead of simply telling your subjects to do this or that, you provoke your heroes to action through offering bounties and rewards for completing tasks, offers which they may or may not accept depending on their individual temperaments and strengths. This feature adds a certain depth of strategy and difficulty as well as oftentimes bringing about frustrating situations - it really allows for unique, individual gameplay experiences and provides certain replayability value.\n\nAdding to the replayability value of Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim is the Freestyle Mode.

On the other hand, it's brutally tough, it's unfair, and its quests suck hard. So even though I recommend it, I only recommend it to those who like [b]extreme[/b] challenge.\n\nI love the idea behind Majesty, and I'm very sad that its levels were designed by masochists who have no idea what difficulty means. I like tough games, but they need to play fair. Majesty doesn't. Majesty enjoys sending hordes of tough enemies at you 30 seconds after mission start. Majesty enjoys directly targetting creatures at your certain structure (which of course must not be destroyed), even though you don't have a direct control over your heroes and the only thing you can do is rely on your luck or save/load approach. Have you ever seen eagles primarily attacking buildings? Well, in Majesty you will.\n\nThe overall problem is that even though you are not given a direct control over your heroes (which is absolutely great and I love it), the developers do not make the rest of the world consistent with this \"simulation\" approach. So, although some creatures just wander around, there are waves which doesn't and it doesn't make any sense, except for artificial difficulty.\n\nIf you want to finish this game, essential is\na) carefully reading a manual, or some web guides, because a lot of important features is not properly explained in-game\nb) slowing down time whenever there is a fight ('<' and '>' shortcuts)\nc) saving a lot, unless you want to repeat the whole level\n\nEven if you all of that, you'll need to repeat some expert levels at least once, because you'll need to learn what special events happen when (e.g. at the beginning of the third day, there is a wave of dragons targetting your elven lounge). And some levels have just one or two possible solutions and it's almost impossible to complete the level otherwise. You'll need to look at YouTube to see how to complete it.

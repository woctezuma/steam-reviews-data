The new ability called Brainclap which was introduced in this game is a great addition\n-Visually appealing with it's retro cyberpunk feel to it\n-Soundtrack is amazing and adds to the atmosphere and pace of the game\n-Improved AI, making the game even more challenging than its precursor\n-It has Steam Achievements\n-It's really cheap at R12 (~$1)\n\nCons:\n-Can't change the volume in-game, which can be pretty annoying as the game is very loud\n\nOverall, this game improves on the previous installment, but still retains the qualities that made UBERMOSH so amazing to play.

Also, an ability called Brainclap was added, which lets the player take out large swaths of enemies once they reach a certain amount of kills.\n- The price\n\nCons\n- No options menu to adjust graphics or sound settings, but the volume can be easily adjusted via Volume Mixer (For Windows users)\n- The player automatically picks up whatever gun they walk over which can be annoying, however once you get the best gun in the game it stops happening\n\nAlso to note, this game is much more difficult than the previous installment. Enemy AI seems to have been improved, there are less areas to take cover, and the achievements and the title of Blade Saint require many more kills. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as some may like the challenge, but it may be a reason for some to avoid the game.\n\nLike the first game in the series, I recommend this game to pretty much anyone, largely because of the price.

I like it. It looks good and sounds good. It's cheap. It's cool. But I have a lot to complain about.\n\nI don't understand what the game is really about. What skill does the game want to test? If it's reaction and twitch, there is the problem with some enemies shooting as soon as they appear on screen from all directions (and enemies coming from north and south gives less time for the player to react). Sometimes they don't shoot and I cannot tell when they will. There isn't any apparent pattern and there is definitely no 'signal' when they are about to shoot. There is also the problem with the player character being too slippery (seems to move in a grid), too fat, and too slow (shooting and slashing has a short recovery period, which is normally fine but frustrating here). \nI considered the possibility that this game is more about planning and positioning but the enemies are too fast for that and the maps are random or at least feels random, then there are the problems from I stated above. \nSure, I'm not as good at the game as I think I need to be but it feels like a lot of my failures are due to me being unlucky. I think there is a simple solution to most of my complaints: zoom out and/or square map so the player can see more threats as they move (or just minimap), and consistent shooting patterns and/or 'tells' for enemies. \n\nAlso, maybe it's just me but 'best class=no class', which is silly.\n\nADD: I can't find the volume slider.

This number is slightly different for each class, but from 50 to 60 in all cases.[*]CM Catalyst - Having played the class through several games, I can't find a functional difference between this class and Green (no CM), as they appear to function exactly the same.[*]New advanced/boss alien with a new gun.  Thsi guy is essentially the same as the brownish colored alien with the red gun, but he's a slightly different color and leaves a blue bloodsplat with a different gun - one with a better spread of bullets.  He's my new favorite alien, because I want his gun >:)[/list]\n\nThere's also a slightly different color scheme and, as mentioned, achievements for kills are doubled from the original.  This sounds formidable to the point of impossible, but the addition of Brainclap, which kills enemies as well as clearing bullets, and the new alien means there's better tools to do killing.  Playstyle will be very similar, but getting 300 as Kensai is indeed frustrating for a while; it's just about keeping on your game until your skill carries you through on a game where your luck is high, too.\n\nCompared to the first UBER, I give this one similar marks in all categories (soundtrack, intuitive controls, mildly wonky but predictable hitboxes, high replay value), and it's an easy, easy thumbs-up, worth every penny at it's price of $2.99.

It's only basically 1 level with some slight random variations, plus a variety of classes to choose from the change the gameplay a bit. The achievements available are listed right on the menu screen to motivate you to open a can of whoop-ass on the hoards trying to murder you. Seriously, I found them extremely motivating. The soundtrack is worth noting for sure - I don't know how many tracks there are, but the music doesn't get old even after a 2 hour play session. In fact, the music is one of the only things that kept me sane while I was on the  verge of rage-quitting, so there's that.\n\nThis game is truly bullet hell (veterans of the genre need to try the \"hardboiled\" mode\") but with an interesting game mechanic added that takes the gameplay beyond simply dodging enemy projectiles. \n\nAll in all, this game is dope. I don't know why I waited so long to buy it. If you are a competitive person who likes to rack up a high score, this game will provide you with several hours of gameplay for a low price. If you catch this game on sale, there's no reason not to buy it!\n\nIf you want to get an idea of the rage-inducing quality of the game, check out my gameplay video below.

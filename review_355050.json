(what more do you need)\n + Graphics is very nice for a top-down shooter\n + Level design\n + Sound\n + Upgrade system.\n\nCon:\n - prepare to repeat the previous levels for badges and stars over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over....... again.\n - (SUBJECTIVE) Level 5 - sorry, but seriously fuck that level. Either get hit by an EMP blast at the start, thereby disabling your weapons and dodging the bullets for the rest of the map (this is a TOP-DOWN SHOOTER game, not a TOP-DOWN DODGE game), OR avoid the EMP homming blast for the entire map forcing you to manover non-stop and shooting at the same time. For me this is not fun.\n - The game has only a few levels, but to complete those, you will have to earn badges which you can get by completeing the same levels on different difficulties, which you can only unlock if you got all the badges from the previous difficulty. so basically: \n - its a non-stop grind fest. Everything costs stars, even the ammo for the Shields, Bombs and the lasers. I basically don't use them because of this as sometimes on the map they drop ammo for them randomly and thats enough for me.\n\n\nAll-in-all the game is fun, but the grind feels abit too much at some point. Also the gandgets have no use if you need to spend stars on the ammo at every turn. I will be too focused upgrading all of my weapons before considering buying them, maybe at the end when I have upgraded everything but at that point i will get bored and move on to the next game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1514975610, "timestamp_updated": 1514975610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38948501": {"recommendationid": "38948501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119449502", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514839540}, "language": "turkish", "review": "[i]Eskiler ahh ahh,\nzaman\u0131nda Nokia S60v2 serisinin en iyi oyunlar\u0131ndand\u0131.\nO zamanlar neyse \u015fimdi de o, ayn\u0131 kalite ak\u0131yor.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1514836532, "timestamp_updated": 1514836532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38923682": {"recommendationid": "38923682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206673416", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 50, "last_played": 1515388952}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u9519", "timestamp_created": 1514779760, "timestamp_updated": 1514779760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38906469": {"recommendationid": "38906469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085900270", "num_games_owned": 788, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514736300}, "language": "schinese", "review": "2018\u5e74\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u7bc7\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u636e\u8bf4\u662f\u6839\u636e\u624b\u673a\u7248\u79fb\u690d\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4e4b\u524d\u6ca1\u73a9\u8fc7\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u5c31\u5f88\u4e0a\u763e~~~\u5173\u5361\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u591a\u4f46\u662f\u53cd\u590d\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u6162\u6162\u5347\u7ea7\u5f88\u6709\u8da3\u5473~~~", "timestamp_created": 1514736579, "timestamp_updated": 1514736617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38884292": {"recommendationid": "38884292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035886955", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 1540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 416, "last_played": 1516067737}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Excelente.\nSimples e excelente.

You play, gain the in-game currency and invest in development of your plane. Levels become easier and easier as you progress with your small plane and unlock the addons. Average developed plane will do just fine to beat the game on normal difficulty and a casual gamer will stop playing the title then. 8 levels + 9th bonus one. 4 to 6 hour will do fine for casual gamer. That's why I expect regular people to judge it 6/10. Graphic is colorful, well looking and fps level is above avarage making the game smooth like butter and catchy. My GF said: \"oh what's that, looks fine?\"\n\nBut those who really looks for the shmup challange will progress with unlocking all levels on higher difficulties where the fun begins. Enemies are more powerfull, faster and the screen begins to be tight as Sasha Grey. Game begins to punish every single mistake. Beating level on insane difficulty will force you to memorize the level and to get some strategy before you start how to alocate your extra resources. It took me about 22 hours to beat the game and unlock all the achivements.\n\nIf you will try to get all the achivements join the discussion group where people are adding each other to rescue each other (after crush - no need to play at the same time).\n\nThere are only 2 cons of the game:\n1)  \"House of Cards\" achivement. My suggestion for everyone trying to get it is to make a break in playing this title. It looks like the card drop algorithm is time based forcing you to return after one or two days to get the new drop. I played like 40 level in a row to get the last card. I made two days break and it occured just at the first try.\n\n2) Only 9 levels. Obviously minus :)\n\nIf my review helped you please feel free to rate it and add me on steam.

She was on auto-fire, using the keyboard, so not having to worry about much and we were able to play together. The levels were not super long so she never felt stuck in something.\n\nPlaying as a ghost on level 5 was a good way for her to train (I have the card) ;) Let it be known that she joined after I had got to the 8th stage and got the plane mostly upgraded, so not starting on the beginning with the super weak base plane...\n\nI showed her SFR and she looked forward to playing it if I were to buy it which I may.\n\n\nAs for me, I usually dislike grinding, but I enjoyed this game quite a bit. I finished it but will keep going after all achievements which I usually don't do, because it's feasible and fun enough. Having said that I do dislike the fact that the game is blocked until you have enough medals, ie enough achievements... It'll prevent bad players or people that just don't want to grind medals to move forward. I also dislike the fact that we have less missions than on Android, even though the 9th says that more should be coming after us.\n\nThe story is never explained, it would have been nicer to get a little more, or nothing at all, I don't get the point of what we get. The game also needs a way to remove upgrades, it's too boring to get all medals in the first stage after the plane is maxed out, but I also don't want to keep doing the same stage over and over before doing anything else.\n\nThe game is not for colorblind people, as sometimes it's a bit difficult to know what is coming at you, especially under clouds ;)\n\nThe game is also not very long, only 9 stages, each one being fairly short. Without grinding/going for medals, it would not take very long, and that's kind of a cheap way to build a game.\n\nOverall, for a low price, I had a lot of fun, and was happy to share it with a non gamer.

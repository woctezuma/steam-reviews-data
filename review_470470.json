The graphics are cute, and the beat box sounds were fun and the game itself takes some skill to master.  End of positives.\n\nI honestly wouldn't even pay the $1.99; more like a 99c game or whatever you value 30 minutes of time at. There are only 8 levels in campaign which can be completed in just half an hour. There is no achievements, cards, menu options or any of the final touches I like to see.\n\nLocal multiplayer is available; but I have never once utilized it. (in any game). If I did have friends and they wanted to play something locally it would be a much better game. So to highlight that element above others is weak.\n\nOverall, it's cool but only worth $0.50-0.99. 30 minutes of Game-play.\n\n[code][h1] Accidently Reviewed[/h1]\nHundreds of Reviews, Thousands of Members and FREE games for you!

Even at the full price I would recommend this game. It's such a simple concept that can get you hooked. My friend and I played through career mode together and had a blast, I would recommend playing through this to get a grasp on the controls. The level editor is very cool and gives you options to create arenas that force you to employ different offensive / defensive strategies. The addition of this level editor gives us so many more hours of playtime and it is completely interractive between every player which is very neat. The art style and music is simplistic and enjoyable, which ties in with the mood of the game. The only bug I have found is that some of my saved levels do not save properly or will overwrite eachother, otherwise this game has been nothing but joy. The gameplay is simple, addicting, and polished. Very fun couch co-op / party game. At 2 bucks, I'd buy this for all my friends so when I come over we can play. \n\nFor the developer: If sharing levels online was possible, that would be cool. I would love to see maybe some more modes instead of just \"score into a net.\" Cups like best of 5 or 7 games would be neat.

The cheers of the crowd provides satisfaction for each goal, the flash of being hit, the little simple sound effects are pleasant. It's hard to decide whether it needs some extra spark.

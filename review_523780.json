A visual novel set in an IM client in the mid '00s about characters in their last year of high school. I have to say the writing and look/feel of the client are perfect.

There aren't any twists and turns, and choosing the obviously 'correct' dialogue options leads to a happily ever after.\n\nIt's a cute little nostalgia indulgence for an evening.

It sounds easy, and it is, especially in ones that just ask you what your favorite music or game is.\nBUT, there is one specific question that has to do with family that each girl words completely differently. They sound like totally different questions, so naturally I answered differently. However, that ruined the game for me and literally guaranteed a bad ending for me as early as chapter 2 (of 5).\nHere are the questions, verbatim:\nEmily: how about you after college, do you want to settle down like right after?\n(my answer: no)\nEvelyn: what are your plans after college, do you want a family?\n(my answer: yes)\nAs you can see, Emily specifically asked about RIGHT after college, where as Evelyn asked about after college in general. I tried to answer both as honestly as possible. My personal plans are to start a family but not until 10 yrs or so after school.\nI liked the first Emily is Away game because it showed a realistic rendition of how people drift apart. It was heartbreaking, but so so real.\nHowever the reactions of the characters in this story are not realistic at all.\n**spoilers below**\n[spoiler]\nI ended up dating Emily, and it was going really well, I felt endearment to both characters on a deep level and I was enjoying the experience. Then in chapter 5 Evelyn tells Emily that I wanted a family, and Emily thought I didn't. Emily sees this as me flat-out lying and suddenly doesn't trust anything I ever said, and said I manipulated both her and Evelyn. I am never truly given a chance to explain myself, I have to say I lied to Evelyn to try to damage control. The game makes it seem for a moment that I could possibly fix this mess, but no I can't.\nIt felt like a super videogamey moment, like I gave the \"wrong\" answer in a silly quiz that happened at the beginning of the game. Like yeah, I can replay the game, but what's the point? It won't feel as meaningful and I'll just have to reread a shitton of text just to change one answer of one question in one chapter.\n[/spoiler]\nAnyway, it's a really good game with mostly good writing and ideas. Most people will have a good experience with it, I think.

set up on the ol' chat services from the 00's\nThe game now takes most of your answers in consideration. Unlocking special dialogs and paths. \nWhile this is great, the only 3 available options could be translated onto \" Strongly Agree, Doubt, Disagree\". Wich may end up feeling as if the main character (you) didn't had any bias towards any outcome. Wich is great, but most of the time you'll be only responding to actual events, unlike EIA 1. You'll eventually feel the game extremely linear despite the choices you could take. The addition of downloads and the time attacks is extremely appreciated.\n\nThe story is... okay at best. No tension, textbook drama and overall the game highlights the best outcome due to it's poor writing. While it encourages players to replay and choose different outcomes, it really lacks the motivation to do so. Emily is now extremely bland, even in the best case scenario you won't feel any kind of attachments. Main Character is now way more confident on it's answers, at first it struggles to express himself but he can end up being a prick to both girls wich just creates a narrative dissonance breaking all inmersion.\n\nWhy do I still recommend this game? Because it's absolutely beautiful, and absolutely worth the price.

They say Christmas is time for magic and miracle and guess what, by accident Humble Bundle made a mistake with my account and made an unwanted purchase with my wallet I went to the website and see what game was bought by mistake and I saw this was it. And this is where a night of my life turned to tears:\n\nWhat I am writing here is based on a true life story, 11 years ago in 2006 it was my first online game experience on GameSpy Arcade and I met someone that I had no idea she was a girl. We were talking for a while then when she gave me her MSN (If you are old enough you know what that is) I saw the photo I asked her if she is a girl she laughed and she said yes. I asked her name and it was \"Emily\".\n\nAfter 3 months just talking on the internet one day she asked about my music taste and we had a very different music taste. But it was interesting for her (exactly like how it goes in this game). I was living in Iran by the time and she was from England. We had no way of seeing each other so all we could do was just to chat. She talked about her video games she liked Sims and Crash and I liked shooters and strategies. It truly was a shock for me but in this game one of the profile pictures you can take is \"Company of Heroes\" which was the game I was playing day and night back in 2006.\n\nShe spent a lot of time training my English and she was very successful. After a while I really started to feel for her although it was only internet. It even got to a point that I was dreaming that I was meeting her in person. She was very keeping in showing her emotions she was a very strong girl and very grown up in behaviour. We kept our connection for 7 years but it had up and downs.\n\nIn March 2014 we got in to a very bad argue over internet because of college she had moved to Germany and I was doing my best to go there I even learnt German but embassy rejected me just cause I was born in Iran although I even passed the German test which again was thanks to her help over internet teaching me German cause she was studying it. She started to be realistic saying this is going no where and we will never meet. I did not want to accept that I pushed it way too much that it really got scary for her and she ended all the connection ways by blocking me. I was very upset I had a pain in my heart that I really can't describe. I never had this feeling for any girl before although I had met them in person and not internet but I never ever did feel any pain like that night.\n\nIt took me a week to get over it. I started my swimming classes and I completely forgot about all of it. I am not sure how many of you played this game through \"Emily\" side but me and her had a nickname for each other and the nickname I chose for her 10 years ago does exist in this game with a little bit of difference. I was calling her \"Mimily\" and she was calling me Prince of Persia.\n\n4 months ago I came to Poland because for some reason I ended up being accepted to work for a video game company here in charge of MK X and Injustice for PC and many other games. One night I was walking in one of the streets in Warsaw and I saw this big hotel called \"Marriott\" which was Emily's surname. Believe me or not go to google and search it yourself, this hotel is located in a street called \"Emili\" and right on the other side of this hotel there is a small restaurant called \"Prince of Persia\". Can you imagine the feeling I had that night?\n\nI dated many girls in these 4 years but none was something I could feel in my heart like I did with her. Every time I was reading a chat line in this video game it was like a sparkle of my past coming back to me. I feel like it was made for me, I have no idea how this is possible but if this is not miracle then what is it? Signs?\n\nThank you all for reading this, maybe I wrote too much off topic but I hope you understand how this game effected me and made me to type all these lines here.", "timestamp_created": 1514932914, "timestamp_updated": 1515327606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826649", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38987069": {"recommendationid": "38987069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159284679", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514924570}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u044e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c, \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0448 \u0443\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e \u043d\u0435\u0439.\n 10 \u0444\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0437\u043e\u043d \u0438\u0437 1 (\u044f \u043d\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0447\u0443 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c)", "timestamp_created": 1514924857, "timestamp_updated": 1514924857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38985865": {"recommendationid": "38985865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088952381", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514922772}, "language": "turkish", "review": "\u00c7OK \u015e\u00dcK\u00dcR \u0130LK OYUNDAK\u0130 G\u0130B\u0130 FRIENDZONE YEMED\u0130M.

It does a great job of evoking that universal sense of overly-emotional teenage angst and stirring up nostalgia for early-mid '00s internet life. Unfortunately, the game's potential for telling an impactful story is sabotaged by overly simple dialog logic trees that eventually railroad you into a confrontation that makes no sense and ultimately ruins the immersion.\n\nThe first (and more forgivable) of the two major offenses were the Chapter 3 conversations that continuously speed up until it becomes physically impossible to maintain a conversation with both characters in a satisfactory amount of time. In my case, my conversation with Evelyn derailed with her saying [spoiler]\"i was so mad, i punched him and just started yelling at him\"[/spoiler] and following up with [spoiler]\"what the fuck? are you even listening?\"[/spoiler] literally THREE SECONDS LATER. Even for characters that are supposed to be young (17? 18?) and easily upset, no reasonable person would flip out and shut down over a delay this short, even during an important conversation. \n\nThe decision to format the game this way, even as a fork-in-the-road means of forcing you to choose how you focus time on one character, is sloppily done from a gameplay standpoint and totally egregious from a storytelling perspective; outside of someone with diagnosed, untreated manic issues, which Evelyn is never hinted to have, no real person would react this way. It totally ruins the moment.\n\nThe major experience-ruining story issue occurs in the last chapter. In my case, the game took an offhand, one-sentence comment I made -- something that many people could plausibly say in casual conversation, and could easily change their mind about later -- and threw it back in my face as a colossal \"lie.\" (It's seriously something minor; not a lie, not even something intentionally misleading. Something many people would consider an opinion more than a declaration of intent.) The other characters react to it (again, something completely innocuous that could EASILY be explained away) as though they had caught me at the scene of a murder with a smoking gun in my hand. The game seems to provide you with an opportunity to explain yourself after this confrontation, but all the dialogue options are a bunch of feckless, directionless word salad that get you no closer to any obvious explanations or reassurances.\n\nHonestly, the most frustrating part about it to me was that I went out of my way to be honest with the other characters throughout the entire game, yet had it torpedoed two hours later over a total misunderstanding. I don't know whether to describe it as the fruitless product of writer's block or just plain laziness, but the clumsy ending to the story over a completely unrealistic interaction between characters ruined the entire experience for me.\n\nWith some fine-tuning to the interactions and script, this could be a highly recommended experience. As it is, it's more liable to frustrate than engage.\n\nI really enjoyed revisiting YTMND's heyday, though.", "timestamp_created": 1514873183, "timestamp_updated": 1514873183, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675500", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38962554": {"recommendationid": "38962554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151890254", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514981463}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

I remember playing it a long while ago and thinking a lot about it. When I saw a close friend gush about how good Emily Is Away Too is, I decided to pick it up on sale with some Steam funds, and I thoroughly do not regret it.\n\n[h1]STORY: 10/10[/h1]\nIn Emily Is Away Too, you play as a friend of the characters Emily and Evelyn, two characters who you chat with over the fictional EOL service. You're all teenagers rounding off high school in senior year. And just like we all experience in high school, whether or not senior year, there's themes of depression, anxiety, relationships, changing interests, what to even do with life after high school. As somebody in high school right now, this hits right on home. And boy, this game reels you in and when you slip up and mix up one name, it scolds you. It makes you feel hurt because you were paying more attention to Evelyn than Emily. And it stings, because you know how that feels to try and balance two friendships. It hurt when I first messed up. It hurt so bad that I logged out of the game and closed it, to come back to it in a couple hours after playing something a bit lighter. This game is all the pain of high school in one small chat client.\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS: 7/10[/h1]\nSeriously, I can't expect much for a pixelated game in a chat client. It's basic. Maybe this means I should get rid of this category, because it generally means nothing. It's not like you can't see anything, so I think it's pretty good.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY: 8/10[/h1]\nEmily Is Away Too is a typing simulator. You choose your icon, you set up your description, and you choose from up to 3 messages to send to Emily or Evelyn. These texts determine your relationships with these characters, and, as stated above, can make or break those relationships. [spoiler]For example, I had a GREAT relationship with Emily, so great that I would call her \"Em\" instead. When I mistakenly replied to her relationship problems using the name \"Steve\" as her boyfriend instead of his actual name, she was very upset.[/spoiler] Sometimes Emily and Evelyn will send you links to fictional websites, which open in your actual browser, and are knockoffs of websites we use daily like Youtube and Google and Facebook. You can listen to music on these sites, send friend requests, and click around.\n\n[h1](RE)PLAYABILITY: 10/10[/h1]\nThere are so many routes you can go. With the emotional attachment you get to Evelyn and Emily, I'm hoping you choose the ones with the best outcomes. You can say \"deuces\" or \"howdy\" or \"that sucks\" or \"**** that guy!\". The choice is in your hands. Will you make Emily and Evelyn happy? Or will your relationships slowly fall apart as you drift away from one, the other, or both?\n\n[h1]OVERALL: 9/10[/h1]\nEmily Is Away Too is a great game. Emily Is Away Too is an amazing game. It's not just a text simulator, it's reliving the memories from friends in high school simulator. It sucks you in and tears you apart. If you're looking for a lighthearted jaunt with Emily, you're not going to get it here. Buy this game. Buy this game if you want to feel truly hurt for messing up. Buy this game if you're also bad at making quick decisions.

That transition and realationships do not mix, and that in reality it is usually worth it to just shake hands and go your separate ways, instead of plugging holes in a sinking ship. even if it is a very new, fancy ship you worked very hard for. \nNow obviously the second lesson is a little meatier, so I'll start there. In the game, your character is wrapping up their highschool career. This is vital to the story, we will come back to it. You start AIMing with two girls, Evanlyn and Emily. The latter more bookish, while the prior is more of a teenage punkier sort of charcter. As you build your friendship and overall relationship with both, you will hopefully seduce one blah blah blah you know the rest. Drama and difficult sacrafices ensue. (None of which are very unrealistic whatsoever). However, if you play the game with that positive twist, and hopefully end up dating one of them, the positive endings are just, meh. Unsatisfying. Whimsical. Fluffy. And then if youre anything like me you play again with a negative twist and find that the end where you leave them behind and go into college a fresh start, is much more satisfying as a story arc. It sucks, and feels like a real punch in the gut, but it is the truth.\n\nThat is the amazing thing about this game. It is written so well, that people without a face and unstable identities (they are indeed very much teenagers) can make you feel such intese emotion, and really sear these lessons into your mind. Using nothing but good writing, and incredibly outdated technology. \n\n10/10 IGN", "timestamp_created": 1514714797, "timestamp_updated": 1514714797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485981", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38894000": {"recommendationid": "38894000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200626783", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513622834}, "language": "turkish", "review": "\u0130lk oyunun denemesini oynam\u0131\u015ft\u0131m.

It had me extremely invested, and brought back some memories from the past that in some cases I'd rather forget. Throughout I felt like i really was talking to these people. It al felt real. Like soemthing that could very much happen.\n\nYou struggle between the friendship of two potential love interests. The game relies on this and makes the price of it worth it compared to it's free predecessor, as well as an overall longer playtime (though not by much).\n\nAs this was written the game had taken me about 2 hours to complete. It shows you how little mistakes and accidents (like telling a semi-different story to one than the other, or not answering a message in time) can really affect the story as far as I can tell. The game has multiple outcomes and options, giving it a much better replay value than the first game did, and I found myself to be much more into the game this time around as well.\n\nI felt love and joy within this story, I found confusion and anger, i found sadness and emptiness. and while these can't always be helped, I found this game had a pace that felt all too real. Yeah, you meant well but it can lead to bad outcomes. This feeling of regret knowing what you could have done better is incredible, and like i said: real. You get those \"oh no\" feelings, and when you do something right (like possibly getting together with one of the characters), it feels really good. \n\nI would reccomend this to just about everyone, and while it didn't give me a new perspective on life or anything like that, It left me with a sort of \"shook\" feeling. How you just gotta deal with these actions and try to work out all of this. \nI'd probably buy it full price, but if you arent sure, play the first game, then come back for an even better experience. If it is on sale, but it now. It's worth every cent for less than five bucks.

It delivered a painfully plausible experience, a realistic (if distilled) depiction of what it\u2019s like to slowly drift away from someone you used to be close to. Central to that experience was the inevitability of the singular ending, and the way the game slowly takes away player agency as you approach it.\n\nEmily is Away Too has none of those things. Plausible and realistic are not words I would use to describe it at all.\n\nEmily is Away Too gives you the option to converse with two girls this time rather than one, but only covers senior year. Rather than covering the tearful goodbyes that typically punctuate one\u2019s final year of highschool or re-delivering on that feeling of separation, however, Emily is Away Too instead tells the story of a cheap highschool drama, the kind you could likely find in teen novels anywhere. If the game\u2019s goal was to make you feel frustrated with the idiocy of teenagers, then it succeeded. If it was going for anything else, it failed miserably.\n\nEmily is Away Too also feels distinctly gamey and unrealistic in your conversations with the two girls. In a few points during the short narrative there are time limits on how quickly you need to reply to one or both of the girls. Conceptually, this is fine, as it adds a layer of urgency to the game. In practice, it\u2019s frustrating; sometimes you have as little as a few seconds to choose and type your reply, when in real life I\u2019ve sometimes taken minutes to carefully consider what I want to say in a serious conversation. I\u2019ve never had anyone respond as vitriolically to my delays as the girls do here; in fact, I\u2019ve never had anyone complain at all. There\u2019s also the fact that a single contradiction at the beginning of the game can ultimately net you a \u201cbad end\u201d with one of the girls calling your entire relationship fake and a lie. More frustrating is the fact that this \u201ccontradiction\u201d might not even be a contradiction at all. In my case, I told one girl I could maybe see myself having kids in the future, and told another I could maybe see myself not having kids. Both are true (as I don't know what I want with regards to children yet), and I didn\u2019t lie to either girl, but the game gave me no chance to offer this explanation, and I was called an intentional manipulator and liar. Like I said, if the game\u2019s goal was to make you feel frustrated with the idiocy of teenagers, then it succeeded. If it was going for anything else, it failed miserably.\n\nUltimately, this game failed to deliver a unique experience or one as poignant and painfully plausible as the first game did.

While the story is very cool and interesting, it just didn't hold my interest as much as other ones. It just felt incomplete.\n\nFrom what I can tell, there are 2 endings, [spoiler] one where you choose Emily and other where you choose Evelyn. [/spoiler] It made me feel like none of my actions held weight, cause it would come down to 2 happy outcomes. If there was a chance of getting a bad ending, I didn't see it. I tried being the meanest person I could, and it still ended in me being with someone. I'm not saying all games need to end badly, but it felt like the creator got too many complaints about the first ones unhappy ending and decided to remove it.\n\nOne thing I DID enjoy were the secret codes. They would allow you to see secret profiles and even talk to them. And there were a lot: Youtubers, TV shows, other games. I didn't get them all simply because I haven't seen/played the material, but the ones I did get were hilarious to read.\n\nI also liked the fake website idea, where they linked to YouToob videos or Facenook pages. It was funny to see the blocky imitations of websites.\n\nAll in all, I didn't really like this one as opposed to the first one. Mostly because I paid to see this story. I don't really want to say \"Don't get it\", but I think I'm gonna have to on this one.

Great for if you don't have any real life friends.\n\nThe game has two paths, you can choose to get close with Emily or Evelyn. Choices you make dictate how much they like you and so on down the path. The game gives you three options to choose from as responses to things the girls ask or say, and you can mash your keyboard as the game types it out for you. The game isn't really hard since if you are just honest and polite you can beat it. My first play through I got a good ending with Emily and I honestly wasn't even trying, I was just being lazy. Not saying the game is bad by any means for being easy for people with souls, but it's nice to play a game where the plot twist isn't a \"Screw you for being a nice guy\". \n\nYou can also customize your profile pic as well to add a little customization to your life.

If you have 5 bucks to spare, and you are someone who does multiple playthroughs of a game to get multiple endings, I'd reccomend it. (SPOILERS AHEAD)\n\nLet me start by saying the general aesthetic of the game, its sound effects, the background noise, the clicks of the computer that are in game, are well done and really help to make you feel like you are on a computer from 2006. This game does style very nicely and I liked the touch of giving you a desktop background to choose from, as well as the many fake old websites such as YouToob.\n\nAs far as characters go, everything is pretty believable and seems real up until a bit of chapter 3 and (if you got the ending I got) chapter 5. In chapter 3 there is a mechanic that you have to reply to a girl in about 5 seconds, or they get really upset with you. This kinda felt weird because in reality if you dont reply to someone in 5 seconds they're not gonna freak out and say fuck you and go offline. Although I do understand why it was done and I do think it added a semi-fun mechanic, it was still a bit weird. Chapter 5 had a major issue if you picked a specific couple of answers, but I'll get to that next.\n\nNow, for my major issue with the game. As you're playing you'll quickly realize one of the main mechanics is about not lying about what your character does. As I played through this game I built up who my character was in my head and what he has done, and for the most part this game allows you to do that... except in two cases (that I've found.) One of them is about being a virgin or not. Now, I decided that my character has only ever gotten to third base with someone, so when Eve asked me if I've had sex in the past, I picked \"Well kinda..\" (or whatever option was closest to that.) The game then autocorrected that to \"Yes,\" even though I did not pick that option. I later told Emily what I thought my actual character did, which was getting to third base.\n\nThe second choice that was weird was about having kids. I told Eve that I would like to have kids in the future and settle down, but I also told Emily that I can respect her viewpoint in life of not wanting to settle down right away, as I'm not sure anyone would be 100% sure to do that, and because so much can change over time. I never specifically told her I did not want to have kids.\n\nIn chapter 5 Eve tells Emily that I wanted to have kids and that I was not a virgin when talking to her. This is weird in multiple ways. Why was Eve telling my girlfriend about personal stuff like that, and why were they discussing everything I've said like I'm in court or something? The OTHER problem is, when Emily eventually messaged me to say \"Fuck you liar,\" I really didn't KNOW what I had lied about. And that's when it hit me (mostly because the game told me.) Because of the way the game dances around the kids question with Emily, and because of the fact the game DELETED one of my answers and put in another one, it robbed me of a good ending that I spent 2 hours trying to get. I did end up playing again, going for Eve, and getting a good ending but I really should've gotten that ending from the start.\n\nThat brings me to my next point, which is should you buy this game?  I usually look at games at a 1$ = 1hr rule. If I am spending 5 dollars on a game, I should get 5 hours of enjoyment. If I am spending 40, I should get 40 hours. I got this game on sale for 2.49$, and with that, my first playthrough was 2.7 hours, meaning I got my money's worth. But, even with a second playthrough, I still only have 4.1 hours in the game. So, if you're planning on playing through this game only once, you should wait for a sale.\n\nOverall even with it's problems I'd give this game a 7/10. If the kids issue is made more clear to choose and if the game is patched to NOT correct the \"well kinda\" answer into \"yes,\" then it would be 8.5/10.

The story was unique and compelling, and brought an amazing sense of nostalgia and realism to playing the game that reflects highschool and college relationships in a brutally realistic way. The first game explored a relationship between the player and Emily, and their transition from highschool to college life and the reality of growing apart. No matter what choices you made or how you played the game, the player and Emily were going to grow apart. This was a major reflection on the situation that a lot of kids feel as they grow up. People grow apart and sometimes fairytale endings just don't exist no matter what you do to try and get one. It was a gorgeous story of adolescence and heartbreak, portrayed through the conversations of two teenagers over the nostalgic aol messanger.\nComing from the first game, I was so excited for Emily is Away 2. I was excited to explore the relationship of these two characters before they split and why it was so heartbreaking for the player to lose her in the first game. I was ready to have my already crushed heart burned and run over. But this game was absolutely not what I was waiting for. I bought this game soon after it came out, a tissue box by my side. However, what I got was a dating sim. Now some people may enjoy that type of game, Emily is Away was so much more. The characters were deep and complex and somehow the decisions you made never seemed to work out in the end, speaking on the true reality of highschool friendships. This entire theme and complexity was invalidated by this game. A new character is introduced as a romance option, and you can choose to flirt with her or Emily. Where the original game was meaningful and heartbreaking, this game was shallow and lost all meaning by turning Emily into a stereotypical highschool girl that could be swayed by a kind word. This is not the truth of the world. The first game was so successful because of the inevitable truth that it portrayed. That truth is lost in this game. I wish I had never bought it, as all of the beauty of the first game was washed away by this superficial dating  sim.", "timestamp_created": 1514059906, "timestamp_updated": 1514059906, "voted_up":

It will change the path of the story. Choose carefully.\n\nThe game is chalk full of nostalgia and easter eggs, so you have to keep a lookout for those. The game also sends actual links to you and puts files on your actual desktop, so be sure to open them. They're full of nostalgia, information, and funny stuff. I thought it was a really cool concept in the previous game, and they've only took it even further.\n\nThe writing of this game is also quite good. The \"teenage\" speech is cringy, but at the same time nostalgic. The conversations actually do touch on many teenage subjects and some important topics, life lessons, and themes. I found myself immersed and it brought me back to my elementary and teenage years. It was an awesome experience to be engrossed in for around 3 hours.\n\nGreat game, and there is definitely replayability if you wish to explore both Emily and Evelyn's route.

Kudos to the devs for that. [/spoiler]\n\nAlso, the dialogue is [strike] really great [/strike] grand! It feels like a genuine conversation between two close friends and not a plotted conversation written by a man in his 50s.\n\nEverything about this game draws you into the games world\n\n\n[b] Now for the negatives: [/b]\nThe game is pretty short (my first playtrough took only 2.8h, and that is with exploring the fake internet quite extensibly, so I'd imagine my second one to be around maybe 2 hours...), but for those ~3 hours I've been really emersed in the game and didn't even realize how fast the time went by. And I can't say that about many games, especially at the 5$ mark.\n\nNow you can obviously play the game multiple times and see all the options, which will bump up your playtime. I haven't played trough it again, but from what I saw other people say, [b] slight SPOILER [/b] [spoiler] the diferences between the two girls are minimal, but hey, if the dialogue is as good as with Emily, then I'll replay it at least once more [/spoiler]\n\nAlso other people have said that they got screwed over by some dialogues (especially with the inbetween-ey choices) where the main character said something diferent than what they thought he'd say. Hasn't been a problem in my playtrough, but I thought I'd mention it.\n\n[b] HUGE SPOILER [/b] [spoiler] also, some of the reasons why you fight with Emily at the end make absolutley no sense; like in my playtrough I really connected with Emily (we liked the same music, I helped her with her \"I'll kill myself if you leave me\" boyfriend and what not) but in the end she dumped me becuse I told her I don't drink but told the other girl that I sometimes do... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Has she never heard of social drinking or what?\n\nSo how did she find this out? Oh, well she talked with this other girl and it turns out that \"the version of me that she knew wasn't the same as the one the other girl knew\", because as we all know, the most important thing about a man is wether he doesn't drink alcohol or [b] sometimes [/b] drinks alcohol. [/spoiler]\n\n\n[b] So in conclusion [/b], this is just like the first game, just bigger and better. If you liked the first game, you should deffinetley pick this one up.\nI can see why you might not want to buy it for just 3 hours of content, but those hours had an amazing atmosphere! (especially if you didn't play the first one!)\n\nI 100% recomend this game, and it has made it up on my top 10 games list.\n\nI really enjoyed watching Jack Septic Eye play the first game when I was 13 and I really enjoyed playing this one now.", "timestamp_created": 1512958113, "timestamp_updated": 1512958113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38224488": {"recommendationid": "38224488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001009833", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512951141}, "language": "english", "review": "Rare entry in the \"why-won't-the-ground-open-up-and-swallow-me\" genre.

But where Cibele made me feel absolutely nothing about its characters and their online drama and shenanigans, Emily Is Away Too succeeded in making me care. Cibele's 74% on metacritic feels entirely and bafflingly undeserved by comparison.\n\nPerhaps it's because EIAT resonates more with me as it speaks to some of my own experiences, not identical but not entirely different to the game's. Maybe it's because, unlike Cibele, you actually have choices to make in the duration of the game that affect where the story goes and how the two people you chat with view you or where the story ends. Maybe it's because the game captures the 2006~ era pretty well with its use of pseudo-ARG youtoob, facenook, profile icons and liberal use of lyrics and other pop culture references. Maybe it's because it's way better written. Without a single voice-acted line of dialogue, EIAT manages through its well-written dialogue complete with (on-purpose) spelling errors, facenook notes and statuses, different endings and creative uses of songs to paint its characters much better than the fully (and well) voice-acted Cibele ever did.\n\nTL;DR: This game is a lot more fun and deep than you'd initially think it is.

Through a serie of discussions, you will shape the history of those two over the last year of highschool, and might even end up in a relationship with one of them. \n\nThe first game (Emily is Away) was a lot about how IM-people were drama queens, and this one is a three-way interaction about how you can't solve everyone's problems at the same time through IM ; although if you don't play your cards right, there's quite some drama. Contrary to the first game, there are actually a couple of good endings, which is (IMO) quite an improvement from the first game. There are too a few immersion details : links you can click for good ol' 2006 music, \"facenook\" web profiles and files which download on your ACTUAL computer. So a working internet network is recommended to play this game. And dont miss the numerous memes/easter eggs !\n\nSo all in all, I would totally recommend this game. The nostalgia of this long gone time, especially if like me you have known it as a teenager, will leave you with quite a heavy heart when you will close the last window of the last discussion.", "timestamp_created": 1511775484, "timestamp_updated": 1511775484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596425", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37762891": {"recommendationid": "37762891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213513840", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511774446}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042f \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431 \u0438\u0437 Cs:Go \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043a\u0438\u043d\u044b \u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0444\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0438\u0445. \u0418 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446, \u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443. \u0416\u0430\u043b\u044c \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0444\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0451-\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f!", "timestamp_created": 1511774714, "timestamp_updated": 1511774714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542312", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37759295": {"recommendationid": "37759295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056585735", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511713262}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Recomendo esse jogo, bem envolvente, curto onde pode zerar em um dia e possui uma mec\u00e2nina na jogatina bem interessante !\n\n 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1511770911, "timestamp_updated": 1511770911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37744707": {"recommendationid": "37744707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133811097", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511753259}, "language": "english", "review": "Watched a youtube video on this game a while ago and the only thing I remembered was that I cannot lie if I want a happy ending, I decided to pick choices honestly and consistently that fit me in real life and ended getting closer to emily than evelyn so since I hadn't lied and made the right moves towards emily I got the happy ending with her!

They created a local time machine, no less, with all these references, sites, music and even your own desktop for **sake. Seriously, all these filled profiles with the content that changes from chapter to chapter have got me in the first place even in the previous game. And I adore these developers for that.\nBUT. \nThe first game was a whole product. It was basically a post factum told story on which you could barely have influence, and it was beautiful because of this fact: you could hate Emily, could despise the main character, but you'd still empathize the story, because it's recognizable, because it's to believe in. \nThe second game gives you a lot more opportunities, it has more endings and feels quite bigger and more solid. But I believe that's a wrong impression, because in the end it gives you one week funservicing story. I'll explain myself: whatever your first ending will be, it will also show you others WORD BY WORD. (exept one, [spoiler] depending on weather you with whoever stayed together or not [/spoiler]). Having only one character, who you will never be able to get, is fine by me, but having two empty shells with different facades and WORD BY WORD same insides - not so much. Yes, they like different stuff, their boyfriends are shitty in diferent ways and..oh wait, that's all 'cause by the time you know it you'll have to choose one of them, and it will not matter any more, because they both are acting verbatim the same when it comes to your relationship. That makes the game not only unreplayble, but antireplayble, because any attempt to rewrite this story will show you how meaningless your previous experience was. \n\nthat's it, folks. Give the creators money they well deserve, try to get from this game the most while completing it for the first time (and there's a lot to enjoy: go through the sites, your chat list profiles, unlock the icons and try appearing profiles too) and don't ever come back to it.\ndeuces", "timestamp_created": 1511731044, "timestamp_updated": 1511746383, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37716868": {"recommendationid": "37716868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254178506", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514863432}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito bom, ainda melhor que o primeiro sendo mais longo e tendo mais finais", "timestamp_created": 1511728696, "timestamp_updated": 1511728696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37710883": {"recommendationid": "37710883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259334989", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511540403}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesomesauce! :D", "timestamp_created": 1511725169, "timestamp_updated": 1511725169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37703726": {"recommendationid": "37703726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026028425", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512156719}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is unique and quite awesome.\n\nIts an experience that feel very humanlike and interactive even though its just text based.\nThis is also a big improvement form the first game and I recommend it to everyone likes small storybased games and likes getting imersed into what ever they are playing.\n\nThe biggest downside to this game is its replayability is quite poor, and there isn't much to come back to.\n\nI would give it an 8/10 because of its story and its ability to imerse me in this unique and emotional journey.", "timestamp_created": 1511721309, "timestamp_updated": 1511721309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37687803": {"recommendationid": "37687803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317384047", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513282974}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool time killing game.", "timestamp_created": 1511712760, "timestamp_updated": 1511712760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37680780": {"recommendationid": "37680780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154057566", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511708950}, "language": "english", "review": "Emily is Away Too, is a very great game.

These girls will complain that I am ignoring them even though they can clearly see that I am typing?!\n\n\nOverall it felt like a graphic novel and I was hoping for more interactivity.", "timestamp_created": 1511671366, "timestamp_updated": 1511671366, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37617949": {"recommendationid": "37617949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164973946", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511681711}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0432, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0441 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a \u0441 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u043c \"\u0425\u044d\u043f\u043f\u0438 \u044d\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c\", \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0431\u044b \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0435. \u0422\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0435\u0439\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c \u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u0442.", "timestamp_created": 1511670404, "timestamp_updated": 1511670404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37615353": {"recommendationid": "37615353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201659519", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511668089}, "language": "english", "review": "...

My mother would say she's everyone. Every [b]girl[/b], every [b]boy[/b], every [b]person[/b] that anyone has ever loved.[/i]\n\nCon estas primeras palabras, casi a modo de estado de messenger, comienza Emily is Away Too. Despu\u00e9s de un primer juego gratuito que me encant\u00f3 e incluso me hizo rememorar viejos tiempos y me hizo sentirme muy identificado, llega una segunda parte, esta vez de pago pero a un precio rid\u00edculamente bajo, y con bastantes m\u00e1s opciones y profundidad que el primer juego. No es una continuaci\u00f3n del primero, sino m\u00e1s bien una especie de reinicio donde volvemos a conocer a Emily, pero esta vez de forma distinta. Y quiz\u00e1 la novedad m\u00e1s destacable es que en esta ocasi\u00f3n hay una segunda chica: Evelyn.\n\nPuede parecer una tonter\u00eda, pero el hecho de que esta vez hablemos con dos personas diferentes hace que la historia adquiera nuevas capas de complejidad y ofrezca mucho m\u00e1s juego. Como es de esperar (el juego no enga\u00f1a a nadie), se nos pondr\u00e1 en la situaci\u00f3n de elegir casi desde un primer momento: \u00bfEmily o Evelyn? Ambas amigas muy cercanas, y dos chicas que no pod\u00edan ser m\u00e1s diferentes entre s\u00ed.\n\nPrimero est\u00e1 Emily, protagonista \u00fanica del primer juego y que aqu\u00ed conserva m\u00e1s o menos los mismos rasgos. La t\u00edpica chica bien, educada, alegre, responsable, estudiosa y sana, al menos la mayor parte del tiempo. Y por el otro Evelyn, que pr\u00e1cticamente es su contraparte: la cl\u00e1sica chica rebelde, que fuma, bebe, se apunta a todas las fiestas y hasta es un poco malhablada, pero tambi\u00e9n muy simp\u00e1tica y popular, especialmente entre los chicos. Y puedo asegurar que es muy dif\u00edcil decidir, y lo m\u00e1s probable es que tengas dudas hasta el \u00faltimo momento.\n\nEl juego usa el sistema de tres elecciones del primero, emulando la interfaz del viejo messenger, y esta vez s\u00ed, las decisiones importan y mucho, ya que hay una buena cantidad de finales, malos y buenos, y que involucran a una o a otra chica. Con esto, el principal punto negativo del primer juego est\u00e1 m\u00e1s que solucionado, ya que esta vez el juego es bastante m\u00e1s rejugable, y por si fuera poco dura algo m\u00e1s que el original.\n\nEn esta ocasi\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s, todo es mucho m\u00e1s inmersivo. Las chicas nos pasar\u00e1n enlaces a YouToob o Facenook, donde podremos escuchar la m\u00fasica que les gusta o echar un vistazo a su perfil y conocerlas un poco m\u00e1s, lo cual ser\u00e1 \u00fatil m\u00e1s adelante si nos preguntan sobre el tema. Al final, si ya de por s\u00ed en el primero era f\u00e1cil crear la ilusi\u00f3n de que por momentos estabas hablando con una persona real, aqu\u00ed directamente te dejas llevar, y sorprende lo tremendamente humanas que resultan ambas chicas, fruto de lo bien escrita que est\u00e1 la historia.\n\nSe podr\u00eda decir que el primer juego funciona como una toma de contacto de cara a \u00e9ste. Siendo gratis, recomiendo descargar el primero y probarlo. Si te gusta, esta segunda parte es m\u00e1s de lo mismo pero mucho mejor. Una historia que sin duda te dejar\u00e1 huella, y m\u00e1s a\u00fan si en su d\u00eda conociste a tu propia (o propio) Emily.", "timestamp_created": 1511478431, "timestamp_updated": 1511479157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37219931": {"recommendationid": "37219931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039713078", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512591772}, "language": "english", "review": "Managed to get a good ending and believe me, it definitely healed the wounds of the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1511476101, "timestamp_updated": 1511476101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37203465": {"recommendationid": "37203465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093481731", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496768120}, "language": "french", "review": "Don't lie.", "timestamp_created": 1511470852, "timestamp_updated": 1511470852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37195304": {"recommendationid": "37195304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216546856", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497809177}, "language": "english", "review": "enough, i gave up\n", "timestamp_created": 1511468773, "timestamp_updated": 1511468773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37191125": {"recommendationid": "37191125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049018763", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496446748}, "language": "english", "review": "the closest ill get to human interaction", "timestamp_created": 1511467783, "timestamp_updated": 1511467783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37189765": {"recommendationid": "37189765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103803720", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513901592}, "language": "english", "review": "I could feel the  2005 radiating off of this game, and i was just a toddler at that time.

Could be summed up in two sentences or so:\n- Two girls you apparently barely know exist and chat with you once a year. Through rather shallow discoveries in similar tastes, you can become friends, or possibly more. \n- Both girls are extremely whiny and annoying, constantly complaining about their terrible boyfriends, and you have to pretend to care deeply and think they're the best people ever, or they hate you, even though you barely know them or their terrible boyfriends.\n\n[b]Annoying game mechanics:[/b]\n- Either mash on the keyboard to type, or turn on type assist and wait for it to type painfully slowly for you\n- Forced \"argument\" in Chapter 3 where no matter what you do, you can't respond quickly enough and both girls are mad at you over not responding quicker than they even do sometimes.\n- To get the best endings, forced to open weird external websites (in your own web browser) that are copies of well-known websites and process what's happening on them. For example, one song page is broken, if you say you liked the song, the girl knows you didn't listen to it. It's an interesting concept, but if you want the game to be immersive, why not just put these things in-game, rather than using my browser?\n- Another interesting concept that could have been done in-game - it has you download a desktop background to put as your desktop on your real computer. Why not full-screen the game and really set up the immersion, a la Orwell? Instead of having me download desktops and set the game's immersion up for you...\n\n[h1]tl;dr - [/h1]\nConcept is interesting. Game is extremely annoying unless you like whiny shallow chats.

The awkwardness and wanting to please even if it means lying a bit, the confusion, being forced to choose between two people you care about and dealing with their reactions, the drifting apart. So much of it hit home. My teenage angst will be with me well into my thirties.\n\nFor those in the right age group consider this a nostalgia simulator.

There's a point where you have to respond within a certain time frame (3-4 seconds) or they'll become irate and end their conversation with you. Nobody talks or acts like this in real life. The artificiality and obvious gameplay mechanics really hurt the writing quality and ability to connect with the characters.\n\nThis game is still great as a charming nostalgia trip for those who used AIM in the 2000s - they'll mention films, songs, bands from then, and when you select your AIM buddy icon at the beginning of the chapter you'll see many images of albums, memes, and other pop phenomenon that you probably haven't seen since 2006. But the first game did that just fine, and that game is free.\n\nI wouldn't pay more than $2 for this game and only if you thoroughly enjoyed the first, because this game is inferior to that. $5 is way steep considering there's no replay value to this and the paths are near identical until they divulge near the end.", "timestamp_created": 1511167175, "timestamp_updated": 1511167333, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542175", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36640183": {"recommendationid": "36640183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030784015", "num_games_owned": 3452, "num_reviews": 542, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 249, "last_played": 1515249420}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a retro pixel desktop emulator.

I just wanted a game where choices had some sway on how the story played out, and for 4.99 USD, Emily Is Away Too seemed like a great option.\n\nI really liked the game. It was a nice way to kill some some time. The characters, Emily and Evelyn, are pretty generic, I guess, but in a way that really works for the game. The music was pretty awesome, and it really took me back and made me feel old (especially since the game takes place about 11 years, from the current date, ago). Gameplay consists of pressing tab, 1, 2 ,3, and pretending you're a world class typist typing at a bajillion GWAM. You *can* use the mouse to click on options as well, but I haven't found it necessary.\n\nThe one thing I wasn't really a fan of was that the concept of nuance seems to be lost on Emily and Evelyn, and certain choices you make with nuance in mind can negatively affect your relationships with either character. There are multiple endings that depend on how honest you are with the characters, so keep that in mind when you're selecting the options.\n\nIt starts off really fun, but it can get real at times.", "timestamp_created": 1511115778, "timestamp_updated": 1511115778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36617648": {"recommendationid": "36617648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076925616", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511333606}, "language": "english", "review": "this game reminds me of the days of msn, windows xp, and early youtube. except i was like 8. so this is what high school kids were talking about in '06", "timestamp_created": 1511081232, "timestamp_updated": 1511121363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36614250": {"recommendationid": "36614250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004051959", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511068274}, "language": "english", "review": "This was adorable.

I absolutely loved the first 4 chapters of the game, emily and evelyn are amazing well made characters that feel real and that they had real emotions. For the most part, they're meant to be the strong part of the game and they really are. I even loved the little easter egg about VA-11 HALL-A, another amazing game.\n\nBut there are cracks, and they slither out to bite you in chapter 5. Before getting to spoilers, most of the problems relate to how the user, protagonist, or whatever you may want to call them, is very stiff compaired to emily and evelyn, and some of the dialogue options feel like they're unnecessarily different because they needed 3 options every time, or they feel like there aren't enough options. Also, the game doesn't tell the player everything it should about the UI (like tab switching chats, although admittedly I might've forgotten it) and the lack of a delete button or change of choice option seems especially considering what happened to me, and a apparently a few others in chapter 5\n\n[spoiler] In chapter 5, if you created a contradiction between the two others, they will talk to each other and learn of any lies you told, this would not be an issue if there was not a lack of a delete button. This is as multiple times, the shortened \"cutout\" of what you'll say is different than what is written. This is glaringly seen when Evelyn asks you about your plans after college, and the more passive option of \"I guess maybe\" turns straight into \"I definitely want kids 100% in the future\" (I can't find the exact text of that part of the game within a decent time, around chapter 2 I think) Then finally,\n during chapter 5, this comes back and you're accused of lying and manipulating both of them. I understand what they were going for, but for me and what seems to be quite a few others in similar senarios too, nothing more than a \"GOTCHA\" mechanic to ruin chapter 5 [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, the game isn't BAD, it's just disappointing from these dev because I feel like they put so much work in, then just got tired after a point.\n\nI'm sorry, but just go buy VA-11 HALL-A, in my opinion is better written and although it can be a little \"gotcha\" at a point, it's not nearly as harsh", "timestamp_created": 1511060206, "timestamp_updated": 1511060206, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36609867": {"recommendationid": "36609867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043253395", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511447545}, "language": "italian", "review": "Una bella storia, pi\u00f9 un librogame che un videogioco.\nNon sono il tipo che si diverte a provare tutti i finali (ce ne sono 8), ma comunque mi \u00e8 piaciuto fare la mia run e vedere dove arrivavo.\n\nPS:  Siccome ho vinto questo gioco in un giveaway, non considero il prezzo nella mia valutazione", "timestamp_created": 1511049810, "timestamp_updated": 1511049810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36603931": {"recommendationid": "36603931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180924030", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504163063}, "language": "english", "review": "this sucz", "timestamp_created": 1511030087, "timestamp_updated": 1511030087, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.370737", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36600064": {"recommendationid": "36600064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312338619", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511026264}, "language": "english", "review": "I would say this is something like Telltale's The Walking dead, just with less zombies, less gore, less visuals, shorter length....\n\nYou talk with two girls and are given some choices.

Emily likes alternative music, does not like to drink, doesn't want kids, and hasn't had sex. Evelyn likes punk music, enjoys drinking, wants to have a family, and has had sex. Emily has a scumbag boyfriend named Jeff; Evelyn has a scumbag boyfriend named Steve.\n\nGot it? Good, because those are the only differences between the two characters. They'll make sure you know it, too, constantly giving you quizzes on things they've said before and sometimes directly rating how close you've said your interests are to theirs.\n\nThe climax of the game comes when both of them start messaging you at the same time, both having almost the exact same boyfriend troubles, and the game transforms into a competition of jumping back and forth between the two to hammer out a response as fast as possible, because if you don't reply in five seconds they assume you're not paying attention even though the UI makes it clear that both people are supposed to be able to see when the other is typing. This turns what should be a serious set of conversations into a juggling competition of mashing your keyboard and making sure you don't get the girls' boyfriends' names mixed up since their circumstances are the exact same. \n\nOccasionally, the game does a gimmick where you choose a response and your actual character isn't brave enough to type it, so they say something else. This is almost neat -- except that at least  one of these changed responses leads directly to a \"bad\" ending where Emily accuses you of lying and breaks off the relationship. There is no way whatsoever to know that this is coming, and it comes at the end of the game based off something that the game did without your input an hour ago. The response is also an absurd overreaction to the point that it completely obliterates the idea that this character could ever be a real person. \n\nOverall, the concept was nifty as a free half-hour-long game,  but the addition of another character with only tiny variations is not enough to warrant even five bucks of your time.", "timestamp_created": 1510807693, "timestamp_updated": 1510807693, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563443", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36539514": {"recommendationid": "36539514", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971756278", "num_games_owned": 992, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510777125}, "language": "polish", "review": "Flirtuj z dwiema szurni\u0119tymi nastolatkami r\u00f3wnocze\u015bnie...

Even some of the minutia such as typing, then deleting what you 'actually' wanted to say, to retype the more 'appropriate' response was fantastic. I was thinking the same things, prior to them actually being written. Very well thought out.\n\nThere were a few times that what I thought was typing would have turned out more straight forward, but ended up throwing a wrench into things. I ultimately got a bad ending, and screwed everything up with both Emily and Evelyn (pretty much the same as real life back then lol). \n\nPlaying along with the atmosphere helps engage in this game a lot. I clicked all the YooTube links and let the music play in the background while 'chatting'. It was great. \n\nAgain, a pretty solid trip down memory lane if you were in highschool in that early 00's time frame I think as I was. It made me almost miss those days playing this game.

Sino, all\u00e9 voy:\n\nEl juego mejora por muchos motivos. Es mucho m\u00e1s largo, hay m\u00e1s opciones, m\u00e1s formas de resolverlo, y sin duda m\u00e1s finales. Aunque depende de lo que consideres un final distinto, claro. Pero me creo que hay 3 diferenciados y variaciones. \n\nLo que m\u00e1s llama la atenci\u00f3n es como el juego te hace creer que realmente est\u00e1s escribiendo con alguien. Te pone los chats, la gente conect\u00e1ndose y desconect\u00e1ndose, la gente te habla o t\u00fa le hablas, tienes perfiles (tanto tuyo modificable como de otros)... Y lo mejor: utiliza links para p\u00e1ginas sociales, v\u00eddeos o incluso te descarga archivos. Queda muy realista, y eso le da mucho a favor. Se hace bastante original. \n\nLos personajes (ya que por fin no es solo uno, aunque tampoco es que aumente mucho...) son bastante carism\u00e1ticos. Te cuentan su vida, y en seguida sabes de que rollo van. En tu mano est\u00e1 mentirles, decirles la verdad aunque pueda doler, mostrarte simp\u00e1tico, o demasiado incluso... \n\nLo mejor de todo es que, para acabar en un final, no hace falta ir al 100% en algo. Por poner un ejemplo: aunque t\u00fa sepas que la otra persona ha dicho que le gusta la comedia, no hace falta que digas que a ti tambi\u00e9n para caerle mejor. Puedes ser t\u00fa mismo, decirle que te gusta el horror, o cualquier cosa. Te recordar\u00e1 que no os gusta lo mismo, pero al final eso no importar\u00e1. \n\n\nY finalmente, aunque ya he dicho \"lo mejor de todo\", esto me ha encantado: NO TODOS LOS FINALES TE LLEVAN A SENTIRTE COMO LA MIERDA Y A ODIAR UN PERSONAJE. Pueden acabar bien, MUY bien :) Por fin... \n\nPD: EVE IS BAE.", "timestamp_created": 1510142490, "timestamp_updated": 1510142490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36372100": {"recommendationid": "36372100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279758766", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510387051}, "language": "english", "review": "This isn't anything revolutionary, but does have an undeniable charm and sense of nostalgia. \n\nThe mechancis are simple. An AOL type chat is simulated, and you have a few choices when responding. The dialogue takes place between yourself and two girls, and you are given ample wiggle room to either try to appease both, ignore one completely, or let one down in a gentle manner. The concept is simple, but the atmosphere around it as well as some sequences which are timed add a slight sense of urgency and stress. There are moments where both characters are simultaneously attempting to vent to you in a very realistic and emotional manner, and failure to reply will leave them lost and angry, degrading your relationship with them. In this way, you must pick and choose your words as to keep friends close yet also give a clear message as to your own feelings towards the characters as to not lead them on in a way. After completing a few chapters, the characters attitude towards you, and in turn your options for how to handle situations, are more clearly defined as they had been shaped by your previous interactions. Overall, this game brings a compelling and engaging visual novel type experience to a unique aesthetic veiled in nostalgia that makes the dialogue all the more believable.\n\nThis experience isn't without its flaws though. Some of the dialogue includes phrases and references to your own previously stated interests that seem somewhat robotic and unnatural, and can lead to some weird breaks in an otherwise believable conversation. While these spots are usually overshadowed by the story that unfolds immediately after, they do stain the experience in a way. \n\nThe moments of stress, balancing two conversations, force you to become more involved and ask yourself which characters have given you reason to care for them over the other. You aren't forced to pursue either character in a romantic way, but leaning too far either way will cause the other to question your motives. While this mechanic mostly adds to the experience in terms of creating an anchor for emotion investment by allowing you to dynamically interact with two character archetypes, the timed sequences can sometimes lead to a rushed feel leaving the player without an option to recover. Immediately after these strange moments of disconnect, though, the story picks up again. However, choices made early in the game might end up stinging later on. Without spoiling why that is, I recommend consistency with however you choose to build your character. You can build them purposely to be unlikeable and pretentious, but can also do so indirectly which may affect the outcome later down the line. After completing a playthrough, I came to really appreciate how impactful some early-game decisions are, though there is a frustration in those decisions destroying your chances and interactions with whichever character you had taken to if you indirectly set yourself up for failure. In a way, though, this creates some replayability, and I'm personally starting over taking the ending I got into account and trying to follow a similar, but better path. The continuous stream of chat messages and various options can at least keep you engaged with the one character you manage to stick with the most, though, even if you completely ruin your chances with the other.\n\nIn terms of replayability, there are also secret profile icons that are unlocked via certain actions or getting a certain ending. After completing my second playthrough I can foresee myself coming back to this game later on to mess around with the extra stuff unloacked via these secret icons. This includes allowing you to chat with some interesting characters and mess around in a separate storyline from the get-go, completely ignoring the main game. This ranges from comical to in-depth and gives you something to come back to in order to experience the atmosphere of this game with a new, more lighthearted chat to play through. The first secret icon I got has allowed me to equip it and chat with a bot who initiates the player into some space force thing. It seems charming and entertaining enough, so I'll be checking it out after my current playthrough. The fact that there are extra fully scripted chat experiences that stray from the serious-toned drama of the main game is appreciable and adds to this product's value as well as displays the devs care for this game as the extra unlockable content is built into the main game and not shoved behind a microtransaction paywall. \n\nThe real star of the show here, obviously, is the aesthetic. While the heavy reliance on low-pixel iconography does seem out of place in certain areas (even in 2007, apps weren't this low-res), the ambient audio as well as audio triggered through mouse clicks and keystrokes serve to immerse you in the atmosphere this game is trying to create. \n\nHowever, the aspect of this game I have to truly commend the dev on is the various links and images presented throughout. When first launching the game you are asked in-game what you want your wallpaper to be as well as a few other things. The extra care taken by the developer is apparent once you click the set wallpaper button and realize that the in-game \"picture saved to your desktop\" prompt also refers to the wallpaper file being sent to your actual desktop giving you the option to set your actual computer's wallpaper to that of the game. While this is sort of a gimmicky immersion, it does add to the feeling that there was genuine care and passion put into this game. \n\nThe links that characters send you via chat are clickable as well, and lead to various webpages that parody YouTube, Facebook, and other nostalgic web entertainment of the time such as the blue ball machine. Not only are these web pages stylized to match the game, when characters send you a link to hear a song they've been listening to, the actual YouTube video is embedded amongst the stylized parody comment threads and interface. The stylized related videos tab also leads you down a rabbithole of nostalgia as you are able to watch many classic videos of the time without leaving the stylized parody site. While this isn't any prodigious web design by any means, the fact that there are multiple versions of these parody sites accessible through the game shows the amount of effort that has gone into creating an immersive atmosphere and triggering that sense of nostalgia. \n\nIn conclusion, this game isn't for everyone. Being in a similar format to a visual novel, it isn't super interactive, but this game does offer more in the way of impactful decision making than most and has an atmosphere and aesthetic created out of passion that also bleeds into your actual computer which creates a unique charm unmatched by any game in this genre. It is a short experience, completed in a few hours, but if you allow yourself to be swept away into a classic he-said-she-said, cringey, emotional, drama-infused 2000's chat experience you won't regret the time spent. I'd say its worth the $5.00 price tag simply to support the work the dev has put into creating the atmosphere and story of this game, as it does improve most of what was great about the original. \n\nThis isn't anything groundbreaking, but if you have a soft spot for mid 2000's internet activity, this is an experience you will definitely want to enjoy. \n\n--- review marked as \"recieved for free\" since I got this through November's Humble Monthly ---", "timestamp_created": 1510135447, "timestamp_updated": 1510138995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36371767": {"recommendationid": "36371767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046420406", "num_games_owned": 740, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510133579}, "language": "english", "review": "I instantly clicked with Evelyn.\n\nI hated Emily from the start, because she was a cold mistress in Emily 1.\n\nEmily whined when I didn't send her a message back in .7 seconds while she was drunk, after choosing to talk with Evelyn.\n\nI got together with Evelyn.

Mais do que as escolhas de di\u00e1logo, s\u00e3o os momentos em que o jogo nos transporta para o nosso pr\u00f3prio passado que fazem dele algo diferente e especial de tudo o resto no mercado. O t\u00edtulo sabe como recriar as diferentes experi\u00eancias de diferentes jogadores e enquadr\u00e1-las numa \u00fanica hist\u00f3ria, numa \u00fanica aventura que consiste apenas em conversas online com amigos e interesses amorosos, algo que todos n\u00f3s fizemos a dada altura da vida, mesmo que com interfaces distintos.\n\nUm dos principais m\u00e9ritos de Emily is Away Too \u00e9 a forma como utiliza essas mec\u00e2nicas para nos manter ligados a uma experi\u00eancia que, no final de contas, \u00e9 extremamente simples. Os efeitos sonoros cl\u00e1ssicos do Windows, o processo de instala\u00e7\u00e3o falsa que marca o seu in\u00edcio, a possibilidade de definir nome, alcunha, \u00edcone de chat - Nickelback, The Fray, Juno, That 70\u2019s Show, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Sims 2, Scrubs, The Wire e Taking Back Sunday s\u00e3o algumas das op\u00e7\u00f5es -, mudar a cor de fundo e a cor da letra, bem como definir atrav\u00e9s de diferentes escolhas o vosso texto de perfil, s\u00e3o elementos que pouco ou nada influenciam a narrativa, mas que s\u00e3o absolutamente indispens\u00e1veis para capitalizar na nostalgia de quem o joga.\nDividido em diferentes cap\u00edtulos que retratam v\u00e1rios momentos da vida de um estudante do \u00faltimo ano do secund\u00e1rio e que tem lugar entre 2006 e 2007, Emily is Away Too diferencia-se do seu irm\u00e3o mais velho ao introduzir duas personagens com as quais podem conversar, muitas vezes em simult\u00e2neo. Emily e Evelyn, duas amigas do protagonista com gostos e personalidades distintos, assim como os seus pr\u00f3prios problemas relativamente a temas do cora\u00e7\u00e3o, o futuro, os estudos, amizades, etc. Ser\u00e1 uma narrativa algo familiar para aqueles que jogaram o t\u00edtulo original, mas a verdade \u00e9 que volta a ser executada com mestria atrav\u00e9s de di\u00e1logos e intera\u00e7\u00f5es cred\u00edveis entre as personagens.\n\nAs conversas sobre absolutamente nada, o drama juvenil tradicional, o sarcasmo e a ironia sempre indispens\u00e1veis, est\u00e1 tudo aqui e resulta de forma not\u00e1vel, elevando a experi\u00eancia a um patamar superior de qualidade. Entre as novidades est\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de hiperliga\u00e7\u00f5es para o YouToob e Facenook - vers\u00f5es fict\u00edcias de YouTube e Facebook com est\u00e9tica inspirada na sua apar\u00eancia original - com o jogo a fazer uso de muita m\u00fasica licenciada atrav\u00e9s deste m\u00e9todo e a revelar mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre as duas garotas atrav\u00e9s das suas p\u00e1ginas na rede social. S\u00e3o mais pormenores a adensar a nostalgia, mas podiam ter sido utilizadas de forma mais frequente e diversificada.\n\nFalemos ent\u00e3o agora do que n\u00e3o resulta. Os finais alternativos oferecem mais possibilidades e personalizam um pouco a experi\u00eancia, mas s\u00e3o algo abruptos e, mais desapontante do que isso, est\u00e3o muito longe de ter o impacto conseguido pelo primeiro t\u00edtulo. Tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o ajuda que os diferentes percursos sejam demasiado semelhantes e quebrem um pouco a magia da vossa primeira aventura pela obra. Querem um conselho? N\u00e3o o joguem mais que uma vez, n\u00e3o vale a pena e isso apenas servir\u00e1 para deixar um sabor amargo na vossa boca.\n\nNo terceiro cap\u00edtulo existe um segmento que envolve duas conversas em simult\u00e2neo com limites de tempo que tem como objetivo for\u00e7ar-vos a optar pela conversa que mais vos interessa, uma vez que \u00e9 praticamente imposs\u00edvel manter as duas em movimento sem negligenciar uma delas ou at\u00e9 mesmo ambas. Percebe-se o porqu\u00ea de existir, isto \u00e9, existe para vos for\u00e7ar a decidir e a seguir um rumo em dire\u00e7\u00e3o aos diferentes finais, mas o que \u00e9 certo \u00e9 que acaba por estragar momentaneamente o melhor que o t\u00edtulo tem para oferecer, transformando demasiado a experi\u00eancia num jogo propriamente dito.\n\nEmily is Away Too \u00e9 uma sequela que expande o conceito do seu antecessor e que volta a entregar uma experi\u00eancia rica em valor nost\u00e1lgico que nos faz regressar a um outro per\u00edodo da nossa vida com sucesso. A magia que tornou Emily is Away t\u00e3o especial continua bem presente, mesmo que por vezes demasiado familiar, mas \u00e9 ineg\u00e1vel que as conclus\u00f5es est\u00e3o longe de ter o mesmo impacto que os \u00faltimos minutos do t\u00edtulo original. Ainda assim, Emily is Away Too \u00e9 uma obra de recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00e1cil a um pre\u00e7o acess\u00edvel que pode ser conclu\u00edda numa \u00fanica sess\u00e3o de jogo.", "timestamp_created": 1510022574, "timestamp_updated": 1510022574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36333128": {"recommendationid": "36333128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025917151", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510015494}, "language": "english", "review": "This game, while it may not look any good, is phenomenal. \nI played it the first time around and it felt so realistic, I grew attached to the characters, so I decided to immediately play it a second time around. \n\nThe characters are so relatable, likable, the answers are realistic, I actually found myself growing attached to the characters and wishing they were real people I could continue to talk to, as strange as that may seem.\nDefinitely recommend buying/playing this game, I can definitely see myself re-playing it more, just to get all the endings.", "timestamp_created": 1510016051, "timestamp_updated": 1510016051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36332976": {"recommendationid": "36332976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073752875", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510008568}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well-made game.

Maybe that was due more to the accurate recreation of Windows XP and AOL Instant Messenger from 2002 (even if it was in pixel art), but I had experienced many of the same scenarios the game covered.\n\nIt was heartbreaking to see my own mistakes and know what I could have done to prevent them. By that same measure, it made me realize that I\u2019m not the only person to have felt the same way in such a situation, even if I beat myself up over my choices every day.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t perfect (the characters were basically one-dimensional), but Emily is Away was effective in at least capturing a time period that seemed to disappear overnight. So what could a sequel possibly add to that? How about two potential love interests and multiple endings!The biggest change to the narrative design in Emily is Away Too is that you have more direct control over the branching paths. Choices you make in conversations with Emily and Evelyn, the two ladies of interest, will see you either ending up with one of them or ending up alone. While it\u2019s easy to replay a chapter and get the exact outcome you want, robbing the game of any dramatic effect, at least you can be an active part of the plotline and avoid some of the negative aspects that plagued the first game (specifically, the scene where you may have unintentionally raped Emily).\n\nThe other big change comes in the form of an interactive recreation of 2006 Internet with Emilyisaway.com. The game now acts more like how AOL Instant Messenger was; what I mean is, everything you do in the game is through the guise of an instant messenger window instead of a recreation of a desktop with the application.\n\nThere are parts throughout the story where Emily or Evelyn will send you links to their \"Facenook\" pages or \"YouToob\" videos and those work through your own browser (which I suppose means the game requires an internet connection). They also send chat logs and homework to you that will dump to your actual desktop for you to look at. If you want, you can even browse through YMTND and find hilariously stupid videos from 2006. It definitely creates a much more authentic experience of the time period, though I\u2019m not entirely sure why this couldn\u2019t be contained within the application.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1509890140, "timestamp_updated": 1509890140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36298267": {"recommendationid": "36298267", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970791901", "num_games_owned": 2174, "num_reviews": 291, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509891183}, "language": "italian", "review": "Il punto che dimostra quanto questo gioco sia magico \u00e8 raggiunto proprio quando, mentre gioco con la risoluzione a \"finestra\", mi rendo conto che sto giocando ad un finto EOL Messenger avendo, come sfondo, Windows 10.\nE vedendo questo contrasto divento fottutamente triste.\n\nPerch\u00e9 in fondo chi gioca ad Emily is Away Too, dopo la magnifica sorpresa di Emily is Away, lo fa semplicemente perch\u00e9 ha voglia di ritornare a immaginarsi indietro di 10 e pi\u00f9 anni.\n\nQuando avevamo necessit\u00e0 di sbatterci tra una chat e l'altra, ricordandoci tutti i fili dei discorsi.\nZero foto, zero contatto, se non ogni tanto una webcam per i pi\u00f9 fortunati (...), per i pi\u00f9 tecnologici.\n\"S\u00ec ho cam.\" \"No, non ho cam\".\n\nOgni incontro, anche \"per\u00f2 poi vengono gli amici e facciamo qualcosa\" era magico.\nNon c'era la noia infinita che sta facendo  marcire la societ\u00e0 attuale.\n\nGiocateci solo se anche voi piangete (no, non sto esagerando) vedendo un Install Shield fatto di due cartelle gialle separate tra loro, con la prima che manda un foglio alla seconda.\nGiocateci se mentre scegliete le icone, state provando a tutti i costi a ricordarvi quale fosse la tipica vostra icona/avatar.

There's no option to defend your choices with \"I changed my mind, as humans are known to do.\" And the game does suffer from what I want to call Bioware text, or maybe Bethesda text.. you can never be 100% sure that you're reading the tone of your chosen response correctly, and once you choose an option, the text comes out and there's no way to go back. It doesn't hurt the story much, but it is a little unrealistic.\n\nThere's also a huge amount of passive aggression in the cast, with some potential emotional abuse that borders on gaslighting. If you realize that you're playing a teen talking to teens, it's easier to understand that these people don't know how healthy relationships work and are still trying to figure it out.

You either play it exactly the way the designer wanted you to play it (aka with no inconsistencies in your choices, even the choices are asked at different points of time in the game). The first four of five chapters are excellent renditions of the early 00s chat culture, but dear god that mess that is Chapter 5. \n\nYou'll be asked a few questions during chapter 1 and 2, which you're expected to give the exact same answers to, which is absurd. One example, in Chapter One you're asked whether you drink, and you can choose to say no. In Chapter 2, a few months later in game time, another character asks you the same question and you're given the choice to say 'just a bit.' In real high school life, people experiment, and so that answer can be entirely truthful, but the damnation of seven hells on you if you choose that, because the game then screams INCONSISTENCY, BLASPHEMY, BURN HIM, HE LIED THE FIRST TIME, except, of course, you're never told that till the final act (and to get the 'good ending you'll have to replay chapters 2-5). You're punished for growing as a character, oh joy. =_=\n\nAny one 'discrepancy' instantly throws you off into the very bad end. I'm not kidding. And there are atleast three other similar questions that cause the same result.

Anyway, this game was great, and it had multiple endings unlike the first one which all ended in pretty much the same scenarios. But the game doesn't have the same ending impact as the first one did, which pretty much almost made me cry and brought me a huge depression for about 10 minutes. This game is a reboot to the original, pretty much. I would have enjoyed to see a continuation to the original, but this one allows more options, so it's good. The story is interesting enough but I don't want to spoil anything. The attention to detail was IMMENSE this time around, the developer even recreated popular websites just for this game. Excellent! I loved the experience and it gave me a lot of great feelings. Multiple endings allow for a lot of replayablity even though it may be a bit mundane to go through most chapters if you know what happens or if the choices you make aren't that significant. The most intense moment was chapter 3, but I won't spoil it. It pretty much decides the ending. Anyway, the first is a great free game and this one is pretty work the asking price even though it's not that long. I think it's definitely worth supporting the developer, especially when so much attention to detail was paid. Worth the time. \n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1509310353, "timestamp_updated": 1509310353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0,

Sure, the plots are incredibly linear and Emily and Evelyn are maybe a little too similar. But the game still manages to feel real. It still feels like I'm not playing a game, but rather actually talking to people. The Facenook and Youtoob links, choice of pixelated XP backgrounds, and file transfers do make for a more immersive experience. I'm too young to have first-hand experience with the atmosphere of the early days of social media, but I do have many memories of XP and that is captured really well.\n\nI think it's a shame that the dialogue is limited to three options. It would be pretty cool to be able to write our own messages and have the characters be able to respond accordingly to them. Of course, that would require a much more complicated API that is likely out of the scope of a one-man indie team. But who knows? Maybe there will be such an API one day that's easy to use. Then Seeley can make another sequel. That would be awesome! If you read this, Kyle, and that kind of AI becomes possible, please make another sequel! Here's someone who will play it in a heartbeat!\n\nI also think it would be interesting if we could talk to the other people as well. It's fun to talk to Emily and Evelyn, but what about like Kelly and Jackie? I have to wonder what they think of these situations. Or what about Emily's troubles from Jeff's perspective? And Steve's opinion on his relationship with Evelyn? That would be much more work, but I think it would add to the game's immersive experience.\n\nOverall, I think there are a lot of good things about this game. If it means anything, I've played this game over and over in the last several weeks because of how engaging it is. I definitely recommend it.\n\n[spoiler] Evelyn for life <3 [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1509195050, "timestamp_updated": 1509195121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36073149": {"recommendationid": "36073149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061216469", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509187493}, "language": "koreana", "review": "1\ud3b8\uacfc \ube44\uc2b7\ud558\uac8c \uc378\ud0c0\ub2e4\uac00 \n\n-\uc6b0\ub9ac \uce5c\uad6c\uc9c0?\n\n-\u3147\u3147\n\n\uc774\uc9c0\ub784 \ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub05d\ub098\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\n\n\ub2e4\ub978\uac8c \uc788\ub2e4\uba74\n\uc774\uc820 \ub450\uba85\uc774\uc11c \n\n-\uc6b0\ub9ac \uce5c\uad6c\uc9c0?\n\n-\u3147\u3147\n\n\uc774\uc9c0\ub784 \ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\n\n\n[strike] \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc800\uac8c \uc81c\uc77c \uc88b\uc740 \uc5d4\ub529\t[/strike]", "timestamp_created": 1509188116, "timestamp_updated": 1509188116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491071", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36062651": {"recommendationid": "36062651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031450306", "num_games_owned": 1081, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509157403}, "language": "english", "review": "Emily is such a train wreck.

Pfff nah man.[/b]\n\nWe all talk online nowadays as we are connected to anyone that has access to the internet and willing to talk to you or post something. When you\u2019re not with your friends in person, why not talk to them long distance so you can talk even more. This is what Emily is Away Too goes on during the years on 2006 and 2007.\n\nWe come in on our Senior year of high school and we made two key friends that we talk to during the course of the game: Emily and Evelyn. Once you setup your username and choose an avatar, it is time to hit them up. From the beginning, there is a sense of getting to know the other person and starting out as friends as conversations with both start up asking about little things like music choice. As we go on, they get more open to talk to us about their relationship troubles and ask for advice. There is a connection there that makes you want to hear them out and if they want to spill their troubles, there is a high chance you will want to be there for them.\n\nSadly, the use of having two girls to talk to, there are forced situations to make you choose one. There are situations that the game that does not want you to keep up the same kind of relationship you have with the other girl. One of the most notable ones is when both are in a vulnerable spot and want you to be there for both of them at the same time. The catch? [spoiler]They are both messaging you at the same time. Of course we must all be thinking that it is not hard to keep up two conversations, you might be able to do more with your own friends and well we were able to message them at the same time in the previous chapters, but this time we have a timer. Each time you try to juggle both conversations, the timer gets shorter and shorter till one runs out and either Emily or Evelyn gets mad at you \u201cnot being there\u201d. If you let the timer run out twice they will log off in a huff, even though you would be writing right before the timer ran out.[/spoiler]\n\nI do get what this was trying to do, but it just falls into being forced and it takes away from wanting to care about the conversation if you want to answer both of them. Especially when the responses you give are mundane. I do think this section could of been worked better, perhaps having you choose your answers carefully, not wanting them feel like you don\u2019t care or perhaps have something that you can actually mix up names. Or even be able to hook up with both and since you can easily guess they will [spoiler]meet up with each other someday since it is very obvious you three go to the same school and this plays a part in one of the endings[/spoiler]. \n\nThere is also the fact that they do overreact to seemingly small things and you can\u2019t explain yourself. They mention that it is totally okay to not have future plans set in stone and okay to change...but then you find out it\u2019s only for them. There is a situation when one of them does something out of character and say people can change, but when you change your own choices (or you interpret the different wordings of the questions differently) it is automatically set to you being a manipulative liar. No way to explain yourself as it is an automatic failure (dumping you) as early as chapter one.\n\nI often find that both seem too similar. They are fleshed out but not in a way that really separates the two. Their interests and how they talk are different, but they both have problems with another boy and both stories rely on which girl you choose and what response you told them. There are a few side characters, but they don\u2019t get any character other than knowing that they could of had any name, one time which I mixed up the names since we have no way to know who they are other than when they cause conflict with the girls. Perhaps this could of been solved with you being able to talk with these side characters yourself. There is also the fact that no matter who you end up with, both Emily and Evelyn will have the same dialogue and reaction with a few things being replaced with a choice you provided and names. \n\nIf you previously played Emily is Away, there is another huge difference that was added. Instead of being completely confined in the instant messenger window, there are a bunch of website links that were made just for this game. You will mostly get Youtube (YouToob) and Facebook (Facenook) page links during your gameplay, but there is a list of links available to see all of the websites..\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n+ Cool to see that a bunch of websites are available alongside the game\n+ Realistic writing\n+ More secret icons with few of them having secret conversations\n\n+/- Reusing text for Emily or Evelyn route\n+/- Emily/Evelyn overreacting over small things\n+/- Underdevelopment of side characters that relate to Emily/Evelyn\u2019s story\n\n- Forced sections where you have to fail\n- Some responses don\u2019t fit what you are roleplaying as (or the response changes to make it mean something else)\n\nIf you want to get more out of the free experience Emily is Away gave or interested in this way of storytelling, go ahead and try out Emily is Away Too. However, despite that this game made me want to care for both Emily and Evelyn there are a number of things that make the experience worse such as some of the force segments. Despite most of this review being criticisms, this game was enjoyable, but will overall provide a different feeling and meaning than Emily is Away. So I do also recommend playing the first Emily is Away game (it's free!).", "timestamp_created": 1506456645, "timestamp_updated": 1506456645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35222446": {"recommendationid": "35222446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055566746", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506436018}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7537\u4e3b\u89d2\u603b\u662f\u6bcf\u6b21\u5199\u597d\u7684\u56de\u590d\u6539\u4e86\u53c8\u6539\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u5b50\uff0c\u827e\u7c73\u5229\u662f\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u4f1a\u7b49\u7740\u4f60\u7684\uff01\uff01 [strike]\u5750\u7b49Emily is Away again[/strike]", "timestamp_created": 1506434656, "timestamp_updated": 1506434656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35221905": {"recommendationid": "35221905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161587459", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506432664}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um \u00f3timo jogo com uma hist\u00f3ria inacredit\u00e1vel e a\u00e7\u00f5es que podem alterar totalmente o futuro, muitos finais diferentes.

I played the first game and knew I'd have a similar reaction to the second, but I'd say the details caught my attention. I appreciate the effort the author had to build websites similar to those of the past just so we could have a deeper immersion. For me in particular, listening to \"Open Your Eyes\" when it came up was just great I never really stopped to listen to the song before, but doing so brought an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia, as if it had been with me throughout important moments of my life and I just didn't bother to notice before.\nObviously, the game wants you to feel nostalgic and immersed, it wants you to think you're back at that time when you could simply live a romance and enjoy your own innocence. I'd say that was well done.\n\nStill, I have some problems with it as well. First, just like the first game, it seems to be designed for a male audience only. You can put a feminine name and stuff, but some moments seem plain weird when you're acting like a girl, it messes with the immersion. Also, why not let the character interact with a male NPC? Or with someone else who isn't a possible love interest? I know that there are limitations, but doing it that way made me feel as if Evelyn was there mostly to compete with Emily for your consideration. Why love [u] has [/u] to be the main goal, as the game seems to suggest?\nAnother issue with the game, at least in my opinion, is the need of absolute consistency. I'm not a native english speaker, but I got my first (bad) ending not because I [spoiler] lied to Emily about not wanting a family, but because I interpreted it differently in each context [/spoiler], and so did my girlfriend. This [spoiler] \"I'll break up with you if anything you told her does not match what you told me\" [/spoiler] leaves no room for the player to explain. It should be harder if you messed up, but not impossible if it was just a bit. And besides, people can change their minds.\nBut I think what really bothered me was the fact that [spoiler] no matter which of them you end up with, it's about the same dialogue and reactions once you do everything right. Emily and Evelyn are quite different from each other, and that has to remain consistent [/spoiler].\n\nI think I wanted this game to go deeper, but it's not like I was expecting that in the first place.

It's a paid sequel to an earlier free project Emily is Away, and has the same basic premise - exploring how friendship/relationships evolve and change as time flies. While the original game was a bit finicky and was a bit harder to suspend disbelief or care about characters due to the yearly gaps in conversations, the sequel enhances the basic idea to something truly amazing. First of, you don't need to pretend-type now with the option to just auto-fill your replies, which makes it feel less tedious and more in pace with the events. Secondly, it makes the gaps in conversations much shorter and each chapter more meaningful by having two main contacts/characters to interact with.\n\nNow, you may, as I have, still have some troubles just due to the nature of the game - as someone who's friendships and even relationships spent a lot of time in online talking in messengers of various kinds, as someone who never considered internet a separate thing and as someone who's musical choices go more in line with the avatars in the game rather than choices you can actually set for preferences, there are moments where I just went \"ugh\", because the game was forcing me to be a character, rather then a virtualised version of me, which the whole narrative really wanted to achieve. But, despite all that, despite the inability to juggle two person's issues in the game (something that I managed to do in real life at times -_-), I cared. I really REALLY cared. The story was exaggerated and went along rather strict rails depending on strict choices you can do, sure. But it felt like an expert from life, just something that could've happened and something that actually happened in one or another way. And for that, especially given the very low price of the game, I cannot recommend giving Emily is Away Too a go enough - you should give it a few hours of your life. Either to experience something you never had, or to re-experience echos of something that you might've.

So I won't lie and say that part of the game wasn't a little dissapointing to me. \n\nStill I'll give this game a solid 7 out of 10- Like I said the experience was enjoyable. Also the little easter eggs with some of the icons did make me laugh.

It's amazingly immersive, despite only ever showing you the chat window.\n\nEmily is Away Too is like if you took the first game and made it a million more times immersive and absorbing. It became more and more of a full experience, set back in 2006 and 2007 as you were able to open links that would open to recreated versions of YouTube and Facebook in your computer's browser, it would put files to your desktop like chatlogs, making the game the actual chat program. Of course, a game like this can't be simply on its visual and immersive experience-- the story is just as heartwrenching, if not as heartwrenching as the first. It makes you feel like you've messed up if you get the ending I did on my first playthrough (and yes, that does mean I went back for another, hoping to get the good ending-- that is, if there is one). Balancing two people feels like a high school relationship, not sure how having two close friends is going to go. \n\nNow for some spoilers (hope the formatting works):\n\n[spoiler] Holy shit, this game made me angry and sad, all together. I'll share my experience, mostly because I need to do something with all these emotions this game threw at me. I said one differing opinion between the two girls, and was able to date Emily. Evelyn went away, came back, and in the final chapter, ruined my relationship-- in pure Emily is Away fashion: outside the chat window, where you don't see anything. The fact that you can make a minor screwup and have that ruin the experience feels real, despite a little irrational (but, I suppose that adds to the realism). I'm in the middle of another playthrough as I write this. I better get Emily, or I'm just going to be more depressed.

"[h1] This! Is! Awesomesauce! \t[/h1]\n\nThere's a lot to like about this game:\n\n[list]\n    [*]It's mostly a text-based messaging sim, so it's simple and easy and mostly fun to play.\n    [*]The endings vary from happy to bittersweet to catastrophic.\n    [*]A full game takes me two hours or so; after you've played once, you can start over or replay from any completed chapter.\n    [*]Emily and Evelyn have distinct personalities and (for the most part) unique issues. They surprised me more than once. [spoiler] While I have much more in common with Emily, when I get together with Evelyn she seems to fall harder for me. [/spoiler]\n    [*]You can try to date either Emily or Evelyn, or you can try to stay friends with them, and either way can work.\n    [*]I actually learned from playing this game. The first time I played, I was too agreeable in making conversation and inadvertently made one inconsistency between what I told Emily and what I told Evelyn, which caused Emily to flip out and cut off our friendship. I played again and learned to be more willing to let my friends know when I don't see things the way they do.\n    [*]The characters will send links to parody versions of Facebook and YouTube, including actual YouTube videos of great songs from 2006-7. The videos autoplay, so you can use them as a soundtrack to your messaging with Emily and Evelyn. And don't forget to check the links of the other people on your buddy list.\n    [*]The game has so many nice little touches. For example, in each chapter you customize your messaging profile with song lyrics and movie quotes. The girls will then react to what you've put on your profile. [spoiler] In Chapter 4, if either girl becomes your girlfriend, she'll change her away message to the song lyrics from your profile. [/spoiler]\n    [*]The nostalgia! However old you are, if you're out of high school, this game will remind you of earlier days, even if your real-life high school days were nowhere near as interesting as your senior year in this game.\n    [*]Emily will send you a link to a Snow Patrol video. If you let it autoplay, the next video is Snow Patrol's \"Spitting Games,\" which I used to hear all the time while playing MVP Baseball 2004. So it's like a video game giving me nostalgia for video games.\n    [*]Did I mention the happy endings? And they're actually easy to get to as long as [spoiler] you're consistent with what you tell Emily and Evelyn and don't contradict yourself. You don't even have to agree with the girls or share their interests, as long as you're consistent. [/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\nIf you've already played the original Emily is Away (I played Emily Too first), the biggest differences are a new Emily, the addition of Evelyn, the compression of time to senior year of high school instead of senior year plus college, and the possibility of multiple endings including happy ones. Plus the great music. Even Evelyn's punk songs weren't too bad.\n\nI played this game four times as soon as I got it. After that, some aspects start to get repetitive, so I doubt that I'll replay it as often, but I'm sure I'll go back to it every now and then for a quick pick-me-up. And in the future this game will even give me nostalgia for the past times I played it.\n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1502548782, "timestamp_updated": 1502589413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34188685": {"recommendationid": "34188685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240949396", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502908949}, "language": "english", "review": "good to know one misunderstanding makes me a manipulative monster.

The game follows your interaction between yourself, Emily, and Evelyn through an oldschool texting format. You learn about them, the problems they face, and how you can provide comfort for them.\n\nIt seems basic enough, how did this game capture my attention, and my emotions, then?\n\nIn the game, you interact with both Emily and Evelyn in a first-person perspective, from the player, and depending on how you respond to them, it effects their dialogue, which in turn more effectively become attached to the characters, and their personalities. The story, the problems, the way they texted reflects how people commonly interact with each other through text, which also goes to show how much effort was put into this game to capture realism.\n\nAs for the story itself, without spoiling it, I must say it was very entertaining, and I felt drawn to the characters as I went through the chapters. The game successfully drew out my emotions, and my compassion for both Emily and Evelyn.\nReally, seeing as how this game made me emotional, which so few games do now a days, it really goes to show how much of a gem this is. Outstanding work, devs!\n\n(Spoilers)\n[spoiler]As I went through my first playthrough, I had not taken much into consideration of Evelyn and Emily \"remembering\" my options, and thus, after getting caught in a few lies in the second chapter, it ultimately effected my outcome on the final chapter when everything was going smoothly with Emily, when that lie caught up to my character, resulting in a break-up. But what really put the nail in the coffin was the fact that she used the same advice that I had given to her to handle the Jeff situation. \n\nThis, in turn, upset me. I began to look through the chat logs on all chapters to see where I went wrong, and after seeing the mistake that was made, I began the game over again, slugging through the dialogue (occasionally selecting new dialogue for new perspective), I achieved my desired outcome, and I was put at ease.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1502423380, "timestamp_updated": 1502423380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34148720": {"recommendationid": "34148720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013369414", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502499000}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely loved this game.

Both for this game and the first!\n\nNow to start off this review is that I got this game for like 2 dollars on the steam market, off sale right now it is 5 dollars. This may seem like a lot for a simple click and typing game yet that is not the case, here is how I view it. People will pay millions to own pieces of art, millions more to have custom pieces of art, and normal people will pay like 20 dollars to go into an art museum. This game is only 5 dollars and many, including myself, would consider this game a work of art. Not that it's visually appealing to the eyes or anything, but that it tells a simple story, one of love, in a masterful style. So please before you read further into this review don't let the price of the product in mention deter you from purchasing it, there are plenty of Triple A games at 60 dollars that tell little to no story and have mediocre gameplay at best.\n\nNow I personally haven't played the first game before this one, I saw this game on sale for cheap and I enjoyed the aesthetic of the 2006 era and the IM gameplay mechanic so I picked it up. I didn't play it right away but I wished I had since I enjoyed it so much. I went into this game expecting little which is how everyone who plays it should, this will provide you with little to be disappointed on. How the previously aforementioned Triple A games thrive on hype and expectations this game does the opposite, feasting on a player cluelessness for the mechanics and how to interact with fellow characters, which may or may not come back to bite you in the end. \n\nThe gameplay is rather simplistic, talk to two girls. Simple stuff like what music they like, what games they enjoy, what they do in their free time, past relationships, sexual history. You talk to just two, Emily and Evelyn, I'm not going to share their characteristics since that's for the player to find but they vary so differently that any person should be able to relate to at least one of them. This game has 5 chapters each relatively long, the game makes use of every chapter very well for character exposition but three stand out. The first chapter is when you first meet these girls and start forming opinions, the third is the height of the story where you have to make a choice, and lastly, you end at five where it all comes to an end.\n\nI've played this game a total of three times, each time coming in at around 4 hours. The first playthrough I never once took a break and completed it in one sitting, I received a relatively good ending but no matter which character one ends up they always ask the same question at the end. For the sake of spoilers, I won\u2019t say it since I myself wasn\u2019t exactly prepared for it and it\u2019s best if you aren\u2019t either. The question is quite a simple one, dealing with the relationship of said character and how long it would last. There are two choices. Neither has an easy answer, with knowledge with a long standing relationship would tell you.\n\nI chose the one that everyone picked, according to the ending and the statistics that it gives every player. 97.3% of players chose the same as me, yet it felt wrong, that the other option was better, that is what this game is so great at doing. Emily is Away Too Harnesses the power of player\u2019s past relationships, which allows for these same players to constantly argue what is the best option, it also harnesses one\u2019s preference in a girl. \nI replayed a second time, wishing to go for the other girl and to get the ending right with the correct answer to the \u201cQuestion\u201d. However this playthrough I feel flat, I hadn\u2019t really grasped gameplay mechanics, which was ultimately my downfall. I ended with no relationship, on both sides of the spectrum, I had no friends or any girlfriend at the end of this playthrough. This ultimately left me feeling as empty as I did with my first playthrough, if not more.\n\nI replayed for a third time, which this game highly encourages, to get my \u201cGoldilocks Ending\u201d where everything is perfect. I took some self-discipline to beat the game for the third time when little to nothing changes, but I got through to the ending. At the ending of it all, with my new love interest, she sprung the \u201cQuestion\u201d this time I was prepared for and I answered right this time.\n\nThe ending song that I love so much \u201cLCD Soundsystem-All of My Friends\u201d purely because of this game. I cried a little, shed a few tears, and started writing this review.

Fazemos planos sobre o que o futuro nos reserva, mas n\u00e3o sabemos o que ocorrer\u00e1 at\u00e9, efetivamente, chegarmos l\u00e1. Esse jogo, em um mix de \"quick time events\" e \"text adventure\" te faz voltar (ou a depender de sua idade, vivenciar) o per\u00edodo da vida em que tent\u00e1vamos advinhar o que o futuro nos reservava ou apenas aguardar sua vinda. Os elementos de nostalgia se resumem a refer\u00eancias \u00e0 \u00e9poca que, atrav\u00e9s do fundo musical opcional (eles at\u00e9 fizeram uma vers\u00e3o vintage do youtube) recheado com aquelas m\u00fasicas remetentes \u00e0 \u00e9poca cart\u00e1rtica da adolesc\u00eancia dos anos 2000. A jogabilidade \u00e9 simples: voc\u00ea escolhe uma linha de resposta \u00e0 mensagem da garota e simula uma digita\u00e7\u00e3o. As vezes, para dar \"mais emo\u00e7\u00e3o\", voc\u00ea tem um tempo limitado para digitar, sob a penalidade de sua interlocutora achar que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tem considera\u00e7\u00e3o por ela e te esculachar. Certamente, como todo \"text adventure\", a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 o forte e por sua raz\u00e3o eu coloquei essa frase melosa no in\u00edcio. Seu protagonista \u00e9 um adolescente e entra em contato com essas duas garotas. Cada uma tem uma personalidade diferente, com gostos art\u00edsticos diferentes. Cabe a voc\u00ea escolher qual, se quiser ficar com alguma, voc\u00ea ter\u00e1 como seu amorzinho adolescente. Diferentes escolhas resultam em resultados diferentes e sua percep\u00e7\u00e3o de ambas as garotas tamb\u00e9m acaba por mudar no decorrer do jogo, da\u00ed a imprevisibilidade do futuro. Comecei meu primeiro playthrough convencido a acabar com a Emily, mas, em decorr\u00eancia de fatos que ocorrem na narrativa do jogo, acabei por mudar o foco para a outra garota. Ent\u00e3o em decorr\u00eancia dessa reviravolta, acabei com um final diferente quando foquei em tentar ficar com as duas em meu segundo playthrough. O jogo \u00e9 bom. Entrar na m\u00e1quina do tempo nost\u00e1lgica e lembrar da meu per\u00edodo \"teen\" valeu a pena. A ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o (o uso da vers\u00e3o gen\u00e9rica do \"MSN\", as m\u00fasicas do Artic Monkeys, os \u00edcones e as cita\u00e7\u00f5es), tal como a hist\u00f3ria interativa s\u00e3o os pontos altos do jogo, de forma que, perante a proposta e a inten\u00e7\u00e3o de jogo, o jogo alcan\u00e7a a qualidade de seu objetivo.

Yes, it's a visual novel/dating sim of sorts, but honestly, it left behind so much of what defines those genres. It did away with character sprites and multiple locations in lieu of an interface that did all the storytelling for you; an early 2000's AOL Instant Messenger chat window. The goal? To maintain a relationship with a girl named Emily, wether that be friends, enemies, or romantic. You still chose between three dialogue options to see where the relationship took you over the course of years, but even with such straightforward gameplay the game had a level of complexity and emotion games with ten times the budget couldn't emulate. I had multiple playthroughs and I STILL couldn't make the relationship with Emily work. It was so nuanced and unassuming you could trip up at nearly any point while thinking you did the right thing. Overall, the game left an impression on me and I revisited it time and time again. \n\nWhat a surprise it was to see Emily is Away Too in the Steam Store. I didn't even think a sequel was in the works but here we are and with a flew playthroughs under my belt I'm more than happy to say it does what any good sequel should; builds and improves upon an already strong foundation. The AIM window is still our main tool, but this time we aren't only talking to Emily (a different Emily than in the first game, might I add) but a new girl named Evelyn who also catches our fancy. Yet again, we can choose to pursue a friendship or a romantic relationship with either girl but maintaining two relationships is a balancing act that the game won't let you take lightly. This itteration of the game includes timed sequences where you only have so long to type replies before it just skips any answer at all, links to various early youtube videos the girls send you to talk about things they enjoy (which the youtube and facebook pages are all meticulously recreated in pixel format). and even more hidden icons to win over the course of your playthroughs. Everything about this installment is just as painstakingly thought of as the first and it's a unique and emotional experience to have.\n\nMy props to the game creator Kyle Seeley for this game series. It hits on nostalgia of the early internet but also makes use of it by making the player form deep and complicated relationships with it's equally complicated protagonists.

I liked her music style and personality way better than Emily, who is basically a copy of the Emily of the first game. Then the third chapter came, and you have to talk to both of these people at the same time, with a timer. I tried to talk to both of these people at the same time, since, even though Evelyn was way better than Emily in my opinion, I didn't want to lose my friendship with her. That's right, I felt like I was emotionally attached to these people. But I f*cked up.  The timing thing wasn't even the hardest, I knew how to keep the conversation going, but I made one mistake, messing up the two conversations with Evelyn. This hurt her so much that she went offline. I finished the chapter and \"signed off\" as well, feeling broken about how I just lost what felt like a best friend to me.

Also this review gets kind of sappy, so like, beware lol.\n\n\nThis game is very personal for me. I myself am pretty young, having been these character's ages not too long ago myself. I didn't really have monumentous expectations for this game, I only picked it up because I felt the first one was a neat proof of concept. I got through the first chapter, was impressed enough, and just kind of thought it would stick to that charming AoL chat simulator thing it had going on for the remaining few chapters. But it was in the second chapter I began realising, wait, I've been here before. Like, not on AoL, I missed that age by a few years. No, I'd been in these friendships. And I'd felt these things for these exact people. Well, not LITERALLY them - people who were just like them. People I KNEW. They represented people who breathed, and existed tangibly, and I KNEW. And as every chapter did its thing, and carried me further into this all too familiar story, I started to get nervous. I knew what was coming at the end, even if I'd felt like I'd done everything I'd needed to do to avoid it. Like, I was honestly tracing back and forth in my mind, \"Have I done something wrong? Did I ever let her down, was I making it too much about me in one chapter?\" I didn't even really think about how silly that was, to be so concerned about fictional girlfriends, and hell putting it like that it does sound pretty pathetic. I wasn't really concerned about whether I'd illed Evelyn, I was concerned because Evelyn was a photocopy of someone I dated when I was young, and I dated this video game character like I'd dated them, and I knew how that went down. And sure enough, there I was, in chapter 5 - I was reliving the worst breakup of my life all over again.  That's a good argument, I think, for this game demonstrating writing that exceeds good, because it captures real people in ways that only good games with good writers can. It's all really sappy, but I think it's supposed to be. Love is, really, usually pretty sappy and messy and pretentious.

It wanted to remind you of how fun a game felt when you played it, like Shovel Knight wanted to remind you how great platformers were in the NES days without the fake difficulty that went with it.  This was Mighty Number 9's attempted idea as well.  Emily is Away Too tries to do the very same, but it does something else.\n\nIt makes you remember the not-so-great moments of your past.  It makes you remember that within all those happy memories, there's painful, heart-breaking memories you desperately try not to think about.\n\nEmily is Away Too is basically an AOL Instant Messenger simulator in which you have the option to interact with two girls.  What happens to them depends on the choices you make throughout the story.  Maybe you become close friends and feel you can share anything with them.  Maybe you'll start a relationship with one of them.  Maybe you end up just destroying your friendship all together with one wrong choice.\n\nIt's a very realistic game, painfully realistic really.  I haven't seen anything so utterly real and something that hits so many personal feelings on a deep and harrowing level.  I would reccomend this game to anyone who wants to remember the early Internet days and everything that it ensued.  You really will feel like you're back in the early 2000's.  The game really does go the extra mile to make sure you're back in the past again.

A lot of your decisions will affect your story and ending. Both the graphics and sounds really take you back in time. (And the craziest part is, that the first game is completely free to play). \n\nEmily is away too is so much more than the first game. Instead of just writing with Emily, you are now writing with two at the same time. Each is a different personality, and you decide how to tackle the whole process. The game also \"break the wall\" with real links to YouToob, Facenook etc. So while listing to all the early 2000s bands they are linking you, you really get into the old feeling. It gave me so many flashbacks to when I was younger and writing with my friends everyday. It felt so \"right\". \n\nThe story was cute, and I liked the ending I got. \n\nOh boy.

1499469893}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]SPOILERS TO ONE OF THE ENDINGS IN THIS REVIEW[/h1]\n\nIt started off good, this time it had 2 girls who you could talk to in case you hated Emily, and the fake retro websites were a fun addition, got to listen to some teenage emo music again.\n\nBut towards the end it got really bad.\n\nI didn't like the first game because choosing to visit Emily ended up with her basically accusing me of forcing her to have sex despite me roleplaying a gay man the whole time. Back then the game seemed to assume the player is a horny straight boy who wants to bang Emily, and there weren't good options for saying: \"dude I'm gay, you having sex with me makes me the victim since you got me drunk on top of it all\". Anyway, this sequel suffers a lot from the similar problems. This time I roleplayed as a straight teenage girl, but both girls seemed to hint to them being into me as more than friends. I shut that down instantly by telling them \"by the way you're a really good [i]friend[/i]\". One of them (Evelyn) eventually started calling me her best friend. We shared some things about each other, and meanwhile I kept being friends with Emily.\n\nSoon, they both needed my help with their teenage drama, and just like in real life, when I couldn't respond to Emily in time (read: within 5 seconds) since I had to juggle both of their conversations at the same time, she got upset and told me something along the lines of: \"gtfo, you don't care about me at all, let's not talk anymore\". Now, I do remember back in the days of instant messengers, people you were actively talking to could get upset if you didn't respond to them within 5 seconds of them sending you a message, but this was a bit much.\n\nMy second, and bigger, issue with the game was when my BFF Evelyn asked me if I had ever had sex. Out of the three options, I chose \"kinda\" since I was roleplaying as a straight teenager who hadn't commited to the full act of sex, but had sucked on her fair share of boy meat. Instead of typing \"kinda\" my character actually ended up typing \"yes.\" I didn't think much of this, as it's not a big deal, oral is kind of sex and I did choose the correct option. However, soon after that Emily asked me if I had had sex, and I told her \"just third base\" as it was the middleground option. She said \"wow me too that's so cool we are kinda similar hahaaaaa x x!\" It was neat, no big deal. In the last part of the game I found out the 2 had become friends with each other, and I could foresee some kind of a cuckold ending coming up. I expected me and my bestie to drift apart and having watching those two become best friends instead while I hanged myself in my one bedroom apartment after failing in my studies in college, without friends.\n\nTo my surprise, this wasn't the case. What happened next blew my mind. Emily contacted me first. She said she and Evelyn had ended up talking about me, and as they talked they noticed their \"versions\" of me were different. Emily had told her the \"truth\" about me and I had no idea what she was talking about. She told me to talk to Evelynn, so I left her alone and went to the chat window of my best friend, whom I had supported throughout the senior year the game takes place in. She told me she was feeling sad, I asked her what's wrong. She said Emily told her I had lied about my virginity back then. I asked what the HECK. She said I had told her I'm not a virgin, but that I had told Emily I was a virgin. I was waiting for a chance to tell her I just gobbled on a few knobs and figured it counted as sex, but no such option presented itself. My options were to apologize, tell her it's not what she thinks, etc. There was never a chance to explain I just enjoyed getting some baby making cream in my mouth and she was getting upset over semantics. She got very mad with me, told me I had manipulated her and Emily by lying to them in order to get them to like me. She said we can't be friends at all anymore because of what a horrible liar and manipulator I am. That our whole friendship had been a lie.\n\nI was baffled. She really blew this out of proportion and never gave me a chance to tell her what actually was going on. All of this because back then I thought oral sex counted when she asked if I had had sex. And no way to explain it to her. We had been through thick and thin, she had been there for me, and I had been there for her when we suffered from teenage angst and abusive boyfriends. And now she wanted to end it all, because of semantics, because this developer didn't think through how the middle ground choices when discussing your virginity, would play out in the end game.\n\nI didn't bother playing through it again just to see if the ending is different if you go hard line and say yes or no to every question they ask. The way the first game's endings went, I don't expect this game to have any happy endings either.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? No. If it was free like the first game, I'd say give it a try, but don't expect either of these wenches to appreciate you for who you are, even if you save their lives many times over. They will hate you for the smallest thing, and they will backstab you even if you were nothing but good to them. Seeing as they're teenage girls, I guess you can at least say it's somewhat realistic. That may be one the few positive things about this game. Perhaps the game's purpose is to show the men and lonely girls who never got to experience teenage girl drama back in high-school the cold reality of teenage girls being unable to have meaningful friendships, and what few friendships they do have are fickle, and prone to break apart at a moment's notice.", "timestamp_created": 1499471826, "timestamp_updated": 1499472066, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531312", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33348669": {"recommendationid": "33348669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273143614", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499477430}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved everything about this game, it was much better than the first.

The interface and commitment to its 'world' is pretty great, and I love the deeper interactivity that's available--sending files, sharing links, having multiple conversations at work. The secret buddy icons are a lot easier to unlock, and the little stories they have with them are a lot of fun. This is a great sequel if you enjoyed the first!\n\nMy one complaint is that, while I understand what messages the game is trying to go for, there are times when the consequences of your choices end up being met with what seems like an overreaction. I told Emily in August that I didn't drink, and then told Evelyn in October that I did--not because I was trying to adapt to Evelyn's personality, but because I thought, well, maybe I'd tried it since then, and had started drinking. If I'd lied in other ways, Emily's upset reaction to the realisation that I'd \"manipulated\" her would have been justified, but the fact that it was the only time I'd differed between the two girls made it feel like an oversight on the developer's behalf for Emily to react as she did. \n\nIn comparison to the original game, which chronicled a detoriating friendship, Emily Is Away Too presents you with a wider world and a greater variety of options that allows you to cultivate friendships with both girls. Unlike the original, where I felt there were very few conversations between the ones presented to you, there's an acknowledgement of the \"offline\" world, of conversations that we don't get to see in Emily Is Away Too. I enjoyed this aspect a lot, but it's what makes these \"either this or that\" responses feel artifical, rather than having the characters react more appropriately based on your responses.\n\nIf there's to be a third game, I hope they expand on that, and the range of endings available to you--it's a great game with a lot of emotion in it, but it's also a game that requires immersion, and that requires a better range of consequences for your actions.", "timestamp_created": 1499195809, "timestamp_updated": 1499195809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33231330": {"recommendationid": "33231330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268682821", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504913368}, "language": "english", "review": "Lighting strikes twice with Emily Is Away Too. I absolutely loved the first, but this is a superior sequel in every way. You wouldn\u2019t think a \u201cgame\u201d that is made up entirely through aim conversations could be so involving, but man what an emotional journey this is. Too is by turns heart-wrenching, creepy, nostalgic, extremely suspenseful, authentic, thought-provoking, and unforgettable. There are times where my heart rate would begin to spike as I tried my damned hardest to keep up with the incoming messages and keeping up appearences. Then the ending that I got left me gutted and feeling awful about myself, but that just goes to show how truly affecting and effective this experience is. The interface is once again as authentic as ever, with more year appropriate AIM buddy icons, and quotes/lyrics you\u2019d see back in the day on many users away messages and profiles. If you grew up staying up all night chatting with friends back in the early days when AIM was so popular, the meticulous detail here will bring back so many fond, and sometimes sad, memories. I really can\u2019t praise this enough, it\u2019s something everyone should experience for themselves, it\u2019s confronting and powerful, and truly one of a kind. A masterful morality play and then some. \n\nMy only issue is that there isn\u2019t an LGBT option, as a gay man I would love to be able to be trying to win the affection of a guy, but unfortunately there is no way to do this. Which in a way only adds another layer of melancholy, because as a closeted teen when aim was popular, \u201cdating\u201d and having \u201ccrushes\u201d on girls, it adds a bit of a sting.

I think it's worth playing even if you didn't like the original.\n\nWhile I feel that many people were frustrated with the ending of the first game for the wrong reasons, I admit that its message may have been hard to take, or easy to miss. That was a game about being powerless in the face of the passage of time, and the inevitability of growth and change that sometimes leads people on divergent paths. Something most people are loath to accept in their own lives, much less in a fictional world where a level of control and influence is generally assumed. I personally liked the original game a lot, but this one made me happier.\n\nAll the little nostalgic touches were really nice, and I was pleased to see that the charm and wit of the first game is also present here. Once you start playing it's obvious that your choices make more of a difference in this game than the last, which serves a different narrative purpose and I think will please a lot of people; luckily, it manages not to feel too much like pandering to those who disliked that aspect of the first game.\n\nIf you were interested in the first one at all I'd give it a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1499151559, "timestamp_updated": 1499151559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33218249": {"recommendationid": "33218249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053572284", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506641155}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would play again", "timestamp_created": 1499151311, "timestamp_updated": 1499151311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33213969": {"recommendationid": "33213969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057527699", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499277292}, "language": "english", "review": "5/5 would play again!", "timestamp_created": 1499140993, "timestamp_updated": 1499140993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33212534": {"recommendationid": "33212534", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993328194", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499241798}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels bad man", "timestamp_created": 1499137462, "timestamp_updated": 1499137462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33211165": {"recommendationid": "33211165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053931662", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499134379}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic.

The themes of music and honesty come through quite well, and the facenook profiles are useful to determine how to please the girls. Overall, I'm glad I played the game, and I hope to see more games from the developer soon! While I enjoy the formula, it would be interesting to see a little change up from the classic AIM setting. 8/10 for the saccharine you spat onto us.", "timestamp_created": 1498950794, "timestamp_updated": 1498950794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33105861": {"recommendationid": "33105861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044960055", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498951853}, "language": "english", "review": "[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatshisnamee/recommended/523780/]This review is exactly what I thought [/url] <--- click hyperlink", "timestamp_created": 1498950782, "timestamp_updated": 1501810718, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468032", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33081178": {"recommendationid": "33081178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198225442136", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498911208}, "language": "english", "review": "Psychiatrist simulator too", "timestamp_created": 1498911286, "timestamp_updated": 1498911286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33073117": {"recommendationid": "33073117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082483297", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512232048}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f 2 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u043c\u044b \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438.\n\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044f\u0442 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432 1 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0451\u0439, \u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0445 \u041e\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0419 \u0415\u0414\u0418\u041d\u041e\u0419 \u0414\u0415\u0412\u0423\u0428\u041a\u0415.\n\u0427\u0442\u043e \u043c\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0432\u043e \u0432 2 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438?

It takes the elements of the (really good) first game, enhanced them, and added some really great new ones like the fake youtube and facebook. The only problem i had with the game is the lack of replayability.\n\nSo, Emily is Away Too. A direct nonsequel to the free to play Emily is Away (that i suggest playing before buying this one).\nWhere to start?\nThe comedy is there (I'm literally writing this review after being rickrolled)\nThe generic but still somewhat intriguing story is there (at least for me)\nThe 2007 memes are there\nThe 2017 memes are there\nAlright, let's get more serious.\nThere are some really big differences between this game and the first one. For example, while in the first one [spoiler]you were never able to stay with emily (which explains the title of the game), in this one not only you talk to 2 people, but you are probably going to have a relationship with one of the two. This creates a really big difference between the two games, because while the first one was focused on replayability (What if instead of a i did b? oh well, i will see it when i restart. *3 hours later* alright, i did b and this happened, but it wasn't enough for Emily. THERE MUST BE A SOLUTION!)\nthe second one is more of a \"1-time experience\" (kinda like undertale, you play it 3 times like intended, you've seen it all), and replaying Emily is Away Too actually felt much worse than the first one. This is my biggest issue with the game: it changed from a psychological inferno where you slowly realize that you can't have what you desire, to a story in which you will have to make a choice between two endings and stick with it forever. (Like Life is Strange's last choice if you know what i mean [BAE>BAY forever]) It's not necessarily a bad thing, but i preferred the sadness that the first game made me feel. [/spoiler]\nNow let's see why i think this game is really good:\n- The Youtoob, Facenook and the file downloading features was really fun, and surpisingly well implemented (it' not as easy as you may think)\n- The timed messages section was the most intense moment i had in a text based game, and the consequences that come from the realization that you won't be able to reply to one of the two made me feel actually bad. \n- The comedy is really good. The easter eggs are even better than in the first game (as i said, i just got rickrolled).\n- The people feel real. It's not a new thing for Emily is Away, even thefirst one nailed it on this point of view.\n- The story is good, and it's really surprising how it changed from the first game.\n\nAlright, last thing i want to say:\n[spoiler]Another big flaw in the game is the fact that the story is basically the exact same for both Emily and Evelyn. After the third chapter, most dialogues are copypasted, making the curiosity that comes by asking ourselves \"what if i decided to stay with the other one?\" fade away with some disappointment.[/spoiler] But aside from this, the experience is really great, i had a blast with the memes and i felt happy with the story.

The reasons I wasn't personally keen were (spoilers ahead):\n\nSo, if you've never played the original, then this game is probably pretty cool (hence the thumbs up) but as someone who played the original, I feel like this new version took everything which made the original great and kinda messed it up.\n\nThe original is a bittersweet tale of growing up and changing, as we all do, and no matter what happens you and Emily grow apart. It's even more poignant come the final year where you can see how she's changed even through the way she types and you're left with no option but to say goodbye, no matter how much you want to stay friends or be with her.\n\nThis new version, by contrast, is much more of a generic teenage love story and, while that's fine, it's not what I was expecting after playing the original. The themes of change and moving on are there but they seem shallow by comparison and easily worked around. You get a second character to chat to which I suppose could have added a new dimension if done right but in the end it's more of a \"which girl do you want\" choice of who you want to end up with. Sure, there are numerous endings, you could be friends, lovers or neutral with either girl but the way you get there feels like it has very little meaning to it.\n\nIt feels forced that there's a section where you can't communicate with both Emily and Evelyn, it feels unrealistic that one girl would flip simply because you were taking a few minutes to respond to her. It's just a way of forcing you to choose but the original game was built so much on the idea of a realistic friendship that it falls a little flat. \n\nBAD ENDINGS\n\nThere's also the issue that some of the bad endings with Emily end up being a little ridiculous. For example, I was totally honest with both girls, chose Emily, but there was one teeny, tiny incident where I told Emily I don't really drink but told Evelyn that I sometimes drink but don't like it. Come the final chapter, Emily flips and screams that I'm a totally different person than she thought, that I'm a manipulative liar who was just creating a fake self to get close to her. That is an overreaction even by teenage girl standards and it honestly seemed insane. By the end of that conversation I actually found her annoying and was glad to break up which is such a far cry from the original Emily who was some unattainable dream girl. I can see how that ending works if the lies were, for example, telling Emily you're a virgin but telling Evelyn you've had sex with literally everyone, or even telling Emily you definitely don't drink but telling Evelyn that's you drunk out of your skull at all opportunities. It's just that particular combination I got which didn't work. \nI will admit that I didn't bother to go through and get the Evelyn endings so I can't comment on those.\n\nTIME SCALE \n\nIt also bothered me that they changed the timescale from several years of life through college to a single year of high school. Again, the theme of changing and moving on worked well with a longer frame, over the course of 4 years at college everyone becomes a different person but in a single year of school we were the same people as at the beginning and so those themes just died. \n\nPOSITIVES\n\n- The overhaul visually is really good, it looks even more authentic now and it's pretty cool.\n- The addition of a mechanic where Emily sends you files which go to your desktop is insanely awesome and I wish more games had it, it makes the whole thing feel so real.\n- Ditto with the mechanic with the website which sends you to Facenook (lol), Tube videos, etc etc. The amount of effort they put into making the game seem realistic is amazing and I can't applaud them enough. \n- I'm slightly addicted to Senses Fail now after having to listen to the music ;o\n- The story is still cute and fun and worth a play, definitely if you've never played before, maybe as a comparison for people who played EIA. \n- The secret icon chats are farking hilarious. \n\nSUMMARY\n\nEmily Is Away Too does a lot of things far better than it's predecessor.

This is fixed with the numerous other features such as Facenook and YouToob which was a nice touch that gave the game a more unique feel. It would've been nice if the pages had some more features but it was fine.\n\nPros:\nGreat nostalgia value if you grew up your teens in the 2000s.\nNice authentic feel with the game sound\nThe characters can feel pretty realistic and you can bond with them\n\nCons:\nI found that the characters did act a bit rash in some cases that made me a bit annoyed, the whole computer aspect of the characters could show.\nI always disliked the timed responses, mainly because it was weird where you could leave them on for hours and they wouldn't say anything but the second you miss a second before the timer runs out you're all of a sudden an asswhole.\nThe extra pages could've been fleshed out a bit more.\n\nHonestly this a great experience and I would recommend to any of my friends (if I had any)...

She seems much more human than either iteration of Emily by far.\n\nMy biggest complaint is with the ending - SPOILERS BELOW-\n\nDiscussing future plans, I said I wanted to 'go with the flow' to Emily and 'settle down' with Evelyn. Emily framed her question a little confusingly, where as Evelyn's was clear to her intention. At the end, for this SINGLE inconsistency (which, lets be honest, you can change your mind at any point irl), I am called manipulative and a liar by my (then) girlfriend Evelyn. Even worse, when given the ability to tell the truth that I was trying to deflect Emily's question (seeing as how I never really felt close / liked her), she still didn't accept it. That doesnt seem all too realistic, which is a shame because the rest of the game feels almost entirelly life like.\n\n- END OF SPOILERS - \n\nAll in all, it was a good but painful look back into history that I enjoyed except for the final moments which really took me out of my immersion.

I have nothing but positive things to say about the game, truly, the sequel does not disappoint. If you were at all captivated by the first game, you're in for that enjoyable ride for a subsequent time.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\n-The game is centered around, of course, yourself, Emily and a new character, Evelyn. The game transpires from the Summer of 2006 to the Summer of 2007 (one year). Basically, you're the friend of the two female characters, who are seemingly polar opposites in terms of interests and personalities, a nerd and a punk. The decisions you make will determine how the game progresses. This is where I'll stop though, because you can indulge in the game and uncover your own narrative! \n\n[h1] Gameplay \t[/h1]\n\n-The functionality of the game is the same but the developers have now added an option in the settings where, once you make a choice while talking to whomever you may be conversing with, it will automatically type it for you, suitable for those who'd rather sit back and watch the story unfold rather than \"typing\" along.\n-An average playthrough, based on the two I've completed, should last around an hour and fourty-five minutes to two hours depending on how much you choose to explore.\n-The game's autosave/save feature allows you to begin either where you decided to save it or at the games intervals of autosave.\n-You can also, if a mistake was made, restart the game/a chapter at any instance. [spoiler] If you restart Chapter 5, based on my observations, this negates the obtainable secret achievement which you discover on Matt's profile. [/spoiler]\n-Unlike the first game, this game contains four endings, again based on my observations. The endings are split between either positive or negative. [spoiler] At least this time, depending on how you play, you won't get friendzoned. :P [/spoiler]\n-As in most story-oriented games, the ending will present you with percentages of major decisions you made in the game so you can compare your unique story to others.\n\n[h1] Layout\t[/h1]\n\n-First off, I'd like to say that the layout of this game is much improved from the predecessor. You're given an expansive variety of customization options, an extra character to interact with, and more secretive yet humorous unlockable icons, some entailing their own backstories. \n-Also, players are introduced to a more immersive experience as they are given links to extraneous websites, i.e. YouToob and Facenook, where they can view videos sent to them or profiles of characters in the game. On these sites, there are a multitude of actions you can perform such as browsing recommended videos popular at the time of your specific chapter, snooping through threads someone may make on their Facenook, etc. \n\n[h1] Rules of Thumb [/h1]\n\n-From what I've accumlated, two rules a player must know whilst playing are, whatever you do, [b] DON'T LIE\t[/b] and [b] THINK SMART.\t[/b]\n-Lying automatically sets you back in terms of progress. So, just remember that honesty is a necessity.\n-Decision-making is an apparent feature of the game and your ability to choose the correct options at given portions of the game is detrimental to the outcome you will receive.\n-Simply following this rule set, as difficult as it may be, will lead you to a desirable outcome.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\n-If you're a fan of this genre of game or even the first installment Emily is Away, I'd give this game an attempt, I think you'll enjoy it. Personally, this game gets my absolute, sincere 10/10, just as the first did for me. And heck, even if you don't like it, you can always refund it.\n-Thank you for reading my elaborately extensive review, if you did. I just felt inclined to give one of my favorite games a review that's both informative and helpful. \n\n\n[b] Also, my apologies if my categorization isn't organized sufficiently and if I overlooked somewhat vital information, such things can always be fixed!

Even when this game had the free \"Emily is Away\" version, it had problems, problems that aren't fixed in the sequel/full version. Let me begin:\n\nYou play as you, and the game tries to be open about gender, but if you're a heterosexual female, you are going to be immersed in this, this game is really meant for heterosexual males, and borderlining on homosexual females. Anyway.\n\nThe big problem I have with this game is what 99.9% of the game is, texting that is meant to feel real and natural. First of all, it is natural and feels real, until the final chapter. Before that, I would like to say how dialogue choices felt very decietful, like, for example, you would choose \"Yeah, I would like to hang out....\" but then your character says \"Yeah, I would like to hang out... just the two of us\". Stuff like this was a huge problem in \"Emily is Away\", and while it is almost non-existen in Too, it still pops up every now and then, which is very frustrating.\n\nAlso, if you accidently choose the wrong dialogue choice, tough luck, you're stuck with it, no going back. How hard is to program in a go back button? Like come on!.\n\nNow, you might be wondering why I said the texting feels natural and real until he final chapter, and I'll try to remain spoiler-free. The final chapter is why I am not recomending this game, it has a REALLY BIG PLOT HOLE. And I mean like FRIGGIN HUGE, it's so major that it makes you feel like you've been cheated, the conversations go from natural and real to YOU'RE GOING DOWN THIS PATH ENJOY! Let me explain how this plot hole happens, minor spoiler here, won't go into details however. So, one of the characters early on asks if you want kids, you can either say yes, no, or maybe. I said yes, but then this other character, who doesn't want kids, asks if you want kids, again, yes, maybe, or no. This time I said maybe, and I answered both truthfully, I kinder want kids, but at the same time I'm not sure. Anywho, game goes on, and I get into a relationship with the person I said maybe to. Now this is where the plot hole comes into play. The other character told the one that I was in a relationship with that I wanted kids. Now, lets go through how a couple in real life would talk this out: \n- \"Hey, *Person's name* said you wanted kids, but you said maybe to me, feeling unsure about it?\"\n- \"Yeah, I am\"\n- \"Ok, let's talk this out\"\nNow that seems like a real world thing right? Now let's go through how it happens in the game about real and natural feeling converstaions (The words in Brackets are my thoughts):\n- \"Hey, *Person's name* said you wanted kids, but you said maybe to me, why the fuck did you lie to me?! Do you want to fuck me?!\"\n(Wait.... what?)\n- \"Yeah, I lied to you\"\n(WAIT WHAT?!)\n- \"I feel betrayed, has our whole relationship been a lie?!\"\n(WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU ON ABOUT!?)\n- \"I'm sorry, let's try to fix this\"\n(Fix what?! I didn't lie to you!)\n- \"No, it's over, I don't know who you are anymore\"\n(WHAT LIE ARE YOU FUCKING TALKING ABOUT?!)\n*Game ends*\n\nKyle Seeley just forces you down a path, a path that feels unnatural, forced, bordering on cringe, and and feels very faked, in a game that is meant to be about realistic conversations that feel both natural and real. I honestly feel cheated with my money, too bad I can't asked for a refund I guess.\n\nTL:DR Game has a massive and forced ending that creates a massive plot hole that makse no senes and makes the whole game's story pointless and horrible.

Kyle Steeley (Credited as the Developer and Publisher) states very clearly at the start of the game that this is a 'different' Emily, and Time. The first game was free and I really enjoyed it. So I had no problems paying the $4.99 USD for it this time around. There are definately some big improvements compared to the first game. For one the AI does really well at feeling human like. You get Immersed by the conversations and invested in the characters. I found myself overthinking and second guessing myself as if it were me in that situation, great job! The 'Crossroads' I faced felt like it had more effect in later gameplay, the addition of the timer really spiced things up too. I felt like the option I chose was going to have an effect to the AI no matter how insigifigant. \n\nThe use of colloquial language and the sound of those old XP's running is awesome to see as well, it was a trip back in time.

This game perfectly emulates the experience of dialing into our crappy internet connections and having engaging conversations with our high school crush through an archaic instant messenger. The additional websites the game provides you with helps enhance this exquisitely executed story too (Tip: To enhance your gameplay experience, listen to the music the girls send you in the background while chatting away to really add to that mid-2000s atmosphere!).\n\nUnlike this game's predecessor, you have legitimate choices that can affect the overall ending. Having two choices of who to court is nice too - Emily and Evelyn are almost foils of each other, but both have very appealing characteristics.\n\nMy only criticism is that if you choose to explore many or all paths of the game, you will start to see the logic or planned progression that the developer had for each story arch. You'll even notice that Evelyn and Emily will have near identical responses to certain statements/situations when you are trying to woo the other girl in a separate playthrough. It removes the \"rose color glasses\" you had from your first playthrough as you start to see the underworkings of the game. \n\nAlso, not a complaint, but I should point out that if you happen to get all of your choices right the first time through, the ending is not nearly as hard hitting or impactful as the first game, but it is still a very sentimental story nonetheless.\n\nThis is a true journey back in time.

For those who want a little more of a detailed view: let's get into it, shall we?\n\nFirst off, let me preface this with the fact that I have played the first, enjoyed it, heard about the second, got a little hyped, bought the second and enjoyed the second as well. Obligatory background aside, let's get started, or if you hate reading, and boy there's gonna be a lot of it here, feel free to scroll down to the TL:DR.\n\n[u] Nostalgia City, Admit One [/u]\n\nEiA2, much like the first, is a love letter to the internet of old, with a faithful, if slightly tongue-in-cheek parody of the old AOL days of the internet, and the sheer amount of effort into creating fully detailed spoof online sights on the *real* internet is a move that I've rarely seen in games, and it's a nice refreshing supplement to the general atmosphere that this game tries to achieve, complete with fake banner ads and even musical tastes that were accurate to those years, which really helps cement the idea that \"Hey, remember when ____ was really big?\" So right off the bat, if you don't particularly enjoy the idea of having a game set in the messengers of old, then maybe don't buy this game, as a lot of the enjoyment comes from re-living the eras.\n\n[u] What's Better Than One? Two! [/u]\n\nWhile the first game had brief opportunities to be able to chat with other characters, they were just that: brief. In EiA2, however, you are immediately greeted with 2 characters: Emily, yes, the one from the first game, and Evelyn, the slightly moody, into-punk-rock-and-is-probably-really-edgy teenager that's shares a class with you. The two girls themselves don't interact with each other and hence don't know each other. This then creates a situation where you'll often have to juggle between the two in order to chat. Now this is where the game gets a little sly with you. You are fully expected to get in the role as an akward high-school student and have tastes and preferences to things, which in some instances may correspond to each girl's own tastes as well, in things such as favourite movie genres or music. This therefore means that trying to \"game\" the system and attempt to pursue both girls by essentially pretending to be two different people is not only something I would discourage as it detracts from the experience of the game, but it is also something that is both impossible as a result of the writing and without spoilers, something that the game itself actually punishes you for later on. No polyamorous relationships here, I'm afraid.\n\n[u] Spoiler-Free Ending(s) Thoughts & Verdict [/u]\n\nI thought the endings were alright, and at least with EiA2, the fact that there were multiple endings added a small degree of replayability, thought ultimately there wasn't anything revolutionary in terms of endings, but then again, I wouldn't have expected too much out of a game that is quite ostensibly a retro chat simulator. As a result, and it may be just me, I felt that all of the endings lacked the sort of emotional punch that comes from reaching an ending as inconclusive and frustrating as the first one did, but that's probably me drawing parallels because it's something that I've experienced in real life, which is why the first game's ending resonated more with me than any of these endings.\n\n[u] TL:DR [/u]\n\nThe Good:\n+Perfect retro nostalgia, complete with little pixel art avatars of pop-culture references for every year\n+Revamped dialogue system, more interactive, meta use of real internet and your computer\n+Fairly accurate teenage behaviour, they're moody teens, what did you expect, Shakespeare?\n\nThe Bad [SUBJECTIVE, DON'T GET TRIGGERED]:\n-Lacks the \"frustration\" that the first one had, ergo leading to a perhaps weaker ending than imagined\n-Fairly limited branching into alternate endings. But then again, this is more or less what you wanted after you played the first, right?\n\nSuggestions for Dev:\n~Would be great to see some community made stories with an open-source dialogue system, to extend life-time and longevity, or to release additional, perhaps paid, expansionary stories further down the line to help flesh out character backgrounds, etc.\n~Game seems to be targeted at males, possibility of swapping out player gender and Emily and Evelyn to male characters? I'm personally a straight male, so I have no idea how the game feels from a different perspective.\n\nOverall:\nIt's a cheap game, fun to reminisce about the old internet, with a lot of pop-culture flair thrown in, would recommend it as an experience.

I know why they're there, since in Chapter 3 [spoiler]the game forces you to choose one of the girls over the other, having the unchosen one log off in a huff then stopping the whole timer bit.  The disproportionate reaction/penalty really bugged me the first time.

I'm actually happy that it cost $5, because unlike the original I feel like this ensures a certain quality to the game, plus, I don't have to spend $9 to get a card drop.\n\nWith that said, I want to take the rest this review to describe the hell of a first run-through I went through. [Spoilers ahead, be warned]\n\n[h1]My Experience[/h1]\n\nSo I meet these two girls, right. Each of them is going through some shit, dealing with guys who they dont like and general high school issues. I befriend both of them, and this Emily girl is seeming pretty cool. We both like the same music, same video games, and things are looking cool with this Evelyn girl too. We talk about our interests, and Evelyn asks me what my plans are for after college. I tell her I'd like to have a family, and she agrees with me. A few minutes later, Emily asks me relatively the same question. \"Elias (that's me btw), do you think you'd want to settle down after college, like right away?\" The truth is, yeah, I'd like to, but not [i]right[/i] away like she asked me. I'd like to do my own thing for a while before that eventuality. Of course there's no option for that, so I just tell her no, because I wouldn't want to, not right away. It's just one dialogue line anyways, so I think nothing of it and move on.\n\nFast forward another chapter or two, and suddenly I find myself being messaged by both these girls at the same time. Each of them is going through tough times, but this is fine because I'm pretty invested in what each of them has to tell me. What is NOT fine is that I find myself under a timer to reply to each one of them, and am constantly rushing back and forth to reply to them, because apparently fifteen seconds is an abusively long time to wait to reply back. Because of this, I ended up losing my friendship with Emily, and looking back on it I realize its really only plausible to become friends with one of the girls. If you're going to play this game, be ready to have to sever a friendship, because, be it intentional or not, I doubt very many people can keep up with this section.\n\nNow for the big catastrophe, we get to the last chapter. By now I've become #besties with Evelyn, and Emily has pretty much cut all ties to me. Luckily, I'm surprised by the fact the Emily apologizes to me and tells me she's gotten really close to my best friend Evelyn. This is nice, after all, who doesn't want to share the love of friendship? The only problem is, Emily tells Evelyn I wouldn't like to have a family after college (yeah you knew this was gonna come back later), which Evelyn takes to mean as I was lying to each of them to manipulate (!) them. She pisses off at me, and as I try to forge a way to clear things up through the flimsy tree of dialogue options given to me, I realize to my dismay that my happy ending has been ruined. In the end, my best friend cuts ties with me because, according to her, our friendship is built on a foundation of lies, leaving me sitting there alone in my room with my laptop, wondering to myself, \"what the fuck did I just go through\".\n\nTL;DR My bestfriend leaves me and calls me a manipulative liar because of a single dialogue option. And it turns out over 30% of users got this ending too, so joy for that.\n\nBut all that aside, the game-to-desktop integration this features is pretty cool. I love the inclusion of so many old memes, and the mockup 2006 YouTube is a joy. I hope y'all have a good time with this game; I just wish it didn't punish you so severely for a single line.\n\nCheers.", "timestamp_created": 1497214725, "timestamp_updated": 1497217858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32351477": {"recommendationid": "32351477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056839946", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497212954}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, Love the different choices you can make and the recreated websites are awesome", "timestamp_created": 1497213030, "timestamp_updated": 1497213030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32350342": {"recommendationid": "32350342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067969242", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497209424}, "language": "english", "review": "Right in the feels", "timestamp_created": 1497209292, "timestamp_updated": 1497209292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32349950": {"recommendationid": "32349950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293535535", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496969158}, "language": "english", "review": "I have one set of advice for anyone planning on getting this game: DON'T MESS UP", "timestamp_created": 1497208129, "timestamp_updated": 1497208129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32349384": {"recommendationid": "32349384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072429233", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514844239}, "language": "english", "review": "dank game, much enjoy, very excite, so nostalgia", "timestamp_created": 1497206438, "timestamp_updated": 1497206438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32348714": {"recommendationid": "32348714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309708186", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497204425}, "language": "french", "review": "juste parfait\n", "timestamp_created": 1497204551, "timestamp_updated": 1497204551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32347505": {"recommendationid": "32347505", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990869436", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497202869}, "language": "english", "review": "Kinda Funny brought me here and what a great purchase this has been.", "timestamp_created": 1497201076, "timestamp_updated": 1497201076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32347289": {"recommendationid": "32347289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171835839", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497191687}, "language": "english", "review": "To be honest, I got bored of it extremely quickly.

games (in terms of content) that you can get for 5 bucks, it's definitely worth a try. I've managed to kill a couple of hours playing through it, the plot of it all is really interesting, it grabs you and almost doesn't want to let go. Yes, this game doesn't have all of the luster of most these days, yes, the content is small, but that's no reason not to give it a try. The easter eggs (icons, random chats, etc.) are hilarious, and at one point the game seems to set you up for failure (not gonna spoil it) just stick with it and things will turn out okay! Emily is Away Too is an amazing sequeal to an amazing indie game, and while not much has changed, the game decides to put more effort into involving you, giving you links to an alternative youtube and facebook (youtoob and facenook) exporting files to your desktop, and even asking you to change your background to help immerse yourself. If you're looking for a very story heavy game, this may not be for you, on the contrary, if you're looking for a visual novel, filled with nostalgia, and a pretty decent story, then by all means this is the game.

It not only ignited imagination and nostalgia, but allowed itself to tell an emotionally engaging story in very low-tech yet aesthetic means. Through a storyline that\u2019s arguably simple and cliche, the novel method of storytelling is able to shine, employing creative devices relevant to it\u2019s context; the use of typing indicators to create suspense and convey hesitation, the occasional forced re-wording of idealistic dialogue choices which protagonist finds himself unable to go through with once it comes to hitting \u2018send\u2019, the difference between Emily or the protagonist being the first to initiate a conversation.\n\nUnfortunately, rather than improving on the original\u2019s flaws and expanding on it\u2019s successes, the follow-up game \u2018Emily Is Away Too\u2019 does the opposite, taking the original\u2019s all too relatable slice of life, and rendering it a cheap Madonna/Whore dating sim.\n\nInstead of building a long-term, romantically-longing friendship with one quintessential-yet-characterised girl-next-door, you now get to pick your favourite girl between two, plodding through conversations that follow shamelessly identical formulas, simply swapping out \u201cpunk\u201d for \u201calt,\u201d \u201cswell\u201d for \u201cgrand\u201d and \u201cmature\u201d for \u201cvirgin.\u201d\nOutside of these one-dimensional characterisations, the first game\u2019s storytelling devices are now bulldozed by uninspired dating sim mechanics. Both girls give you jarring pop quizzes on their personality traits to make sure you\u2019ve been paying attention, both girls periodically summarise your common qualities in identical lists to establish how close you are to winning them over. And most cartoonishly, you\u2019re eventually forced to pick your favourite in a sequence reminiscent of Root Beer Tapper, during which both girls suffer simultaneous yet unrelated crises and demand your attention in challengingly timed intervals.\nConsidering the storytelling opportunities available through having a game take place entirely through text, and the converse lack of opportunity for interesting skill-based gameplay, it\u2019s frankly baffling to me that the developers chose to go this rout when given the opportunity to expand this game.\n\nRather than making the game's world feel fuller, the extra character introduced counter-intuitively makes the world feel so much smaller, raising the question of why the only people the protagonist seemingly ever talks to are two girls who (for the mostpart) don\u2019t know each other, both of whom he may or may not be into, and both of whom constantly come to him with their problems as if they have no one else to talk to either.\nConversely, the original game has a background cast of friends and romantic rivals who impact your relationship with Emily. While these people can never be directly spoken to, their presence in the main characters\u2019 lives and their off-screen impact on game events paints a picture of the offline world in which the game takes place. But rather than using the opportunity to bring these kinds of characters further into the foreground, adding complexity by exploring the other types of people one typically talks to online, \u2018Emily Is Away Too\u2019 just hones in on the notion of talking to a crush and literally doubles down, thinning itself in the process and inevitably rendering at least one of the girls obsolete by the end of the game for all your trouble.\nUnlike the original game, which arguably relied too heavily on unseen events in between conversations to the detriment of player agency, \u2018Emily Is Away Too\u2019 does the opposite, giving little to no sense of how the characters engage with each other or anyone else outside of their mechanical chatbot-esque messaging, or that they really even speak outside of the few and far between vignettes that make up the game.\n\nWhile the original game may have been limited in it\u2019s endings and some players may have felt shoehored into a situation that felt unearned, the game made do with what it could accomplish with endings that remained consistent to it\u2019s core premise. \u2018Emily Is Away Too\u2019 capitalises on it\u2019s greater developmental freedom by simply waterboarding players with an ending for every possible outcome regardless of whether it tells a compelling story, with the good endings feeling like a meaningless waste of time and the bad endings leaving you with a feeling of \u2018hitting a bomb in Minesweeper\u2019 moreso than \u2018dealing with the consequences of being young, unthinking, and a little too eager to impress\u2019 - something the game itself feels more guilty of in this watered down reincarnation.\n\nI highly recommend \u2018Emily Is Away\u2019. I can only recommend \u2018Emily Is Away Too\u2019 to curious people who enjoyed the original game and would have been happy to pay a few dollars for it.", "timestamp_created": 1497118470, "timestamp_updated": 1497118470, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 146, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823739", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32318351": {"recommendationid": "32318351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183090293", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497102049}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u524d\u4f5c\u5982\u679c\u6211\u7ed99\u5206\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f5c\u6211\u7ed97.4\u5206\n\u770b\u4e86\u4e00\u5708\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u6211\u662f\u5f88\u5c11\u6570\u7b2c\u4e00\u904d\u5c31ge\u7684lucky player   :p\n\u53ea\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u786e\u5b9e\u4e0d\u60f3\u9a97\u4eba\uff0c\u6ca1\u60f3\u5230\u8fd9\u6b21emily\u6ca1\u6709\u79bb\u5f00\u6211  \uff1ao\n\u4f46\u662f\u4e5f\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6211\u7ed9\u8fd9\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c18\u5206!\n\u56e0\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u662f\u60b2\u5267\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u5f88\u5e0c\u671b\u8fd9\u4e00\u4f5c\u4e5f\u662f\u60b2\u5267\n\u7136\u800c\u5f88\u53ef\u60dc\u5c45\u7136\u6709gd\n\u8fd9\u5c31\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u672c\u597d\u4e66\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u90e8\u5206\u5374\u662f\u5e73\u6de1\u7684\u59a5\u534f\u7684\u5927\u56e2\u5706\ndisappointed\uff01\n\n+\u7a81\u7834\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\n+\u4fdd\u7559\u524d\u4f5c\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\n-\u660e\u660e\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u662femily\uff0c\u8fd9\u65f6\u5019\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u8005\u7684\u8c08\u8bdd\u5c31not means\uff0c\u5f88\u60f3skip\n-gd\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ee4\u4eba\u611f\u52a8\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\n-\u5f3a\u8feb\u6027\u7684\u5728\u7b2c\u4e09\u7ae0\u4f5c\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\n7.4\u5206\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u6ca1\u73a9\u8fc7\u7684\u4eba\u4f18\u5148\u73a9\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8233", "timestamp_created": 1497102908, "timestamp_updated": 1497102908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32317559": {"recommendationid": "32317559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218973835", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498060511}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game would play again.", "timestamp_created": 1497100753, "timestamp_updated": 1497100753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32313786": {"recommendationid": "32313786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043269462", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498349090}, "language": "english", "review": "A surprisingly sweet, touching throwback and early-2000s nostalgia fest.

But there is one very specific problem I have with this game that left a sour taste in my mouth, and that would be the endings, or rather the way to get the \"Bad Ending.\" [spoiler] so basically: over the course of the game, Emily and Evelyn will ask you questions, namely your favorite color, your favorite video game genre, your favorite music genre, and if you want to have a family after colledge. These questions are fine and all, but both of them ask you these questions, and if you make ONE inconsistency, even if by mistake, you get criminalized by whoever you end up helping more. And I would think this would be a good thing, being forced to be consitent/honest, but then there comes the dialogue choices: from what I remember, once on of them asks you if you want a family after colledge, you can reply with \"I'll take life as it comes,\" which for SOME REASON means you don't want a family, and that's what I chose, so then the other asked me if I wanted to \"settle,\" which I assumed meaning wanting my own house after colledge, becasue I didn't know what it meant and could only assume, so I said sure, and here comes the first problem: not that I didn't know what settling meant, becasue that's my problem, but the fact that saying \"I'll take life as it comes\" is a contradiction, and not only that, but that question in particular is one you would give a lot of thought into ,so once I chose the option that suited me best, being \"I'll take life as it comes,\" then not being given an equally suitable option in the other question, basically forces me to make a contradiction, I had no idea that saying \"I'll take life as it comes\" meant \"I don't want a family.\" But touching back on me not knowing what settling was, even that can be seen as a problem of not making your questions clear enough. HERE WE ARE FOLKS, the ending is what pissed me off the most, so after booting up chapter 7 and Emily telling me \"I told Evelyn you made a contradiction\" I was like \"Well shit,\" so after getting messaged by Evelyn a few times talking a bit, she starts to go off on me saying things like \"You have a different persona for each friend\" and \"How can I trust you,\" when I made ONE contradiction that I almost couldn't help, and not only that, but it was a MINOR ONE THAT CANONICALLY WAS MADE VERY LONG AGO. So we end up not talking to eachother because of one very minute and stupid decision of dialogue on the dev's fault. Because of this, I really don't want to go back and see the good ending.

[/SPOILER] Apart from this scene, it was just listening to problems of the two girls and nodding and it felt like none of my choices or answers really mattered (assuming you're not a complete idiot. It's easy to guess what kind of response or behaviour the girls despise). In contrast to the original game where no answer was correct, this game lacked conflict - every answer seemed to lead to the best possible outcome. And to make it worse: even the consequences of my \"bad\" decision I was forced to make was undone later on when the girl you then hated me just decided everything was her mistake and apologized. Because of that the last two chapters were basically endless chatlogs full of \"you're so great\", \"you're so honest\", \"I love you so much\" without any actual conversation in between. When was the last time you texted somebody and just exchanged compliments without actually talking about anything? It just felt extremely unnatural to me.\n\nApart from the lack of conflict and the last chapter, the characters were more or less convincing, but not really. Maybe my view of high school adolescence is a bit too positive, but most of the problems were too superficial even for young people without real problems.\n\nOn the other hand, I definitely felt the 'vibe' of the mid 2000s and the whole idea of chat friendships in the early internet age. Acessing youtube videos and facebook through the game client was a nice way to create immersion, even though you actually just chat with two people, add them on faceboook and click their 4-5 songs. That felt like wasted potential, but it was still very innovative.\n\nAll in all I maybe shouldn't complain. Three hours of more or less enjoyable game time for 5 bucks is not the worst deal and most of the flaws won't spoil the fun, but it's not very good either. Only buy if you played and somehow enjoyed the original Emily is Away.", "timestamp_created": 1496539117, "timestamp_updated": 1496859102, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32165103": {"recommendationid": "32165103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065753764", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513360071}, "language": "english", "review": "Way better and actually makes you feel sad", "timestamp_created": 1496538305, "timestamp_updated": 1496538305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32164925": {"recommendationid": "32164925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115077427", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496700409}, "language": "english", "review": "CAN'T WAIT FOR 3!!!", "timestamp_created": 1496537385, "timestamp_updated": 1496537385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32164480": {"recommendationid": "32164480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009093434", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496486705}, "language": "english", "review": "Both this and the first game are really cool and can get very emotional.

However, I got to know IM in the names of AOL somewhat around. I used to send messages to my family members when I was 6 years old and had a lot of fun doing so. Emily is away too brings back old memories, but not only that but a handful of excellent writing, charming people to talk to and really just feeling like you are in the world of this game.\n\nThe \"story\" plays during and after Senior Year. Emily and Evelyn are the 2 characters that you chat throughout 5 chapters, which capture a timeframe of a whole year. During that, you are given multiple choices, on that realistic one's that you would actually like to say,  and you do your own mindset. I can't really say much about it without spoiling anything - it's \"make up your own route\" for a reason.\n\nThe reason I liked this experience so much is the realism of this software. It has a WHOLE EXTRA domain with some websites and their actual look in ~2005, such as YouTube, Facebook... the list goes on. Every time you are sent a link in the chat it redirects you to your actual main browser and opens up the page. You have the ability to poke the friends you talk to on Facebook, sent them a friend request, read notes, their activity feed...

So much that I prodded my friends all the time to play it. Right now I'm abroad in japan (unrelated), but I got 2 of my floormates to play the first one last week. They both enjoyed it even though the point of the game was not to succeed, because \"in retrospect everything just seemed so planned out...\" (<< $%^& that line. That is what I always quote now).\n\nEmily Too is a much more developed game, still about the same length or so, but with much more features to pull you in and make the game feel like the player is talking with Emily and Evelyn. However, this is where it bugs me. Emily 1 was somewhat cartoonish and unreasonable, but the point was that in reality \"you don't have control sometimes.\" In EmilyToo, this cartoonish and unreasonable behavior is magnified and multiplied in both of them! I got a bad ending with Emily unfortunately, but as soon as I realized I was heading down the path of failure, I stopped caring. \n\nI stopped caring because, in my situation, Emily was being far to unreasonable and irrational to care about, or think of realistically as a person. If you want to know my situation: [spoiler] When Evelyn asked if I had sex, I said \"kind of...\" (b/c that is a hilarious option though!), but told Emily I was a virgin. Then it goes completely spiraling out of control when Eve says otherwise, and Em thinks the entire relationship, friendship, history was a complete lie! And, proceeds to say I manipulated her and used her, which makes no &*$#@ sense and there is no way to draw a connection from a lie like that.[/spoiler] So on and so forth more unrealistic bull$%*&, and at that point: me, and the girl that sitting next to me in the hallways playing this game together but were like \"fuck emily, I don't care anymore.\" \n\nAlso when Evelyn says: [spoiler] \"fuck off kid!\" when the player doesn't respond in 5 seconds, is another example[/spoiler]\n\nSo ya, I don't care for the bad ending in the slightest, it just felt like an unreasonable/unrealisitic one. I will go back and play again for the good one(s)? but like I kind of have a bad taste in my mouth. I barely ever right reviews, but I felt this one necessary to get across to Kyle Seeley (love ya bro).\n\nIn conclusion, Emily Too improves on alot of the features Emily 1 was, but I felt the characters were lacking in any sense of being grounded. Also, Evelyn has a great taste in music ^-^b. It's only $5, I do recommend this game still.

Maybe that was due more to the accurate recreation of Windows XP and AOL Instant Messenger from 2002 (even if it was in pixel art), but I had experienced many of the same scenarios the game covered.\n\nIt was heartbreaking to see my own mistakes and know what I could have done to prevent them. By that same measure, it made me realize that I\u2019m not the only person to have felt the same way in such a situation, even if I beat myself up over my choices every day.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t perfect (the characters were basically one-dimensional), but Emily is Away was effective in at least capturing a time period that seemed to disappear overnight. So what could a sequel possibly add to that? How about two potential love interests and multiple endings!\n\nThe biggest change to the narrative design in Emily is Away Too is that you have more direct control over the branching paths. Choices you make in conversations with Emily and Evelyn, the two ladies of interest, will see you either ending up with one of them or ending up alone. While it\u2019s easy to replay a chapter and get the exact outcome you want, robbing the game of any dramatic effect, at least you can be an active part of the plotline and avoid some of the negative aspects that plagued the first game (specifically, the scene where you may have unintentionally raped Emily).\n\nThe other big change comes in the form of an interactive recreation of 2006 Internet with Emilyisaway.com. The game now acts more like how AOL Instant Messenger was; what I mean is, everything you do in the game is through the guise of an instant messenger window instead of a recreation of a desktop with the application.\n\nThere are parts throughout the story where Emily or Evelyn will send you links to their \"Facenook\" pages or \"YouToob\" videos and those work through your own browser (which I suppose means the game requires an internet connection). They also send chat logs and homework to you that will dump to your actual desktop for you to look at. If you want, you can even browse through YMTND and find hilariously stupid videos from 2006. It definitely creates a much more authentic experience of the time period, though I\u2019m not entirely sure why this couldn\u2019t be contained within the application.\n\n suppose this was more to accurately recreate how chat clients worked, but there were a few times where I got confused on what I was clicking on my desktop and launched Hearthstone while trying to look over Emily\u2019s art homework. My stupidity aside, it\u2019s certainly a neat touch and tickles the nostalgia bone a lot more than the first game did.\n\nOne small tweak helps the game feel more playable, as well. One of the gimmicks in the first title was how you had to type randomly on your keyboard for messages to appear on screen. You can now just select an autotype function, letting it fill in the text after you make a selection. It helps cut down on the monotony of replaying the game, which at least yields something this time.\n\nAll of this is window dressing to the main content of the game: how the story plays out. I definitely made a connection with the original, but it was mostly through a projection of feelings I had experienced at a similar time. It was worth a playthrough, but does it stand up as good narrative design? Not entirely. It\u2019s nice to see Emily is Away Too improve on that front.\n\nI\u2019ve already mentioned the branching paths, but having the ability to chat with multiple people is nice. It stops the protagonist from feeling like a single-minded stalker and it even creates a scenario in which you\u2019re trying your hardest to console both women while they are going through a crisis. You\u2019re going to have to let someone down and it sucks doing that.\n\nStill, the personalities are pretty thin. Emily is Away Too is told through instant messages, so there isn\u2019t a lot of room to write fully fleshed-out exchanges, but you don\u2019t quite get to learn much about Emily or Evelyn throughout the five chapters. There are still the same tired scenarios where both girls are complaining about their boyfriends and you can send messages like, \u201cI never liked that guy,\u201d effectively painting yourself as Mr. Nice Guy. By that measure, though, Emily or Evelyn will call you out on your lies if you happen to try and manipulate them, so you can\u2019t get a \"good\" ending while being a dismissive ass.\n\nThe lack of control over your character\u2019s identity is also a bit odd. When you start each chapter, you get some choices to create an AOL profile, but nothing really applies to what I consider myself to be. You get asked the question of, \"What is your favorite type of music?,\" but I can\u2019t pick heavy metal (despite their being a buddy icon for Tool). I know that he is supposed to be an individual with his own wants and needs, but if I\u2019m naming him after myself, why can\u2019t I also have ultimate control over what he enjoys?\n\nFor that matter, there is no option to play as a female. That isn\u2019t the biggest issue for me, but it might turn some people off. Stories are meant to have a clear focus, though, and not be a catch-all for everyone at all times. It would be interesting to see this structure applied to LGBTQ relationships, but maybe that could be part of what defines Emily is Away Three in the future. It certainly is strange to put in a female name and get treated like a man, though.\n\nThose complaints aside, Emily is Away Too is basically the first game expanded beyond a simple gimmick. It may not be the best piece of interactive fiction ever created, but quality-of-life changes to the original formula make the journey feel more personal for individual players. The multiple endings really seal the deal, meaning you\u2019re in for heartbreak or everlasting love.\n\nThe low price of admission is also nice, since spending $5 is hardly what I\u2019d call expensive. I don\u2019t know if I care for choose-your-own-adventure games (they, effectively, have no drama), but Emily is Away Too does enough right to make it easy to recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1496441183, "timestamp_updated": 1496441183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32138328": {"recommendationid": "32138328", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991160678", "num_games_owned": 710, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496438986}, "language": "english", "review": "This game gives me feels.\n\nSo many feels.\n\nYou should play this game.\n\nFEELS.", "timestamp_created": 1496438586, "timestamp_updated": 1496438586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32138292": {"recommendationid": "32138292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168532733", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510521647}, "language": "english", "review": "very touching", "timestamp_created": 1496438353, "timestamp_updated": 1496438353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32138160": {"recommendationid": "32138160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072297189", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496436753}, "language": "english", "review": "This game/interactive story would be a middle thumb if steam had them, it is very close on this one for me anyway.\n\nThe game itself is all played in a AOL chatbox with some very intresting mechanics. You first have to pick a background for your desktop, now the background it gives you is for your actual computer desktop, turn it on for the maximum AOL-days immersion, You then pick a screen name and input your first name and choose an avatar, from then on you chat too 2 different female characters, That's the game. Trying to avoid spoilers as much as possible you have to talk to them about the usual teenager issues that are pretty boring and such. The game is bland and I never got that attached to the characters. I once messed up and did something stupid and one of them blamed me and instantly logged off, I assumed to go kill themselves but they showed up in the next chapter. It continues and finally I get to the final point of the game, I now would get too see how I and these people ended up in the end.\n\nThis is what happened: [spoiler] I onced lied to one of the girls and then said the truth to the other and they became friends and because of this they told each other and then one of them got mad at me and left [/spoiler]\n\nI spent 2.7 hours of my life for that, The reason I think this game is in the middle is because the interface is really well done at what it tries to do and the mechanics are solid, sometimes in the game someone will send you a file and it downloads onto your actual computer and you can look at it as an actual PNG, sometimes people send you links to videos and they lead to a kinda pixelated youtube site that was made for the game. I can see why some people would enjoy the story but for me it was bland and not my kinda thing but after 3 chapters I said \"I have came this far, I won't stop because It may get intresting\" Unlucky for me, it never.\n\nI was going to give this game a thumbs up but then I thought, for a interactive story the storry was pretty sh*t so it deserves the No I am giving it now, but only just, if the story was more intense such as Orwell with the mechanics it has, it would have been a great game, But a bland story made this game a bore to get through.

It's free, and it's not too long. The original Emily is Away brought be back to the golden years. It really encapsulated the time. It was short, melancholy, and sweet. This one also offers the 'time-travel' element of feeling like you're back in the mid-2000's internet era, using aol and early youtube.\n\nThis one appears to be a larger scale version of the original. The first three chapters do this fairly well, and had me smiling many times. There are certainly some unique mechanics not present in the original here, which I found very entertaining. However, towards the final act of the game, the story feels rushed and incomplete. The ending of the story can be very largely influenced by the first two chapters of the game. What feels like innocuous answers to the girls' questions will determine the end of the game, in many cases. The rest of the story doesn't matter as much if you give the girls different answers. This is very unrealistic, and it negates the implicit relationship that the characters have outside of the AIM messages. \n\nWhile the original encapsulated the melancholic feeling of losing someone through inaction, this game too often gives the feeling of frustration that you have sunk an hour into a futile endeavor. The characterization breaks down completely at the final chapter. Regrettably, I am giving this game a thumbs down until it is updated to have a more cohesive flow and ending. I'm not saying to hold my hand and have happy endings all the time, but there is no way to escape the \"you told her you liked punk, but you told me you liked alternative. Existential crisis!\" dialogue, and repair the relationship, unless you claimed to have only one interest at the first chapter.\n\nReally, beyond the first chapter and a later chapter (with a rather interesting mechanic), not too much matters here.

I thought this was a great game that was almost ruined by a potentially terrible, non-sensical ending.\n\nMajor spoilers ahead:\n\nThere's two girls you can talk to and both of them ask you more or less similar questions.  I went back to my high school years to answer these questions in a way that best reflected myself during that time period.  \n\nAt one point one of the girls asked if I'd had sex before, and the answers were something like \"Yes\", \"Kinda?\", and \"No\".  I went with the seemingly neutral \"Kinda?\" answer because I thought it would signify not quite sex, but very close.  My character started typing the \"Kinda?\" response, then deleted the message and rewrote \"Yes\".  Absolutely not the selection I chose, but whatever, hopefully that wouldn't matter.\n\nThe second girl then asked me if I'd had sex before and the answers were something like \"Yes\", \"I only got to third base\", and \"No\".  I picked the middle option because, again, that's what I was trying to answer with the first girl.  This time, my character actually typed out my selection.\n\nCut to the ending and the second girl is now breaking up with me because I apparently lied to the first girl about being a virgin even though I selected essentially the same answer for both of them (but my character decided to type out something different from what I selected).  This really rubbed me the wrong way and left a sour impression of the otherwise really immersive experience.  Even if I had lied to girl 1 about not being a virgin, it makes no sense why girl 2 would break up with me over it and it really seemed like the game was just grasping at straws to try to justify the bad ending.\n\nAs much as I felt cheated out of the good ending I should have gotten, I still found the experience enjoyable enough for the $5 price tag to begrudgingly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1496374419, "timestamp_updated": 1496374419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32120353": {"recommendationid": "32120353", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999566861", "num_games_owned": 556, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496891097}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me relive all my emo high school music.\n\nMy Chemical Romance/10", "timestamp_created": 1496372070, "timestamp_updated": 1496372070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32120288": {"recommendationid": "32120288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034438959", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496409234}, "language": "english", "review": "The feels are real =/", "timestamp_created": 1496371677, "timestamp_updated": 1496371677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32119685": {"recommendationid": "32119685", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967191194", "num_games_owned": 1154, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496368408}, "language": "english", "review": "wow, if i was born 2 years later i may have been able to talk to women ;( ;( ;(.

The following paragraph is a rant as to why people like me should avoid the game. The second paragraphs is why people who dont care for roleplaying as much should buy this game 5 times over.\n\nI know I'm going against popular oppinion here but I'd suggest playing the first one, the first one had you interacting witha character and it all worked out, but in two diffrent situations this game it forces your chracer to be a specific way, and in this case, against what I wanted to do. There is a segment where you need to reply unnessessarily fast in order to make one of your contacts upset with you and another moment where your forced to start dating one without intening to. Then aparently our relationship was built on the fact that I liked the idea of settling down and the idea of going it alone as well, the game once again forces you to act a specific way and admit I lied not allowing me an option to just be me and that all things I said were true. The reason I do not recomend playing this game is purley because there is a free version that alows you to stay in whatever role you want, where this game forces you to roleplay a chracer with diffrent thoughts than you AND you dont know what those thoughts are until you messed up, you need to play multiple times just so you know how to not screw things up by going against your own chracter, cant say i'm a fan of this new method.\n\nThere is also a chance that many of you are fine with trial and error play methods. People who arent like me and need to know who they are roleplaying and are fine with messing up not by choice.

I can say that this game offers a very nostalgic feel to the people who were teens/young adults in 2005-2007. I got myself deep into the game, exploring every thing I could find, from the Facenook's profiles and notes, to the weird memes and mini-games I clicked on some of my contacts link in the \"buddy info\" thingy. My first gameplay lasted almost 3 hours because I just couldn't play the game by typing and blah blah. I checked every link and look everything I could find! There's just so much attention to detail it's crazy! Nice going for an indie-game based on instant messaging!\n\nSome of the songs that we hear I've actually never heard of and I thank Kyle and the developers team to put them into it. Some of them are already at my Spotify playlists xD\n\nEven though the first game had only one ending and the gameplay would end in about 40 minutes and was very linear, I think thay Emily Too is way different in every aspect. The characters are pretty down to Earth and this may sound weird but you end up thinking you're talking to someone when playing hahaha it's pretty funny, though!\n\nStill don't know how many endings the game has to offer, but I'll try to find all of them. I really like what the Devs made when you beat the game (sorry, I won't tell). That's one of the reasons I've played again and again too!\n\nHopefully Kyle and the developers see this, because this game is very good and is very worthy in my opinion! Hopefully you guys make a third game (Emily Is Away 3)! I would play it for sure and tell my friends about it. They liked both the 1st and 2nd games so far and people seem to really like them as well, so why not make a 3rd game? :) If yes, make sure you can include other languages into the game so that it would be more accessible to everyone worldwide (I could help with Brazilian Portuguese haha).\n\nThat's my review!

But looking at the original, I though to myself I would not have bought it, even as much as I enjoyed it. So if they expect me to buy their sequal, it oughta be damn good! \n\nAnd... it's not. \n\nThe \"choices\" you make in this game aren't even choices really. They're more you just answering questions the girls ask you. These questions include asking if you're a virgin, if you drink and if you'd ever want to settle down and make a family. The only real \"choice\" in the game is to answer the same to both girls, as in do you give the same answers to both of them? If so, great! You get the good ending. If not, boo-hoo. You get the bad ending where they call you out and it's sad.\n\nAnd that's about the whole game. I got the bad ending my first run because I told the girl I didn't like as much (Evelyn) that I was a virgin, but told the girl I liked more (Emily) I wasn't. I did this because I was not comfortable telling Evelyn that I had banged before. So at the end of the game when Emily is willing to stop talking to me because of that, I didn't feel sad or like crying, I felt like I'd just gone through some bs. What makes the game worse is that after Chapter 3 it doesn't really matter which girl you chose because they both behave and talk the same. \n\nTo be clear, even looking past the lack of choices, the game's story sucks. Girls ask you questions, you can lie to one of them and they'll find out, then they'll break up with you. That's it. The original had a much more interesting story and did not try to disguises itself as some 'choose your own adventure game', it was linear and it had a good, sad story.\n\nTl;dr, the game is very linear, you don't really have any choices to make at all and even beyond that the story isn't very good. Lie to girl, girl get mad, the end.\n\nSome pros would be the immersion is really good, you really do feel like you're in 2006 chattin' up some babes.

When I saw the first episode of Jacksepticeye's playthrough of \"Emily is Away Too\", I was completely surprised on how much more immersive and detailed this one seemed to be. This game clearly was going for immersion and emulating the feeling of living in the era where the internet was about to hit its growth spurt. This game had so much going for it.\n\nOne of the things that I noticed right away from it was the nice multiple person talking mechanic. In the first \"Emily is Away\", it was always just you and Emily\u2014nothing more, nothing less. In this game, however, it was more than just you and Emily speaking. It made it feel more dynamic and more immersive as it approaches to hit the classic AIM feel. The conversations within the AIM parody also felt fairly geniune and realistic; to a fair degree that is considered. The biggest part that moved me was the realization that I cannot make everyone truly happy. Conflictions can and will occur\u2014just like in real life. Upon realizing that, it really warped my playthrough for the better as I was struggling with all my might trying to make everyone as happy as can be to me focusing on a select person(s).\n\nOverall, if you are one to enjoy stories told through only the characters as well as stories that focus primarily on development of the characters, then this will be one great emotional ride for you.

I still love that when you pick a response you need to \"type\" your answer, great example of immersion done right.\n\nThe game builds in some replaying with the branching paths and in my two quick run throughs the differences that played out felt very organic based on the different choices I made in each playthrough.

I thought it was quite amazing and very good\u2014especially for a free game\u2014even if it was fairly short.  When I saw the first episode of Jacksepticeye's playthrough of \"Emily is Away Too\", I was completely surprised on how much more immersive and detailed this one seemed to be.  This game clearly was going for immersion and emulating the feeling of living in the era where the internet was about to hit its growth spurt.  This game had so much going for it.\n\nOne of the things that I noticed right away from it was the nice multiple person talking mechanic.  In the first \"Emily is Away\", it was always just you and Emily\u2014nothing more, nothing less.  In this game, however, it was more than just you and Emily speaking.  It made it feel more dynamic and more immersive as it approaches to hit the classic AIM feel.  The conversations within the AIM parody also felt fairly geniune and realistic; to a fair degree that is considered.  The biggest part that moved me was the realization that I cannot make everyone truly happy.  Conflictions can and will occur\u2014just like in real life.  Upon realizing that, it really warped my playthrough for the better as I was struggling with all my might trying to make everyone as happy as can be to me focusing on a select person(s).\n\nOverall, if you are one to enjoy stories told through only the characters as well as stories that focus primarily on development of the characters, then this will be one great emotional ride for you.  Otherwise, I recommend checking out \"Emily is Away\" first and then decide whether \"Emily is Away Too\" is worth the purchase.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1496177023, "timestamp_updated": 1496177023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567675", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32071142": {"recommendationid": "32071142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042549377", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496351293}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Awesomesauce!\"", "timestamp_created": 1496176878, "timestamp_updated": 1496176878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32071055": {"recommendationid": "32071055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044167078", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496527719}, "language": "english", "review": "you can actually talk to multiple people in this one which is cool\nI've never had this many friends to talk to", "timestamp_created": 1496176591, "timestamp_updated": 1496176591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 145, "votes_funny": 241, "weighted_vote_score": "0.908347", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32070845": {"recommendationid": "32070845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045441093", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496175761}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story and fun to play with.

[/spoiler]\nBut that was not because of \"lazyness\" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game, [spoiler] even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions [/spoiler] . In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that [spoiler] sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on [/spoiler] .\nIt was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience.\n\nUnfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one. This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one. Moreover, here [spoiler] you can actually achieve not one, but several \"good\" endings [/spoiler] .\n\nI liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago.\nThere are still some \"twists\" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game.\n\nThat does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first.

It was an interesting experience that taught you a lot of things, like don't wait for someone and be daring. (even though neither of those options mattered to the game, but its the illusion on the first play that it made you think it did)\n\nCome back to the next game, and for the first two chapters especially, it felt awesome, you actually get real choice in game, so I decided in my first play to see what happens, be honest and play it where it falls. Play myself pretty much. Doing this I had no problems, [spoiler]this was until I continued talking to Evelyn, and when asked \"Have you had sex?\" I told her \"eh kinda\" suspecting that was gonna be like Emily's \"not really, only like third base\" option when she asked. Except instead of saying what I expected, it just outright forces \"yes\" with no other response. This became a huge issue later on.[/spoiler] So I continued the game, only thinking that was weird but that it had no hold on me. [spoiler]I than get to the \"You gotta choose a girl right now\" moment and decided to try my hand at doing both, and I failed (and sorry for ruining this very interesting point of the game's illusion of choice, but as of now,[spoiler]the dev seems to have designed it to [strike]autofail[/strike] infinitely speed up as far as I've seen, he doesn't expect anyone to do it, and I don't think the game will let you do that honestly, you'll probably not want to bother[/spoiler]) forcing myself to pick Evelyn. So I get through that and go to the prom with her and do all that stuff, and then I reach last chapter after Emily and Evelyn have talked, but that choice I made that I had no intention nor knowledge of making, it happened to be the only reason Evelyn got mad at me, as a result I got the poor breakup with Evelyn ending all because of a choice I never meant to make.[/spoiler] \n\nThat really ruined the game for me. On one side, it made me think even harder on my choices, but I became obsessive and paranoid about every choice I made that I was unable to play anymore games with the intention of playing me or a character, I ended up designing a strategy to best the game, (as I oddly seem to do when I start to notice breaks in the illusion, I did the same thing with the Mass Effect series, call me crazy) which I really didn't want to do when I first got it. I went from trying to play the game the \"right\" way to gaming it, and that is something you shouldn't need to want to do with this game. Aside from that, this game honestly has very little replayability. I mean better than the first one, and while better than like Mass Effect 3 in sense of ending choices, the game is not as clever with hiding its trick on the second playthrough, (which it clearly expects given all the secrets that require replays, granted you could look them up, but it seems that was at best an afterthought) I mean the choices you made being reiterated perfectly verbatim feel kinda flat for both characters, Evelyn and Emily can end up saying almost the exact same things with some simple choice flips, and your player choice changes due to the character are no longer hidden in any way from the player, I don't recall any real changes from chapter to chapter on the second playthrough that don't involve the little extras you unlock, and I've yet to see if they affect the \"plot.\" (but I doubt it) All that given, there isn't really anything new to playthrough a second time at all, except the endings, which are probably more effort than they're worth to get, given how the conversations stay pretty much the same all the way to the fifth chapter.\n\nOne thing I think about this game is the dev was thinking that instead of reiterating an emily is away sequel where it does the same thing, he was trying to do something new. Doing so, he pulled probably one of the most popular ideas of \"the happy ending\" people and \"give me real choice\" people. And while it did make it interesting, what he wrote up and designed out didn't line up with those \"features,\" (or objectives if you'd like) and it seems more like a lot of the attempt was too heavily mixed with trying to implement more design of the original game back. As a result, while in select moments Evelyn and Emily both seem unique, especially in dialogue, there are way too many times they are functionally equal, and it if not for the writing, they may have been easy to confuse. I think if Kyle wanted to push this idea, his design needed to be much more devoted to creating an experience that made the characters feel different, and not by just stating it, but by acting it out, cause as of now, the ingame actions of both characters are basically the same and the only difference between any particular action is who you choose. (or none in that case too, which I haven't seen or tried yet)\n\nGiven all this, I do recommend it, I'm a little sketchy on five dollars for it, while fun and interesting first time through, ([spoiler]unless you hit the glitch in the Matrix I believe I hit[/spoiler]) unless the content gets changed, updated, or we get workshop content, it'll probably be a waste for most, as the current core game offers very little actual payback after the first playthrough. I'm hoping Kyle sees this type of critque (and I'm hoping I'm not alone in it) and is willing to do one of those things, (I'd really like him to do all three, but even just a longer and more planned out experience would put this game far enough to ignore the price tag) but as of yet, great game, sketchy ending ([spoiler]Give you anything less then perfection in certain choices totally screw you up without much reason or information, combined with the flaking, it really can screw you, wouldn't be as much a problem if some of these decisions could be reigned in a bit[/spoiler]) with only one really interesting unique design choice, but it has potential to be improved upon, as long as the dev continues to improve its design. (and maybe some more content, and/or add player made content)\n\nSo yeah, I recommend it, but I also recommend you wait and see if Kyle plans to do more with it first before buying.", "timestamp_created": 1496131321, "timestamp_updated": 1496199161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32057441": {"recommendationid": "32057441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045037438", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496511474}, "language": "english", "review": "Both Emily is Away, and Away Too are the most delightful stabs in my heart I could get away with.

I only have finished one ending so far and for 5 bucks, it's not a bad deal. It's not like the first game where choices didn't matter. Small things in this game can affect your ending. Sure there can be improvements like making the game a bit more longer, having more interactions with the characters, and from what I have read in the other reviews; sometimes the system that judges what ending you get is a little too harsh with your choices. Also casual conversations start to drift away after one or two chapters. I also feel that the characters don't really have anything because we are basically role playing as a fictional character who does stuff with this person. It's hard to judge the personality based on their messages because our character supposedly hangs out with them IRL, but it seems like they only talk on the computer.\n\nBesides these few problems, the game is great for a \"5 dollar, play it if you don't want to invest time into something too major\". Pretty much any PC can run it. So if you have a toaster, you should pick this up.

I played Emily is Away when it first came out, and I absolutely loved the game. It felt nostalgic, fresh, and actually made me \"feel\" for my virtual persona through every chapter of the game. There were very few moments in Emily is Away when the chat felt slightly unrealistic, but for the most part it felt extremely genuine. \n\nOf course, hearing there would be a second iteration of this game, I was sure to buy it as soon as possible. I've played through two playthroughs, and I can say I'm sadly not nearly as impressed as I thought I would be. There are some cool gimmicks that the developer integrated such as dropping files onto your real computer desktop and the mock-youtube/facebook pages. I actually really liked that extra bit of immersion, which helps break the imaginary wall between a video game and reality. I feel as if the addition of communicating with two characters was also well-done, but with more to be desired.\n\nHere is my biggest, and arguably most important, gripe of the game: the lack of reality and depth in dialogue. I feel like this time around the dialogue feels incredibly fake and clearly variable-based at times. As with Emily is Away, your decisions in this game change the course of the rest of the playthrough. In Emily is Away, this was much less noticable in the chat dialogue compared to how it is in Emily is Away Too. In a game that's root gameplay comes from story and dialogue, I feel like this is too big of an issue to ignore. There are times when either Evelyn or Emily would reiterate back to you what you chose in previous chapters, almost verbatim. I can understand why Kyle, the developer, decided to do this, but it just felt unrealistic. If you play Emily is Away Too, you'll notice what I mean. I believe that solely because of that, I just didn't feel the heartwrenching story like I did from Emily is Away. \n\nI know my opinion may not be a popular one, but I wouldn't recommend Emily is Away Too over Emily is Away (If you haven't played the first one yet). Maybe if you didn't play the first one, the second would be more heartfelt, but I can't comment on that. Emily is Away Too is full of unlockables, well-coded and designed, integrated \"barrier-breaking\" immersion, and the story is still going to capture players through the very end. For players looking for a story-driven game, yes - Emily is Away Too is well-done and I would recommend it. With all of that being said, I would still highly recommend players play the first game(which is also free) over the second, if they are looking for a better story-driven experience.", "timestamp_created": 1496010927, "timestamp_updated": 1496010927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610245", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32030482": {"recommendationid": "32030482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101228352", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497486207}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a feels trip for sure.

At $5.00, it will have more emotional impact on your than any other $60 game out there. This is especially true if you were a teenager in the 2000s, in which case this game will bring back the nostalgia and memories. \n\nEverything's well done, from the retro interface and buddy icons to the parody websites and music choices. The instant-message conversations also feel real and there's a lot of emotion conveyed through the text. I'm sure everyone who plays will connect with the characters and feel real pressure when deciding how to respond to them. In fact, my only complaint is that in one specific chapter, you're forced to talk two girls at once with increasingly pressured time limits, which gets to the point where they rage at you for not responding in 4 seconds. Only that unrealistic task takes away the feeling of immersion during the game; for the rest of it, the dialogue feels real and your choices decide the outcome.\n\nSo if you're still reading this, do yourself a favor, support the developers, and buy the game.

Away was honestly one of my favorite games of all time, just for the sake of it being so true to the ways I felt in those periods of my life and how I handled my relationships, and this game has built upon that and improved.\n\nI honestly lived a very similar situaiton to the person you play in this game. I dated someone just like Emily just before I ended up dating a person just like Evelyn a week later in 2013, and it was one of the most heart wrenching things I ever went through. In my first playthrough, I chose to puruse Evelyn (who liked the same music and acted the same way as my first serious girlfriend), and everything she said brought back so many memories that literally brought tears to my eyes. When she sent me a link for Your Guardian Angel by The Red Jumpsuit Aparatus, I was immediately sent back to that night that the first girl I ever loved unconditionally sent me the same song and told me that she loved me for the first time. This game will pull at your heartstrings, even more so if you've lived these kinds of situations.\n\nThe dialogue felt very realistic to how I and others I knew around senior year of high school talked, and the timed answers mechanic worked well for how the story plays out. I felt like utter shit for not getting to an answer quick enough for Emily and watching her log out because of me hit me just like the first game, and my heart pounded in my chest when Evelyn said she thought she loved me, just like the first time I heard it from my ex. This game made me smile genuinely and feel terrible all in 2 hours, which I love so much. If you're on the fence about it, save 5 bucks and please get it. This game is expanding my perspective on what makes a game good and how much influence it can have on how we think and feel.\n\n10/10 seriously going back tomorrow to cry like an emo teen again\n\n*edit - I forgot to add that if you play this game, I'd reccomend leaving whatever music they send you on, because it adds to the atmosphere in a great way.

All for $5.00. \n\nNever thought I'd have to drink a beer over a virtual girl... Fucking emily, man.\n\nOhhhh God, this takes me back to high school. Almost cried from the memories this invoked. This game is... I don't know. I don't know how to explain it but they really managed to capture emotions through text and music. (TIP: keep the music they give you playing, it sets the mood really well.) \n\nThe conversation options are very realistic and somehow convey emotions of nervousness, rethinking, by backspacing and rewording what you're going to say just like real life. \n\nMaybe it's PTSD from relationships, but it really took me back to the girls I used to talk to in high school, almost kind of makes me wish I was in high school again.\n\nIt's like an interactive movie, you almost feel like you're a 16 year old boy again.\n\nI really did think this was going to be a shitty game with cliche conversations that were like something like, a conversation you'd think up at night of how a talk with a girl the next day would go, or something completely unrealistic like one of those newgrounds dating simulations. No such thing in this game. The dialogue very likely could've been taken from some shit I have said before to girls. The responses too sometimes made me feel like shit. It feels like the characters are real people, hurting them hurts me, the suspense of not knowing when to lie, the \"away\" message coming up in the middle of a conversation truly makes you feel like you've fucked up.\n\nAll I can say is, if you were around in the early 2000's and had a life, you will relate to this. Well worth the $5.00. \n\nThis really makes me want to relive my high school days, fuck man, back when the internet was simpler, it was actually texting and instant messaging, having conversations with people. It's just not the same anymore. It's an idea so simple, but for some reason is held close to my heart, maybe it's because of all the memories I have of people. \n\nThis is the only game in years that has actually made me feel emotions. This is the type of substance I fucking expect out of a big league $60.00 game! And I can't get it!

The multiple, vastly different endings are all worth getting to, and despite some repetition in dialogue across the different branches (most notably in Chapter 3 where the two different NPCs can spout the exact same lines of dialogue the other would have said had you taken a different path) each pathway through the game is gripping and entertaining.

Found an enclosure and booted up a /very/ old Maxtor 250GB drive, one I had throughout my highschool 'career'.  I remember using Trillian as opposed to the native AIM because of the extended/enhanced features, like automatically logging chats.  It's been a good ~13 or so years since highschool, and after 'playing' this one in particular, and thoroughly enjoying it, I figured I'd get a laugh out of all of the hilariously blown out-of-proportion teen speak that was emphasized here.\n\nI was wrong.  This game is spot on.  If you were in a teenager in the early or mid 2000s, you were this game.  Maybe you didn't use AIM or whatever, but you were definitely this game.\n\nMy intention was to only look at a few chat logs - that didn't happen.  I ended up spending hours reflecting, cringing, almost bringing myself to sobs.  I was the protagonist in this game, many times, and there were many Evelyn's and Emily's.  I had been hurt, had triumphed, hadn't known what the hell was going on -- had lied to gain favor -- everything.\n\nThe game is very simple by design.  Despite this, it manages to take you back into time where the Internet was a much simpler place and the line between good intention and malice was stowed away behind a low-res text window.  Social media, nowadays, it's nigh impossible to truly hide from someone.  Back in the days of AIM, Yahoo! Messenger, ICQ, and MSN, seeing someone's away message pop up in the middle of a conversation was a most tragic thing.  Did I screw up?  Is the person actually away?  Will I get a response back?\n\ntl;dr\n\nAn awesome, albeit short experience.  If you were a teen in the early-to-mid 2000s, you can almost be gauranteed to relate, and then reflect.

Nostalgia is a very powerful tool and 99% of shameless plays on that never work on me, but this game truly puts me back over a decade ago. That was true of the first one, and with the inclusion of websites, music and imagery of the time, it's even more true with Emily is Away 2.\n \nWhat is most astounding about this sequel, is how truly clever it is in comparison to its predecessor. EiA was very basic, in the idea of it having branching paths and all the work was in the AIM style, but EiA2 builds on these mechanics and tells stories in not only the AIM conversations, but through 2006 versions of popular websites. It uses the culture of the time, and what your tastes were THEN to characterize the personalities of these characters. You learn about people you never talk to simply because of the YouToob URL in their Buddy Profile or the survey they filled out on their Facenook page.\n \nI do not want to spoil any of the endlessly surprising tricks developer Kyle Seeley has injected  in this game, but the biggest compliment I can give is how immersive and real this game feels. I never thought the most intense gaming moment of my year would come from a text adventure, but here we are.\n \nMy only complaint is length, with my initial playthrough being around 2 hours, but it has a ton of different paths and endings. \n \nThat being said, I don't think I will do another playthrough. This is such an immersive game that I feel going back and making different decisions would be dishonest to the experience I just had. Choices matter, and I made some poor ones.

The characters all seemed pretty cool.\n- The other content that is brought into this game through Youtube and \"Facenbook\" is great, a genius way to add to this game.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\n- Minor: I couldn't access the \"desktop\" portion and it wasn't clear how to do that. Luckily it didn't affect the game play.\n- Minor: There were a few times where the text that was input didn't match what I selected and that was annoying.\n- Minor: In 2006 this would be Gmail, not AOL. lol\n- Major: It seems like the central mechanic of the game is a time based answer mechanic where it has a lot more to do with the time the computer takes to type the words then it does for you to write your response and is annoying.\n\nAll told this is a great game, and if you have $5 you should get it, but it's probably worth closer to $2.50.

It truly has been one of my Top 10's for best of 2017 thus far. It's simple, sure. But the pure emotion and thought-provoking story make up for the simplicity more than ten-fold. If you've ever had any doubts about playing Emily is Away Too, I can tell you it's worth it. For five USD, you're getting a ticket for one hell of a ride. I'm also raising my final rating to the highest 10/10 I can possibly give it. That makes it the first of the year. I don't know what it is about this game, but it really struck a chord with me. And I can tell that it's going to hold a very special place in my heart for some time to come. \"If I could see all my friends tonight...\"\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore I begin, I will preface with saying that as a \"Choose-Your-Own-Adventure\" style game, Emily is Away Too excels. It's a cut above your average hour-long romp of trial-and error storytelling that you see from most games of this calibre nowadays. It deals with some actual real-life situations and handles them very well. In a fashion that makes sense...for the most part. But we'll get into that later. Seeing as how this isn't an entirely \"complex\" game, i'm not going to go about using my normal review style. Instead, i'm just going to give you a short list of pro's, con's, and my in-depth thoughts on specific listed aspects in either catagory. Let's begin.\n\n[u] Pros [/u]\n-A pleasant and visually pleasing art-style remeniscant of the era being portrayed, and all the nostalgia that goes along with it.\n-Generally great pacing.\n-Two interesting, and in-depth main characters, although there's this one little instance...Well, we'll talk about that later.\n-A helluva nostalgia trip due to the setting. But, may I take a moment to say: [b] Fuck High-School. [/b] Really though, the setting is engaging, and it sets the stage for the story very well.\n-Actually reduces the window you play the game in down in size quite considerably, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It is very remeniscant of the old-school instant messaging programs you'd see back in the day. That's the point, after all. \n-An marvelous misadventure of a mini-game with knock-off Rick & Morty.\n-An exaggeration of an entire Internet inside the game, which is suprisingly interactable.\n-It gave me a cool wallpaper.\n-Lots of little secret icons to unlock.\n-Multiple endings.\n\n[u] Cons [/u]\n-The introduction and mentioning of multiple side-characters, but no real way to interact with them. Some of these people sound like pretty interesting characters! Let me talk to them, god-dammit!\n-The limitation to only a few dialouge options at a time. And most of the time, they're really generic and corny responses.  And sometimes, you'll find yourself with a bar full of options that ultimately mean the same thing, or the option you select will be changed by your character when he's typing it out! (That's how I got fucked over in the end.)\n-The lack of an option to punch Evelyn in the god-damn throat.\n\nSO, now that we've got that out of the way, let's pull a few things from the list, and talk in-depth about them. First-off: [b] What the actual FUCK?! [/b] WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! [spoiler] At a certain moment in the game when playing twenty-questions with Evelyn, you're presented with a question along the lines of: \"Have you ever had sex before?\" I decided to take the middle-of-the-road option and say: \"No, not really.\" Or, that's how it was presented as an option, at least. Instead, halfway through typing the response, my character turns around, pussies out, deletes the sentence and just says \"Yes.\". This is why I got fucked over at the end of the game. I had done everything else to the best of my abilities, and had run the game fairly well, I think. But it was this single event that threw the whole thing off the rails. When presented the same question by Emily, I selected the option of: \"No, only to third base.\" which wrote itself out in full. For this reason, at the end of the game, I was labeled as a \"liar\" and ended up getting kicked to the curb. [/spoiler] This instance is a slap across the face of the player, and I sincerely hope that it gets patched soon to avoid frustration. Now, If you're just reading this portion to avoid spoilers, and you're going to be set on hooking up with Emily, I would advise you [b] NOT [/b] to select \"No, not really.\" when presented with a question about your virginity from Evelyn. Now...let's talk about something positive. The overall premise of the game is great for the league it's in. You'd be pressed to find some of the better CYOA games out there of this formula. The art-style is great, the developer's got some great taste in music, I find the pseudo-Internet thing really charming, and the real-life-esque scenarios you're presented with are believable and engaging. I also find all the old, nostalgic sounds of the old OS's, and hard-drives oddly theraputic.\n\n*sigh* As you can probably tell if you read through my little rant given above, i'm kind of salty over a single fault in the game's design. But in all seriousness, it's a great CYOA game, and a great story in-and-of itself. You'll be getting around two hours of well-written dialouge, and interactive story, possibly three if you take the time to really dig deep into the psuedo-Internet in the game. And I say it's well-worth the price of admission.\n\nTL;DR: Great CYOA game. Check it out. It's five bucks.\n\nFinal Rating: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1495863774, "timestamp_updated": 1496122482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31988960": {"recommendationid": "31988960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088704217", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496165475}, "language": "english", "review": "Porbably the weirdest part about this game is the part where your real girlfriend comes in the room and you have to ssssh her and explain you're in a fight with your virtual girlfriend.\n10/10 would buy again.", "timestamp_created": 1495862997, "timestamp_updated": 1495862997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509367", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31988932": {"recommendationid": "31988932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088570666", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495865651}, "language": "english", "review": "Made me fall in love, cry, laugh, and give me arthiritis all in one gameplay 10/10 would recomend", "timestamp_created": 1495862823, "timestamp_updated": 1495862823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31988722": {"recommendationid": "31988722", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992990221", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495868516}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played this entirely.

It allows you to focus on two memorable characters (being Emily and Evelyn) and allows you to decide your fate with any of the characters and the way it does it is really impressive. This game really takes what you say to both characters and uses it against you (much like that of a Telltale game) so be cautious around both characters and choose which one you go for as they both can lead to satisfying endings! Or, play the game and experience its many quirks and wonderful features it has. I definitely reccomend this game for those who played the first one or others who are new with this serious, as it's a wonderful narrative and has wonderful replay value. \n\n10/10",

Ultimately, I feel like this game did an excellent job bringing me back to the days when I was in high school and silly conversations over AIM managed to feel like some of the most intense shit ever. It was easily worth the modest asking price of 5$ and I beat it in roughly 2-3 hours while playing at a very leisurely pace and pausing to converse with friends occasionally. More enjoyment derived here than 5$ at a fast food restaurant, for sure. \n\nGameplay is simple. The game thankfully subverts some of the more trite aspects of interpersonal simulations in other games, in that you can still form meaningful bonds with the main characters even if your character doesn't necessarily like all the same music and/or movie genres they like. Characters notice more than traits in common and will also pay attention to how consistent, genuine, and honest you are. The only thing I didn't care for was the timed responses sequences. The game is fair about how they're introduced - before timed interactions play any sort of meaningful part in the story it tests you with a timed sequence just to introduce the concept to you. That aside, ten seconds to type a reply isn't a lot of time even if you ARE paying attention. It's a bit jarring how suddenly this results in blowback in the story, but ultimately, it didn't hamper my enjoyment entirely. \n\nMessing around with the online components of Emily Is Away Too was enjoyable and neat, and I was able to get pretty immersed. With my first playthrough, I'm tempted to call this game 'best friend simulator'. \n\nI have yet to take on another playthrough and honestly, I'm not sure I want to. I enjoyed my first experience through it guide-free without worrying about achievements and seeing every possible outcome. I'm sure eventually I'll go through the rest, but for now, I encourage you to try this game and just sit back and get as into it as you can. Be you, and be the best friend you can be. Maybe you'll find love. Maybe you'll make a friendship or two that will last a lifetime.

[/h1]\nDo you like having your emotions fucked with? Then yes, yes indeed. If you like games that are influenced heavily by your choices (like yours, truly) this game most likely will not disappoint you. It's a simplistic idea executed extremely well.\n\n[h1] What's the Game Like? [/h1]\nEmily Is Away Too is completely text-based. It's essentially an IM emulator, if IM made you cry for hours on end after using it. The main attraction of Emily Is Away Too is undoubtedly, the story (unless mashing buttons on your keyboard is your kink, in that case, the gameplay will satisfy you, like your mother did me last night. Shit joke, sorry.) To tell you about it would honestly spoil the experience. What I can tell you is that in Emily Is Away Too, you message two girls, Emily and Evelyn. Two very different characters. You try to flirt with the characters and get with them, but you must remember that your consequences do matter very much in this game. If there is a criticism to be had, it's probably that in some points of the game, I felt that at some points, no matter what option I picked, it wouldn't be the one I would actually intent on using, It throws the immersion off a little bit.\n\n[h1] Anything Else? [/h1]\nImmerse Yourself. That's it. It won't be enjoyable if you don't immerse yourself first. Oh, and you should probably play the first game before buying this one, it's free so it's kind of like a demo. Don't worry, it's not as long as this one.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nThis game can be truly saddening or happy depending on the choices you make. Remember, before making a decision, be ready to face the consequences.\n\n[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]\nI'd give Emily Is Away Too a 8.5/10, it's a nifty little game and is definitely humbly priced. I just wish there were a bit more options, is all.

I had really loved the first game, and I still believe the first game was waaaaay better. And I will tell you why. In the first game, you had way more decisions, everything was on a larger time scale (including both high school and college) and everything felt way more real. It had soul, nothing felt rushed or contrived. It really hit home. \nNow about this game. Not much happens. Minor spoiler warning. You just decide between which girl you want to hit on and....... that's pretty much it. It only takes place during senior year, which makes it less interesting.\nSPOILER WARNING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see, the whole crux of the game is whether you will tell the two girls different things so that they like you. Eventually this will backfire, but in an absolutely contrived way. For example, in my playthrough, I lied to Evelyn about some stuff, and hooked up with Emily. In the final chapter, Emily found out and broke up with me. WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CONTRIVED. Instead of the normal thing to say like \"I lied to Evelyn because I didn't feel confortable admitting that I am a virgin to someone I don't know that well, but I said the truth to you because I know you better and care about you\", both the player character and Emily acted weirdly and stupidly, and that made me feel angry, not sentimental. And the fact that the game just ENDS after the breakup is bad. In the original, your relationship went through a lot: being firends in high school, maybe hitting on her on prom, growing distant in college, maybe inviting her over and maybe having sex, and then a touching ending, in which the game mechanics themselves betrayed you. It was awesome. So no, don't spend your money on this.

I've never met anyone that does that, and it was immersion breaking compared to the relatively realistic typing of the first game.\n\nAnother issue I had was the deceptive use of the Assisted Typing, what I assumed to be a practical tool. It ended up screwing me over, making me take too long to respond in a time-sensitive situation, likely changing the outcome of my game. Not the fault of me or my choices, but because of the game's slow auto-type speed. That pretty much took out all the immersion in my playthrough.\n\nMy final issue was how the game ended for me. From general experience, multiple endings in a game is typically intriguing and would make me want to play through multiple times. The ending I got made little sense interpersonally and should have had more appropriate options to respond with. I felt forced to play through picking whatever choice I thought was least stupid in the last chapter, instead of picking what I thought to be something I'd say. There was also a contradiction that I thought would be addressed but unfortunately wasn't (involving an alcohol scenario), which was strange to see missed out on.\n\nIn the end, I just felt pissed off at the game and Emily's script, instead of the rich emotion I got out of the first game. \n\nI still give this a thumbs up because of its uniqueness as a game, and I can genuinely see how this game could be incredibly enjoyable if played right. I suppose I was unlucky in my hindered experience with this game.\n\nTLDR/Summary: Iff weirdd doublee letterss don'tt botherr youu, and you don't play with Assisted Typing on, you'll probably enjoy this game a lot.

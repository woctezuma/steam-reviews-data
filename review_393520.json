Not only that but they sometimes get a little preachy (I won't spoil what but there's a lot of tumblr-isms) which can get tiring after a while.\n\nThank god that cutscenes are like 1% of the game, and the rest 99% is absolute gold. The movement and the combat blend perfecty with eachother and both can be augmented with different tweaks that you have to find and craft which in turn give you access to more parts of the game. Granted this is all optional but good luck getting through some of the boss fights without them.\n\nOverall this game has outstanding gameplay but there are a lot of issues with the story.

With that said, I have a confession to make here, and it really hurts me to have to say this because fans of mine will know that I always finish games before I write my reviews on them, but Iconoclasts, I don\u2019t know if I can finish this game, I\u2019m legitimately bored to tears here. I had a stream open where I was watching a guy play Fire Emblem and I thought that was more entertaining than playing this game. I\u2019d be happy to go into more detail on that, just let me know in the comments, some really interesting tactics were put into action.\n\nDo not for a second listen to anyone that describes Iconoclasts as a Metroidvania, because it\u2019s more like Cave Story in the sense that it\u2019s linear with chances for some very limited exploration, like that part where you have to collect all the dogs in the desert area (maybe it was cats). Now here\u2019s where we run into one of our issues with Iconoclasts: there isn\u2019t much there. Cave Story had health and missile upgrades that you could find as well as a variety of hidden items and weapons. In other words, if you went off the beaten path you would be rewarded. In Iconoclasts, the reward for every single optional challenge that I\u2019ve found so far is one of four different types of ore. What do you do with the ore? I\u2019m glad you asked, what happens is that you go to a workbench and trade in a certain combination of these ores and receive a \u201ctweak\u201d which you can equip into one of your \u201ctweak slots\u201d. Tweaks are minor upgrades, such as being able to stay underwater for longer or being able to take an extra hit. If you take damage, your right-most tweak slot will break; you start with three so if you take three consecutive hits your tweaks will be useless until you can collect special orbs by breaking statues (even healing at a save point doesn\u2019t restore your tweaks). This is the only form of optional content in the game that I\u2019ve encountered so far, is opening the chests and getting tweak materials that you won\u2019t even end up spending because you have so many and none of the tweaks sound that interesting. What this means is that there\u2019s very little motivation to do anything other than go exactly where the game tells you to go. Even if there were other types of optional rewards I\u2019m not really sure what they could be, because, outside of boss fights, the game tends to focus more on platforming- and timing-based puzzles (which I\u2019d like to add tend towards being tedious/boring more than anything else, now that I think about it I should probably focus on how boring doing the puzzles is but man the system with the tweaks really pisses me off) than combat; even on the hardest difficulty available when you start the game, enemies are fairly sparse and save points are so close together that health upgrades would be completely unnecessary. This is probably an identity issue more than anything else; Iconoclasts isn\u2019t sure what it wants to be.\n\nWhile the general pattern of gameplay is to run through however many puzzle rooms, maybe backtrack a bit in the process (very tedious), and then encounter a boss, Iconoclasts tries really hard to be a \u201cnarrative game\u201d. There are, to put it nicely, way too many cutscenes and general gameplay interruptions in Iconoclasts. This might not be a problem if the writing was good or the story was interesting, but no, both are complete dogshit. The writing is incredibly cliched, and while the game tries to take itself seriously it just comes off as super ham-fisted because it\u2019s impossible to see Iconoclasts as anything but a video game. The environments themselves are very video game-y, with levers and doors and locks and keys everywhere, there\u2019s no attempt to try to make things fit into the context of the game world. The village that your character lives in, in classic JRPG fashion, appears to have a grand total of 5 or 6 residents. When you\u2019re given directions, the characters don\u2019t say \u201cWest\u201d or \u201cEast\u201d, they say \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d, like \u201cgo right of your house to reach the village\u201d. I can\u2019t believe that this setting exists, and as a result I can\u2019t bring myself to care about anything that\u2019s happening in it. The plot itself, I was going to try to describe it in a way that made it sound stupid, but it\u2019s literally just about intolerance. It really isn\u2019t subtle at all, there\u2019s a big evil religion that controls everything and you know what who cares, it isn\u2019t interesting, it isn\u2019t believable, it\u2019s communicated entirely through clich\u00e9s, the plot of this game isn\u2019t worth thinking about other than to wonder about why you have to waste so much time mashing through text boxes.\n\nIconoclasts looks nice but that\u2019s it, it\u2019s a one-trick pony, all style zero substance. Fighting the bosses isn\u2019t bad but so much of the game is spent doing other, much more boring things. Also, the game is probably like 8-9 hours long. Hey, that\u2019s reminding me of another game that I played recently, hmmm, that\u2019s right, it\u2019s No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle, developed by Grasshopper Manufacture for the Nintendo Wii and released in 2010! But wait, NMH2 is a good game, how could that be? Well, dear reader, that\u2019s because NMH2 knows what it wants to be, you run at enemies, mash buttons, and eventually you fight a boss. Is the game filled with long cutscenes, is there even that much of a plot? Of course not, but even with how minimal the story is, you still get a sense of what the game is trying to do. NMH2 also had an entire team of devs working on it, so the risk of getting sidetracked from the primary goal was comparatively low. Iconoclasts, what is it, who is it for? It\u2019s got Contra-esque bosses, but it also has a lot of platforming puzzles. It looks like it might be a Metroidvania, with the map and all, but it isn\u2019t really? And it\u2019s still trying to have a really heavy and impactful story despite the fact that implementing something like that clearly isn\u2019t the dev\u2019s forte? Ultimately, Iconoclasts is a lesson on why we need other people in our lives; they give us value, they give us meaning, and they prevent us from cluttering up our Cave Story fangames with puzzles and terrible writing.\n\nTaster\u2019s score: C-\n", "timestamp_created": 1516887945, "timestamp_updated": 1516887945, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447679", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39605237": {"recommendationid": "39605237", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988065337", "num_games_owned": 753, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "last_played": 1516885145}, "language": "english", "review": "Man, this was worth the wait.

It's a shining example of simple game design, executed amazingly well, created by a truly humble designer, Konjak. It's not perfect, but oddly that kind of coincides wonderfully with the overall theme of the game...\n\nThe gameplay itself is absolutely delicious. Motion is tight, responsive and goes at just the right speed to make traversal through the beautiful world rarely seem tedious. The stomp attacks and wrench grabbing have a little bit of homing on them, and generous hit boxes so as to allow the player to never really slow down. Think Metroid run speed with Megaman air control. Not only that you can increase this speed, making Iconoclasts a viable speed run game.\n\nCombat is simple to execute, and bosses are fun and unique for the most part, save for one or two slightly frustrating set pieces. Konjak made a point to try and make all boss fights somewhat unique, and while in rare cases this makes some feel like a slog as you're trying to work out what to do, they all shine in one way or another. The other great thing is that it's clearly shown the moment they switch gears. Under their health bar is sometimes a selection of crystals, giving you an inkling of how many times this boss will switch tactics and a good idea of the time it will take. It's a simple yet very nice addition that I appreciate after loving Cuphead's progress meter after every death. It's also nice that the game does not subscribe to the 'hard game' trope that is often used to bloat an otherwise short game. It knows exactly what it wants to be without pandering to hardcore gamers.\n\nWhere this game really shines is its presentation. There are no voice actors present, and the game is dialogue heavy. However, the design, the beautiful animations, the actual thought put into how emotion is portrayed through text effects and the flow of it all really showcases the care Konjak had for the narrative. Each character is as flawed as eachother, [spoiler]including the main character Robin, who essentially by the end of the game is somewhat selfishly doing what she wants to do, rebelling against a world that tells her she can't do everything. Indeed her trying to do everything is sometimes the catayst for alot of misery, and even when saving the world, it was almost less about saving anything than to show her traumatised older brother that she doesn't need his protection, amking the whole end sequence almost a violent temper tantrum[/spoiler]. It really hammers home the weakness of humanity, how even the powerful are nothing more than human, and how we all find comfort in one thing or another, be it faith, family or even fear.\n\nStill, as stated, it's not perfect. My main gripes have been miniscule at best, but still memorable as flaws. Some bosses are a tad obtuse, often several minutes spent trying to work out the path forward. Some people would probably work it out quicker than others, but there's an inconsistency to the help you get, like in some cases a partner in a boss fight will hint at you the way forward, but on other bosses they stay silent. While this is not too bad, being predisposed to getting hints can make some boss sequences a folly of trying to work out the correct bunch of powers or the right sequence. Once the gears start turning again however, they go down quickly and don't ever repeat the mistake. \n\nAnother problem, again with the odd boss, is that there is A LOT going on. You can get lost in the mish mash characters as everyone explodes their flashy animations everywhere or dialogue attempts to distract you. It's rare, but it feels a little sloppy. When done correctly though, it's a visual feast.\n\nMy final gripe is that some heavily scripted moments can break, meaning that the game soft locks. I feel a quick restart function like in old Playstation RPGs would really help keep the pace going fast. Thankfully the game has some generous checkpoints and many save points so you never feel too overwhelmed. \n\nAll in all, it's a fantastic narrative driven action platformer that delivers a near perfect experience. Fascinating, funny, equal parts heart warming and heart wrenching and polished to a mirror sheen, this game being worth the wait is a pretty huge understatement.\n\nGet it, be inspired.", "timestamp_created": 1516880455, "timestamp_updated": 1516880455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505230", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39601144": {"recommendationid": "39601144", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989433135", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 724, "last_played": 1516825029}, "language": "english", "review": "i'm ~35% in this game on Hard and find it to be pretty boring.

While it may have the appearance of being well produced, it's hard to not feel that those efforts lie almost entirely in surface level aspects. Iconoclasts is a game that has somewhat satisfying movement, cool effects ,etc, and deserves notice for such, but this is about as far as my praise will go.\n\nIt's difficult to be concise about the problems Iconoclasts is plagued with as there is such a huge variance between them. Iconoclasts feels like a game that underwent many iterations, and instead of confidently embracing one, a messy cluster was settled upon instead. Part shooter, part puzzle, part platformer, part brooding drama, Iconoclasts fails to elegantly combine these aspects and instead presents a game where none of these aspects shine.\n\nA majority of the gameplay in Iconoclasts is puzzles. While maybe not the focus of how this game is marketed, a primary chunk of time spent within the gameplay loop will be messing with switch puzzles of varying complexity. Every upgrade, 6 hours into the game at least, functions first and foremost as a new means of solving a switch puzzle. A problem with this, is that these puzzles don't combine new elements in a compelling or interesting way. Getting an electricity attachment for the grenade launcher doesn't mean that you solve problems in a new way, it just means that you have a new type of switch you can shoot. This alone isn't egregious, but to be frank it's pretty boring. Where Iconoclasts transcends from boring to annoying is the fusion of these elements with the combat and platforming sections. It is very often in Iconoclasts where a puzzle is made \"more difficult\" by having an enemy, or a bed of thorns placed to punish failure. These additions never make a puzzle more interesting, it frankly just makes them fucking annoying to deal with, especially given that the rewards for the optional puzzles are almost never worth it (see tweaks later). There is also a very frequent issue with the puzzles in this game where the primary source of difficulty is from elements being communicated poorly to the player. I haven't once yet had the ever sought after \"A-ha!\" moment from the puzzles in this game. Puzzles made me familiar with \"well that was bullshit\" more than anything else. On a related note, the mini map has outright lied about whether I can access rooms from above or below, making some of the exploration based puzzles terrible to experience (The Tower, notably. Rooms that need to be accessed from below saying they can be accessed from above, etc etc)\n\nThe pace at which you're given new gear & upgrades is disappointingly slow, especially given how little they actually change gameplay (as mentioned above). The lack of movement options makes platforming and exploration a total slog. It feels as if Iconoclasts is afraid to give players any movement options (I could be wrong given that I haven't completed the game) for fear of puzzles not being solved in the intended way.\n\nCombat is a total bore, as most engagements are won by sitting and waiting to spam attacks, or using the exact same strategies over and over. Enemies aren't used in interesting and new contexts, they serve exclusively as annoying roadblocks to pad out game time.\n\nBoss fights suffer the same communicative issues as puzzles mentioned earlier. I've had cases of bosses giving off explosions particles on hit, only to later learn that I wasn't damaging them at all. Boss fights are also very willing to throw in new mechanics at irelevant times, like spamming you with notifications that Mina has a shotgun when it isn't immediately relevant.\n\nTweaks as a system are baffling and annoying. They're not important enough to have any weight on your completion of the game, but they feel as if they exist to curb mechanical intrusions. The tweak to charge your electric wrench is a perfect example. Without the tweak on, a full wrench spin is about 1 tick too short of charging the wrench. It completes in one spin with the right tweak though. Getting the spin duration up tweak isn't a fun or meaningful change to my character. It feels like a feature that should've just been there already. Additionally, some of the most desirable tweaks are heavily gated for no discernable reason, such as \"run speed up\". It almost feels like the game doesn't want me to have fun at times.\n\nMost egregious of these all is the writing. To be frank, the writing is pretty insufferable in this game. While the moment to moment banter is alright, the game will constantly derail itself as often as possible to exposition dump uninteresting lore and racial/cultural drama. I don't think I'm the only one so tired of seeing racial allegories being slapped on to titles so that we can pretend characters are more multi-faceted than they are. The racial and cultural tensions feel wildly insincere and half-assed. It's gotten to the point where I want to skip a cutscene if I see Mina talking. The writing feels more focused on angsty shouting and squabbling instead of any ideological confrontation. It feels almost patronizing how unspecific this drama is. If you do decide to play Iconoclasts, my sincere advice is to literally skip every dialogue scene as fast as possible. The drama presented in Iconoclasts is mostly a vehicle to push the plot. It is woefully non-concise, insincere, and worst of all boring.\n\nDespite being what a lot of people probably believe to be considerably harsh, I look forward to seeing more projects from this developer. I'm not usually one for this phrase, but Iconoclasts is loaded with \"potential\". The bottom line is that in it's current iteration, it feels \"undercooked\".", "timestamp_created": 1516852782, "timestamp_updated": 1516852782, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598886", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39596162": {"recommendationid": "39596162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011746963", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 736, "last_played": 1516825690}, "language": "english", "review": "Superbly polished gameplay, incredibly high-quality pixelart and animations, great humor, and a well-paced and interesting (if at times thematically muddy) narrative.

You'll definitely get your money's worth.\n\nJust can't recommend it enough.", "timestamp_created": 1516798628, "timestamp_updated": 1516799592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39579414": {"recommendationid": "39579414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006165906", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 89, "last_played": 1516793475}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0443 7-8 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0415\u0449\u0435 \u0432 2012\u043c \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0432, \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0444\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043a\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432, \u044f \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d. \u041d\u043e \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0432, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0438 \u0432\u044b\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c, \u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430.\n\n\u0421\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439, \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c.\n\u0412 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \"\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0434\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\" \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0447\u0438\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c.\n\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e Joakim Sandberg \u0437\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0448\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440! \n\u042f \u0443\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0435\u0449\u0435 2015 \u0430 \u0442\u044b \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433! \u0412\u0430\u0443!\n\n\u041d\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0442\u0435\u043c, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442 \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440 \"\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0434\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439\" (\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u044b \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u044b\u043b \u043b\u043e\u043b)\n\u0410 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0443 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0436 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e \u0441 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c, \u043d\u043e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 (\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044e\u0442, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430)", "timestamp_created": 1516795230, "timestamp_updated": 1516795230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39579408": {"recommendationid": "39579408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001273308", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 644, "last_played": 1516790841}, "language": "english", "review": "Look upon this game and tremble.

Blueprints for new accessories, and the materials needed to craft them.  This game allows you to equip up to 3 'tweaks' at a time, but in order to get these, you'll need to find the blueprints and materials, which are often hidden in boxes in out-of-the-way areas, sometimes requiring some platforming or light/medium environmental puzzling to reach.  No grinding for materials by killing enemies, as all of them are found via exploration.  The more you explore, the more types of tweaks you'll be able to craft, and the less selective you'll have to be with which ones you decide to make.\n\nThe difficulty seems pretty mild during the 3 hours I've put in so far, but has been ramping up at a gradual rate to where I'm starting to feel challenged at times, so I think it's probably fine.  There is also a 'harder' mode availible from the start, which might be more ideal for those looking for a tougher game from the start. \n\nThe lore and story of this game have been interesting to pay attention to so far.  The characters are also great, each with their own personalities, motivations, and backstory.  There has been some genuinely funny writing, too.. There are quips, sarcasm, blunders, and even a little bit of mild 4th-wall-breaking, which for me are always appropriate and never too over-the-top, and just enough to give the characters some extra pizazz, and a serious-but-not-too-serious vibe that I have been enjoying.\n\nThe graphics look great, of course.  You can tell that much from the screenshots and videos here on the store.  Unless you have a problem with sprites and pixel-art, you'll enjoy the quality of the drawing and animation.  Every inch of this game oozes life and atmosphere.  The music is catchy and pleasing to hear.  The sound effects are perfect, suiting the style of the game just fine and sounding great.  \n\nIn my opinion, this is the best game to come out so far in the month of January 2018.  Well-worth the money.  If you've been looking for something to play, and if this looks good to you, then I say go for it.  Quality through the roof, top-notch indie game.  I'm glad Joakim finished this game.

Its development alone, the hobby project of one man spanning a gestation period of half a decade, showed the world that one person, with a singular vision and a self-motivated drive to express themselves through the melding of both the sciences and the arts and a window roughly 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high, could create a new, personal style of game that rivaled, and in many ways surpassed the experiences handed to us from the Nintendos and Segas of the heyday. This Metroidvania -- a portmanteau which owes its very existence to this masterwork of code, pixels, and FM synths -- would spark the powerkeg that would kick off the independent revolution.\n\nIt was amongst this backdrop that I, a starry eyed youngboy with a copy of Multimedia Fusion and a devil may care attitude would take aim to the skies and shoot down the albatross that would hang around my neck for decades. It was around this time that I began work on The Underside.\n\nFor a decade prior to this big mistake, I had been part of one of the lesser tribes of the proto-indie games community, the Click Community. Under the label \"Fallen Angel Industries,\" I had worked alongside a few rabblerousers, one of which was a quiet swede who at the time was going by the name ZeroTau. His big project, his Moby Dick in this convoluted and barely cohesive string of nautical fiction references was a Monster World IV inspired platformer called \"Mina of the Pirates,\" a swashbuckling adventure that starred the titular (or was it eponymous) heroine, Mina, who indeed was a pirate.\n\nYears passed, the Click Community faded into obscurity, a few of its graduating members moving onto become indie games figureheads. Mina of the Pirates -- the game that had captured the hearts of the young boys and girls that had devoted their precious dial-up bits to arguing over bad South Park fangames and whether or not Derek Yu's Eternal Daughter was actually good or not (turns out it was, but I had not yet developed a discerning eye in my teenaged years) -- was nowhere to be seen. The name \"ZeroTau\" was scarcely seen without a dangling \"Mina\" modifier, and as weeks became months, and months became years, and the albatross grew heavier and heavier still. Perhaps it was the weight of the expectation coupled with Multimedia Fusion's finnicky toolset that finally did it, but Mina was canceled and as the game he had worked on for years faded in the public's consciousness, so too did the name ZeroTau. (I may of course be playing it fast and loose with the events of history for the sake of creating poetic flow.)\n\nI know this feeling all too  well. I grew up creating games alongside ZeroTau, who now goes by the name Konjak. I too had that albatross project, for his Mina of the Pirates, I had my own The Underside. What began as a 16x16 box moving around the screen and shooting other 16x16 boxes with smaller, 8x8 boxes would eventually grow up to be the single game that defined my existence. Every new image I'd put out of the game would be passed around the dark corners of the internet like some weird pre-internet pornography. It's true, I once had the gall to end a 30 minute demo of the game with the words \"coming soon\" -- a phrase that would become a recurring punch in my career as a indie games developer.\n\nJust as shooting that albatross would become the catalyst that would strand the ship of the ancient mariner at sea, The Underside, Mina of the Pirates, and yes, even Iconoclasts, the very game I set out to write about but have until this point failed to mention by name even once, all found themselves in development limbo, and their fans, the crew of the ship, once working together to steer the ship towards land found themselves veering off course and inadvertantly becoming agents of pressure and torment. In the poem, the other members of the crew end up succumbing to the sea left feeling nothing but emnity towards the mariner, shaping the mariner into the type of crazed old man who takes a perfectly happy wedding guest passerby and unpromptedly drops this sort of story on him.\n\nWhich is why it's an imperative that you play The Iconoclasts. This is to say nothing about how it looks or plays -- neither of these things should be a surprise to you if you've ever played Noitu Love or Legend of Princess, or if you have any sort of fond memories of the off-kilter, bouncy, kinetic feel of old Treasure games like Gunstar Legends or Mischief Makers. You can feel Konjak's poured his soul into every inch of the game, from the incredibly hand pixeled opening animation, to the little visual flourishes like the bouncy save confirmation prompt (yes, the save confirmation prompt in this game somehow manages to exude more charm than most games have in their best moments)\n\nInstead, Iconoclasts is a game that exists in spite of its legacy -- you can, at times, feel a bit of Konjak in the story as Robin, a quiet mechanic with a very big tool quiety fights back against the One Concern, a legion of faceless fascists who publicly decry, but secretly kind of rely on Robin's skills as a mechanic. And not to beat a beat a dead horse with a big wrench, but to see Konjak finally release this thing, to kill Moby Dick and to take off that dumb bird necktie he's been lugging around for over a decade, well, it leaves THIS ol' grizzled mariner feeling a bit overstunned (a wonderful turn of phrase I hope I'll be seeing a lot more in the coming years)\n\nAnyways, I hope you enjoyed my review of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, it's certainly worth a read if you haven't already encountered it in your high school English classes.", "timestamp_created": 1516742146, "timestamp_updated": 1516758296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696509", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39566667": {"recommendationid": "39566667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099954891", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 735, "last_played": 1516900459}, "language": "polish", "review": "[h1]Czy 10 lat developingu poz\u0142o na marne?[/h1]\n\nIconoclasts jest to gra kt\u00f3ra powstawa\u0142a blisko dekad\u0119,czy to oznacza \u017ce jest arcydzie\u0142em?

Every inch of this game is dripping with style, from the charming character sprites to the utterly gorgeous environment art- there isn't a section of the screen that isn't a joy to look at. The animation doesn't hold anything back either, and all that gorgeous pixel art looks great in motion.\n\nThe music is pretty good- and fits each area/boss really well. I haven't run into any songs that specifically stand out, but in general they've all set the tone really well.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect from a quality metroidvania- you can jump, you can shoot, you can hit things with your giant wrench, and there's a whole bag of tricks to unlock throughout the game. Iconoclasts doesn't focus on combat as much as you'd expect, and apart from using enemies as mobile obstacles, for the most part running around in the world is more focused on puzzles & platforming challenges- at least early on. Which is actually kinda refreshing. Enemies also don't respawn often, so you aren't forced to re-fight everything while backtracking around puzzles.\n\nFollowing that trend, the bosses are also more puzzle than fight in a lot of ways, and I spend more of my time trying to figure out how to exploit/reveal their weaknesses than plinking away at a massive healthbar. Each boss also completely unique so far, and have all been fascinating to fight.\n\nYou also get companion characters! Though they're plot limited so far, and generally only stick around for a bit, they're kinda fun to work with when taking down bosses- which is something I haven't really seen in this genre before.\n\nLastly, and almost most notably- this game's writing is really solid. Iconoclasts is set in an extremely broken world governed by a regressive, tyrannical religion that seems determined to keep everyone in the stone age. Almost immediately you're introduced to a handful of colorful (or not so colorful) characters, who paint a fairly vivid picture of the state of things. It's kind of crazy how stark of a contrast it is against the bright and cheery visuals, but it works really well. Despite that, there are still a large number of jokey moments that were absolutely hilarious, and caught me completely by surprise.\n\nOverall, Iconoclasts is already one of the best games of 2018, and I doubt that opinion will change as I play through the rest of the game.

Lo hemos podido ver con Eric Barone y su excelente Stardew Valley, y, desde ya, os aseguro que Joakim Sandberg es otro de estos peque\u00f1os grandes artistas, su obra Iconoclasts, as\u00ed lo va a demostrar en las semanas y meses venideros. Puesto que tras 7 a\u00f1os de duro trabajo, se nota que aqu\u00ed hay calidad y aut\u00e9ntica pasi\u00f3n por el mundo del videojuego.\n\nPero antes de nada, pong\u00e1monos en situaci\u00f3n. Somos Alondra, una mec\u00e1nica en un mundo gobernado por una sociedad religiosa en la que el uso de la maquinaria y el combustible que las hacen funcionar, el Marf\u00edl, est\u00e1n estrictamente regulados por ellos, quienes dicen representar al dios al que todo el mundo teme, pues los pecados se pagan caros con la llamada Penitencia. As\u00ed pues, Alondra como mec\u00e1nica debe medir cuidadosamente sus pasos si no quiere terminar en el punto de mira de esta organizaci\u00f3n que controla todo, o casi todo... Sin embargo, la aventura comienza con un acontecimiento que desencadenar\u00e1 una serie de sucesos que cambiar\u00e1n la vida de Alondra y la de su planeta al completo para siempre. Y hasta aqu\u00ed puedo decir, de verdad, a nivel argumental el juego me ha sorprendido much\u00edsimo, es tal la profundidad que tiene en cuanto a lore que es algo que para nada uno se espera en este tipo de juegos.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1278882655\n\nVamos a conocer a much\u00edsimos personajes muy interesante a lo largo de la aventura, tanto enemigos como aliados, cada uno de ellos con una personalidad y una \u00e9pica arrolladoras, por momentos incluso vais a creer que est\u00e1is en un jrpg dada la cantidad y calidad de los di\u00e1logos. Es una trama que no solo se sigue con much\u00edsimo inter\u00e9s, si no que adem\u00e1s saber combinar con maestr\u00eda momentos de humor, drama o acci\u00f3n. Y a la que solo se me ocurre una palabra para describirla; Sublime.\n\nEn cuanto a la jugabilidad, que es otro elemento important\u00edsimo en esta clase de videojuegos, tranquilos, est\u00e1 a la altura de los mejores plataformas y/o metroidvanias que se os puedan venir a la cabeza. El control es perfecto, y las animaciones r\u00e1pidas, los saltos los puedes ajustar al milimetro y tenemos una amplia gama de movimientos, desde saltar, agacharnos, reptar, engancharnos a los bordes... Nada se echa en falta cuando juegas a Iconoclast ni tampoco sientes que nada sea mejorable en ning\u00fan momento, de nuevo se vuelve a notar que su creador ha aprovechado mucho esos 7 a\u00f1os que le ha llevado crear esta maravilla virtual.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1278883916\n\nEl desarrollo del juego es una mezcla entre metroidvania y juego de plataformas, pues a principio avanzamos por zonas mientras dejamos otras atr\u00e1s, no obstante llegados a cierto punto podremos regresar libremente a todas las ya visitadas, dando como resultado un enorme mapeado coherentemente interconectado. No en vano contaremos con el t\u00edpico minimapa donde ver las habitaciones estructuradas en cuadraditos, por tanto, la exploraci\u00f3n es fundamental para descubrir secretos. \n\nEn los escenarios nos iremos encontrando enemigos a los que despacharemos con nuestra pistola aturdidora o bien a golpes cuerpo a cuerpo con nuestra fiel llave inglesa, que adem\u00e1s \u00e9sta nos ser\u00e1 \u00fatil para resolver ciertos \"puzles\" que encontraremos, los cuales siempre se combinar\u00e1n siempre con plataformas, dando como resultado un gameplay que en ning\u00fan momento se torna mon\u00f3tono. Por supuesto conforme avancemos iremos obteniendo ciertos objetos que nos brindar\u00e1n nuevas habilidades, al tiempo que nos permiten acceder a zonas previamente inaccesibles. Y adem\u00e1s, podremos craftear ciertas mejoras que nos otorgar\u00e1n m\u00e1s salud o mayor velocidad de movimiento etc. Por lo que esto \u00faltimo es otra capa m\u00e1s de profundidad en la jugabilidad.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1278883413\n\nPor si fuera poco, el juego nos ir\u00e1 sorprendiendo a cada paso con peque\u00f1as mec\u00e1nicas que rompen por completo con la f\u00f3rmula habitual de plataformeo etc. Por ejemplo, lo mismo estamos escapando de unos guardias con sigilo, que participando en un minijuego que simula el tres en ralla, por poner dos ejemplos. Y lo m\u00e1s incre\u00edble que es nada est\u00e1 metido con calzador, todo tiene su por qu\u00e9 a nivel argumental. \n\nLos jefes finales, que por cierto hay m\u00e1s de 20, merecen una menci\u00f3n a parte. El primero, muy simple, s\u00ed, solo es el tutorial... El resto, a cu\u00e1l m\u00e1s original que el anterior, sinceramente, una sorpresa tras otra. Cada uno con sus mec\u00e1nicas propias y bastante desafiantes (sin llegar a frustrar). No hay ni un solo enfrentamiento que m\u00ednimamente se parezca a otro, y eso en un juego con tantos jefes finales es todo un logro, os lo aseguro. Hablar de los enfrentamientos es hacer spoilers, porque de verdad, derrochan originalidad por los cuatro costados y est\u00e1n tan ligados a la propia trama del juego que es mejor no decir nada m\u00e1s. Tan solo recomendaros tirar por el modo dif\u00edcil, ya que ser\u00e1 una experiencia m\u00e1s satisfactoria, puesto que en este modo los jefes finales cuentan con m\u00e1s ataques y son mucho m\u00e1s divertidos.\n\nPara terminar, el apartado gr\u00e1fico y sonoro, decir que est\u00e1n a la altura del resto del programa. Cuenta con unas animaciones exquisitas, los personajes muestran muy bien sus emociones con ese pixel art tan bueno que tiene Iconoclast (mucho mejor in-game que en las im\u00e1genes, ya os lo digo) y la banda sonora es buen\u00edsima, con temas muy variados que mezclan sonidos retro con toques modernos muy bien medidos. Las canciones se nos quedar\u00e1n grabadas en nuestra cabeza sin darnos cuenta. Lo que es una se\u00f1al inequivoca de que tiene gran calidad. Y por cierto, el juego est\u00e1 perfectamente traducido al espa\u00f1ol,adem\u00e1s de contar con una duraci\u00f3n generosa de entre 12 y 15 horas.\n\n[h1]An\u00e1lisis completo[/h1] http://www.mediavida.com/foro/juegos/analisis-de-iconoclasts-602247", "timestamp_created": 1516707388, "timestamp_updated": 1516731786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39554781": {"recommendationid": "39554781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043816722", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 665, "last_played": 1516799928}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc640! \uba54\ud2b8\ub85c\ubca0\ub2c8\uc544!  \ud0d0\ud5d8\uc694\uc18c! \uc65c \ub09c \uc774\ub7f0\uac8c\uc784\ub9cc \ubcf4\uba74 \ud765\ubd84\uc744 \uac10\ucd9c\uc218\uac00 \uc5c6\uc744\uae4c \u314b\u314b\n\uc870\uc791\uac10 \uad1c\ucc2e\uace0 \ubcf4\uc2a4 \uc801\ub2f9\ud788 \uadc0\ucc2e\uace0 \ud37c\uc990 \ub108\ubb34 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uace0 \ub9d8\uc5d0\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1516707372, "timestamp_updated": 1516707422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39554778": {"recommendationid": "39554778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045411400", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "last_played": 1516797575}, "language": "english", "review": "[Full review pending, will be posted at a later date.]\n\nThis game is the near decade long passion project of one incredible human being known as Joakim Sandberg.\n\nI have played this game for just over half an hour, highly recommended on that alone.\n\nWatch this person, they are a force to be reckoned with, appreciate their work while you have the chance.\n\nIconoclasts is a 2D, incredibly detailed, fluidly animated, action platformer. It has actual DS4/PS4 controller support and every move in the first half hour delivers responsive, satisfying, audio/visual feedback. Sharp sound effects and lively animation punctuate every action. Moving in this videogame feels great, exercising your toolkit (wrench, gun, movement) consistently delivers in combat as well against environmental hazards. The world and its inhabitants look, sound, and are characters of intrigue. The writing is straight to the point while bein' witty and the introduction wastes none of your time. The HUD is snappy and delivers extra charm to tha game in its presentation.  I get a sense of nostalgia, but one which states the past still has unrealized potential bein' finally realized right 'ere, raight nao. I hafta play the whole game first, but this is highly favorable material right off the bat, I see that much potential in it.

Thank you Joakim, for the intro to your videogame alone, Love & Respect! :D\n\nJus' a heads up, do not buy this game on my recommendation alone at this time, as I'd like to release a more realized and experienced review in the future. This tentative placeholder is just a reminder to do so at some point. I did my research and so far, have had my expectations exceptionally exceeded. Still keep an eye on Joakim, but put in the work to see if this game is for you. If you want a beautiful action platformer with a strong personality and no nonsense introduction in terms of the first half hour, look no further.

So it's just a preliminary review and I'll update it more as I play more, but so far I'm having a blast! \n\nIf you are a fan of beautiful pixel art and metroidvanias, this game delivers in spades! Not to mention the writting is surprisingly funny! [Mild Spoilers] I just snuck past the guards after breaking out of jail. The converstaion the guards were having made me laugh hard enough that I kept intentionally failing the scene just to read through it again! \n\nI'm also really liking the world lore. Very unique! I like how the game doesn't just dump a bunch of info on you. Instead, it lets the world unfold in various conversations. \n\nIf anyone out there is on the fence about this, pick it up, give it a try. I know $20 is often seen as high for an indie game, but this game is worth it.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nA bit further in, the game is still funny. So far the only things I can critic is that the game is far too easy, even on the harder difficulty and, this is a personal preference, but I'm not a fan how the game is divided into little sub stages. I wish it was a big open world. It sucks how you hit a story point and then get dragged into the next area.

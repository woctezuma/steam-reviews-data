I love the character designs , enemy designs and way everything moves.\n\nMusic 8/10\n\nThe music in this game is also very abstract. From mellow to smashing a guitar this game has some very weird but good songs in it to listen too. If I could buy the soundtrack I would in a heartbeat.\n\nGameplay : 6/10\n\nThe gameplay is no way in focus for this game. It's put on the side to have more focus of the abstract elements of this game. I do enjoy the attack , item and enemy attack animations and the collecting aspect of ganing more skills as you go.

These animations are more than just \"eye candy\" as they give the moves  emphasis or adds intensity to varying attacks, making each feel natural.   \n\n-Words cannot justify the game, everything makes some sense when you launch the game.\n\n[b] -Important to note that any text that IS relative to the story is spoken simple enough to understand, [/b] the rest is gibberish from use of random text generation.\n\n-Overall it's pretty unheard of and I've not talked to many who have known of it, but it's surely worth a go.", "timestamp_created": 1511380535, "timestamp_updated": 1511380535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36750533": {"recommendationid": "36750533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255038307", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510778422}, "language": "english", "review": "An RPG for people that don\u00b4t like traditional RPGs\nHylics has a pleasing and creative artstyle alongside a soundtrack that i can only describe as anti-music,all this combined helps to make a short but absorbing experience full of memorable characters and mechanics\n\nAll this was made by a single person", "timestamp_created": 1511378552, "timestamp_updated": 1511378552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36708667": {"recommendationid": "36708667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035952504", "num_games_owned": 2094, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509216889}, "language": "english", "review": "weird but lovely", "timestamp_created": 1511374724, "timestamp_updated": 1511374724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498489", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36620994": {"recommendationid": "36620994", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970282291", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511155063}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite almost all text being randomly generated, this game is secretly a well crafted RPG.

took me a little under 4 hours in game time to finish my first playthrough (although i'm pretty slow at rpgs), wasn't disappointed. if you're expecting a really in-depth rpg in any aspect from gameplay or story, you're looking at the wrong game, it's more of an art showcase set to music (i'd dare to label a genre like prog rock but that's barely my alley) featuring interactive landscapes and characters.\n\nhylics is built with a version of rpg maker so anyone whose played an rpg maker game before (LISA, for example) will feel somewhat at home with the mechanics but many are stripped barebones and are super simplified if utilized at all. the combat isn't much, but it doesn't take away from the game. there's a nice variety in this game's items and equivalent to 'magic' in other rpgs; afaik many of the possible stats an instrument (weapon) or wearable object can have don't have any significance or bonus at all, and some have separate bonuses that aren't made obvious or are mentioned in the item description instead of as an added status effect, or something.\n\ngame isn't extremely hard but i died a lot; frequently at the start trying to get my bearings (so don\u2019t be discouraged), by trying to avoid instant-death enemies (more-so intentional obstacles), and intentionally not taking the time to heal or take care of my characters because death has almost no penalty\n\nevery time your party dies, you\u2019re taken to a hub where you can pick one of eight activatable checkpoints to transport to that you find throughout the game, and you\u2019re thrown right back in and can go refight (or avoid) whatever killed you from full health/will (MP). this is also where you \u2018level up;\u2019 killing enemies gives you \u2018meat\u2019 which you can take to the meat grinder in this after-life hub to gain more health; initially making you stronger every visit back.\n\nyou can become stronger and gain more bonuses (some of them nearly essential for fighting certain enemies) by buying items at shops, although, there\u2019ll be almost next to no need to revisit shops, and there\u2019s very few across the entire game, so it won\u2019t be a huge deal after you\u2019ve bought and found some of the best equipment. special moves that use will (basically MP) to cast are learned from interacting with TVs throughout the map and can all either damage enemies, heal your allies, or remove status effects (although I\u2019ve got no clue what some of them do; the game won\u2019t always tell you, so whatever), and there\u2019s a comfortable amount of variety. i haven\u2019t even found them all, i\u2019m sure\n\nthere isn\u2019t really much of a cohesive story and the dialogue is insane and nonsensical; it took me a while to realize it but as far as I can tell most of the dialogue with minor importance is pre-written pieces of sentence interchanged with randomized gibberish (as in, you\u2019ll get a different spiel every time you talk to some characters), which definitely adds to the game\u2019s weirdness factor, already pretty high because of the aesthetic and the music.\n\nthe art and the music (which pretty much makes up the core of the game) is likely not for everybody, but if you can stomach the trailers and screenshots and just wanted to know more about the game before you spend all of a little over 3 dollars (canadian), you should definitely pick this up.\n\nalso, the final boss\u2019 name is [spoiler]gibby[/spoiler]. fucking [spoiler][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cRPk6DXPkc]gibby[/url][/spoiler].", "timestamp_created": 1504321965, "timestamp_updated": 1511405080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34593584": {"recommendationid": "34593584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313993254", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492960542}, "language": "english", "review": "Words...fail to encompass just what Hylics is.

Coming from the brilliant mind of Mason Lindroth, Hylics is a very distinct game that unfortunately doesn't seem to get noticed by the RPG community. Right off the bat, you'll likely notice the art style, which is made from digitized claymation models, with a nice pastel color pallet, making for a very visually pleasing adventure. Said adventure follows Wayne, a yellow dude with a moon shaped head, and a biker jacket. As Wayne, you will traverse this strange world collecting tokens, watching tvs, and overall having a good time. However, Hylics is not without its flaws either.  Firstly, the leveling mechanic. You're most likely used to killing enemies and leveling up in these kinds of games, however Hylics is different. When you kill enemies you gain meat. Meat is still essentially xp, however in order to increase your hp from it, you are required to die. It just seems odd that death is not only encouraged here, but required. On top of that, this is a very very vague game. You never get any direction, you just stumble into a place and hope you found what you need. The npcs never say anything of use, and even after killing a boss to unlock a cut scene, it only presents you with more poetic gibberish. Now for rpg \"experts\" this may not be a big issue, but even if you've played your fair share of rpgs, you will still most likely be stuck. And this games obscurity also means that the guide you'll end up needing doesn't really exist. I would give this game a 6/10.

Each party member has 10 lines of text each with no motivation for why the join the main character (Wayne) in their adventure (example: first guy joins because you found a paper cup, second one joins because you found his gloves).\n- A few characters  seem to have a history together but is never flesh out in any meaningful way. This leads to the inital intrigue generated by the trippy aestethics and the world built on it evaporating within the first half hour.\n- The combat is bare bones and is imbalanced, maybe by design. \nExample: There's a skill that allows a party member to heal itself for 30% and costs 25 magic points (each maybe starts with a flat 100), which everyone can learn. There's another skill that heals EACH member for 50% of their health and costs only 35 which EVERYONE can learn. Think about that.\n- Due to imbalanced combat, encounters become trivial to the point of irritating, again, maybe by design. I avoided a lot of fights because I had learned how to exploit the system and enemies did not scale well with my progress.\n-A majority of dialogue is randomly generated, as such I avoided interacting with most of the npcs and I made it through 95% the game through deductive reasoning.\n-The major lack of direction or guidance leads to a fustrating start.\n\nConclusion: I get the feeling this was Mason Lindroth dipping his toes into the RPG waters or maybe wanted to make an \"experience\" or perhaps a parody of the conventional rpg. What resulted was a subpar game that feels like wasted potential. \n\nHonestly I would've paid more than twice as much for just the sound track or maybe an artbook in pdf form.\n\nThe biggest thing I've taken away from this is how not to design an RPG or a game in general, so maybe the experience was worth it after all.\n\nI see people comparing this Earthbound and Lisa, but both of those had direction, and not only gave you reasons to keep playing but rewarded you for it, as a game should.

At first it's fine and the way death is handled is extremely interesting, since you can't really game over from wiping, so the next worst thing is you can fight enemies that waste your time and drag out the fights. This occurs when fighting enemies who spam blind and paralyze attacks which are unfortunately frequent. You're probably saying, \"well duh just cure the status ailments\" but the only means of combating the status effects are either: equip items to prevent the status effects or find the ONE TV in this game that gives you a spell to remove status effects. Combined with getting party members possibly late, this means you could fight battles with minimal party members and being blinded for way too long. For crying out loud there are ghost enemies that love to spam the blind move and have naturally high evasion. I almost say just flee from enemies that are this much of a hassle since winning just seems to be a way to get more health in the long run.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]\nHylics is a gem of an RPGMaker game that everyone should experience for $3.

Hylics takes all the weird surreal claymation stuff from around the 90's, and cranks the dial up while giving an above average RPG type game to play. \n\nThe game is far from perfect, movement can be clunky, it can be hard to tell which stats do which, and the randomly selected pretentious dialogue can be pretty cringey, but I don't think it's supposed to be anything but that.\n\nThe music is fairly nice, along with the mix of digitized 'actors', claymation, and drawings. They all blend very well. The gameplay is somewhat standard to an Earthbound type game, something I don't have much expertise in. I usually do not like turn based combat very much, but the animations and everything does make the combat much more pleasing to someone like me who does not enjoy turn based combat much.\n\nThe game is short, 3-4 hours to complete the 'story' for the average player, but this is acceptable considering the price and how entertaining these few hours are. Acheivements for certain in-game milestones, or at least a percentage amount to know how much you've left to find for a 100% completion would help make players want to play more than 3-4 hours.

I always had a dream about this surreal spectacle, one to subvert all the conventions of the video game medium, something truly special and different, a fucking strange game unlike any other. It wasn't until a week before this review that I saw the trailer for Hylics when I felt like the sheer bounds gaming can in fact be expanded and thoroughly toyed with to mold this weird as shit, silly, off-the-wall alien world of meaty clayflesh and some bugfuckfest galore that was just positively psyche-protruding.\n\nIn the same way the game bends gaming conventions, I'll bend the convention of a positive review and go on and rant about my disappointment for \"Hylics\" even though by all means the game is still great, really. I never really got the impression the game was promising anything more than just being a weird little fun thing, so I only have myself to blame for wanting more out of it. Holy shit did I want more, though. After watching the trailer I thought this may be \"the one\" -- the real video-game-medium subverter, the real one to make you question what a game can do, what a game can be -- a true candidate to push forward in the whole \"games as art\" debate that's still going on now. I can now safely confirm with conviction this game doesn't carry that weight, so I'll keep searching. But it's still a neat diversion.\n\nI should probably get the bad out of the way, before I do come to its positives. The most prominent disappointment to me is the game's narrative, or lack thereof. In Hylics, there's no attempt to make any kind of decent story, even a nonsensical or non-coherent one. There doesn't exist a world to get lost in, or characters to care about or be invested in. The furthest it goes in having any sort of plot (besides its ending, which I won\u2019t spoil) are the very brief sections in which you play a caped-man who sets off the game's \"acts\", though there really aren't any. In these sections, and through the rest of the game, there are strange, pseudo-poetic verses that are often spoken, and carry no meaning. It seems to be randomly-generated gibberish, and although it lends to the game's atmosphere, it doesn't serve any other purpose. It's more or less the same with the dialogue, though there's often less continuity there, because some of the humanoid characters/creatures speak that total fake-poem nonsense, and others talk completely casually and normally, like people. While amusing, it definitely takes you out of the experience, since the two extremes clash, more than anything. The main characters (especially Wayne) are themselves brilliant in their design, but are memorable only for their design alone, which is unfortunately the most shallow quality a character can have, even for a surreal game. I got the impression weaving together any sort of story in the game was one of the last priorities in creating it -- which was a painful impression for me to get, as a game like this would have benefitted so much with an inventive, creative absurdist narrative.\n\nIt sounds like I\u2019m being harsh, but it\u2019s just testament to my disappointment for the game. Wasted potential hurts, but I\u2019ve never felt it become tangibly part of the game as much as Hylics. The gameplay was so straightforward and repititive, too, that those were the only thoughts in my head as I had to tediously traverse the landscape back-and-forth RPG-style and grind through countless pointless enemies. Herein lies the other primarily problem -- the lasting factor, and how the game\u2019s effect almost immediately begins to wear off on the player. When I first began, I was floored by the atmosphere and feel of the game, just as I thought I would based off the trailer. This lasted in about the first twenty minutes in the game, and then the oddness just wore off. This surreal world was no longer weird, then -- in fact, I was shocked to find it was contrived and boring and normal. The game is much too-quick to let up on its oddity, and stops delivering almost immediately on everything but its visuals. The intrigue of the world, characters, and story all fade away when you realize there really is none. The only thing left *are* the visuals, and while they\u2019re fantastic, many times I felt like they just weren\u2019t enough to make the game compelling. I began to lose my drive to keep playing, because there was nothing driving me forward except what kind of environments I get to experience next. I wasn\u2019t even anticipating any sort of surprises at this point, because nothing strange or unexpected really happens in the game. As far as unforeseen and unusual events, it\u2019s actually extremely tame. Everything that happens is incredibly predictable from a game-perspective. \n\nTo give a particular instance, I ran into an enemy, and the screen went to black for longer than normal. I thought to myself \u201choly shit, is some weird fucking thing gonna happen now? Is it going to be a new room I accessed on random, or something?\u201d and then the battle just started, as normal, nothing else happened. \n\nThe closest the game gets to hitting on these are when control is sporadically and spontaneously taken from Wayne and given to the caped-man who sets off the game\u2019s next act. Every time this would happen, I would feel a glimmer of potential in the increasingly-mounting normality, but it never follows up on it.\n\nPretty much the sole thing I\u2019ve been praising it on so far is the visuals, and they\u2019re extraordinary. The visual style ranges from rotoscope, to claymation, to traditionally surreal digital art, and it all blends together seamlessly to make something distinctly unique to Hylics and Hylics only. You can absolutely tell the background of the game\u2019s developer, Mason Lindroth, is in art, rather than game design or storytelling. And this isn\u2019t necessarily bad, because it works. The art truly shines through, and makes the three-dollar admission price more than worth it, even if nothing else is good. That\u2019s how strong the visuals are, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s far more fanart of this game than any other form of fan media. Nobody cares enough to speculate about the world, or the characters, because that clearly wasn\u2019t the game\u2019s intention. The intention was to give off a distinct feeling in the visual style of the game, and in this sense, the game succeeds with flying colors more than any other game in recent memory. However, they lost their power on me twenty minutes in, and for that reason Hylics isn\u2019t very memorable. I distinctly remember every criticism I had about this game than I do its actual content, and I wasn\u2019t even looking for them.\n\nI kept finding disparity because the whole experience comes together ultimately with very little lasting impact. It\u2019s as if everything but the visuals were a contrived mechanism or tool that existed just because for it to be a \u201cgame\u201d, they needed to. And it\u2019s really sad to me, that a game so strange turned out to be extremely standard. The very, very worst thing a weird game can be is normal. Underneath a thinly-veiled brilliant surreal exterior, Hylics is just a really generic RPGMaker game with nothing else special to it. But it\u2019s still so fucking unassumingly odd in a sea of boring-ass video games that it still manages to pull together on its surreal and absurd visuals alone. It\u2019s sad that everything else is so terribly droll that when a game like this valiantly fails it still ends up succeeding.", "timestamp_created": 1462856165, "timestamp_updated": 1462907003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585460", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22867911": {"recommendationid": "22867911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207234148", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462731667}, "language": "english", "review": "hylics:\n\nGeriatric facelift confoundment arbitrarily denounced bycentennial surrealist corruption.

A lot of the reviews talk about that aspect and the insane, randomly generated writing, so I'll focus on how it plays. Hylics was quite a bit deeper than I expected in terms of mechanics and what it offers up.\n\nCombat at the start feels pretty meh when you're a one-man team, but even so smart use of the moves at your disposal makes combat interesting and as you start finding companions (they're all missable!) and learning more moves you get a pretty interesting combination of tactics! Battles are a rather standard affair otherwise, being turn-based. However there's no random battles, and enemies stay dead once defeated- they literally turn into a mushy pool of blood and bones on the map forever. And of course the animations of attacks are a pleasure to see and your foes have... interesting aesthetics, to say the least, so it offsets some of the monotony. At the end of each battle, you'll get Meat for the enemies you slayed.\n\nAdding onto to that, death works differently here. Instead of the usual game over, you're put into a kind of hub only accessible by death. The Meat you found can be grinded to increase your HP- since there's no leveling up, at least not visibly as far as I know- so if you've saved some up the same enemy that killed you may not be so tough next time. I ended up here a lot at the beginning. I really enjoyed this, it's very different from pretty much any other RPG Maker game.\n\nIt's also fairly non-linear. There's the main path, of course, but hidden NPCs, companions, and items encourage exploration which is fun thanks to the fact that there aren't random battles.

It's sort of a jrpg, though it flips a few classic elements of such on its head in a way that makes you play it differently than most. The combat is the pretty ordinary turn-based sort with the usual attack/guard/skill/item options, but there is no levelling up and new skills are learned by finding TVs scattered throughout the world. Death actually is the only way to get stronger, and can even be used as a teleporting method. The way the items and stats work is confusing and requires you to figure out its odd logic. I made plenty of mistakes in equipping and advancing the party, but the game's short enough that it doesn't really matter.\n\nSo, from a strictly combat perspective it's weird and confusing and fairly simple. There's a lot more to it than just combat. I wouldn't call it story-based. In fact, there isn't a story at all, just a weird, jumbled set of progression through a series of trippy, bizarre backgrounds with the nagging feeling in the back of your mind that somehow this all makes sense even when it really, really doesn't. The dialogue is all a mish-mash of vaguely philosophical-sounding gibberish that the creator admits was just him plugging things into a random word generator. It's bizarre, makes no damn sense, and yet I never found myself getting lost or unsure if I was going the right way. For having a total lack of plot coherence it makes so strangely much sense.\n\nIt's also one of the most unusual games to look at out there. The graphics are some kind of weird hybrid between claymation and retro Apple colours, and sometimes just looking at it it's hard to even tell you're playing a game. Everything is distorted, garish, and sometimes nearly blinding. This, along with a muffled, garbled sort of soundtrack and sound effects, makes everything just a little off, a little confusing. The whole journey is a hell of a trip, but it enraptured and pulled me to the end even though I didn't know why I was doing the things I did. Just to see what weird thing happened next was reason enough to see it though to the end. \n\nIt won't be for everyone, but if you like old-school rpgs with a twist (see also: Undertale, Lisa, etc), then you could spend your three bucks a lot worse.

[b][i]Hylics[/i][/b] is one of the most greatest JRPG influenced games ever created. A masterpiece that will be talked about for generations to come[/h1]\n\nRarely and every couple of years, in the indie gaming scene tends to appears a new creator whose name is destined to be inmortal and referenced in future articles for decades to come. A creator that based in the originality and unbelievable degree of talent showed in his first major commercial attempt, will be cited by future designers, writers and artists as a major influence.\n\nSo, you can salute to Mason Lindroth. An be prepared to see his name and the name of [i]Hylics[/i] in hundred of articles. In all-time best videogames lists. In conferences talking about experimental narrative but also in those talking about animation and how to break established conceptions in the artistic design field. But most importantly, cited as an essential recommendation and life changer experience by your most beloved friends. Because Mason Lindroth is now in this list of the chosen ones, close to the names of Edmund McMillen, Jonathan Blow, David Kanaga, Davey Wreden or Rami Ismail.\n\nMason Lindroth defines himself as an animator that uses videogames as an artistic tool for creation, rather than as a videogame designer. His art style is a lysergic amalgam between the drawing pencil artwork seen in Bill Plympton\u2019s most wilderness animation films and an experimental approach to the claymation technique, using a lot of bizarre materials in the sculpture of its elements. His work truly shines with originality, and seeing figures that seems hand drawn by pencil and that are animated through stop motion causes an impact similar to the first time that you could see [i]The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker[/i] in movement.\n\nBut the best part is his almost obsessive degree of perfectionism, with dozens of billions of subtle and almost imperceptible details. The game doesn\u2019t repeat a single asset in any of its maps. You learn magic skills watching television, and every single skill has its own television\u2019s marquee design. Every attack has a distinctive animation, doing psychic movements with the hands. Every single monster is also animated in the main map screen. Every scenario has lots of interactive elements that can be deformed, altered, all of them with its own unique animation. If you open a treasure chest, then you have an animation of the chest being opened. If you crush a garbage can, you can see the deformation created in the metal. You haven\u2019t seen before a JRPG with 16 bits aesthetics and this unattainable level of detail. Because the JRPG genre tends to use a lot of times the imagination as a substitute to time-consuming graphic assets. But in [i]Hylics[/i], all the elements are shown in a material and tangible way. Every item that can be used to debuff stats in the combat, has his own graphic asset and animation in screen. If you win a combat, the enemy doesn\u2019t disappear in the main map, you can see how disintegrates, and then his corpse. EVERY single combat has a DIFFERENT screen background!\n\nBut [i]Hylics[/i] IS MUCH MORE than its artistic design or its captivating world with an original and distinctive lore. The TRUE ACHIEVEMENT of [i]Hylics[/i] comes in its narrative. With a radical approach taken in its writing, influenced by beat generation writers as Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac or by the most experimental works of Bob Dylan in his [i]Tarantula[/i] creative period.\n\nThe 90% of the writing in [i]Hylics[/i] comes in the form of procedurally generated, highly fragmented verses extracted from cryptic and almost impossible poems. Including a lot of subversive messages and distant voices, resonating in a dystopian and incredible oppressive world. This element of narrative creates in the player a constant sense of paranoia, similar to watching Alejandro Jodorowsky\u2019s cult classic film [i]The Holy Mountain[/i]. [i]Hylics[/i] even surpass the grade of perverseness and quirky nature found in [i]Lisa[/i]. And this joyful sense of bizarreness is approached in even more complex and subtle ways, using abstract poetry and a dylanesque speech about human alienation.\n\nAnd even in its general game design, [i]Hylycs[/i] shines. With exigent combats that requieres a lot of thinking. Brilliantly designed puzzles. LOTS of secrets. An innovative experience system that requires that you die to improve the character in a limbo parallel reality. Even its soundtrack is MEMORABLE, with a lot of psychedelic rock disturbing compositions, that helps to create some short of state of trance in the player. While he deliberately lost his sanity in one of the most fascinating parallel universes created for a videogame.\n\n[i]Hylics[/i] is a rare example of piece of art in which every single element is sublime and a leap forward. And it puts the name of Mason Lindroth written with golden letters in the history of the interactive medium.\n\n\n[i]( The writer of this review is not an English native. So you should expect occasional grammar errors. I apologize in advance. )[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1444338949, "timestamp_updated": 1445588091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 122, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767364", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18385951": {"recommendationid": "18385951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021454390", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444557101}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not fond of JRPG's, but this is an exception.

I'll be honest with you: I have no idea what's even going on with this game. It's incredibly weird and fantastical -- and that's probably why I love it so much. This game features amazing art made with clay and rendered in Photoshop for the grainy pixelized look. The battles are done in a typical RPG format with trippy battle animations. There's a lot of procedural text generation in this game, making the dialogue extremely fun to read.\n\nEverything about this game is an experience. Guitars scratch and croon in the background as you explore its strange world. Backgrounds sway gently and can make you nauseous. Exploration is peaceful, but it also makes you feel slightly uncomfortable as things get even weirder. In 5 minutes of the game, I'm reading poetic talk that doesn't make any sense, learning battle techniques by watching television, and making sandcastles on the beach in the afterlife. [i] It's a really strange game[/i].\n\nI honestly don't think I can recommend this game to just anyone. It's one of those art projects that's probably going to polarize a lot of its audience, especially on Steam. However, for $3, it's a great grab for anybody looking for something odd and different. It's pretty short, it should last you no more than a couple of hours. In this game, what you get out of it is what you put into it. I play it to relax, explore, and laugh. I hope you can embrace its strangeness and just chill to its dank tunes.\n\n[b]TL; DR:[/b] For fans of [i]Yume Nikki[/i], [i]Beeswing[/i], [i]LISA[/i], [i]EarthBound[/i], and [i]Undertale[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1443814363, "timestamp_updated": 1443858026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18295129": {"recommendationid": "18295129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021267944", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443810291}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Hylics Uses the Absurd to Explore New and Interesting Mechanics [/h1]\n\n[i]If you're worried about the short playtime, I put a couple hours into this game when it first released on Itch.io.  I bought it again here since I kind of love it.[/i]\n\n[h1] Just Go With It [/h1]\n\nThis game goes out of its way to be strange.  Every aspect from the possibly questionably claymation art,the noise rock soundtrack,  the nonsensical item descriptions, the randomly generated dialogue for non-important NPCs, and the 90s pop art attitude exude a casual absurdism.  Eventually, a new logic emerges that, while non-sensical, stays consistent and lets you get lost in a world completely unlike reality.  Don't worry just go with it.  Throwing the flesh of your fallen foes into a meatgrinder at the entrance of Death gives you more Meat Points?  Just go with it.  Frozen burritos are powerful projectile weapons while warm ones are healing items?  Don't worry about it.  Eat up.  A random NPC in the Mortal City raises insects?  Not a problem.  Kinda gross though.\n\n[h1] Mechanics to Match the Meat [/h1]\n\nIf all Hylics had to offer was the weird, then the game would be hard to recommend.  But Hylics uses its absurdism as an escape from convention, allowing it to explore simple but interesting new ways to tweak the traditional JRPG formula.  There's no leveling to speak of.  Instead, you have to explore the world and find new equipment and abilities to grow stronger.  Remember that part above about depositing meat into a grinder to gain more Meat Points?  Meat Points are health.  This means if you've defeated any enemies before dying, your max HP can be be upgraded upon death.  In that same area you go after a death, a counter lets you into a room to get a new ability after 3 deaths.  Items can be bought from vendors, but like the cold burritos that can be turned into healing items by warming them up in the microwave, items don't give straight statistical boosts.  Similar to Atlas games, status effects actually debilitate your character, so a technically better item might be less useful than something that stops a certain effect.  \n\nThese moves to make death interesting, growth non-linear, and exploration central to progression make Hylics a fantastic cheap and short game that will burn through an afternoon and leave you satisfied and mildly confused.\n\n[b] TL;DR:  Hylics is weird, smart, pushes JRPGs in new directions, and costs less than a coke and candy bar.

The story was confusing if there was one, and i didnt quite know what my goal was.\n\nbut in some way the game makes this work.\n\neven though i had no clue WHAT i was doing, the game always presented itself well as to WHERE i was going. though open, the game directs you so you know what your partial goal is at any given time. If you dont know what to do, exploring will almost always reward you with a way to go.\n\n-The health and mana system, being Flesh and Will and how they are upgraded, are both very unique and well executed\n\n-the humor is surreal, so if you like that sort of thing youre going to dig it\n\n-the game looks terrible in its own way to the point that it looks incredible\n\n-the combat itself is very tight and the special skills feel great to use\n\nonly downside is one time i did get very lost and had to google what to do next, but as far as weird surreal rpg's go this is pretty standard. The game felt like it curved well in difficulty, but was fairly easy to get through for the most part if you buy the right items. \n\nIf you like strange RPG's like Off, Lisa, and Space Funeral.

The main core of Hylics is an old school JRPG, with turn combats, a world map full of secrets and vehicles to explore it. But Hylics is also an experimental, bizarre and unique game.\n\nAlmost every object can be examined: not always will give an item, but for sure will be an interesting animation. Trees of different shapes will shrink, trash bins will smash, baths will fall throwing strange masses, sand can be used to build castles, and everything with gorgeous clay animations.\n\nThe magic system also spreads innovation. The characters will learn new abilities interacting with televisions hidden around the world. For example the main attack will hurt the enemy just snapping the fingers, while using the dynamite will cause an atomic blast.\n\nEverything is a new discovery and a surprise in the surreal and whimsical world of Hylics.\n\nFull review: https://surrealandcreepy.wordpress.com/2018/02/02/hylics-a-surreal-painting-in-claymation/", "timestamp_created": 1517606830, "timestamp_updated": 1517606830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39743782": {"recommendationid": "39743782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175239129", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518849799}, "language": "english", "review": "Strangest game ever.

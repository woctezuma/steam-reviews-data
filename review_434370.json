ONCE. \n\nMy first playthrough was incredible. I can't remember the last time I played through a game with a narrative that interesting. Every word and sentence had me getting closer to my screen. I couldn't get enough and it seemed that every chapter was better than the last. I love how the story affected the game in such a way. I couldn't get to my second run through to change my decision fast enough. LOVED THIS GAME. So before I go any further I'll say one thing. For the price, it's definitely worth it.\n\n!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!\n\nUnfortunately it was my second playthrough that I noticed one very disappointing fact. Your decision don't decide anything. I made one massive decision right off that back. When deciding whether or not to follow the ringing, I decided on this playthrough to not follow it. But it didn't matter. I ended falling through a hole in the ground and getting stuck in the tunnel anyway. \n\nThis kept happening, making decisions and not getting any different outcome from it. In fact, this system is so broken, that dialogue lines where nonsensical. After not having shot my weapon ONCE, I was somehow running low on ammo. After NOT speaking to Barksdale once, he still made a comment on 'How I had spoke to him'. \n\nThe way I see it, there is essentially one ending. 2 endings that are somewhat different but with no real difference and 2 other endings that have such a minor difference from the first ending, that it might as well have not been included.\n\nAs much as I love this game, it's cheaply done and is just giving the illusion of multiple endings.", "timestamp_created": 1513224121, "timestamp_updated": 1513224121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38244816": {"recommendationid": "38244816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424022814", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507183672}, "language": "english", "review": "7/10\nThis is a great game to play if you have time to just sit down and play for a few hours non stop.

As he moves though an underground bunker whose entrance is exposed when Roger wakes up, he begins to realize that the incident was not just a simple vehicle accident, but something far more supernatural, and horrifying, then he could've ever imagined.\n\nThe core gameplay of Buried is simple- text is read to you on your screen describing the story, and when you come to a fork in the road, you're givien two choices on what to say or do. Unlike Telltale games, these choices are not timed, allowing you to think each decision through. Unfortunaltly, very little of the choices in Buried really affect the plot long-term. Most of them are just simple dialogue options that only show how your Roger views the current situation. There were some choices that had potential to really affect characters, but they don't have any emotional effect on said characters for more than 30 seconds. You tell a character his best friend died, he takes in the news, mopes for a few seconds, and by the time the scene's over, both characters have forgotten about it and never bring it up again. The first 4 episodes really only have 1 or 2 major decisions throughout their 30-40 minute runtimes. It isn't until the final episode that the game really steps up and gives you some really big and impactful choices that really affect the plot.\n\nStorywise, Buried tells a pretty intresting story. The game does take the cliche \"government experiment gone horribly wrong\"path for its main plot, but it explores a different side of this plot that isn't commonly seen. Instead of focusing on stopping the thing that went horribly wrong, this is a story about witnesses to the event, and about them trying to comprehend what in the hell just happened, and trying to hold on to any hope of survival, no matter what form. As Roger and the few survivors he finds make their way through the bunker, there was this big sense of unpredictability and unknown threat as you slowly begin to see what horrific things the creatures can do, and when you do reach the encounters with the creatures, they're so unpredictable that every encounter feels different, and it's really engaging to see Roger and crew desperately try to both comprehend these things, and fight them off at the same time. The encounters with the creatures are truly the highlight of each episode. Bromoco Games also nails the pacing of this series, smoothly weaving between character moments, plot revalations, and action sequences, all adding up to a well-paced adventure. And by the time you get to the final episode, well, let's just say the supernatural parts of the game completely take over, leading to some of the best moments in the game. While the soundtrack and visual pictures in the background aren't anything special, they're a good fit for the environments described, and really do add to the overall experience\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nPros:\n-Powerful, character focused story\n-Soundtrack and visuals fit the mood nicely\n-Action-packed final episode\n-Great pacing throughout all five episodes\n-Unpredictability of the creatures make the encounters with them truly memorable\n\nCons:\n-Not many game changing choices\n-Painfully short runtime\n-Occasionally nonsensical character behavior\n-Little variety in endings leads to little to no replay value\n\nDespite a shortage of impactful decisions, short runtime, and almost no replay value, Buried's powerful story and unpredictability, especially in its final episode, makes it really worth looking past it's issues.\n\nScore: 7.5", "timestamp_created": 1504991534, "timestamp_updated": 1504991534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34426406": {"recommendationid": "34426406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398701557", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503445523}, "language": "german", "review": "Tolle Geschichte.\nDie zwei Stunden Gameplay waren sehr interessant und faszinierend.

The story reads from the perspective of a timber logger who has come to after an unexplained accident, then attempts to discover what happened and subsequently get to safety.

The story has a strong supernatural element to it which allowed for an anything-could-happen feeling that kept it from being too predicatable, and it features realistic dialogue/action choices as well (hence the 'interactive' title.) I played without sound, so I can't comment on the quality of that.\n\nThe pros: The well-written narrative and story arc kept me interested to the end, plus the text appears at a quicker speed than in many novel-type games which appeals to me as a fast reader. The background images are nothing special, but perfectly adequate, and always fit the current situation. The price is fair for the quality of the experience and the playtime.\n\nThe cons: While the game does feature ending variants dependant on your choices, they aren't different enough in my opinion to offer replay value. Because of how much I enjoyed the story, I would've liked to have needed more than two hours to complete, and while it all falls together well, I did wish there was more.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the game to those who already enjoy an interactive visual novel experience, and to others who appreciate an intriguing supernatural tale.

When I got into the \"game\" I realized it was literally a book. So instead of judging a book by its cover, I began reading. The story became very interesting and I wanted to read more. The concept of the reader and the characters having vague clues on what is going on, just aroused my curiosity. After Chapter 1 I was so enthralled in the story and I couldn't stop reading. The story may only be 5 Chapters long and have a very weird ending, however, it's just incredible! I'm not saying the ending was terrible, the ending was actually quite of a cliffhanger but left on a good note and I genuinely liked it. It opened up the possibility that top secret agencies are actually researching these kinds of things and makes me wonder.

Well, that and some of the morally ambiguous choices you're given have an obvious answer. Yeah, it may be wrong to kill this guy, and it may give away your location, but he's betrayed you twice already and will likely do it again if given the chance. Besides, if you don't, the bad guys will.  It's hard to imagine that scenario working out too many different ways. \nAnyway, what do I mean the story was written too well? I mean, for as concise as it is, it makes the other possibilities pretty easy to predict. Sometimes your character outright says exactly what will happen in both situations. \n\"But what about going back to explore for more info on the world?\" you ask. Well, I have one thing to say to you: Go play Half-Life 1. Or don't, since it's a totally different kind of game even if the stories are basically identical.

It's [i]not[/i] a CYOA, as the plot doesn't appear to truly diverge except at the very end; it's just aesthetic choices which are quickly railroaded back onto the same author-set track.  That's okay, though it harshly limits replayability.  With this in mind, if Markiplier brought you here, [b]stop watching his playthrough until you've finished the game yourself.[/b]\n\nThe speed of the text and button reveals feel appropriate to the atmosphere, but it's painfully slow when you're just trying to power through a replay.  Although mashing the space key can speed this up a bit, I think this game would benefit from a variable speed/instant reveal option.\n\nAn appropriate atmospheric soundtrack is a pivotal 'make or break' point in multimedia literature, and Buried makes it.  The Wasteland/Fallout feel of it fits well.  Markiplier claims at a few points in his playthrough that the 'calm' soundtrack doesn't fit the immediate events.  I disagree; this is a text story, and jumping to frenetic music would be distracting and would stand out like a sore thumb.  This soundtrack doesn't stand out \u2013 it looms in the background.\n\nThe writing is respectable.  I would caution author Barry Napier to \"kill his darlings,\" however; \"haul ass\" is a phrase which should never be used more than once in a work, and then only to demonstrate what sort of person a character is.  Beyond that, there's some over-reliance on horror/action tropes, occasionally to a degree which borders on breaking suspension of disbelief (ie: Overdrawn at the Blood Bank, Ax-Crazy, Aliens are Bastards, Science Is Bad).  Mostly, though, the writing is convincing and interesting.  I hope to see more interactive fiction like this from Mr. Napier and Bromoco Games.\n\nAnd then, there's the value.  That's not exactly a Triple-A price tag.  Overall I wouldn't call this a masterpiece, but it's well-made entertainment for substantially cheaper than watching whatever trash reboot Hollywood has most recently vomited at the cinema.

Even if you give the gun to the person that fires off a shot, the gun still only has one bullet left if you choose to spare another character) there seemed to be a disconnect with the science the game is based on. \n\nOne of the characters references the idea that there's 10 dimensions, all well and good. Backed up by current theories in physics and quantum physics. \n\nHOWEVER. Throughout the entire game there's a severe break in the basis in real-life understanding of logic. For one, we who live in a 3D space can see things on a 2D space, but those in a 2D space (in a theoretical house drawing on a sheet of paper) cannot even comprehend us. We in the 3D cannot enter a 2D space without crushing our bodies and just dying from the compression. Basically, the laws of nature of whatever dimention you're in are the laws you're subjected to, biology be damned.\n\nWhile the idea of interdimentional Lovecraftian horrors sounds like a great premise, there was a lost opportunity for character motivation by ignoring that core theory of how the different dimentions work. \n\nThey shouldn't be able to operate on their own laws from their dimention, they should be severely limited and in INCREDIBLE pain after falling into our world. If they INTENTIONALLY invaded and were stated to do so, I might buy that they had some sort of tech to help them stabalize, but the game lore admits that they AREN'T stable and glitch in and out of existence. \n\nI'd buy that they were acting like wounded, cornered animals, especially if it were established that 3D humans fired first and didn't bother to try to make contact or misunderstood that they were in pain. Instead, the lore makes them out to be entities of pure sadistic evil. While I could maybe buy that they don't think much of 3D entities just like we wouldn't think twice about burning a stick figure drawing, that attitude drastically changes when your body has to adjust to a plane where you can no longer move in a set of directions you had before.\n\nHad a lot of promise, but more research would have made it a better horror experience. Endings could have used more elaboration, maybe an epilogue or something for the \"good\" endings. Which, I'll admit the choices only affecting character relations I'm on the fence about supporting. \n\nOn one hand, it feels unsatisfying, on the other hand however it fits into the Lovecraftian theme when dealing with entities far beyond our comprehension where at best you die quickly and at worst you go insane the more you learn until you finally kill yourself upon realizing that you cannot change anything or save anyone. \n\nI'm still recommending the game, it was a fun experience.

Why? Because I could play it and someone could play it and they could be like, OMG DUDE DID YOU SEE THIS? And I'm like NO DUDE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED! I do love the fact that at the end of each chapter it tells you how others reacted to the major decisions that you make in the story. It'll say you and 36% of players chose this.\n\nSee my point? I won't spoil anything at all about this you'll have to pay the money for the game.\n\n---Music/Artwork---\n\nThe music is a ten out of ten, sure it's very basic but the subtle of the music adds to the climate of the still shot art. The art that is in the background is fantastic.  Though I think they could have added more to the music at the starting of the chapter 1/2ish by acting a slight hum, ya know the hum of florscent(sp?) lights but it's not a deal breaker.\n\n---Price---\n\nFor 2.99 this game is quite worth it so far, I hope to play it more after I beat it to see if there are any other endings/branching paths etc etc. I really hope the makers will make more of these. Perhaps expand the genre, expand on their game and make even more, bigger, more decisions/endings, etc etc.\n\n---\n\nIf you wish to see what the game is about, here is a spoiler alert and a link to the playlist of what I am making for a Let's Play. I hope this convinces more people to play this game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrS81Xfbl5mtRJ5y9IJyw4onO94b-ZDF6\n\nHave a good night.", "timestamp_created": 1484989851, "timestamp_updated": 1484989851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564894", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29389739": {"recommendationid": "29389739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040757926", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484972990}, "language": "english", "review": "What an incredible story!

You try to find out what has happened and are gradually drawn into lethal mystery. All the elements are top-notch. Great characters. Creepy environments. Discoveries that are both baffling and horrific. And threats that are chilling and relentless.\n\nDuring the story, you regularly make decisons that will affect the narrative. You may find yourself crushed by a choice which leads to an awful death. I found there were sufficent decisions to be made to keep you deeply involved without detracting from the game's biggest strength, which is the storytelling.\n\nThe writing is gripping from start to end. For me, it felt like being trapped in a truly sinister Stephen King story - it was that good.\n\nNegatives?

It won't be an earth-shattering experience for anyone who's read the odd horror/sci-fi short story - or played a certain famous video game franchise, which I won't mention the name of for spoiler reasons! - but it's an entertaining enough diversion for those of us with an unquenchable taste for the eerie and enigmatic. \n\n   Oh, and for those greatly concerned with such things: it would also appear to have some small degree of replayability due to the variety of choices on offer, even if one suspects that most if not all of the story's main mysteries are revealed in a single playthrough.

But as a story it still has a way to go, and some of the issues are so integral as to likely prohibit repair. Still, for the most part not a bad way to spend three hours. (Due to offline play, I can only estimate game time at over three hours. There is a LOT of text. I found this to be both a plus and a minus, as you will see.)\n\nThe premise of \u201cBuried: An Interactive Story\u201d (BAIS) is that you are the boss of a logging crew who very suddenly finds that he and his crew are the victims of a mysterious and unknown disaster deep in the forest. You find your way into an underground government facility, where things really start to go bad. The story/game is broken into 5 chapters, each chapter is further broken into small segments, allowing for pauses.\n\nThe story of BAIS is pretty basic Lovecraft-like, and not particularly original. Saying that, I would also say that the mood generated is adequately creepy, with a story that feels both complete and real, in the context of this type of game. If the idea was simply to create a great story, this would fail. But since the point is to create an interactive story, it succeeds quite well, with the storyline leading not to more story so much as more decisions. The purpose is simply to drive the player to the next choice, and the choices really stand out (at least for the first three chapters.) The choices really are often quite difficult to make, as they almost always involve other characters for which you feel a genuine sense of responsibility. Some choices are simply to move the story along, and give the feeling that the response would have varied little based on the decision made, if at all. Some choices are significant, as you are notified once your choice is final. At the close of each chapter the player is notified of the statistics involving each significant choice among existing players. \n\nUNFORTUNATELY, once the fourth of five chapters of BAIS is reached, the choices do next to nothing for the story and are rarely significant. In virtually every case it\u2019s a simple choice of \u201cnoble choice\u201d versus \u201cselfish choice\u201d, and shallow beyond belief considering the depth of many choices offered in the first three chapters. I chose \u201cnoble\u201d (this IS fiction), so I have no knowledge of how other choices would have played out. About his point, the complexity of the game that was such a strong feature to begin\u2026..comes crashing down. In numerous cases the story feels unconnected, and one death as related in the story was absolutely NOT the death that had occurred in \u201cmy\u201d story. While there were many pluses to the first half of the story, I was quite happy when it finally came to a grinding halt.\n\nGreat attention was paid to the grammar in BAIS, which was much appreciated. I only found one case of a typo, one of a sentence that made little sense linguistically, and one case of \u201cI\u201d instead of \u201cme\u201d. While there were numerous cases of commas improperly used (or absent), they were by no means dealbreakers. The minor background sounds added much, as did the background stills and the choice of typeface. The feature of leaving the game with a simple ESC, then returning regardless of the position within a chapter segment was very welcome.\n\nWhile I wish BAIS had either been shorter and cheaper, or long with more attention paid, it was still acceptable. Still, I would recommend waiting for a sale price of no more than $1.50 US.\n\nBUY ON SALE ONLY.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1455316852, "timestamp_updated": 1455432118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697317", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21078806": {"recommendationid": "21078806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139094674", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507499804}, "language": "english", "review": "Good stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1455033430, "timestamp_updated": 1455033430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499782", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20926276": {"recommendationid": "20926276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075895667", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454479610}, "language": "english", "review": "Wasnt sure what to expect but totally worth it.

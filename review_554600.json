I enjoyed the music and artwork for a $7 title.  I'm mixed about the voice acting; the competence of each actor varied quite a bit, and Satomi's was the only one who stood out to me, albeit in a positive way. Understandably, all of the characters have an American accent despite their backstory.  I don't have much to say about the story and whatever else I don't mention.\n\nAs for the negative:\n\u2013 No real-time challenges. Whenever you read, speed is important, and this game offers no benefit for speed. Even just having a FF7/8-esque ATB system would be a huge improvement.\n\u2013 Difficulty is extremely low. I just rushed through the story and absolutely destroyed everything, including the final boss.\n\u2013 The organized Answer menu makes it way too easy to deduce the correct answer for romaji enemies without learning the katakana well.  You can ace all the answers by memorizing slightly over 20% of all the katakana.  OCR could be used instead.\n\u2013 The vast majority of the enemies have attributes that scale with how recently you received their associated lesson, making it even easier to deduce the correct answer without learning katakana.\n\u2013 Too often, the same enemies will appear in exactly the same positions. Compounded by a menu that remembers your previous commands, this makes it even easier for players to succeed without learning much katakana.\n\u2013 Poor balancing between the number of katakana enemies and number of romaji enemies.\n\u2013 The challenge castle is pointless. The NPC who takes you there makes it sound like a big deal, but it looks like unfinished content.\n\u2013 Katakana [i]words[/i] are shown literally once ever in battle.  In my experience, I've only really encountered individual katakana characters in manga, and they aren't very important.\n\u2013 Some of the sidequests require you to purchase a specific item so that you can receive the lesson that helps you identify that item. This is backwards and I don't understand the logic.\n\u2013 Barely any \"RP\" in what's sold as an \"RPG\".  Your choices are basically inconsequential, and only have a minor impact during the character affection sequences.\n\u2013 The gameplay and design have nothing interesting at all.\n\nThere are way better budget RPGs out there, and if you just want to learn katakana, there are plenty of free katakana flash games out there that would help you learn much faster.  Personally I think playing with a katakana Anki deck is one of the fastest ways to drill individual characters into your head, and if you can't even handle that, then good luck making any meaningful progress towards learning Japanese, one of the hardest languages for people who don't natively speak an East Asian language.", "timestamp_created": 1516282311, "timestamp_updated": 1516338965, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39145929": {"recommendationid": "39145929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285605207", "num_games_owned": 1224, "num_reviews": 247, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515317137}, "language": "schinese", "review": "2D\u7684RPG\u65e0\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u6389\u5361\uff0c\u5220\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n[spoiler]\u4e60\u60ef\u6027\u62c7\u6307\u5411\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0d\u5177\u53c2\u8003\u6027[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1515317258, "timestamp_updated": 1515317258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39092687": {"recommendationid": "39092687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337214950", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 570, "last_played": 1515742902}, "language": "russian", "review": "****\n\u0420\u0423\u0421\n****\n\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435. \u0413\u0435\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0430, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0442\u044b \u0441\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0448\u044c 5 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044b, \u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0443 \u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043b\u044f\u044f \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b. \u041a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c \u044f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043c, \u0438\u0437 \u0447\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u0445\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438. \u0422\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439. \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0435, \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441 \u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438.\n\n*****\nENG\n*****\nGood presentation of material in the game form. The gameplay is made in the form of a plot where you first learn 5 syllables of katakana, and then you walk around the world and fight monsters, thereby fixing the material studied earlier. In addition, there are side heroes in the world who will teach basic Japanese words, from reading on hiragana and romaji. There is also a certain system of pumping characters. I recommend buying a game at a discount, then there is a chance to pay off with collectible cards.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1515177739, "timestamp_updated": 1515177739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38533180": {"recommendationid": "38533180", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984752312", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513947775}, "language": "english", "review": "The game itself is pretty easy, but it's great as learning tool.", "timestamp_created": 1513950461, "timestamp_updated": 1513950461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38034303": {"recommendationid": "38034303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120553714", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511724315}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a perfect game neighter as an rpg or a tool for learning japanese, but still entertaining and manages to awaken my hunger for both playing rpgs and learning japanese. Also makes me wish I had the knowlegde and lets face it WILL to make my own game. In short this game is a diamon in the rough. \n\nBad stuff:\n\nA1. Dialog in english.\nA2. Missed opportunity at writting actual word in battles.\nA3. Enemies are quiet alike..\nA4. Repeative missions\nA5. Forced lessons to proceed\n\nGood stuff\n\nB1. affection meter\nB2. character seperat story\nB3. side quests\nB4. crystal store\nB5. short game\nB6. achievements\n\nThe bad in more depth:\n\n\nA1. Dialog in english.\nIt's a issue I have with most language tools. Too much english. A option for having the dialog read in japanese would help me learn even more. Listening to english kinda feels like a waste of time when I trying to learn japanese and since there are subtitles why not? I could listen to the japanese and read the english. Of course I do understand that newcomers might find listening to japanese overwhelming and finding and recording dialog in 2 languages (and translating the dialog) cost more money. Yet it would have been a nice option.\n\nA2. Missed opportunity at writting actual word in battles.\nThe monsters or Obake you fight appear in shape of japanese letters. In most battles there are multiple letters on screen. Yet they don't say anything. This feels like a perfect opertunity to teach some more japanese words or remind us of words we've seen earlier in the game. All that would be needed is just to arrage what letters pop up at a specific battle and maybe the translation of the word writen at the top of the screen. A missed opportunity.\n\nA3. Enemies are quiet alike\nNot much difference between one battle and the other. Only difference was the bosses which change from one letter to another once the last one had been defeated until the final form. In my oppion this should have been the model for the normal enemies. Once I attacked \u30a2 with A there is no educational value in me attacking it with A again with a different member of my group. However if it after the first attack switched appearence to a different katakana which I would have to identify then we would learn more wouldn't we? Maybe some of the enimies could have cofused a party member. Maybe the others could have cured this by spelling out his or her name! There were of course some battles that toke place in another dimention where the monsters appeared as latin letters and one had to defeat them by attacking with right katakana. A good idea, but it wasn't used enough. Also a sweet idea that just poped. If one could attack Obake from both dimetions at the same battle. Maybe once party memebers could switch between the option of katakana or latin. Might take a move to do. Hmm...\nAnd maybe throw in some really hard enemies once in a while... wait the game did this, but there weren't just hard enough. There's a escape button that I rarely use. \n\nA4. Repeative missions\nThis wasn't a issue at the start of the game while one was limited to the first town. But the later part when one has to travel to another part on the map to fight some small Obake before a bossbattle only to end up back in town 1 to repeat the process in the next part of the game. No sleep overs, No traveling without a party member or wich a curse one has yet to learn how to remove. Now the game is not the only rpg with this problem. And as I said before this isn't a problem in the begining of the game. Maybe because you can kinda see what difference you've made.. or because the walk to the action was shorter.\n\nA5. Forced lessons to proceed\nKinda a part of the last complaint, but it comes from a different place. I've tried to learn japanese on and of for some years. So I kinda don't need these lessons, but to progress in the story and to get access to other \"tools\"(in lack of a better word) in the game to teach me some japanese I don't know I have to sit thorugh them. Kinda wish this would have been optional.\n\nGood stuff more in depth\n\nB1. affection meter\nDone a lot of ginding in other games to empower my partymembers. Rarly grinded to improve affection. Still grinding, but now it had more of a pay off. A simple short little cut cusceen. Well done! Grinding now has more of a purpose.\n\nB2. character seperat story\nThe charaters in the story are kinda simple minded, but still kinda entertaining. Or maybe it just me. Yet The final cutsceens (especially Owens) gave me such hunger to learn more. Well written.\n\nB3. side quests\nThe side quest were enjoyable and the reward was a to learn more japanese words and sometimes there was a quiz at the end. Those quizes were fun... maybe because they were so easy that I acced everyone except the ones that I kinda messed up on...\nAlso The simple bubble with the text \"rock on super star\" that appeared everytime you finnished a quest. Really got me hyped for some reason.\n\nB4. crystal store\nIn some battles you receive crystals which you can exchange for items that permanatly boost your characters stats. Love having this opion. So now I can make my weakest character the strongest or the slowest the fastest or... I could just speed up my mages for the best results in future battles... Yet the option to modify like this gives freedom to do it all. Turn a warrior to a mage or a mage into a battle mage. Freedom like this is oe of the best features in gameplay probably only riveled by joy of double jump.\n\nB5. short game\nI'm old. I have a job and lots of other things I want to do. So Good things come in small packages and don't take up to much of my time. I rather play a short game than a long one that looses it's charm because of the time it steals from other activities or because fun of the game stoped being fun after 50 hours and you still have 100 left,,,\nI know there are young people out there that want a game to last forever,,, but you will learn.\nStill a ultimate boss to fight after would have been nice...\n\nB6. achievements\nNever thought that this would ever become important to me, but it did... and that is why I haven't fibbished Hiragana wars... Yet I found myself playing though this game in less than a week. Nice upgrade... Now please path the first game so with achievements as well... please..\n\nSpecial thanks!\n\nTo Sleepy duck! I might have called your game a diamond in the rough, but that's still a diamond. Please continue your work. I want more fun japanese education and you seem to pretty good with motivation as well. Keep making more! Looking foward to playing kanji wars. puzzled by how it will work with the battle mechanics. Guessing you are not going to inclued all what 4000 kanji...

Isso faz com que o jogo, em primeira instancia, pare\u00e7a mais din\u00e2mico que o anterior, mas existem problemas aqui que ser\u00e3o falados mais pra frente.\n\n2. Outro ponto positivo \u00e9 o menu de letras estarem infinitamente mais organizado. CUIDADO! N\u00e3o decore o simbolo pela linha que ele se encontra. Entenda que, esse \u00e9 um jogo educacional, ent\u00e3o duele com todos os monstros se poss\u00edvel e decore de forma com que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o esque\u00e7a.\n\n3. Nesse game temos dublagem. Ela \u00e9 uma merda, mas auxilia na hora do combate. \nQuando voc\u00ea vai lutar contra um simbolo e a\u00ed seleciona uma tradu\u00e7\u00e3o, o personagem fala em voz alta o que foi selecionado e escreve na tela. Isso \u00e9 bom por termos tanto apoio visual quanto auditivo e facilita na hora do aprendizado. \n\n4. O uso das magias, pelo menos pra mim, foi superior tambem. No jogo passado era s\u00f3 pegar o personagem, socar level e itens que d\u00e3o for\u00e7a pra dar hit kill mas nesse aqui, os personagens s\u00e3o mais fracos e as magias auxiliam. (Charllote \u00e9 healer e roubada, use-a)\n\n5. O jogo tamb\u00e9m tem n\u00edvel de intera\u00e7\u00e3o. Tu consegue fazer amizade e super amizade com a sua party e eles ganham buffs adicionais.\n\nAgora vem os defeitos:\n\n1. Me incomoda o tanto de di\u00e1logo entre personagens. Eu particularmente n\u00e3o dei a m\u00ednima pra intera\u00e7\u00e3o dos personagens e nem pela hist\u00f3ria, que \u00e9 completamente enfadonha. O jogo \u00e9 educacional e deveria se comportar como tal. Isso faz voc\u00ea perder algum tempo s\u00f3 tendo que dar skip.\n\n2. Tem um bug chato que faz o fps do game cair pra 1 quando seu personagem vai upar de classe. Isso faz voc\u00ea perder tempo tamb\u00e9m.\n\n3. Achei os mapas bem pequenos, ent\u00e3o se voc\u00ea for apressado, tu pode sair rushando o jogo e n\u00e3o aprender muito, o que no jogo passado, era imposs\u00edvel.\n\n4. Dublagem. \u00c9 ruim gente, desculpa.\n\n5. Acho errado num jogo que era pra focar apenas nos simbolos querer me ensinar palavras. A melhor forma de aprender palavras \u00e9 em textos, n\u00e3o no avulso.

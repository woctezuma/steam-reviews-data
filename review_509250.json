It's the first game I've played that has really brought out the visceral gut reactions to movement for me in VR - before playing this game, I'd thought I was immune to it. Let me tell you: I was wrong.\n\nThe flip side of that? This is also by far the most terrifying game I've played. Even though I can feel that I'm standing on solid ground, watching myself jumping across huge drops and knowing that if my aim is off or I miss the grab, I will fall... it's legitimately scary.

Keine Angst, auch f\u00fcr dieses Spiel nicht, aber nach den ersten paar Minuten war ich kurz davor. Das Tutorial ist nicht auf die Oculus Rift abgestimmt, die Controllerbelegung wird nur f\u00fcr die Vive angezeigt. Das Drehen der Sicht wollte nicht funktionieren (Ich habe nur ein 2-Sensor Setup)... Festhalten per Trigger- statt Grifftaste?! Ich hatte das Gef\u00fchl, als m\u00fcsse man irgendwo noch einen Oculus Modus aktivieren k\u00f6nnen, so wie es etwa bei Space Pirate Trainer der Fall ist. Aber Nein, auch eine Suche half nicht weiter. Somit landete ich das erste mal auf einer Seite, die mir erkl\u00e4rte, wie Steam R\u00fcckerstattungen funktionieren. Aha, man darf f\u00fcr eine erfolgreiche R\u00fcckerstattung nicht mehr als 2h gespielt haben. Da ich bis jetzt nur einige Minuten gespielt hatte, dachte ich mir: \"Was solls, probier es eben nochmal\".\n\nVorher las ich mir allerdings im Forum durch, wie angeblich das Drehen der Ansicht funktionieren sollte.\nUnd - was soll ich sagen - nach etwas rumprobieren klappte es! Daf\u00fcr muss in den Optionen allerdings der \"Seated Mode\" ativiert werden, was mir nicht ganz einleuchtete. Daraufhin kann die Ansicht mittels des rechten Thumbsticks oder durch gedr\u00fcckthalten des A-Knopfes und \"Ziehen\" der Welt gedreht werden.\n\nSTEUERUNG:\nDie Bewegung/Steuerung ist am Anfgang SEHR gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig. Im Prinzip gibt es \u00fcberall im Level verteilt blaue Fl\u00e4chen, an denen man sich festhalten kann. Wie bereits erw\u00e4hnt geschieht dies per Trigger-Taste. Dies ist wohl daher gerechtfertigt, da es sich streng genommen nicht um ein Greifen, sondern um ein \"Abschie\u00dfen\" der H\u00e4nde handelt. Alle blauen Fl\u00e4chen innerhalb einer gewissen Reichweite k\u00f6nnen mit einer oder 2 H\u00e4nden gefasst werden. Wenn beide H\u00e4nde greifen und dann loslassen, springt der Charakter in die Richtung, in die man in diesem Moment schaut. Wenn man solche Spr\u00fcnge schnell genug aneinanderkettet, springt man h\u00f6her und schneller. Und das ist auch schon alles*.\nWenn man dieser Form der Bewegung eine Chance gibt, wird man sich wundern wie schnell man atemberaubende Sprungserien u.\u00e4. hinbekommt. Hierzu gibt es zu sagen, dass ich lediglich am Anfang, als ich die Ansicht noch nicht drehen konnte Probleme mit Motion Sickness hatte. Ich bin auch eher anf\u00e4llig daf\u00fcr, bei Spielen aus der Ego-Perspektive, die keine Teleport-Option anbieten, ist bei mir normalerweise Schluss. Hier bin ich verwundert und wei\u00df selbst nicht so recht, warum ich eigentlich nicht im Strahl kotze wenn ich durch die Luft springe und \u00fcber Gel\u00e4nder rutsche. Aber hier funktioniert es wunderbar und macht super viel Spa\u00df.\n\n*Im Steam Forum habe ich gelesen dass wohl sp\u00e4ter noch ein Jetpack dazukommen wird, aber so weit in ich im Moment noch nicht.\n\n\nLEVELDESIGN:\nMan merkt, dass die Entwickler versucht haben viel Abwechslung in die Level zu bringen. Nahezu keine 2 Levels spielen im komplett selben Setting. Meiner Meinung nach h\u00e4tte das garnicht unbedingt sein m\u00fcssen. Ich h\u00e4tte kein Problem damit 5-10 Level in der gleichen Umgebung mit unterschiedlichen Strecken zu spielen. Dagegen f\u00e4llt hier so ein Level wie das H\u00f6hlenlevel total aus dem Raster.  Die sonstigen Level die ich gesspielt habe, waren grafisch eher einfach gehalten, mit einem Fokus auf einfachen, geometrischen Formen und kr\u00e4ftigen Farben. Dieser Look steht dem Spiel gut und erinnert an WipeOut , Ninja Warrior etc. \nAlles in Allem sollte die Kreativit\u00e4t der Entwickler aber positiv erw\u00e4hnt werden. \nSchon allein das Roboterlevel hat mich sehr positiv \u00fcberrascht.\n\n\ntl;dr: Nach kurzer Eingew\u00f6hnungszeit ist das Spiel seinen Preis definitiv wert. Und da sonst Wave-Shooter und allgemein First-Person-Shooter bei VR vorherrschen, sollte man diesem Spiel erst Recht eine Chance geben, weil es viel anders, und das meiste richtig macht.\n", "timestamp_created": 1511404190, "timestamp_updated": 1511404190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36861278": {"recommendationid": "36861278", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994266375", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514761315}, "language": "english", "review": "Nominated it for \"Even better than I expected' award.

I played it for about an hour and refunded it. I played many of the easy levels and then a match of the multiplayer. I'll list some talking points below in no particular order.\n\nMusic: In my opinion, I didn't really care for it and I seemed to only hear the same three or four songs in my play time. I would love to be able to add my own music.\n\nGameplay: I feel like there's some conflicts with the games design. For instance, they emphasize that you should beat the levels as fast as possible but then they leave secrets to find in the level that you have to go out of your way to collect. The levels I played I rarely got a medal because I was exploring the level trying to find everything. Perhaps this is intended to make you replay levels. I'm not sure though because, as far as I can tell, there's no way to restart a level once you're in it. There also isn't a way to return to the main menu to select a different level or mode or anything. I had to take off my Rift, close the game, and reopen it just to get to the main menu. I tried every button on my controllers and nothing worked, which was midly annoying. One last tiny thing, I think in some levels the checkpoints were a bit too far apart, but a majority of them were fine.\n\nMovement: Overall feels good enough. My biggest gripe is that I thought if you wanted to push yourself off a wall, for example, you'd have to actually push off with your arms like in Echo Arena. Instead, you merely grab a blue environment object with both hands, look where you want to go, and then release your hands. This is also true while you're in mid air, so if you want to look around while you're falling, you'll start moving in whatever direction your looking and could potentially mess up a jump. I wish I could use a movement stick to control where I go in the air. Now, I didn't check the settings, but it seems like there's no snap turning. I managed okay for the most part but there were times where I would've liked to snap turn. I know there's a button to reset orientation quickly, which is nice, but that requires me to take off my headset to see where I am, which cuts out time in this time racing game. The only times I felt a bit VR sick was from falling at great heights, but it was tolerable for me.\n\nVisuals: Visually, this is a very nice looking game. One of the best looking ones, honestly. Very stylized. I like that you can get a sort of preview of the level as it loads in. No gripes here.\n\nCustomization: You can customize your character in this game and I was already happy with some of the first things you could choose from, which is greatly appreciated since many games with a \"customize your character\" feature make you look ugly at the start. You unlock new outfits and parts by just playing the game, completing levels and challenges. Nothing wrong here.\n\nMultiplayer: So, when I first joined in there was a sign that said something like \"work together to complete the level\" when it was just a race. No cooperation involved. Felt akin to playing a surf map on Counter Strike. Left me a little dissappointed. The only time I felt any sort of \"cooperation\" was when I asked a guy about a part of the level I was struggling with. \n\nDespite my problems with the game, I still recommend it only because I feel the problems I have with it are somewhat personal (such as not liking the music). It runs well, plays well enough, and has a good concept.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511199683, "timestamp_updated": 1511199683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36641070": {"recommendationid": "36641070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347462300", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "last_played": 1516065185}, "language": "english", "review": "If you own a VR system.\nYou need this game.", "timestamp_created": 1511163389, "timestamp_updated": 1511163389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36639195": {"recommendationid": "36639195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058602281", "num_games_owned": 413, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511930553}, "language": "english", "review": "Just as good as Windlands, just different.  10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1511153718, "timestamp_updated": 1511153718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36638819": {"recommendationid": "36638819", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970575528", "num_games_owned": 1265, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512068461}, "language": "french", "review": "J'ai eu l'occasion de tester Climbey avant To The Top...

It has incredibly satisfying and fun movement mechanics that evolve as you progress into more difficult levels that demand more precision, implement new obstacles, and introduce new methods of locomotion. The levels themselves are for the most part very well designed and varied both in gameplay and art design. I think the game is beautiful and some of the levels capture that sense of scale that's only possible in VR so well that they made my jaw drop.\n\nI really enjoy that each level has a few different ways to get medals (five medals each: three different completion time goals, one medal for finding all of the geoms scattered throughout the level, and a hidden medal usually placed down a well-hidden side path). Collecting the geoms encourages you to give the level at least one slow playthrough, finding various paths and giving you a chance to practice the parts you struggle with. The hidden medal is incredibly satisfying to get, both in finding the path to it and actually executing on the usually very challenging platforming you must do to get to it. The completion time goals give you a reason to put to the test what you learned and practiced in your first few runs, and completing a level faster than the fastest challenge time is often incredibly satisfying. Each time I got to a new level I was excited to spend time at least attempting to get all five medals.\n\nThe soundtrack is also amazing and the vibe it has really adds to the excitement and joy of going through levels leaping, sliding, falling, skating, etc. The avatar customization options are a neat little incentive to keep trying for more medals and a lot of them look pretty cool.\n\nIf you have a VR headset and think you'd enjoy this even a little bit I'd say go for it, this game is a joy.", "timestamp_created": 1510888490, "timestamp_updated": 1510888490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36561035": {"recommendationid": "36561035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052502172", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514502677}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is simply awesome.

I wouldn't even needed it in every level, only a few. Because it often happended that there was a really long level and at the verry end there was a spot that was so hard, that I and my friends lost all the time there. This became so frustrating.

For a \"simple\" control scheme, the devs have really gone all out on how diverse the levels are.

The levels are very much intended to be learned, then memorized, then exploited to hit the fastest time medal.  Every level has several routes, and usually the most obvious route is not the optimal one.  These levels are HUGE, and only seem to keep increasing in size.  Recently I'd worried that I was becoming immune to VR's biggest feature: presence.  I no longer flinch away from robots in Raw Data, Brookhaven isn't scary.  TTT has my palms sweating every time I play it, which hasn't happened, ever.   The fear of falling combined with the fear of screwing up a set of especially tricky jumps to get a hidden geom, cranks up the experience to levels I haven't experienced in other games.\n\nThe graphics are ok...like a lower budget Mirror's Edge, TTT uses color coding for you to understand the world.  It feels like the devs may have been a bit overly stingy with their polygon count, but the sheer size of these levels likely demands it.  The art style is consistent and pleasant, and free of overly showy distractions.  Like Awaken, theyre doing the best they can with the budget (monetary and vr-framerate) they've got.\n\nOh and the soundtrack is a nice pleasant surprise, with lots of actual SONGS, not just some repetitive techno beat.

I have to say I'm quite impressed by the amount of joy that can be had with soaring through the virtual air. It's little to nothing to watch but experiencing it is a whole different story. \n\nDifferent from \"Climby\" this game has you soaring much more than climbing. Initially I was going to wait for a sale but quite frankly I think that at 25$ this is a must for any VR owner. Super duper fun game to play or watch your friends trip out on. I can't speak highly enough of the good work put into this. \n\nThe levels are varied and usually provide much more than one way to get to a place which incites experimentation and choice. Levels are short and because of this it's a good game to swap back and forth with a person. They also make repeating previous levels a joy as learning to run something perfectly can be done in bite sized chunks. Your avatar is customizable as well as your hands. Should you mess up at all the checkpoint system makes it easy to reset to the last checkpoint you hit. Although I had some trouble clicking the wrist menu to reset the whole level. \n\nThis game is something that any VR owner should have but maybe just if you know you don't get sick in VR at all as leaping and climbing can cause vertigo or nerves or puke.\n\n+Amazing gorgeous worlds and levels\n+Controls feel great\n+Concept plays out perfectly for VR\n+Make me feel like a parquor master\n+Your hands extend off your controllers so you don't have to reach\n+Levels get more interesting as you go\n+Speedrunning this is too much fun\n+So far bug free for me\n+A secret in every level\n\n-Literal balance can be an issue in this game\n-Some issues with in game wrist menu\n-Prepare to get sick if you easily get queasy\n-Low ceiling issues might show in this game if your playspace is short\n-A little pricy compared to some other VR games\n\nBe warned though that if you at all have trouble with balance or have a fear of hights then this game might be a bit much to take in.

Along the ground, the feeling is similar to pulling yourself along with skipoles. The momentum you have and direction you fling yourself determines your leap's initial trajectory, but by looking towards where you want to go, you are granted a modest degree of air control. This 'perfectly-imperfect' amount of control helps keep things from getting too easy. The game then does a good job of gradually introducing a few additional mechanics to keep things interesting.\n\nUnless you are the type who gets motion sick from VR games that most are completely fine with, I doubt you need to worry about motion sickness. Although on rare occasions, you may be thrown a little off balance for a split-second. If you play in a tight space, it would also probably be good idea to have the headset's Chaparone setting turned on, as you can easily stray a little from the center of your area and reach outside of your play area without realizing.\n\nIn terms of replay value, that really depends on you. If you are the type to just go through once and never look back, the game's 30 levels will probably only last you a few hours. If you are more of a completionist, you will get much more out of it. There are medals to earn for faster times and getting through more challenging hidden paths. There will also be multiplayer races in the future. Hopefully we will also see more levels in the furture too.\n\nThe are a couple of trivial things that could be improved. The game's menus are extremely bland. The environments, although certainly posessing a sense of style and diversity, don't offer much in the way of eye-candy. And while the game has some great songs, it is a short playlist.

In VR, it is sometimes distracting how great everything looks, it's not one of those blurry, jaggy VR games heavily relying on lots of fancy textures.\n\nThis game starts as a simple \"grab the blue objects to climb\" experience, that gradually transforms into this grand, exuberant mess of exhilaration that I haven't experienced in any other game. The mechanics are simple enough and requires no force to jump distances. Instead you learn to time subsequent jumps like in Super Mario 64 which propels you further along the direction you are looking. You don't need to move your arms but I do it anyway because it creates this really primal feeling I haven't experienced in any other game, it's like being a predator in the jungle, or Mufasa leaping from rock to rock, and even falling feels fucking incredible and gets your heart pumping.\n\nEven collecting the gems/jewel/crystals things in the game is fun, because it is challenging and you have to think about how you are going to get to certain location and sometimes time your movements, like having to wait for the perfect moment to free fall off of a giant that is moving in order to reach that one last crystal thing you need to unlock the next level, that you know is going to have more cool ass shit you didn't expect.\n\nDon't miss out on this release if you are at all interested in some exhilarating 1st person Parkour Platforming with huge jumps, skating, sky diving, and more (I haven't finished the game but read that there is some rockets boosters and other cool stuff to be unlocked).\n\nI've included a link to a video of me attempting to break the current top score in the Giant Robot Level (which I didn't, but I did reach a personal best by subtracting 10 seconds to my lowest time)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/f-1yX_ACoCY", "timestamp_created": 1496790173, "timestamp_updated": 1496790173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32216090": {"recommendationid": "32216090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028028027", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496738482}, "language": "english", "review": "The music is pretty good, but that's all I like about this game.\n\nI was expecting a momentum-basedVR fling fest.

OF. MOVEMENT. \n\nSeriously, I feel more free playing this game than in any other VR game, and I get around pretty well. It feels somewhere between TF2 jump maps and Climbey, with the aesthetic of Mirror's Edge. \n\nTo The Top trades a lack of accuracy in technical climbing for an exhilarating, leaping, spider man crossed with the hulk crossed with Mirror's Edge experience. You run across the ground, fling yourself into the air, swing from buildings, and glide across roofs. It's a feeling I've been chasing in skill-based movement games since I started to get the itch for this kind of thing. Already set a WR on a map, I'm ready to tackle more!\n\nI like just about everything in this game. Here's what I DON'T like:\n\n- Handling of relative motion is not completely consistent. Some moving obstacles, while you're attached to them, seem static, and if you jump at the wrong angle, they kill you. Collision damage should be based on relative speed, not absolute.\n\n- The skate mechanic can be infuriating. In some spots, it's faster to spam grab your way across gaps than to actually skate.\n\n- No workshop map support! This game is missing out bigtime on that front.\n\n- Not enough flying levels. The flying implementation in this game is fantastic, but it's not fleshed out whatsoever. It's a huge loss that the climbing element and the flying are barely integrated.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. Two of them aren't actually issues, they're just me wanting more.

I've only had a couple of hours in this game so far but it's been a blast!\n\nIf you are worried about motion sickness, somehow it's very minimal in this game. Even though it doesn't blur vision or narrow the field of view during movement, I don't feel an ounce of nausea. I think the biggest reason for this is one of the gameplay mechanics: you look where you leap. I.e. you will always move in the direction you look.\n\nThis means you cannot jump backwards, or sideways. And you also have significant air control (you can change direction mid-air) by looking where you want to go.\n\nSo because of this, you will always be moving \"forward\" relative to the direction you're facing, which is the least likely to induce nausea.\n\nOf course, I cannot speak for everyone when I say it won't cause nausea. Your best bet is to try it out for yourself.\n\nThe way you move around is probably the most fun I've had in a VR game in a long time. Now I want other games with this movement scheme! If there is ever a VR Spiderman game, this is where it's at!\n\nAlso: you can be as active as you want while playing. You can swing your arms together like a squirrel bounding between tree branches, or you can simply press and release the triggers while looking in the direction you want to jump. It's very accessible for people have limited space, or can't move their arms for long periods of time.\n\nSpeaking of accessibility, I'm hoping the developers can add an option to snap-turn in increments for players unable to stand up while playing.

The fact that this game has released with a large number of actually designed levels that have secrets, collectibles, time trials, and tons of level features makes this game win over Climbey any day of the week.  Yes, Climbey has multiplayer and a level editor, but the core levels that come with it aren't very good, and last only an hour or so.

Have had the game for a while as a pre release and have had the pleasure of seeing levels and features added.\n\nLevel design is in a way where new gameplay elements are added in a manner that is  very intuitive.  At the beginning a tutorial explains the basic features on how to maneuver, and then lets you loose.  On each level a new gameplay element is added, moving surfaces, breakaway handholds, and they are all color coded so it is easy to tell at a glance.\n\nThe art style of the game is stylized so it is easy to tell where your handholds and grab points are.  If you are running the courses for speed, it makes it easy to find your next point at a glance.  \n\nEach level have items called Geoms that add an exploration factor as well, makes climbing around off the beaten path rewarding and find some nice hidden areas.  You will be challenged with gaps to get across and even natural hazards like lava.\nThe soundtrack is awesome and fits the game very well, very energetic music that goes along with what is happening.\n\nAn example of one of the quality of life features that the developers of To The Top have thought about that so many others gloss over is the difference between their Vibe development platform and the Oculus.  The natural hand position for the Vibe controllers and the Touch controllers is off by a few degrees, but we are given options to fine tune the angle of the hands to feel more natural.  Everyone else needs to take note of this.. THIS is how you do it.\n\nFor those that are having motion sickness, make sure to check out the grid option, it gives a grid effect that appears around you when moving fast that helps the user be able to keep their orientation and will reduce any illness\n", "timestamp_created": 1495480100, "timestamp_updated": 1495480100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520404", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31905742": {"recommendationid": "31905742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068633638", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511930491}, "language": "english", "review": "I decided to pull the trigger and give it a go and it's really really fun. The movement is not nauseating, the devs did a great job with the control scheme. Keep in mind This is coming from someone who plays a lot of onward but cannot really do flight sims. I think most people will be fine with it, but there are comfort options if you need.\n\n The game has A TON of content and the graphics are great. It has really great high quality music, with several songs that change while you play ( you can turn it off it you want, but you probably won't want too the music fits so perfectly with the gameplay)  and the fun factor I would say is a 10/10. I'm very impressed with this game and I think if you have been looking for a fun and polished VR game this one is for you.

Usually when I see a lesser known VR game that intrigues me on steam I wait a while to see how many reviews it gets and if they are positive. Either that or until it starts to get a lot of buzz on reddit. I decided to grab this , because it had caught my attention several times since it was released a few days ago in the new releases tab. It looked like a ton of fun.\n\nI am so glad I decided to grab it. This game is a little different than I thought it would be I thought you would have to swing your arms and pull yourself to each platform. The control scheme works different than that though, you use your hands to grab and position within your view, and your head to control the direction you jump / fly in. I suspect this is how they reduced nausea despite the fact that this is a very fast paced title. Its an amazing interpretation of a platformer in VR. The control scheme and locomotion is not something I would consider as hampering the game even though it was different than I thought it would be, unlike some titles where you wish the locomotion/ control schemes didnt get bogged down by the developers trying to illeviate motion sickness I did not feel that with this game.\n\nThe game itself has a good amount of Content over 30 levels I believe and tons of replayability. You will certainly not master these levels on your first play through. There are secret routes you can take and collectibles on each level not to mention level times , which is where I think most of my replayability will come in, trying to complete levels as fast as I can to not only get medals for faster completions (which unlock new levels) but hopefully to compete on leaderboards. I will attest that I did not notice any leaderboards on my playthrough of the first 14 levels but if they are not there I imagine it is something that will be added when the Dev adds multiplayer in the future (something they have said they will do)\n\nThis game is not climbey, it is much more fast paced. Its more like a parkour game with jetpacks. Highly suggest it for almost anyone. I am generally not into these types of games as much but this one intrigued me enough to give it a try, and I dont regret it.\n\nEdit: I have a few criticisms though after playing a little while longer. During my first play through I was happy to go from level to level just trying every level out, but now for example if I dont get the right time on a level there doesnt seem to be a menu option once your actually in the game. To either restart the level or to go back to the main menu. Your actually kind of stuck in the infinite loop of going level to level until you decide to quit the game and restart it to get back to the main menu as far as I can tell. I have pressed every button on the controllers to no avail when it comes to finding a menu. This seems like a serious design flaw, in a game where posting fast times is important either resetting mid level if you screw up to many times or even deciding to replay the level if you JUST missed the time you wanted would be important features., and they are missing from TO THE TOP.

What a rush!\n\nThis game is AMAZINGLY good, like the VR version of Mirror's Edge in many ways. The way the grabbing system works is a little less realistic but its very intuitive for doing super-fast speed hops from one surface to another. Speed builds up as you successfully hop multiple times and when coupled with surfaces that can effect the way you move it can allow you to build yourself up and .. just .. FLY!\n\nThe level design is also something to be admired. Each level has a certain amount of \"Geoms\" you have to collect which make for cool challenge points requiring you to really observe the level and use the terrain in many fun and interest ways in order to collect them. There is also a Hidden \"geom\" in each level which are SO rewarding to find and often very challenging to reach.\n\nAfter about an hour's play I have so far only unlocked about a 3rd of the game so I feel like, so far at least, there is plenty of longevity although as I get better at the game I might end up breezing through it. However the existence of Hidden geoms and requiring to collect all the geoms in the game will make for a much lengthier experience overall. \n\nPlus, the game is just FUN, like I would come back to any one of these levels just to feel the rush of certain mechanics of each level. I could easily see myself spending 10 hours plus in this game. Seriously if you started playing this game and you're thinking \"meh\" .. JUST GET TO THE LEVEL WITH THE FREAKING HALF-PIPES... HOLY SHIT!\n\nUpdate: 10 Hours ..... HAH!\n\nAlso as an Oculus Rift user ,SteamVR generally runs very poorly for me. To the Top only supports SteamVR currently but due to the low-fidelity of the graphics it doesnt seem to effect me too much, I have had near 0 frame frops, judder or tracking loss. On top of that, the Dev's went the extra mile to add a Controller tilt/rotate option to the options menu which allowed me to get the hands feeling more or less the way they should on the Touch Controllers. +10 Dev points for that, excellent fore-sight while they work on the proper Oculus Version for Oculus Home.\n\nUpdate 2: As of the latest version, Oculus is now natively supported by the game. It also added 5 new levels and multiplayer. Definitely get in on this if you haven't already.\n\nOverall, DONT miss this game .. I 100% recommend it.

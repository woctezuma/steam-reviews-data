Ended, for now, only Alex's route (going for Ian's and Jed's) with all CGs, but HECK this was an adventure! Cute and awesome game for evening meetings with \"friend\" and wine.\n- I'm totally in love with the art, men in general and face expressions are drawn super professional and perfect;\n- The theme in main menu is so good, it stuck in my head for long;\n- CGs are like commisioned arts, they are worth collecting;\n- We have like the best friends in game, and in general VNs categories, I want such roomates in my life too;\n- Also the stories of guys are so well written (pretty time-taking too!), every one of them is unique and with his own flaws and beautiful character features. Maybe sometimes you get the \"stereotypical\" feeling of some texts, but it's just sometimes.\nIt lacks voice-over which is a shame for such a good game, I wanted to hear Penny, Ian and Alex  what they might sound like. BUT, I accidentally hit \"V\" button which affects in many laughs - I don't know if it is choose by country, but Polish one was so hilarious! Please... Just do it.\n\nIn general, really awesome game for adults with interesting story and characters - and I think I would not take it back!\nP.S.

I really wish we had more games like this with different stories and settings. \n\nI can't express my level of appreciation for this game from a gay man's perspective. In a video game culture dominated by weebs and overemphasized females in every game and genre arch it's rare to come across a game that clearly proves its creators were knowledgeable on gay culture and behavior. It felt real and relatable.\n\nOh, and this was my first visual novel game. I'm very impressed! I finished the game in about two hours or so on my first playthrough, but I don't think that time is indicative of it's level of content given the multiple paths you can take and side events and extras. Plus, I may have sabotaged some events and cut myself shorter than anticipated. \n\nI'm eager to go back to try and unlock the other achievements and see more of the many alternative paths! Not to mention the extra content outside the main storyline that's provides some extra \"side quests\" so to speak or dialogues/events. I was dying during the fish incident! \n\nI'm very happy the developers did full exposure on their artwork during the adult scenes. By default, the game is censored, but if you can download a file from the developer's website that will decensor the game for you giving you full details with no censor boxes.\n\nGreat game!

It was wonderfully crafted and developed with great amounts of effort, love, and care. The artwork and design is phenomenal, the writing is brilliant, the gameplay is addictive, and the stories truly resonate. The theme definitely isn't for everyone and if you're open-minded enough to get past the adult nature, you will find immense enjoyment with this visual novel.\n\nMark (or whatever you choose to name him) is a character that I was able to relate to on a very personal level and I think that's what attracted me to this game the most. I've been in similar situations as him, trying to find my place in the world and experiencing many different things coming-of-age and coming to terms with who I am as a person.\n\nThe stories are charming and the decision-making paired with the choice-and-consequence allow for several different paths and endings, leading to remarkable replay value.

The genre is very different to most games out there in which it's like a choose-your-own-adventure novel, as indicated by the screenshots. There is no voice acting. There is sexual content and it's pixellated in the Steam version. Obscurasoft's website provides instructions on how to uncensor it, strictly for 18+ folks.\n\nI enjoy the writing in COOT, how the game doesn't take itself 100% seriously. When briefly touching on themes of homophobia (Phil's route), polyamory (a Brofinder bonus date), and so on, the writing is serious around those subjects however. There's not a lot I can say objectively about this game.\n\nIf you're a fast reader, the game will seem short. The quality of content makes up for it well however.\n\nThere is a demo available at https://obscurasoft.com/demo-18-only/ for folks interested in this game. Also on the site are more screenshots.

At first I was put off by the art style since that's not normally my thing, but once you get used to it, it's great. The writing is very good, though some of the humor came with heavy secondhand embarrassment, and the story doesn't take itself too seriously. There's a lot of substance to the different routes and they're all engaging. It knows you're playing for the sexy guys, but doesn't cheap out by giving half-assed writing.\n\nThe characters are probably the best part (aside from the H-scenes, which are VERY nice). There's only six main routes but ten additional guys to do one off dates with, which adds to the length of the gameplay but doesn't feel like padding.

Luckily there is a skip option, so it's not too bad, but even then it does still get a little tedious.\n\nAnother complaint I have is that several of the characters are just genuinely awful people, though I think that's kind of part of the genre and a bit more of a personal taste.\n\nOverall I would say the game is really enjoyable and a unique experience.", "timestamp_created": 1508694920, "timestamp_updated": 1508694920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35918670": {"recommendationid": "35918670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098630665", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511499286}, "language": "schinese", "review": "1.5\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u767d\u5ad6\u8fc7\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u6765\u8865\u7968(\u6342\u8138)\u3002\n\u53d1\u5728steam\u4e0a\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\u4e0e\u539f\u6765\u76f8\u6bd4\u786e\u5b9e\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6587\u672c\u91cf\u5927\u4e86\u4e0d\u5c11\uff0c[strike]\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6709\u7801\u786e\u5b9e\u5dee\u8bc4[/strike]\u3002\n\n\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u6e23\u6e23\u6d4b\u8bc4\uff1a\n1.\u7b97\u662f\u5f88\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u604b\u7231\u6a21\u62df(?)\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0b\u6765\u5f88\u50cf\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u540c\u5fd7\u77ed\u7247(\u4e0d\u662f\u7535\u5f71)\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u751c\u871c\u7684\u5e7b\u60f3\uff0c[strike]\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u57fa\u4f6c\u4eecyy\u5f97\u5f88\u591a\u7684\u63b0\u5f2f\u5ba4\u53cb\uff0c\u63a8\u5012\u6559\u6388\uff0c\u52fe\u642d\u4f53\u80b2\u751f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u519b\u4eba\u8b66\u5bdf\u533b\u751fetc...[/strike]\n2.(\u5fae\u5267\u900f\u9884\u8b66)\t[spoiler] \u6bd4\u8f83\u9057\u61be\u7684\u662f\u5404\u6761\u4e3b\u7ebf\u4e4b\u95f4\u57fa\u672c\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u653b\u7565\u8c01\u7684\u8bdd\u51b2\u7740\u8c01\u53bb\u5c31\u884c\u4e86\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u653b\u7565\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u82f1\u6587\u82e6\u624b\u548c\u5bf9\u57fa\u5708\u793e\u4ea4\u4e0d\u600e\u4e48\u719f\u7ec3\u7684\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u96be\u4e00\u6b21HE\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c10\u4e2a\u7ea6\u4f1a(pao)\u7ebf\u505a\u5f97\u4e5f\u7b97\u662f\u522b\u6709\u7528\u5fc3\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u90fd\u6709\u70b9\u4e0d\u6309\u5e38\u7406\u51fa\u724c233333\u3002 [/spoiler]\n3.\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u914d\u97f3\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7CG\u662f\u771f\u7684\u7edd\u8d5e\uff0c\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\u8eab\u4f5323333\u3002\n4.(\u7b97\u662f\u4e2a\u5c0ftip)\u6b63\u5982\u540c\u6e38\u620f\u6807\u9898\u90a3\u6837\uff0ccoming out on top\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1508673834, "timestamp_updated": 1508674041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35916358": {"recommendationid": "35916358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103003072", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509514019}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u90a3\u4e48\u54ea\u91cc\u53ef\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u80fd\u591f\u53bb\u6389\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u5462lol\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1508667674, "timestamp_updated": 1508667674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35905615": {"recommendationid": "35905615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005815839", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512715630}, "language": "english", "review": "... so Its really hot.

There are great illustrations, but the game play is all about reading and responding.\n\nSecond, a single play-through of the game is relatively short; maybe an hour or two.  \n\nThird, it's gay.  The main character is gay.  The relationships are gay.  The whole approach is gay.  It's just as advertised.\n\nIf you're okay with all three of the above, it's absolutely a great game.  The dialogue is witty and frequently laugh out loud funny.  The situations and choices range from realistic, to absurdly bizarre, to \"why doesn't this ever happen to me?\"   One of the major strengths of the game is its branching in seemingly insignificant dialogue choices.   Deciding to wear a hat can change your entire life.  After a number of playthroughs, I'm still being surprised by the variety of outcomes possible and that some of the paths are more poignant than \"happy\".  Occasionally, stepping through dialague that you've already been through to get to another choice can be a little long, but that's a minor nit and the payoff has usually been well worth it.  The game as delivered used censored illustrations of some of the encounter screens, but I consider this a NSFW game in any case with partial nudity and some written dialogue displayed in large text on the screen.  For personal use, the uncensored screens are a fun update noted in the forums.\n\n\nOverall, I found it engaging, fun, and worth well more than the $15.", "timestamp_created": 1508252870, "timestamp_updated": 1508252870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694825", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35783878": {"recommendationid": "35783878", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993491971", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508902170}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this when it first came out years ago.

Read on if you're not sure if this game is for you.]\n\nI've been a huge fan of this game since I discovered it several years ago, and it just keeps getting better. Lot of game time on this, but mostly on the pre-Steam version.\n\nWhat to expect:\n1) This is a gay dating simulator, so the fun comes from reading descriptions and dialogue, making choices and watching what happens. If you're looking for more gameplay than that, this might not be for you.\n2) Getting to a desirable ending might take a few tries. Don't be discouraged if the first time you play you get all the way through and get a bland or negative result. Some choices will cut out options, so attempting to do everything in one play will NOT work. Play and replay to find new things. Save often.\n3) The images are censored by default, but there are instructions available for downloading uncensored content if that is to your liking.\n4) The are a lot of settings help tailor the game to your preferences, but be warned that some situations may go places that aren't to your tastes. There will generally be fair warning and options given in game to avoid anything undesired.\n\nPros:\n1) Fun and sexy, sexy, sexy.\n2) Great writing and great story lines. Some situataions are more plausible than others, sure, but there are some delightul surprises and even touching moments. There's a LOT of terrific writing here and a LOT of variations. The best moments may not appear the first time, but stick with it and try again. There's so much worth finding.\n3) Great characters. I found myself liking many of the characters and personalities. Some of the plot lines were heartwarming in addition to being sexy.\n4) Great art. The expressions on the characters are priceless. Much of the humor comes from clever character reactions. Nice variety. And yes, the explicit artwork is great, too, but it's also nice that characters are fun to be with during dialog as well. The level of detail is impressive. NOTE: It was a surprise for me that the \"action\" art is in a different, somewhat more realistic style than the main game. It took a little getting used to as I'd already adjusted to the \"cartoon\" versions, but mostly a plus for me.\n5) Lots of humor. There are many kinds of encounters here and attention has been paid to creating characters whose humor evolves through the developing situations. \n6) Lots of variety. The game has room for some insane options if you want to go there. :)\n7) Replay value. Many of the play lines are mutually exclusive, so replaying is a must. Can also be a con, especially if you don't realize you HAVE to replay to get everything or if you're wanting to find EVERYTHING.\n\nCons (neither of which bother me too much):\n1) Delayed gratification. Sometimes going for early sexy action can lock out later good times (or better endings). While this is a perfectly fine life lesson, it's hard to pick up on in a game. Since there's no way to know what's ahead, choosing to enjoy any sexy that comes your way (so to speak) seems natural, but might lead to a sluggish, limited game later on. My first few times weren't great paths, and others might feel disappointed. However, if you see it as learning the style and flow of the game, then replay will reward you. It can feel strange to have to replay to get all the sexy action with any specific character, but knowing that up front can avoid frustration.\n2) Finding everything. The game has lots of branching, with options opened or excluded as you go along. Many of the major branching choices are not obvious, so it's easy to get lost in paths that don't lead to exciting conclusions. Would like see games like this have a hint system so that you can either find everything yourself, or get various levels of guidence (reminders) for what options you haven't tried, or what options should be avoided to go new places. Because of the branching choices nature of the game, it should be possible to basically build in a completion guide as part of the play, tailored to the player's desired level of \"spoilers\". I think this would help satisfy the DIYers and the \"readers\" who don't want to hunt and everything in between. The good news is that now that this is on Steam, there is a high probability that completion guides will get created.\n\nBottom line (so to speak): Much fun, great writing, I found the tone, humor and sexiness worth the replay and the hunting for endings. \n", "timestamp_created": 1508166660, "timestamp_updated": 1508166660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35770359": {"recommendationid": "35770359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075762496", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 57, "last_played": 1514200727}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot recommend this game enough.

The main being that the stories aren't entirely believable, yes I realize this is a game, but on most if not all of the dates you have to chase after the dudes and pretty much stalk/beg them to be with you. I think in most the cases any self respecting dude wouldn't bother, but I suppose were meant to play the desperate guy? \n\nI also wasn't expecting the game to be so short, though I gotta admit this is my first dating sim game so not sure if that's just how these games are. I get that these aren't big budget games, but while the game has replay value...it seems to go by entirely too quick. I guess I would have just liked to have seen a more extensive story even if they reused backgrounds and character models. One that lasted for more than 15-30minutes.\n\nAll in all I'm pleased with my purchase, just hope future games like this are a little more in depth and expansive with their content. A semester that lasted a month to play through rather than a half an hour would be nice.

The rooster of datable guys is very large and they are all unique in personality and appearence. \n\nKeep in mind that this is a Visual Novel game, so the gameplay is pretty much the same (pressing space bar or left clicking the screen), but the story and the exploration of the various routes more than makes up for it. Each route isn't necessarily long, but they are very engaging and the sheer number of routes gives it a great replay value, but be prepared for a lot of reading.\n\nIt isn't a game for everyone but, if you enjoy dating sims, story driven games and homoaffective relashionships don't bother you, then you should have a great time playing it.\n\nIan <3", "timestamp_created": 1508076551,

Very well written with witty dialogue. A huge cast of likable (and dateable/screwable) characters. There are serious endings you have to really work towards, hot endings that are more for...\"fun\", and there are also some really funny \"WTF\" endings. The art is amazing. The sex scenes are incredibly hot (play them uncensored!). I'm so glad Steam is giving gay people a platform in the gaming community. This game is important.\n\nDream Daddy by the Game Grumps is a good game made by good people, but it doesn't take the risky moves Coming Out On Top does. What Coming Out On Top lacks in mini-games, it makes up for in genuine, realistic love stories and gay relationships that are actually sexual. This game gets pornographic if that's where you want to take the story. It doesn't shame or lecture the player, there are tons of fantasies you can live out in this game. The steamy (ha, STEAMy) scenes are clearly made for people who appreciate the male body. There's no fade to black after you start kissing. COOT has the balls (lol, balls) to actually let you make choices in these scenes. Want to be a top? Want to be a bottom? Cool, you can choose! But even more than that, what do you say during this event? How do you want you character to feel? Is this too much, and do you want to stop? You can. Or do you want to keep going and reach the...climax of the scene? WHERE do you want to...finish? The amount of choices you get in this game seem endless, even down to picking if the guys have body hair and beards, or if you want to use condoms or not. This game doesn't hold back. It's for grown ups, like the old adventure games of the 1980s used to be.\n\nMost importantly, this game can be a real tool for people who are thinking about coming out. It really shows how it's not the end of the world - but it's also not always a cake walk. You can have a really depressing ending, or you can be brave and fight through some tough choices and get the happy ending you want.\n\nComing Out On Top gets an A+ from me.

I certainly believe that the game provides a comfortable level of fantasy material for people while also providing situations and storylines that will resonate or at the very least be relatable to some degree for others.", "timestamp_created": 1507884809, "timestamp_updated": 1507884809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680777", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35686823": {"recommendationid": "35686823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125762287", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 2248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514337195}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "It's a homo version of any other visual novel games.

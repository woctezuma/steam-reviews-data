It's a short game (4-ish hours), but will probably feel even shorter if you blaze through it the way I did. Escape Goat is not a particularly innovative game, but it's tremendously successful at pulling off it's core concept. The platforming controls are incredibly tight and satisfying. This is one of those games where it's fun simply to move around within the levels.\n\nEach zone of the prison has a unique theme and iterates on one or two key puzzle mechanics. The levels themselves manage to pull an impressive amount of variety from single screens. The music is pleasant, and a little bit moody. The graphics, oddly enough, are one of my favorite parts of the game. The color palette reminds me of the early Castlevania titles, with weird blues and purples standing out against dark and gloomy backgrounds. The whole package is surprisingly atmospheric for a game that is otherwise a pretty stripped-down platforming experience.

And let's not forget the kickass soundtrack.\n\nThe only problem I have with the game is the free expansion it comes with.

Many of the puzzles in the initial game are simple enough with a few challenging levels here and there that can be completed without being killed too terribly much and the first set can be completed within a couple of hours tops.  Once you've completed this fun set of levels, you unlock the extreme difficulty set of levels in another zone.  These appear to be designed more toward the crowd that likes rage games as the difficulty takes a massive spike upward for these.  Expect to die nearly non-stop on the extreme levels.  I have no idea if there is a third set of levels past the second group as the second group feels nearly impossible to complete, and I'm a veteran gamer.\n\nThe music is pretty great and goes well with the game.  This is a good thing since you'll be hearing the same tracks a lot once you reach the extreme difficulty.\n\nControls feel a little floaty at times, especially when you're trying to make precision jumps to small platforms.  It gives you a tendancy to either fall short of your jump or slide past it.  This can lead to some minor frustration in the easy levels and be downright infuriating in the extreme levels.\n\nLevel design is really good.  It feels like they could have included an intermediate set of levels to help smooth the transition along to the extreme levels.  That's assuming the extreme levels aren't actually the intermediate ones, though I can't imagine how that would be possible given how incredibly hard the game got after the easy set.\n\nOverall this is a great little 2d platform puzzle game that everyone should at least give a try.  Unless you're a completionist or masochist, I wouldn't recommend doing more than taking a cursory look at the extreme difficulty levels once you're through the easy set as you'll be beating your head against the game for what feels like hours just to complete a single room at that point.", "timestamp_created": 1451191967, "timestamp_updated": 1451191967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19954994": {"recommendationid": "19954994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078103257", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450972700}, "language": "french", "review": "C'est un jeu de platforme alliant skill et reflexion .\nVous controler un bouc devant sauver ses amis bouc .\nL'histoire n'est clairement qu'un pretexte pour nous faire traverser\n9 mondes remplis de 6 niveaux chacun .\nLe jeu se boucle en a peu pr\u00e8s 1 h 30 .\nLe gameplay est simple et efficace, la difficult\u00e9 bien dos\u00e9e mais pas insurmontable .\nUn jeu que je conseille \u00e0 petit prix tout de m\u00eame !!", "timestamp_created": 1451119024, "timestamp_updated": 1451119024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19954182": {"recommendationid": "19954182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111577271", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451115616}, "language": "english", "review": "A medicore platformer for me.

However, the game is the kind of hard that is challenging, rewarding and keeps you wanting for more instead of frustrating and the shortness of the levels help a lot. I only had to watch a guide for one of the levels. The music is also very charming and catchy, the controls (atleast with an Xbox 360 pad) are precise and the graphics and art are nice, even if there's not a lot of variety in the scenery except some small colors and detail changes.\n\nI bought Escape Goat back when it was on sale by one buck, though I think the normal price tag justifies the sale, as it also includes a level editor and an extra set of REALLY hard levels made by users after you completed the main story.

It's a cute, but challenging puzzle platformer about a purple goat and a mouse with a sweet [strike]pimp[/strike] magic hat who must escape from some jerk's diabolical prison. To do this, they must travel through nine different areas to rescue the magical, slumbering sheep within, and then conquer one final extra-long area for good measure.\n\nEscape Goat has an interesting way about its levels. They're always shifting. Buttons and switches move blocks, barrels will roll, platforms move along tracks, and crates explode (usually in big chain reactions). Puzzles tend to involve trying to understand what will make what do what, and then making sure it all happens in the right order without getting yourself killed.\n\nThe actual movement can be a little floaty, but you quickly get used to it. It's not a game-ruiner. Block-wide openings require some precision to get through that may cause a few deaths when you're in a hurry or just unlucky with your dash timing. Still not a game-ruiner, but occasionally annoying.\n\nThere are enemies, but you can't kill them directly. You can often kill them indirectly, by using the environment creatively. In several spots, this can even gain you achievements. Which, by the way, aren't just your standard \"congrats you beat another level!\" fare. The majority of the achievements here are for completing levels in challenging ways. Many of these require you to do things that were clearly not intended when the game was originally released on XBLI, but which probably came to the dev's attention later on down the line. Barring a handful of annoying chievos, these add a good deal to the game, requiring you to think outside the box and push your skills to the limit.\n\nOn that note, the overall difficulty of the game is pretty good. You've got a few easy warm-up levels, and then quickly get into the thick of it. Towards the end, you'll be putting your platforming skills to the test. If it's still not tough enough for you, don't fret. Once you complete the game, a bonus mode unlocks with four worlds of extra-challenging levels. A warning pops up to tell you that the going's going to get tough when you start it. And it's not kidding. I'm sure not finishing that without a walkthrough anytime soon.\n\nThe game looks great! The dev understands the importance of color, something which pleases me greatly. There's a bit in the first Castlevania episode of Sequelitis about using colors that pop, and it's a lesson that I feel doesn't get taken to heart often enough. In Escape Goat, your goat is purple. Your mouse friend is orange. The environments use a variety of colors to keep your eyes focused. No slog through brownish grey ruins, here. I mean, there... there are some browns and greys. But you get what I'm saying.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I think the music here shines above all else. Which is only natural, as the dev was originally a video game composer before getting into design, as well. There's a unique sound to the music of Escape Goat that I really can't describe very well. They should have sent a musician. I don't know if it's an echoey sound or, I dunno. Reverb? Something. Makes for some mysterious melodies, though, I can tell you that. Give it a listen on [url=http://magicaltimebean.bandcamp.com/album/escape-goat-original-soundtrack]Bandcamp[/url], if you like. If that sounds like something you'd like to hear in a game, then this is that game, and you know where the purchase button is! \n\nThe game contains a level creator, and you can play player-made levels by placing them into a certain folder on your computer. There's a stickied thread on EG's Discussions board that will tell you more.\n\nIt's pretty short at about 3 hours for the initial campaign, with potential time extensions in the forms of the bonus campaign and player-made levels. It's also pretty cheap at only $5, which seems like a pretty good trade off. I can safely recommend the game at that price. If you're on the fence, $1.24 during a sale is honestly about as much of a steal as a steal can be. If you're dissatisfied at that price (you won't be), then I just don't know what you're doing with your life.", "timestamp_created": 1421427524, "timestamp_updated": 1421427524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507148", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13972807": {"recommendationid": "13972807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004144177", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421171743}, "language": "german", "review": "Die Ziege ist endlich aus dem Gef\u00e4ngnis ausgebrochen und hat alle Scharfe befreit.\n\nAls ich die erste Level gespielt hatte, dachte ich mir das sei doch viel zu einfach, aber das waren halt erst die ersten Level.\nBei den ersten Level sind die Wege zum Ausgang wirklich offensichtlich, sp\u00e4ter sind da schon R\u00e4ume dabei wo man ein paar Anl\u00e4ufe brauchen wird.\n\nDer Levelaufbau ist immer sinnig und die Mechaniken werden gut genutzt.\nZu der Musik muss man leider sagen das es sich kaum unterscheidet bei den verschiedenen Levelthemen, jedoch sind die vorhandenen Musikst\u00fccke trotzdem nicht schlecht.\n\nSumma summarum ein guter Plattformer deren Schwierigkeitsgrad von Leicht bis hin zu nicht ganz so Schwer.\nVon mir bekommt es auf jedenfall [b]eine Kaufempfehlung[/b] auch f\u00fcr den normalen Preis.", "timestamp_created": 1421174433, "timestamp_updated": 1421174433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13956286": {"recommendationid": "13956286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000587285", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419019739}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una cabra condenada por brujer\u00eda, un rat\u00f3n, una prisi\u00f3n y un pu\u00f1ado de ovejas.

After playing Escape Goat, I am not here to review a simple 2D puzzle platforming game. I am here to prove that this goat is a witch. Goats have long been known for their platforming prowess. They have always been able to scale tall mountains with ease. Like all goats, this one can dash forward to ram through breakable walls or extend a jump. Those are qualities that a normal goat possesses. This goat can double jump. There is no other goat that can jump in mid air.\n\nThe meager purple goat that you see before you has broken out of our deepest, darkest prison within only three hours. All with the aide of a cohort mouse that believe it or not, this goat talks to! Not only that, but the goat can command this mouse. The goat can send the mouse running in a straight line, scaling up walls, traversing ceilings and hitting switches. It can even get placed under a sleep spell where it rests wherever this foul witch goat places it! Making it useful to rest on 'weighted switches' that need a body to hold them down. This heathenish goat can even toss its unwilling partner in escape upward where it can then cling on the ceiling and walk forward. The mouse can be instantly summoned back by the simple will of the goat.\n\nI would like to show the court evidence A. The magical hat I have just revealed allows the witch goat to change places with the mouse. Calling this hat magical is a farce! It isn't the hat that is magic, its the goat that makes the hat magic! The goat was able to have the mouse crawl through small areas and then teleport directly to them.\n\nThere were still things that the goat couldn't possibly use his mouse ally for. Wall mounted switches that only the goat could touch. These switches lead to a variety of things. Both bad that enabled platforms to help the goat escape and good that started machine like traps. Walls that moved, floors that shifted. All the goat had to do was exit out of each room's open door. If the door wasn't open, the goat managed to find keys that it used to unlock the door. Sometimes six keys in one room and this goat managed to collect them all!\n\nBecause of these talents, this magical goat may have escaped all 55+ rooms in this prison, but it cannot escape the arm of the law! This goat managed to escape its own cell block of five puzzling rooms. Then it made its way to the gathering place where it opened up new cell blocks. For every cell block the goat went through, it opened up two more cell blocks. It was able to go through each of the nine cell blocks consisting of five rooms each. All to rescue its sheep sisters from prison. After all that, the witch goat managed to escape nine final rooms of doom!\n\nEach cell block is themed and had even more danger, but the goat make it look easy and fun! One cell block of five rooms featured ice blocks. Blocks too cold for its mouse friend. Blocks that the goat managed to ram and push. Another cell block had hollow blocks that the goat could travel through, but other blocks stacked on top of. Razorblades spinning around platforms couldn't stop the goat! Nor could death reapers that throw fireballs when they spot the goat. Nor could fire breathing wall mounted sentries!\n\nMoving platforms, mechanized blocks, changing structures, rolling barrels that explode when lit on fire and walls that blew up when lit on fire. Nothing could stop this goat! How on this great Earth could one goat survive death like that? Well truth is, the goat never survived death. This goat is as fragile as your ordinary goat. Anything can kill it. Its magic that brought this goat back to life again and again! If the goat ever got trapped in a room. It could suicide, completely resetting the room. The rare times that the goat would fall into pits or be able to leave the room without exiting through the door, the goat respawned!\n\nAfter all this, the goat thinks it can make a better prison. It can somehow make blue prints and escape from a prison of its own invention! Well witch goat, you may have escaped from the easy prison, but after you made your 3 hour escape look easy, there is another prison waiting for you more brutal than the first!

Escape Goat. Dans la jungle des puzzle/plateformers qui inondent le march\u00e9, difficile de trouver son compte. Si vous \u00eates du genre \u00e0 ne pas appr\u00e9cier le type, essayez le tout de m\u00eame, dans le cas contraire, c'est un coup de coeur assur\u00e9.\n\nCar le jeu ne fait pas dans la maladresse de nombreux puzzle/plateformers lassants, r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs et coinc\u00e9s entre l'aspect \"plateforme\" et \"puzzle\" sans trop savoir de quel c\u00f4t\u00e9 il tend. La petite ch\u00e8vre est vive, ses sauts sont souples et n\u00e9gociables, son inertie est juste, et elle peut faire un dash en avant \u00e0 sa guise. Choses qu'il faudra apprendre \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser si l'on veut parfois prendre des raccourcis et gagner de nombreuses secondes, car la biquette peut aller jusqu'\u00e0 deux sauts et un dash maximum une fois dans les airs. Les puzzles sont inventifs et on se demande \u00e0 l'arriv\u00e9e dans une nouvelle salle de ce qu'ils vont nous r\u00e9server.\n\nLa vuln\u00e9rable ch\u00e8vre sera aid\u00e9e par une petite souris, que l'on peut invoquer \u00e0 volont\u00e9, et qui pourra se frayer un chemin et activer les m\u00e9canismes voulus, quand la premi\u00e8re ne sera pas assez fine pour passer. Et l\u00e0 vous vous dites : \"on va encore nous faire le coup du gameplay en deux temps, avec un gimmick offert par la souris pas vraiment utile\". Sauf qu'ici, il faudra l'utiliser proprement, et g\u00e9rer souvent la petite ch\u00e8vre en m\u00eame temps, quand on peut carr\u00e9ment m\u00eame \u00e9changer sa place avec le rongeur si on a obtenu le chapeau magique - qui peut trainer dans certaines salles.\n\nCar quand on parle des salles, elles sont toutes de la dimension d'un \u00e9cran. On les enchaine en empruntant la porte de sortie \u00e0 chaque pi\u00e8ce. Chaque lot de 6 salles est disponible \u00e0 travers un hub, et il faut savoir que l'on peut passer 2 d'entre eux parmi les 8 d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9s progressivement. En comptant le prologue et l'\u00e9pilogue \u00e7a nous fait un peu plus d'une cinquantaine de puzzles, tous aussi vari\u00e9s visuellement que dans leur conception. Si la partie graphique ne plaira pas \u00e0 tout le monde (style 8-bits), Magical Time Bean s'est concentr\u00e9 sur un gameplay aux petits oignons, et la partie sonore offrira probablement la moiti\u00e9 du plaisir que l'on tirera du jeu - du synth\u00e9 fa\u00e7on 90' aux petits airs baroques qui me font des guilis dans la partie situ\u00e9e sous la ceinture.\n\nPour finir, le fait que le design de certains niveaux laissent de nombreuses opportunit\u00e9s de raccourcis satisferont les rookies amateurs de la compl\u00e9tion \u00e0 100% - exigeant de r\u00e9aliser certains challenges dans certaines salles - et les speedrunners qui se sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 amus\u00e9s \u00e0 roder le jeu. \u00c0 ce sujet, l'achievement le plus difficile exige de finir sous 45 minutes, ce qui est loin d'\u00eatre insurmontable, puisqu'il est recommand\u00e9 de s'entrainer dans les salles d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9es avec une fois le jeu termin\u00e9 (j'ai fait 25 minutes avec un peu de patience).\n\nS'il faudra 3-4 heures environ pour parcourir le jeu une premi\u00e8re fois, on passe jusqu'\u00e0 presque jusqu'\u00e0 9-10 heures pour un 100%. La difficult\u00e9 est progressive et le jeu est abordable m\u00eame pour les ceux qui ne mangent pas du genre \u00e0 tous les petits matins. Pour les joueurs \"hardcores/masocores\", finir le jeu donnera acc\u00e8s \u00e0 de nouvelles salles extr\u00eamement difficiles - \"All Intensive Purpose\" - qui me donnent des frissons et des sueurs froides rien qu' en y pensant.

The exact timing of the puzzles create a great platforming challenge, as the actual window you may have to reach your goals can be very short and very difficult. Then there's the mouse, an NPC that you can send out to run along walls/ceilings, hit switches for you, and get into small places, this creates scenarios where you also have to aim the mouse with precise timing to complete your goal. \n\nI really appreciate how there is no direct way to kill any of the enemies in this game, instead the focus is on dodging, sneaking, and distracting them. They're less enemies and more like elements of the puzzle that can hurt you, as many levels require baiting enemies to destroy blocks or hit switches. Then there's levels that basically amount to ridiculous rube-goldberg machines, and figuring out how they even work is half the fun and half the challenge. \n\nI bought this game for 2 bucks on sale, and it was worth evey penny.", "timestamp_created": 1406958519, "timestamp_updated": 1406958519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11467077": {"recommendationid": "11467077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058975220", "num_games_owned": 556, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406658557}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than Goat Simulator.", "timestamp_created": 1406658669, "timestamp_updated": 1406658669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490255", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11429014": {"recommendationid": "11429014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024742473", "num_games_owned": 851, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406433077}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Meeh-eeh-eeh!\n\n\nIt's good goat fun!\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1406436580, "timestamp_updated": 1406436580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509340", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11363812": {"recommendationid": "11363812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028564676", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407132741}, "language": "english", "review": "I had this game gifted to me one day in the hopes I would find some enjoyment out of it.

It's a puzzle-platformer with a retro aesthetic. Also, there really wasn't anything that really blew me away about the game. However, don't think that this game is bad because of that. It's actually a very solid game with excellent level design (with a few exceptions and another part that I'll talk about later). As far as the controls and mechanics go, this game keeps things rather simple. You are, as you might guess, a goat. You also have a mouse companion with you that you can use to distract the enemy (there's only one type of enemy, but that's okay; combat doesn't exist in this game) or send into narrow corridors to do various things. You can send out the mouse and call it back at any time, and there exists a power up in some levels that allows you to switch positions with the mouse.\n\nThe levels themselves do make a great deal of use of the mechanics and are very good about introducing concepts without tutorializing you to hell and back. While there are a few levels that don't feel like puzzles at all or are rather easily broken, I'd argue that about 90% of the levels are well thought out and cleverly designed. All in all, there's about 50 levels in the game, with the exception of the extra chapter that you probably shouldn't play. \n\nThis chapter is called All Intensive Purposes, and after one level I stopped playing it because of the immense bad taste just one level left in my mouth. That level was the first level of a chapter called Death Row, and it's pretty much an unfair piece of garbage. The problem comes from the fact that the event triggers for the level are invisible. Likewise, a lot of these triggers create unpredictable effects that can completely ruin your progress. Yes, there's even a pretty much unavoidable death trap at the end of the level that made me stop playing. There's a difference between difficult and unfair. Maybe there were better levels later on in the chapter, but after spending about 20 minutes trying to beat that level, only to be screwed over by an unavoidable death trap at the end. After how expertly crafted most of the main stages were, a level like that felt like an insult followed by a slap to the face.\n\nApart from that, though; the game itself is very fun and very enjoyable. It is a fairly short game, clocking in at just over two hours for the main stuff for me, but for quite a few very clever puzzles that actually feel rewarding to solve, $5 is a very good value. 8/10.\n\nStory: You am goat leave prison fast much. Yeah, no point rating it.\n\nGraphics: As mentioned earlier, this game goes for an 8-Bit aesthetic. The pixel art isn't exactly impressive, but it's not bad either. The animations are smooth, it's easy to differentiate between things, and it's pretty functional while not looking lazy or bland. For the technical aspects, the game launches with the option of fullscreen or windowed. The game fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without a hitch, so you probably shouldn't have many issues (if any at all). Overall, the graphics style isn't gonna blow anyone away, but the animations are good and the game works perfectly on a technical level. 3/5.\n\nSound: Pretty much just music to talk about here, and man oh man, does this game have a good soundtrack. Whoever Chainsaw is, ya did good. The only complaints I can make (and they're minor) is that the songs do get reused for a couple of sections and one of the songs loops weirdly. Other than that, this soundtrack is worth getting on its own merits. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/0/3/5; cumulative score of 8.0/10.

The game is also a bit short, 2-3 hours to beat all levels, so be aware of that in case you wanna wait for a sale, though there is a level editor and some secrets to extend the playtime further thankfully.\n\nAll in all, if you have a Xbox controller and like puzzle platformers it's a pretty good game, just do be aware it's pretty frustrating sometimes if you play with a keyboard.", "timestamp_created": 1404249643, "timestamp_updated": 1404249643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10920846": {"recommendationid": "10920846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040512669", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404043200}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Puzzles entretenidos", "timestamp_created": 1403994288, "timestamp_updated": 1403994288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10904379": {"recommendationid": "10904379", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993650434", "num_games_owned": 1126, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405890673}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0422\u044b - \u043a\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043b. \u0422\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 - \u043a\u0440\u044b\u0441\u0430. \u0422\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 - \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f. \u0422\u0432\u043e\u044f \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c - \u0441\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u044e\u0440\u044c\u043c\u044b, \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0432 \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432. \u0422\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u044f\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f - \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c, \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e-\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0448\u0442\u0443\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0438.", "timestamp_created": 1403958789, "timestamp_updated": 1403958789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10883923": {"recommendationid": "10883923", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977162597", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404003584}, "language": "english", "review": "I purchased this game as part of some bundle.

Fortunately 2 minutes into playing I found myself drawn into an extremely slick 2d puzzle platformer with a great soundtrack.  The basic mechanic of jumping around and hitting some switches is complimented by a little mouse friend to help extend your 'reach' a bit.\n\nLevels start out quite forving as they teach you the basic game mechanics and interactions with the mouse, but by the half way point start turning wuite fiendish and can require many, many, *many* attempts to get past.  By the end thye are sort of straddling that luck vs skill vs figuring out three way fight and sometimes you'll know what needs to be done, but it will take you dozens of lives before you manage to just slip between two death dealing traps in exactly the right way to continue.\n\nOn that note, one *warning* for people with more advanced gaming hardware.  It turns out that the timing of the game is not based on clocks/counters but rather on the frame pacing of the games draw engine.  For most people with 60hz displays, that won't matter much (though you can get a slight 'slowdown' if you set things to a 50hz euro sync rate instead).  Those of us with 144hz gaming panels though are in for a bit of a rough ride.  \n\nI hit a certain level where i was just physically incapable of timing jumps fast enough to 'work' and thought I must have the wrong idea of what the level needed, so I looked up a youtube walkthrough. Well wouldn't you know it, everything seemed to be moving way *way* slower for that guy, and he was speaking german... I put two and two together, rebooted the game with the display at 50hz not 144hz, and suddnly everything was literally moving 3x slower and those 'impossible' jump timings suddenly became quite easy.  \n\n(and to think i beat the first half of the game at 3x 144hz 'speed')\n\nThat resolved though I really did enjoy the game and would happily reccomend it to anyone who loves neo retro indie stuff with great soundtracks and great action puzzle platformer game play.", "timestamp_created": 1403821613, "timestamp_updated": 1403821613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10847333": {"recommendationid": "10847333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022997080", "num_games_owned": 1720, "num_reviews": 358, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403814106}, "language": "english", "review": "I like to think of Escape Goat as \"the little game that could\". Launching first on the highly flawed and crowed Xbox Indie Game Market, it garnered a cult following that pushed it ahead of the seemingly endless shovelware that littered the platform, eventually making its way to Steam and even getting a sequel. Despite the acclaim, I've been sitting on the sidelines, still unconvinced by the unimpressive graphics and seemingly basic design. As is often the case though, my first impressions couldn't have been further from the truth, as Escape Goat more than lives up to its well deserved reputation.\n\nLocked in a dungeon, you play as a magical goat with a magical mouse friend, on a journey to escape and bring with you the magical sheep who have been trapped for an eternity for crimes of witchcraft. To get to these sheep however you must first solve a series of puzzle rooms, the contents of which can be anything from harmless blocks to fire casting Reapers. Because of its nonlinear structure, there isn't any way for your abilities to grow overtime or otherwise have the game expand and evolve the further you get, but far from being a handicap the developer uses this potential limitation to craft remarkably consistent levels. There's no gradual rise in difficulty or sharp spikes later on, but instead a constant stream of challenging but not frustrating level designs that feel incredibly satisfying to complete.\n\nYou may only have less than a handful of moves and abilities, but the ways these can be applied to levels continues to broaden as different areas showcase various applications of them that never would have occurred to me to even try. It's this continual progression of what you think you can do without actually changing anything about your character that makes Escape Goat such a clever game to play. It rewards your own ingenuity without resorting to simply giving you a new mechanic to work with. \n\nIf you have yet to partake in the escape of Argus with your magical mouse friend, I'd advise you to delay no longer. Developer Magical Time Bean's Escape Goat is a truly impressive achievement and a joyous game to play, who's biggest flaw is it ends so soon (though perhaps it's for the best, as it completely negates the chance for filler). Despite its dated look it manages to feel fresh and innovative the whole way through, and you'd be fool to do as I did and wait so long to give it a chance.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2014/06/26/escape-goat-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1403816098, "timestamp_updated": 1428781498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809256", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10751263": {"recommendationid": "10751263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042023224", "num_games_owned": 876, "num_reviews": 503, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403769088}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc9e7\uace0 \ubb34\ub09c\ud55c \ub9ac\ud2b8\ub85c \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ud37c\uc990 \ud50c\ub798\ud3ec\uba38 \uac8c\uc784.\n\uc8fc\uc778\uacf5 \uc5fc\uc18c\uc640 \ub3d9\ub8cc\uc778 \uc950\ub97c \uc798 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9f5 \uc18d\uc758 \uc7a5\uce58\ub4e4\uc744 \ubc1c\ub3d9\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc5f4\uc1e0\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5b4 \ucd9c\uad6c\ub85c \ube60\uc838\ub098\uac00\ub294 \uac8c\uc784. \ub2e8\uc21c\ud574\ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud30c\uace0 \ub4e4\uba74 \uc81c\ubc95 \uc2ec\uc624\ud574\uc9c0\ub294 \uad6c\uc131.\n\n\uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub2e4\uc9c0 \uc5b4\ub835\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub358 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \uc801\uc5b4\ub3c4 \ubcf8\ud3b8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294. \uac00\ub054 \uac01 \ub9f5\uc758 \ud6c4\ubc18\ubd80\uc5d0 \ud2b8\ub7a9\uc774 \ub9c8\uad6c\uc7a1\uc774\ub85c \ubc1c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \ub9f5\uc774 \uc788\ub294\ub370, \uad6c\uc870\ub9cc \uc54c\uba74 \ud06c\uac8c \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub290\uaef4\uc9c8 \ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uacb0\ucf54 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ud55c \ubc88 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\ud558\uba74 \ub098\uc624\ub294 \ucd94\uac00 \uac8c\uc784 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub294 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub97c \uc790\ub791\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7f0 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc88b\uc544\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\ub2c8\uc544\uce35\uc5d0\uac8c \ud658\uc601\ubc1b\uc744\ub9cc\ud55c \uc694\uc18c.\n\nMSX \uc2dc\uc808 \uac8c\uc784\ub4e4\uc744 \ubcf4\ub294\ub4ef\ud55c \ub3c4\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5c4\uccad \ud280\ub294 \ub9ac\ud2b8\ub85c \uadf8\ub798\ud53d\uacfc \ubcc4\ub85c \ub9ce\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uad6c\uc131\uc740 \ucde8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud0c8 \ub9cc\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84. \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc774\ub7f0 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uc57c\ub9d0\ub85c \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc624\uae30 \ub531\uc774\uae34 \ud558\ub2e4\ub9cc.\n\n\ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 \uc18d\ud3b8\ub3c4 \ub098\uc654\ub2e4\uace0 \ud558\ub294\ub370, \uae30\ud68c\uac00 \ub418\uba74 \uaf2d \uc990\uaca8\ubd10\uc57c\uaca0\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1403611326, "timestamp_updated": 1403611358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.955446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10745854": {"recommendationid": "10745854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021051482", "num_games_owned": 1994, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402413545}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun puzzle platformer.

Un puzzle platformer, ce n'est pas une mince affaire. Niveaux trop courts, trop longs, insatisfaisants ou frustrants, r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 toucher du doigt l'\u00e9quilibre entre les diff\u00e9rents facteurs qui d\u00e9finissent cette composante \u00f4 combien rev\u00eache qu'est le fun, c'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 beau, en soi, quelque part. Un peu comme  un casu marzu tient lieu de clou du spectacle chez les amateurs de surstr\u00f6mming. Oui, elle est douteuse mon analogie. Et ?

HEIN ?) ne s'incruste pas. Il vient, vous passez du bon temps avec lui, et puis quand l'h\u00f4te commence \u00e0 b\u00e2iller il s'en va en saluant poliment. Le genre d'invit\u00e9 qu'on voudrait voir plus souvent quoi. D'ailleurs \u00e7a tombe bien, il est revenu. Mais c'est une autre histoire.\n\nLe bon go\u00fbt de sa difficult\u00e9. Jamais les \u00e9nigmes ne sautent au-dessus du requin, jamais on ne sent que les choses deviennent plus cors\u00e9es, jamais on ne se sent frustr\u00e9 par la facilit\u00e9, rarement par la difficult\u00e9 - et m\u00eame alors, on fait une pause, on revient le lendemain et la solution appara\u00eet comme par magie sous nos yeux \u00e9bahis.\n\nLe bon go\u00fbt de son ambiance. Le pixel art, \u00e0 la longue, c'est \u00e9c\u0153urant. Les chiptunes aussi, d'ailleurs (\u00e0 l'inverse de leurs semi-homonymes \u00e0 base de pommes de terre). Et pourtant EG est imm\u00e9diatement prenant. Force est de constater que, si l'on abuse pas des aigus, si on ne fait pas de l'art pour l'art, la sauce continue d'\u00eatre ce magnifique compl\u00e9ment semblable \u00e0 celui qui accompagne les tacos (venez pas vous plaindre si vous avez faim, maintenant, mmh).\n\nLe bon go\u00fbt de ses contr\u00f4les. Prise en main imm\u00e9diate, r\u00e9actions imm\u00e9diates, confort complet que ce soit au clavier ou \u00e0 la manette (quoique la seconde soit clairement \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier). Pas de manipulations compliqu\u00e9es, le gameplay est ici au service du joueur. Et \u00e7a, c'est bon.\n\nLe bon go\u00fbt de son sadisme. Je parlais plus haut de la difficult\u00e9, permettez que j'en remette une couche vite fait, de mani\u00e8re plus pointue. Le jeu inclut, une fois termin\u00e9, un mode plus difficile. Si vous avez trouv\u00e9 le jeu trop facile (et entendons-nous bien, c'est tout \u00e0 fait possible. S'il est plus \u00e9pineux qu'un Portal, ce n'est pas de beaucoup)... ma foi le cr\u00e9ateur lui-m\u00eame avoue sans honte avoir du mal avec ce mode. Bref, si vous en redemandez, vous serez servi.\n\nTout dans tout, Escape Goat r\u00e9alise le sans-faute. Pour peu que l'on ne soit pas compl\u00e8tement r\u00e9fractaire \u00e0 la 2D et aux jeux old-school, il y a l\u00e0-dedans de quoi faire fondre sinon les c\u0153urs, du moins les r\u00e9sistances et quelques neurones.

The main storyline of the game has 65 levels grouped into 10 zones (9 sets of 6 rooms, and a set of 9 at the end), and once you complete it, you unlock ridiculously hard bonus levels with another 36 rooms (pushing the total to just over 100) I still haven't finished all of the bonus rooms (though I've managed to get through 27 of them, they're seriously evil) but you don't have to even touch them to complete all achievements, which is good for me, because I like having that 100% complete record.\n\nThe graphics are pretty generic 8-bit indie debut game, and the music, although catchy, is nothing to marvel at.

You come up with a clever pun - \"Hmmm... Scapegoat... scape... escape... Escape Goat!\" - and everything just flows from there.  It's risky to force inspiration by trying to design a game around a cute title, but in this case the result is surprisingly fun.\n \nEscape Goat is exactly what it says on the tin.  You control a goat, and you have to solve puzzles to escape rooms.  The puzzles are of the \"touch this switch to open the wall to grab the key\" variety.  The retro graphical style reminds me of some early arcade games, and fits well with the gameplay.  I'm not a huge fan of the current trend of making everything look 8-bit, but it feels appropriate for this game.\n \nThere's not a lot of depth to be found here.  Your goat can move, jump, double jump, and ram things.  Early on you befriend a mouse who can climb walls and (on some levels) switch places with you.  Each room is a single non-scrolling screen, with switches placed here and there.  Sometimes there is a correct order you need to press the switches, in order to open the right wall to give you access to the next switch.  Sometimes you'll need your mouse companion to hold down one switch while you jump over to the next one, or you'll have to send the mouse through small openings to trigger switches you can't reach.  On some levels you face fire-throwing wizards, deadly traps, and other obstacles.  These hinderances can be exploited in your favor; for example, a well-dodged fireball can destroy a crate that was blocking your way. \n \nThe level design is great.  As a casual gamer I found the difficulty level to be just about right, though some of the levels took more than a few tries to figure out.  You usually have a choice of levels to play, so if you get stuck, you can always try a different set of levels for a while.  The game was designed to work best with a controller, but I used a keyboard and had no trouble.\n\nBottom line:  Escape Goat is not very involving, or very pretty, but it's a fun time-waster.", "timestamp_created": 1400303198, "timestamp_updated": 1400303198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10041475": {"recommendationid": "10041475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110860427", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473441798}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Me diverti muito jogando este jogo e pegando todas as suas conquistas, e espero pegar a insignia do jogo um dia.", "timestamp_created": 1399440964, "timestamp_updated": 1399440964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10028183": {"recommendationid": "10028183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041984970", "num_games_owned": 757, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1399306537}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu de plateforme/r\u00e9flexion \u00e0 l'ancienne (autant pour les graphismes que pour la difficult\u00e9) qui poss\u00e8de un charme ind\u00e9niable.

[KAMGUSTA's REVIEW][/b]\n\nI was not really expecting much from this game and instead I found a little gem! Do not let you scare by the ancient graphic, the character (a goat!) is controlled with pixel precision, the animations are smooth and the game doesn't really need any improvements: it works and looks great as it is.\n\nThe aim of the game is to find the exit of the level and then the exit of the entire evil dungeon! Every room provides you a different hindrance and so you will have to prove your skills in platforming, puzzle solving and timing! A friendly rat and some kind sheeps will enlight your way... The difficulty is average, letting you progress nicely in the game, but then skyrocketing on the very last levels, forcing you to make more than one rage quit!\n\nThe translation surprised me, too.

You see, most of what you actually do in Escape Goat is trigger switches, wary of their consequences, which typically involve all manner of blocks and platforms and electric arcs and explosives changing positions in ways that are necessary for completing the room but will also kill you if you haven't planned things out properly.\n\nWhat I find so wonderful is that all of these things that change do so along tracks and pulleys and cogs that animate throughout the background.  Blocks do not merely shift into new positions but rather travel to them believably and in concert with other moving pieces.  This is hardly necessary to the gameplay, but it creates an aesthetic experience that transports me behind the eyes of a child seeing a trip passage in a fireplace or a hidden compartment under a stair for the first time\u2014every time.  I sometimes find myself triggering switches without cause, only to study the resulting machinations.  It just sparks my imagination, one of those uncategorizable details of videogames that make them a delight uniquely to you.\n\nWill you agree with my feelings?

Now I enjoy these, but I spent an entire afternoon in them and only made 30% progress. I'll probably never beat them all. The platforming needs to be perfect, with perfect jumps and perfect timing. You'll die 20+ times figuring out just one jump, then 20+ times on the next, etc., until you figure out the level. Then add in another 100+ deaths since you'll just plain screw up plenty of times. Death is low-frustration because you respawn in 2 seconds, and the music keeps playing without resetting. The music is very catchy and keeps me motivated. But low-frustration over 200+ deaths starts to accumulate into real frustration. :p\n\nSo the bonus levels aren't for everyone.

You play as a purple goat with strikingly green horns and golden eyes.

Like many NES era games this is a title of few words, yet it does not need to say much for you to grow fond of this unconventional hero and push onward to rescue your trapped friends and escape the magical prison.\n\nThere are lots of good things to say about Escape Goat, but what really stands out are its incredibly tight controls, innovatively moderate to challenging puzzles, and a strong soundtrack that pulls it all together. You will find yourself ducking traps, avoiding pitfalls, dodging spinning blades, leaping over chasms, and avoiding the reaper's deadly burning gaze. The physics are simple and straight forward. Its easy to understand how each object works, but in combination they can make the room you were in become something completely different and reveal new paths and dangers.\n\nWith a dash that resembles a head-butt, the ability to double jump, and the unlikely companionship of a mouse, you will quickly find yourself solving puzzles and navigating tricky terrain with the ease and surefootedness of your mountain-faring kin. Afterwords if you are still feeling brave and want to really stretch your legs to see what you can do, then maybe its time to delve into the more difficult 'All Intensive Purposes' campaign.

Dime a dozen, right? But look past that and what you have is a nearly flawless game. It never uses it's retro stylings as an excuse for bad design - like Doom, it feels like a game that not only lives up to modern standards but will have aged very well ten years from now.\n\nThe one-room level design is consistently clever and always uses it's different pieces in new and unexpected ways. The instant respawn means it's rarely frustrating, it's moderately challenging but easy to understand your many mistakes, and the controls are strong enough that 99% of your deaths are your fault.\n\nOn top of that, the soundtrack is catchy and memorable and even the sound design is very well done - the chime when you collect a key, for example, is so satisfying that I can hear it while I'm typing this. And although the graphics are simple, they'll grow on you as very charming in their own right - it looks so much better than most retro-styled games that the HD graphics in EG2 almost feel like a step down.\n\nIt's not perfect, of course. If you prefer games that last for dozens of hours, the basic game lasts only a few -  just long enough that it largely avoids getting gimmicky or repetitive. There are achievements, a set of obscenely brutal bonus levels, and custom level sets that can keep you playing for a long while, but none of them really live up to the original game.\n\nSome of the levels are also less clever than others, particularly some of those in The Endless Machine that fall into the trap of trial and error puzzle design. Others rely far too much on reflexes, which doesn't suit this game particularly well - although the controls work well, your goat isn't really built for twitch platforming.\n\nBut, really, those are minor problems. When the game is great, it makes you remember why you fell in love with the genre in the first place  - and it's that great for nearly every minute you spend with it.

The music and sound are enjoyable. The graphics remind me of 16-bit-era PC games, and I think they look great. The game controls well on an X360 controller (didn't test keyboard).\n\nThis game is really very elegant. There are only a few things you can do: double jump, rush, and teleport (if you have the hat), and the mouse can do a handful of things by himself as he runs around. Similarly, the level design only uses a few elements to pull together some interesting and tough puzzles. The game isn't terribly hard (unless you play the bonus content), but it makes you earn your prison escape, and it feels satisfying when you do. I'm probably going to keep playing a bit longer to get a few more of the achievements that I missed the first time.\n\nThis game is a solid puzzle platformer, and if that sounds like something you enjoy, pick up Escape Goat.

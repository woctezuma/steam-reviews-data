The game itself focused completely on the buillet hell genre, but taking a kind of unique turn on the enemies and 'ships' that you are to shoot your enemies down with.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nFor me, bullet hell seems to be a over used and repetitve genre that lacks user progression and gets repetitve rather quickly. Not saying that Champions of Breakfast is a 'perfect' bullet hell game, but it does cover a few areas that some other bullet hell games don't.  I am sure most of you reading this are famailar with the bullet hell genre of gaming. This game really does fit well in a sort of weird and unique way. First thing to note is all of your 'ships' are now machines that you use to make breakfast with, and your enemies are bottles, paintings, paint, toilets, sofa and bascially any other furnature that you can think of. Your objective is simple. Destory all furniture, Why? Well that's the thing, the game doesn't really set up a reason for you doing so, which isn't exactly suprising because most bullet hell games don't.\n\nWith the enemies that you encounter in various places in the house and outside, all of them will do different attacks that you should probably want to remember so that you are ready for what they are about to do. (Taking out the bosses that you reach mid-way and at the end of a area for the time being, I will talk about them after) Here is a select few unique attacks that some of the enemies do: small bullets, large bullets, throws paint on the ground, spray, bouncing bullets and so many more that you will encounter as your progress through the game. With that, and the way that they are placed makes it even more difficult as they will crowd you making it very difficult to be able to dodge bullets.\n\nNow going onto the bosses that you will encounter twice through one course. The bosses are obviously way more difficult than the average enemies that you will find before encountering the boss. These bosses have special attacks that normal enemies don't have, and some of them are so over powered. With each of them having their own, shall we say, bullet style making them all unique and very different from one another. Some of the bosses include: sofa, toilet, toolbox, drain pipe and many more. Some of these bosses have a shield of some description which protects them from getting hit. In order to get rid of this sheild you will have to kill the enemies that they spawn in. Yet another unique and clever idea that seperates this from other bullet hell games. Sometimes this can be a bit tricky, and making you repeat the game over and over which could be a drawback for those who are new to the bullet hell genre of gaming.\n\nThe game is laid out in stages, each stage having two bosses and their own set of enemies that will only appear in that specific area. Upon completing each area and killing the boss, you will be granted with a choice of powerups that can help you along your journey and trust me, you're going to need it. Other special abilities are only temporary but will give you a short boost of more bullets or a spread attack. There has obviously been a lot of thought and care that has gone into this game.\n\nThe graphics of this game are plain and simple. The enemies are noticable, meaning that you will be able to tell which of them you have to shoot. The game also has this nice warning sign everytime that enemies will appear on screen to avoid any cheap deaths throughout the game. The different types of bullets is rather impressive, most of the enemies have their own sort of bullet that makes it different from others that are also attacking you. As for your bullets, it's clearly noticable which are your and which are the enemies.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Unique selection of breakfast machinary\n+ Unique enemies \n+ Each enemy has it's own attack\n+ Enemies laid out to make the game more challenging\n+ Challenging bosses, each having their own unique 'bullet style'\n+ Many areas to complete\n+ Plain and simple graphics, warning signs to avoid cheap deaths\n+ Steam Trading cards and achievements\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Gets repetitve if your not used to the bullet hell genre\n- No story or real purpose to kill, but who really cares\n\n[h1]Result / Final Thoughts[/h1]\nI think that the developers really did well with this game. It really does balance fun and difficult together nicely to make the game enjoyable and not feel like the game is just focusing purely upon difficulty. The enemies and bosses that you encounter all have their own unique attacks and bullets. There are some nice special abilities that you can aquire to make the game a bit easier on yourself. I would definatly recommened this game, especially if you love the bullet hell genre!\n\n[b]Rating: 8.9/10[/b]\n\n[quote]For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LotsOGiveaways]Lot's O Giveaway's[/url] curator group [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LotsOGiveaways#curation]here[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1462250241, "timestamp_updated": 1462250650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552257", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22682388": {"recommendationid": "22682388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277984478", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499053845}, "language": "english", "review": "OK!

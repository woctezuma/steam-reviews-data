The game plays in four waves per room. Each wave has several enemies and when you get down to the last enemy there's always an object in the room to eat and spit at the last foe. There's no way to digest the enemies. Completing every few rooms will send you to the next theme. Swamp goes to ice, goes to something else, goes to the spooky haunted realm and then the game loops to the beginning.\n\nThe art is great and fits with an 8-bit style, the soundtrack is barely noticeable. Controls are easy to master, left, right, tongue and jump. There is even controller support which is always a plus. \n\nThe tongue mechanic is simple, it will extend out and return. If it catches an enemy it returns instantly. Using the tongue in mid air will freeze Handsome Mr. Toad hovering until the tongue returns. You can keep using it and just stay in the air. Its a good mechanic even with its flaws. Sometimes I managed to catch an enemy behind me while extending the tongue in the opposite direction.\n\nAfter a few enemies get disposed of and fall into the drink, bubbles with collectables appear and float up. These collectables are 1-ups, treats that result in points and hot tamales. These hot tamales let you spit a single burst of three fireballs that bounce around objects and melt through enemies. Its a fun addition to an already good tongue mechanic.\n\nYour foes get into the room by in from ceiling holes. When they walk off screen a new enemy spawns to take its place. You however can run laps around the environment. Go out the left side of the screen and appear on the right. There is a bit of a safe spot as you can completely disappear from the screen.\n\nEach theme has two different enemies: The swamp has birds that run at you and gators that move forward at a slow pace. The ice theme has penguins that dive at you and something a bit slower. In the aquatic realm, octopi will shower you with water that can push you out of the way as well as kongs that run about. The spooky haunted realm has bone throwing skeletons and ghosts that can go through solid objects. The diversity keeps the entertainment factor up.\n\nSome of the rooms feel a bit unfair as some have no safe spots to stand from quick dropping enemies. Well you can always stand off to the side between the left and right of the screen. Other rooms are well designed and make things easier. Each theme has a mixed bag of rooms from easy to challenging.\n\nWith everything said about the game, I encountered two issues. The first is that the game starts in full screen mode and for a lot of people this results in a black screen. It did this on my PC, but my laptop was fine.  The other major issue is the game froze for me. It happened once in twenty minutes of playing. This forced me to control, alt, delete my way out.

It is a single screen, two dimensional, platforming game. In this game, you play through wave after wave of various enemy types on each stage. There are a few stages in each world. The worlds have different settings, including the basic starting world, an icy world, a horror world, and a world with water hazards. The gameplay consists of jumping and eating enemies as an attack. You are a frog and use your tongue to grab enemies and spit them at other enemies to destroy them both. To clear a wave of enemies you must defeat them all. You also have a box or two to help you out as you can throw that at enemies as well. The controls are simple, just jump button, eat button, pause, and movement, and it can be played well with keyboard or Steam Controller setups. There are items like extra lives, points powerups, and a chili pepper that lets you shoot fire. You also have a leaderboards system to see your online rank. One of the best parts of this game is collecting hats for Mr. Frog. The hats appear randomly in game, and once restarted you can choose one to wear throughout the gameplay. The game is a lot of fun, just like an arcade game, it kept me coming back to it on a weekly basis but usually for short plays at a time. I definitely recommend it to fans of the arcade classics.", "timestamp_created": 1480161516, "timestamp_updated": 1480161516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Its developer, Cowboy Color, was the team behind [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/401840/]ChargeShot[/url], so it's no surprise that this game looks and plays so well. The premise of the game is that you are the titular handsome frog whose hat has been stolen by thieving animals, and you go on a vengeful rampage. It's pretty great.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but fluid. You can grab onto enemies or blocks with your long tongue and then launch them into others to knock them out. The game spans across 4 different worlds with 3 levels each, drawing from a pool of randomized room designs. Each world has 2 types of different enemies with separate behaviors, giving you a new challenge to adapt to as you progress. Along the way, you can pick up items in bubbles to increase your score, spit fireballs, or even unlock cute hats! Getting hit once will knock you out, but you start with 10 lives that can be replenished through pickups, so the game feels forgiving. All of this helps the game feel fast and fun.\n\nThe look of the game clearly draws from a retro aesthetic, but it's so charming that it stands apart from other indie games that use the gimmick. Most importantly, all of the art is clear and easy to read. You can always find yourself on the screen, and all of the enemies and items are easy to spot. The sound design is also hilarious. Mr. Frog always sounds like a robot with a sore throat when he talks. On death, I swear he sounds like he's saying \"Donald Trump\". I'm not kidding. Plus, you're playing along to sweet, catchy tunes. It sounds like you're playing on an old arcade machine; it's such a great [url=https://zbwmusic.bandcamp.com/releases]soundtrack[/url].\n\nAll in all, I love this game. The controls feel tight and responsive, and it's easy to pick up and learn. Others might feel like it's too simple, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's a great game to pick up and play, and it's easily addictive enough to keep you entertained for as long as you want to be. Besides, anybody who'd give a negative review to this game is probably a killjoy, anyway. The game is well worth its $0.99 asking price, and I definitely got what I wanted out of it. #worthit\n\n[h1]TL; DR[/h1]\nFor fans of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/212800/]Super Crate Box[/url], [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/]Downwell[/url], and [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/315110/]Woah Dave![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1471216846, "timestamp_updated": 1471216846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545657", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24921343": {"recommendationid": "24921343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208160216", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489126770}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is adorable and fun, especially with the frog hat on frog action! You jump, slurp, and spit at an unending assault of enemies much like old school arcade games, with the exception of: 10 lives at start, can gain additional lives occasionally at each level's end. Each enemy has a different method of killing you, and later levels combine random enemies to further increase difficulty. The music is a smattering of peppy chip tunes, with cute touches of Mr. Frog going 'yum' when grabbing bubbles, 'rib' when he slurps, and 'bit' when he spits (although I'm still wondering what he says when he dies). The graphics are fitting and dynamic (although I'll miss being squished by a platform in the itchio version). The controls could be more fluid. Keyboard X for jumping, Z for tongue. You can only attack with Z. I made the mistake of trying to jump on enemies like a Mario when I first played. As mentioned in another review, once he jumps, he cannot reverse direction to spit the other way, although if timed right he can slurp an enemy right behind or above him. Also, there is no pause button and he only has one height of jumping. Still, this really fits the aesthetic of playing a ruthless arcade game!\n\nOther minor notes: Silly hats!

Has that nice retro feel, and is simple enough to pick up or put down whenever you have free time. Props to the devs for the frog literally croaking when he dies. And the ribbit sounds, oh my!\n\nOne of very few games on the quirker side that does not go too overboard with quirk. He's just a handsome frog makin' his way through some doors. Nothing too in your face, no intense visual or audible noise. All in all the game is just a pleasant experience. Good for cooling off. While I, personally, would prefer if there were some way to take 2 hits before you lose a life, the 10 lives you're given from the start are actually very forgiving (especially of course if you're just playing to cool off. I've yet to get past the second area so I really can't talk about the grand scheme of things here.)\n\nThe game of course, has its flaws. Aerial movement feels quite odd, though I suppose it acts the way it does as tribute to older games which made you really commit to jumps more (so if you're into that kind of thing, its really a plus!), where as now'a'days most people in video games have the aerial movement of some kind of helicopter jetplane hybrid.  A lot of the time the aerial movement just kills the experience for me, literally and figuratively. I think its the combination of low aerial mobility and the fact that using your only means of attack freezes you in mid-air. Leaves you open for quite a while. Perhaps I'm just taking too ballsy an approach to the game though, and it isn't quite as fast paced as I'm trying to make it.\n\nThis by no means though completely ruins the game, it is merely frustrating.

From the quick yet implicit little tutorial at the startup that teaches you how to jump and move to the adorable Ribs and Bits of the titular frog gulping and spitting various objects out, Handsome Mr. Frog brings a lot of character to the indie game community. My personal favorite details are the beads of sweat that pour off of the character after he eats a chili pepper and the squishiness of his body as he bumps against the ceilings and lands on the ground.\n\nThe 8-bit soundtrack is extremely well done and great to hum along to, as well as being inexpensive to purchase along with the game! Shouts out to @zbwmusic for influencing me to buy a video game OST!\n\nThe integrated Steam leaderboards help add to the addicting and competitive replay value of this game!\n\nGet this game, or lose all hopes of becoming handsome", "timestamp_created": 1470701121, "timestamp_updated": 1470701404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593440", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24785497": {"recommendationid": "24785497", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999969896", "num_games_owned": 881, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478406024}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game.

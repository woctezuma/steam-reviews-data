I see something promising under all of it, I really do, but after completing all of the songs and bosses on normal, I'm just left feeling very unsatisfied.\n\nFirst and perhaps foremost, I think the soundtrack is awful.  Not the songs themselves, many of them are decent and they're certainly popular tracks in their genre (which consist mostly of dubstep, some feelings of house, things like that) but holding my control stick in a direction to a grinding bass tone is just not exciting.  Rarely did I ever feel like I was interacting with the music.  I could mute the sound and probably play the game just as well as I did with the music.\n\nAlong with that, the core gameplay is just not fun to me.  That may be in part to the whole \"glowing blue to a bass tone\" bit, but again the interactions with the music consisted solely of firing on like... the 16th note before the beat of the measure, which was honestly just really kind of annoying, especially since they explained it very, very poorly in the tutorial.  The shooting itself revolved around scrolling a large circle around to lock-on to enemies and pulling the trigger.  It's as shallow as it sounds, really.\n\nThe environments and aesthetics are just... dull.  There's this vaguely low-poly sci-fi universe with plenty of glowing lights, and 90% of what you see is just brown and gray dodecahedrons?  Is it to help the large, bright blue glowing line to stick out?  I just feel there's a lot of missed potential here, especially considering the change in pace with one level that has these crushing traps timed to the music.  They're pretty similar in color but they hold a different look.\n\nAs a music and rhythm game enthusiast, I'm just left bored at the end of the day.

It has obvious elements of Rez with the lock and shoot, though this calls for some conscious timing to maximise returns on it. Others might try the ribbon mechanic and feel nostalgia for Gitaroo Man, or dodge obstacles in the tunnels and think of Star Fox - but it's not just an homage, this game makes these mechanics its own and maybe even surpasses all three... When I got into stage 7 I was dancing in my seat with tears of joy while playing because I couldn't believe someone nailed the fun, look, sound, etc all at once like that, and I wasn't even through the game yet!\n\nIt's the clearest case of \"want to call it an homage, but it's too original in the way it does everything.\" It really takes the best parts of the games it almost surely borrows from, and it seems to just give you what you'd want from all of them. I can't believe it myself, but if you ask me about it, I'll rave about this game. It works.\n\nSoundtrack is heavy on the dubstep and glitchhop end of the spectrum - some would want to avoid that, but I think it fits great and makes a lot of sense for the mechanics. The sound of each song varies a fair bit within that broad umbrella and they're not only well curated but surprisingly well known.\n\nI have some issues at times with the incoming missiles - they're very visible, but if there are other things in the area, I can sweep and shoot and sweep and shoot and still never get the lock to lock onto them, so losing a ship is inevitable. I've saved replays and watched myself track over the same missile 3 times to no effect. This gets worse at higher difficulties where the screen will very soon start filling with them, and to compound it, you can't shoot anything down while you're blown up, so you can come back just in time to blow up again. It can all be solved with the right approach, but it can be tricky.\n\nStill, this is the kind of game you won't even find every several years, if even in a decade. The fans of this type of thing are probably already interested, so all I can suggest is don't sit on the fence or pass it up - if you're wondering about it, go for it!

Idk, and community mapping if possible!-\n\n\nNow for one that I think should be brought  to attention to anyone who achievement hunts this game like I did.\n\n            To get all secrets, you must have your top play be the one that unlocks all in a level, so if you get ALL secrets but lower score, you have too retry it. I find this VERY inconvienient because if you don't go for secrets WITH top scores to begin with, it takes HEAPS of time to get a new top score with them (if you get high ac % on your non-secret run, that is)\nA work around for this is doing the song on a lower diff, but you MUST know where they are if you intend on doing it this way as the leniency for acc is alot lower and you can easily top yourself without realizing.\n\n              All in all, I'd recommend this game ANY day of the week to rhythm gamers, it's fun, it's challenging, and it's a nice change of pace in rhythm gaming compared to the bigs like Osu!, Guitar Hero (or Clone Hero), and Step Mania, and the Pros REALLY outweigh the negatives, most of mine are just nit-picky but they should be known.

I didn't know much about it beforehand and had expected it to be a rhythm game.  I even went back and read the Steam store description for the game, and in fact nowhere does it suggest Aaero is a rhythm game.  Although the music plays a major role in Aaero, it's first and foremost a twin-stick rail shooter. \n\nThere is no apparent story at all.  It's all about the action here.  You pilot a small ship through through fifteen stages.  Along the way you fight an assortment of enemies and huge bosses while trying to trace an illuminated ribbon of light as accurately as possible.  There isn't much more to it than that, the basic idea is fairly simple.\n\nMotion is restricted within a circular space.  One stick controls the ship and the other stick controls the aiming reticle.  Enemies are attacked by moving the reticle over them to lock on and them by pressing a button to fire homing shots at them.  There is a rhythm based shot timing that determines how fast your missiles fly but I didn't see any discernible visual cue for it.  If you can pull it off, it's a great way to increase your damage output as well as your score.  As far as I could tell, it was the only mechanic of the game that directly involved timing with the music.  I suspect someone more musically inclined would do a better job than I did, but I was able to make it through the normal and advanced difficulties without being particularly skilled at the shot timing.  The majority of enemy attacks are avoided by shooting down their missiles rather than dodging out of the way.  In other words you can't manually dodge them, once a shot is fired it must be countered with your own fire.  This was a little strange for me at first because I desperately wanted to fly out of the way but was unable. \n\nThe stages have a variety of environments and themes, but most notably each one is accompanied by a licensed music track. Mad Fellows managed to curate an outstanding soundtrack.  Although it isn't the type of rhythm game where you spend each song constantly tapping buttons to the beat, everything in Aaero is designed around the music.  The shape and flow of the light ribbons and even individual enemy placement meshes well with each song.  Unfortunately, there was one thing that didn't seem as well thought out. In some stages the enemies, their shots, your own lock on notifications, and the enemy proximity warning are all colored red.  It all can blend together and sometimes I failed to shoot down one enemy missiles in a volley that I thought I had a complete lock on.  Perhaps it was just my eyesight or inexperience, but it did leave me wondering why they couldn't have used a few extra colors.\n\nOnce I became relatively proficient at the game it felt great to fly to hug the ribbon while simultaneously battling foes.  And I really do mean that it felt great, Aaero makes awesome use of controller rumble.  The rumble intensity is even adjustable for those that don't like their gamepad shaking.  It took me a little under two hours to clear normal mode for the first time, which some people will no doubt consider to be a short playtime.  Individuals only playing to finish the tracks once on normal may end up disappointed by the low playtime.  Aaero is clearly a game that's intended to be played multiple times and eventually on higher difficulty levels to attain mastery and compete on the leaderboards.  I enjoyed Aaero and would recommend it to fans of Rez and to people looking for a rail shooter rather than a more traditional rhythm game.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review?

The track progresses with the soundtrack and you have to complete elements in the song to progress.\n\nleft analog follows the musical ribbons (blue lines), right stick + right trigger is to aim and fire against the scurge of enemies. Every single thing in this game, is on time with the beat. and i mean EVERYTHING. scenery, enemies, ribbons, doors, pistons, walls, debris. EV-ER-Y-THING. This meticulous design from Mad Fellows is top notch. and puts this game on one of my all time favourite Rhythm games, nay all time favourites PERIOD.\n\nThis game is low poly art style, its beautiful and the sound track is amazing, with talks about expanding the song line up it will only get bigger and better.\nI, myself post a lot of content aimed to help you all in the community and I will endevour to do so. the community around this game, the Devs (Paul and Dan) have been phenominal. \n\nNow, the bad, (theres only a few)\nthe tutorial seems to catch a few people out, its very basic, and does get you going, but for more advanced techniques are missed off. this is why people struggle with the timing aspect of this game. theres a few issues with non conformity resolutions, like ultra widescreen, but I think for the most part that has been resolved now.\nThis is a huge thing for you on pc, but it IS controller required, dont buy it, then moan cause you cant play with your keyboard. it CANT be done. I only list it as a negative, because I would also like to see a traditional input method, but Im happy to play with controller.\nThere is also a solution to get Steam controllers working for those using that over Dual Analog so check the discussions!\n\nTL;DR WUBTracks, follow ribbons in a spaceship like some deranged olypmic sport and short various animals in a bizarre cleansing. 11/10 Would always, always, always recommend to any fan of rhythm, and even those new to the genre 100% of the time.", "timestamp_created": 1494952610, "timestamp_updated": 1494952729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31777599": {"recommendationid": "31777599", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966072008", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494961762}, "language": "english", "review": "I played Aaero lots of times at industry shows over the last year or so and have been following it in the press; as you'd expect, the released version is just that bit more polished and solid than the version I played at shows and it hasn't disappointed at all.\n\nI've been waiting for a music driven game to come along which impressed me the way SEGA's REZ did when I first played it, on the Dreamcast back in the day - and this is the first one since REZ that's hit the mark; in fact I go further and say that the 1st level of REZ was the high point of the game from the point of view of how the gameplay meshed with the music and Aaero maintains that level of synergy between gamepay and music the whole way through.\n\nWhen I get in the zone with a track I find start deliberately changing the tempo & timings of my lock-ons and shots so that they fit into and work with the music in ways that make my ears happy - it's very satisfying when you manage to perfectly time your gameplay input so that it feels like you're actively contributing to the sound of the music.\n\nReally enjoying it - definitely improved by having some dangerous speakers or good quality headphones hooked up to your PC...", "timestamp_created": 1494887811, "timestamp_updated": 1494887811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31773402": {"recommendationid": "31773402", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975454735", "num_games_owned": 1654, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "last_played": 1515277655}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun mix of rail shooter and rhythm game, plays a bit like Starfox meets Guitar Hero.

"playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492214611}, "language": "english", "review": "Aaero is a beautiful hybrid of a rhythm game and on-rails shooting that shines brightest in its 3 boss battles. \n\n\n== VISUALS\n\nHeavily inspired from  the early rhythm game days of FreQuency, Amplitude, and REZ, the low-polygon models look stunning in HD, especially when coupled with the particle effects. Color plays a large part in the portrayal of their environments and reinforces the digital playground you navigate through. EDM fans will feel right at home as this visual style is often used in music videos for Drum & Bass, Dubstep, Future Funk, etc.\n\nThe levels seem to \"breathe\" with the music, which is great feedback and a trip to play while high. \n\n\n== AUDIO\n\nThe licensed soundtrack of Noisia, Flux Pavillion, Habstrakt & Megalodon, and more is one of the reasons this game was so successful. While it is still possible to have a great rhythm game without the licensing (a-la FreQuency), it really helps when selling the game to a skeptical audience. \n\nThe audio mastering was very well done in this game and is slightly different than the official track releases by the artists, giving each song a fresh feel that worked for each of the game's levels (even if you've heard these songs before). \n\n\n== MECHANICS\n\nJust like the visuals, the mechanics feel like an homage to early rhythm games with a fresh spin on their execution. The controls are tight but forgiving, so players who aren't accustomed to rhythm games won't be instantly turned off to it. The game can sometimes feel like a brain-teaser, having to move the controller's analog sticks clockwise and counter-clockwise (and at the same time), but in a way that encourages practice and mastery rather than frustration. \n\nAll of the games actions are performed on beat to the song, whether or not you perform them on the beat yourself. This all helps the player stay on beat or find the beat if they tend to lose their way while enhancing the player's engagement. \n\n\n== SCORING\n\nThe game's scoring system is a nice blend of intense but non-intrusive, allowing players who don't care about scoring big to complete the levels without worrying about how well they're doing. For those looking to climb the leaderboards, however, the game does a great job of providing depth by rewarding precision movement and timing. If none of this really interests you, there's always \"Chillout\" mode, which forgoes the scoring altogether. There's definitely something here for everyone. \n\n\n== BOSS BATTLES\n\nAmazing. Brilliantly crafted. The boss battles are where Aaero really shows how innovative it is. The bosses movements and attacks are all timed with the music, and even the levels themselves fit in perfectly with how the boss is tackled. If Shadow of the Colossus was a music game, this is how it would be done. \n\nMy only gripe with the game is that the entirety of the game wasn't just a collection of boss battles past the first boss. The way the music really ties into the feel of the boss designs was also a great feeling, and made defeating the bosses that much more satisfying.  \n\n\n== CRITICISMS\n\nThe first criticism I have with the game is that the difficulty progression doesn't always flow nicely, especially when you have to beat the songs in order. The song, \"Edge of Tomorrow\" was the biggest culprit of this, where the mechanics felt like the song should have been placed down further into the game. \n\nThe screen size scaling was also an issue (at least for me). Running on a 21:9 monitor, I scaled the game size to 100% (the default is 80%, and it made some parts of the game almost unplayable at times as the enemies and projectiles I was trying to destroy were often outside of the shooting range. From videos I've seen of other people playing, this didn't seem to be a problem, so I'm assuming it wasn't a \"feature\" but a bug, though I can't be sure. Either way, it was frustrating. \n\nThe music ribbon (the line you have your ship follow to the beat) patterns were also fairly basic. This is fine on normal mode, as the entire Normal playthrough seemed like a tutorial run, but these basic patterns also continued into Advanced mode as well, meaning the difficulty curve didn't stretch too far. \n\n\n== FINAL THOUGHTS\n\nSome people will criticize this game for not being \"strictly\" a rhyhtm game and including a shooting aspect, but I feel as though they are ignoring the fact that the combat is directly tied to the music and rhythm as well. As I said before, every detail of this game is tied to rhythm, it just might not be apparent at first. The combination of the shooting and timing your movements might just be the gateway for people to see the draw to rhythm games in the future. \n\nHighly recommended. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1492308702, "timestamp_updated": 1492308702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31168411": {"recommendationid": "31168411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269463052", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492365099}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si tenes las manos de un bebe de 4 a\u00f1os te dan ganas de suicidarte por lo malo que sos, pero johnny sins aprueba esto", "timestamp_created": 1492306724, "timestamp_updated": 1492306724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31167338": {"recommendationid": "31167338", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960583962", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492371515}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little rhythm game with a cool OST, bright visuals, and a simple but effective gameplay style.\nHeartily recommended if you're into the kind of music this game has to offer.

I'm not sure if there actually was a difficulty change between Advanced and Master, other than only having 1 life in the latter, but to achieve a competitive score at the Advanced level, it is necessary to stay alive the whole time anyway.\n\nAs a rhythm game, one of the most important aspects are the controls, and Aaero really shines in this department. Controls are tight and responsive, and easy to learn. When something goes wrong, you know that it's your fault, and this helps make sure that failing to complete a level or achieve a certain score feels like your own fault, and not one inherent to the game.\n\nThe soundtrack chosen for the game is excellent - a fine selection of music in the vein of dubstep, electronic, drum and bass etc. Following the ribbons of light will add layers to the music, and every sound effect in the game - target locking beeps, weapon impacts, enemy spawns and so on - is quantised to the beat of the rhythm, achieving a state where the game is as much a part of the music as the music is the game.\n\nThe shooting aspect is simple enough to understand, and has a little more depth to it than first seems. Attacks will always land on the 1st or 3rd beats of every 4/4 bar, and you are rewarded for hitting these exactly on time - in attack efficiency, as well as score. Understanding this mechanic is crucial, but skipped over in the game's tutorial, which can lead to some amount of frustration when your shots seem inconsistent.\n\nWhen these two main mechanics are combined, Aaero comes to life as a fantastic rhythm rail shooter in the long-empty void of Rez. A lack of content will disappoint the most dedicated and skilled players, but in spite of that, Aaero is not an experience to be missed.\n", "timestamp_created": 1492283622, "timestamp_updated": 1492283622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702772", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31159154": {"recommendationid": "31159154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188120431", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492272206}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6709\u723d\u5230", "timestamp_created": 1492271245, "timestamp_updated": 1492271245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31158381": {"recommendationid": "31158381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364244180", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495184229}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u7535\u97f3\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u624b\u67c4\u3002\u5f00\u59cb\u6296M\u4e4b\u65c5\uff0c\u6211\u88ab\u8650\u60e8\u4e86\uff0c\u5c0f\u4f19\u4f34\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\u554a\uff01\u73b0\u572838\u7279\u4ef7\u4e70\u4e0d\u4e86\u5403\u4e8f\uff0c\u4e70\u4e0d\u4e86\u4e0a\u5f53\u3002ps;\u8fd9\u662f\u624b\u67c4\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u73b0\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u9f20\u6807\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1492269015, "timestamp_updated": 1492269015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31154922": {"recommendationid": "31154922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015035094", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515221063}, "language": "english", "review": "Although the Devs haven't said this in their marketing. you can tell where they took some insperation from.

Controls are accurate and tight and the music is licensed from artists such as Flux Pavillion and Katy B. If electronic, bass-heavy songs don't fit your musical taste then you're not going to enjoy Aaero's soundtrack, although there is no denying how those distinct beats help Aaero's gameplay thrive.\n\nThe game has two gameplay loops: ribbon tracing and shooting. The shooting segments have some minor issues but ultimately the gameplay is super satisfying. Transitioning from a shooting segment to a tracing segment as a song transitions from a verse to a chorus feels great. Boss fights are chucked in every 5th level which gives the shooting segments a more grandiose feeling; there was one moment within the first boss fight (that I won't spoil) where something happened that facilitated a transition into a tracing segment, and that moment made me realise how much I love this game.\n\nWith 15 songs / levels available, I was ultimately left wanting more. Harder difficulties and re-playing songs to compete on the global leaderboard was a great way to extend the game's content - but I would have liked more unique levels. Having said that, licensing songs as an indie studio would be difficult or expensive, so I understand there is a limitation there.\n\nI would most certainly recommend this game. It now sits on a list of great rhythm games that I will continue to revisit when I want to scratch that particular itch.\n\nFor full review - http://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2017/04/aaero/", "timestamp_created": 1491952634, "timestamp_updated": 1491952634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490620", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31086067": {"recommendationid": "31086067", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995622352", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515188364}, "language": "english", "review": "This game gave me a headache I actually enjoyed", "timestamp_created": 1491945476, "timestamp_updated": 1491945476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438162", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31085720": {"recommendationid": "31085720", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969467117", "num_games_owned": 648, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515181824}, "language": "english", "review": "Rez meets Panzer Dragoon - awesome soundtrack.

Rhythm games are on my list of top favs and this one is worth it. It has its challenges, sometimes you might want to throw the controller at the screen. That moment when you beat the level after all that hard work is so very satisfying.\n\nThere's four seperate modes, Normal (Easy) , Advanced (Hard), Master (Extra Hard), and Chillout (Practice). I like the Practice mode as it gives you unlimited lives so you can work on timing and what not. Unfortuanly, the practice mode only lets you run the Moderate courses and not higher. \n\nStaying on the rail as perfect as you can builds up your multiplier. If you stay off it for too long, you lose that multiplier and possibly even lose a shield. There are enemies you have to shoot on the beat to also build up that score. Some enemies will fly away, and other will case you down after a very short amount of time. Some enemies will shoot bullets at you, so you'll have to focus your attention on those [i]before[/i] you take down the badies. I won't lie. It's a bit difficult. I have raged more times than I can count.\n\nThis is the kind of music I listen to on a daily basis so hearing it with a game makes it rather enjoyable. I hope maybe there will be more releases in the future.

The problematic aiming from the right analogue stick while trying to line up on the track is unnecessarily difficult and really ruins the experience for me.\n\nSorry Mad Fellow, you did well in 2015 but you added a feature that wasn't needed and ruined the game.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to the devs for responding, it's a nice change to find a dev that cares! I was using a Steam Controller which also made the shooting feel awful because of the trackpad and not really being able to smoothly glide over the enemies, after trying it with an Xbox 360 controller it feels more fluid, it does still take the player out of the action a bit but not as bad as with a Steam Controller.", "timestamp_created": 1491937548, "timestamp_updated": 1511554046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487323", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31083380": {"recommendationid": "31083380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364336916", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 9534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 476, "last_played": 1515691329}, "language": "english", "review": "I backed this on Kickstarter as it looked quite special and wanted it to come to PC.

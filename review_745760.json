I will say this flat out. Most are just slap some anime boob pics together, string them together with words and bam done collect your reward. But I had an immediate interest to this game when I saw the artstyle  and dialogue that felt like actual dialogue in the preview pictures. Because it's free I had no qualms to download it and have no regrets of doing so.\n\nI only played through the Jill Count scenario which is a small time streamer going to a haunted place to hopefully get more views during the spoopy season. Her dialogue and voice direction were perfect, I have to say. Her side profile did look a bit odd and make her look like a different person . There were a couple other character voices that were a bit offputting but eh it's fine. \n\nThe art itself imposes a nice unique style to the game as a whole and has some amazing effects added on in later scenarios for spoops. It's a refreshing reprieve to have something visually unlike any other. I found myself scanning each new scenario over to admire the art while the story was read to me by some good VAs.\n\nAs I said though I'm not much for VNs so not sure what to critique asides from dialogue, art and voice acting.

I feel there could be more spooks, but understandably that would be better for later games (since it's clear the story has only just begun!).

Some minor bugs of course, like, you click and nothing's happening, kind of embarassing in fast fps game, but, wow, everything in this game is awesome, from gameplay to game design. I was expecting for a Heretic-like, but it's way more psychedelic, maybe too much dynamic lights, but a great visual experience, almost near from El Shaddai (another great psychedelic game) with a kind of quake/heretic gameplay, very strange weapons and pnj, but very playable. Can't wait for the final release. \nLevel design is great, very intuitive, you will not search your way for hours like in 89% of old school fps, maybe a little bit more easy once again ? But I like this kind of game, a lot of ammo everywhere, health etc. Maybe keep this generosity but add more PNJ ?\nCrossing my finger for multiplayer mode but not sure it will happens. Anyway, even with only solo mode I'm really happy to have bought this one. Just waiting for more arenas + scoreboards + final and epic solo mode.\nSPOILER: the second boss looks like a martian gelly shit.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1521750953, "timestamp_updated": 1521750953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40978697": {"recommendationid": "40978697", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977848675", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 537, "last_played": 1521744726}, "language": "english", "review": "92/100\n\nAmid Evil might just be the pinnacle -for now- of the retro FPS reneissance we are experiencing.", "timestamp_created": 1521741310, "timestamp_updated": 1521741310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40969352": {"recommendationid": "40969352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017904244", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "last_played": 1521180204}, "language": "english", "review": "when you get full soul gauge and spin the axe into the entire map worth of enemies\nbuckets of cum", "timestamp_created": 1521699389, "timestamp_updated": 1521699389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40953062": {"recommendationid": "40953062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148723875", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 149, "last_played": 1521277033}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is fantastic in everyway but the AI.

A quality game through and through, a dedicated team of developers, and not -just- a rehash of old games, AMID EVIL kicks it oldschool, while also understanding that our expectations for our games have evolved somewhat over the years.\n\nThe level design in the campaign can occasionally be confusing, but is always top-notch in not only the function of providing a play area to explore and fight in, but also in looking beautiful in its detail, and hiding its secrets well enough to keep you in each stage a little longer hunting for areas and rooms you might have missed.\n\nWhen you tire of the campaign (which is already long enough to provide several hours of entertainment, with more chapters in the works during this Early Access period) you can take a break seeing what kind of a score you can rack up in the wave-based endless survival mode.. a relatively simple, but fun way to enjoy some pure combat.\n\nThere is a fine variety of weapons, each with their own purpose in combat situations.. there's even one that flings planets at your enemies to deal explosive damage.  Commit genocide by using the earth itself to destroy a rock golem!  Collect enough souls from your fallen enemies to activate extra-powerful attacks until you run out of energy... my only wish is that perhaps you could choose when to unleash your soul energy, rather than it happening automatically the next time you fire any weapon.\n\nThe game may look like Hexen or Heretic on the surface, with its magic-based weapons.. but if I were to compare the actual feeling of playing and controling the character, as well as the hub-style of navigating the difficulty options and chapters, I would compare this most to Quake 1, but maybe a little slower.  No complaints here, it plays wonderfully!\n\nAnyway, if you're on the fence about this game, consider this my recommendation to take the plunge.  If you don't like Early Access, and expect to have the full campaign when you purchase the game, wishlist it for now, and check back later.  Either way, it's definitely worth keeping an eye on this one if you like a nice action-packed FPS with oldschool roots.", "timestamp_created": 1521515170, "timestamp_updated": 1521515170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500731", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40928687": {"recommendationid": "40928687", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975346572", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 159, "last_played": 1521588193}, "language": "english", "review": "Where DUSK quenched my thirst for Blood (heh), Amid Evil has quenched my thirst for a more modern take on the Heretic style of gameplay.

A disciple of the \"shooting on rollerblades\" speed of classic FPS's, Amid Evil is almost jarringly fast paced, but is far from unweildly.  Even in the most crowded fights, I felt that I had significant agency and control.  The weapons are similarly fine tuned and exceedingly creative.  If you don't grin ear-to-ear when impaling enemies to a wall with a crystalline mace or blowing them to bits with a literal projectile planet (you read that correctly), I don't want to be your friend.\n\nThe visuals tow a fine line between the pixelized standard of yore and the enhanced lighting and shading effects offered by the Unreal engine.  The results are difficult to describe and absolutely stunning in motion.  More than once, I had to stop and gaze at my technicolor surroundings - something I can't say about most games with more realistic fare.  The level design itself is an innovative mix of the first Unreal's saturated color pallete, Doom's alien aesthetic, and Quake's gothic architecture.  It truly melds into something unique and appealing.  Similarly, the music hits precisely the right chords (no pun intended) for those who remember the games of that age.\n\nThis is my first review on Steam, and I couldnt think of a more appropriate game for which to write it.  Amid Evil is important in the current game climate and deserves your support.  You will not regret purchasing this.  I appreciate a good narrative as much as the next gamer, but game developers really need to take a good, hard look at gameplay and atmosphere again.

Good level architecture with some secrets and great atmosphere (awesome music). Each Episode has it's own world and setting. The Weapons are simple but useful like in the old days and that's what i like so much. By the way when the Player is getting a new weapon he laughes like \"Corvus\", a Sidhe Elve and the main Character of \"Heretic\". This is so cool. Now we need a world map between the levels for each episode like it was in Doom1 and Heretic and the game is perfect ;-p\n\nThe pixelated graphics looks so good and like in the old days it's a major influence for the great and mystical game atmosphere. For Example the Style of the World in Amid Evil (first episode) reminds me of the Water Palaces in Heretic (Episode 3) and there are so many more hints and links honoring the old games. The gameplay is a real fast \"run and gun\" gameplay, or should i say \"run and sorcery\" ;-)\n\nFor all those who want to play an oldschool shooter with great atmosphere, sorcery wands instead of firearms and liked the old games heretic and quake, this is the one to go. \n\nGet it now, this game is awesome!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1521208301, "timestamp_updated": 1521320777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40848349": {"recommendationid": "40848349", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996919612", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 415, "last_played": 1521715230}, "language": "english", "review": "EARLY ACCESS REVIEW: 3-16-18\n4.1 hours in\nCompleted each episode on HARD in 3 hours. Completing them again in EVIL.\n---\n\nEasily the best Heretic sequel we will ever get (Heretic II sucks, deal with it).\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nForced retro graphics on UE4 looks nice and runs well on GTX 1060. Weapons are skinned VERY NICELY (loving the Celestial Claw!) Only caveat is some textures look really bland and repetitive.\n\nLevel design: 7/10\nThe level design seems too focused on small skirmishes, which kinda breaks the action on some parts. Still fun, but could be better by adding more action on large areas. Maps can seem barren at times. Also, worldbuilding by blocks quickly loses its novelty after a few minutes.\n\nClever design on the difficulty select, though - finding the EVIL difficulty is pretty good, although there are secrets still being constructed by developers...\n\nWeapons: 9/10\nThe weapons are not only original - THEY'RE ACTUALLY FUN AND USEFUL. Depsite the ammo-sharing, you'll find uses for the weapons in most situations, and you'll find yourself switching more often. The Celestial Claw holds a place in my heart (blow up the earth for lols), as well as the Star of Torment (spiky mace thingy that launches spikes that impale enemies to walls). The game even has a Painkiller-esque souls that you collect to enter Soul Mode, which will power up your weapons for a short time (akin to Heretic's Tome of Power). The only reason it's not getting 10 points is the Trident thingy is... kind of useless really. And the BFG thingy. But other than that, it's golden!\n\nMovement: 10/10\nIt's fast. It's furious. It's got options to change your FOV, strafe tilting and movement bobbing. Most importantly you can rocket jump. With freakin planets, as one reviewer pointed out.\n\nVerdict: \nSolid 8.5/10 overall\nBuy full price, and watch for updates!", "timestamp_created": 1521206172, "timestamp_updated": 1521206444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40842239": {"recommendationid": "40842239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131845361", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 846, "last_played": 1521325649}, "language": "english", "review": "game gud", "timestamp_created": 1521176793, "timestamp_updated": 1521176793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500731", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40842217": {"recommendationid": "40842217", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990971266", "num_games_owned": 812, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 108, "last_played": 1520903428}, "language": "english", "review": "Sexy level design.

Crazy weapons, spectacular levels, lots of enemies.  A call back to FPS classic run-and-gun that's polished and precise.\n\nWhat this game is is kind of a Hexen/Heretic fusion, completely retro (even in some of the look), with some modern polish and a bit of a plot.  It delivers exactly what it says it does, so if that interests you, then go for it.  If you want more detail, read further.\n\nThe game follows the classic formula:\n* Enter areas from a hub.\n* Battle through assorted enemies.\n* Find assorted weapons, powerups.\n* Kill more enemies.\n* Find secrets.\n* Now and then fight a boss.\n\nIn addition, there's a \"Soul Power\" mechanic.  You collect enemy souls and with enough you power up and temporarily your weapons all work differently.  Keep killing enemies and you keep going.\n\nPlus on top of all of this there's a horde mode.  For more enemy-bashing.\n\nFor an Early Access game, AmidEvil clearly delivers -hearkening back decades ago, at this time there's 3 full areas to explore so you can experience the game.  It's pretty well polished, and the devs are open to feedback.\n\nBy now you know if it's for you, so there's not much else to say, but I'll add a few issues:\n* Targeting mode seems a bit iffy right now, and it needs some improvement.\n* Occasional clipping/environment issues.\n* The weapons are neat, but I feel like they need one or two more, just to really round it out.\n\nMinor complaints, really.

There's also a staff that shoot homing projecticles, a bad a** starting AXE which can if you aim it right one shot weaker enemies by taking their heads off completetly which feels pretty satisfying and a couple of other surprises that you'll get to enjoy.\n\nThe game has a similar soul mechanic like from Painkiller, when you kill someone you get to pick up their soul, when you max out your soul meter all your weapons do increase damaged and get some cool new properties be it making some weapons get ricochet shots or in the planet launcher's case, it starts shooting suns at enemies. Only annoyance about this mechanic is the same annoyance Painkiller had, as soon as you max out the soul bar, the first shot you fire activates it so sometimes you might find yourself activating it at a time where there might be no enemies or very few left making it kinda go to waste, however activating it at the right time such as a boss fight can turn a boss into a complete joke which is probably why the developer doesn't let us simply have it be a seperate button to activate it.\n\nSo far the three chapters offered in the game are good with the first one being my favorite for now, each chapter offers a completetly unique environment,design and new enemies with new aesthetics designs that fit with each chapter. The developer put a good amount of effort of making each chapter feel very different which is great, however the enemies for an example don't feel all that different between chapters and the A.I. code for them is mostly to just run at a straight line towards you at a very fast speed and that's about it, even the range enemies will usually just keep slowly approaching you as they're shooting untill they get into close range to hit you, it's thus far about the only more major weakness of the game.\n\nI love the art style in the game, it's really darn unique i have to say. It does an odd and very visually pleasing combination of old and new type of graphics which gives the game a very strong visual identity to make it stand out from other games.\n\nOverall i'm enjoying it quiet a bit and made me quiet happy to play even more old school fps games made in the current year, it's not finished yet as its i believe suppose to have 7 chapters and atm there's only 3, still i strongly recommend picking it up for any fans of old school shooters who grew up with games like quake,heretic and duke 3d, you won't regret it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1521128590, "timestamp_updated": 1521128590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505910", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40830695": {"recommendationid": "40830695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323218877", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 428, "last_played": 1521741034}, "language": "german", "review": "Amid Evil- Or you axed for it.

From superficial things like gold and silver keys and the difficult/level select hub, to a lot of the level design and a few of the subtlties about how combat plays out. And really, 'like quake' is about as high a praise as you can give an FPS.\n\nReally though, there's a lot of unique stuff in here. I'm not a huge fan of just listing off features in a review but some of the weapons in this are just great. Stuff like the sword, which is one of the few genuinely new in function weapons I've seen in an FPS in a long time. It seems like just a simple projectile at first, and somewhat underpowered, but once you realise that it still does most of its damage while passing through just fine when it grazes enemies you wind up trying to line up shots in a bunch of unique ways. The rest of the weapons are generally more generic, but pretty fun and unique from an aesthetic standpoint, like the shotgun/painkiller-stake-gun crossover that is the mace, or the BFG which shoots black holes in soul mode.\n\nOn the topic of soul mode, it's another of those things lots of people seem to be misunderstanding quite a lot. I hear a lot of people complaining that you can't save it for when you need it, but that's *exactly* what make it great; it's something you get really regularly, often enough that you don't need to save it, and forcing you to use it ensures it's common and gets you chasing down rushed, long lasting chains of it with stupid amounts of destruction as you blow through enemies.\n\nAlso I told the dev to make the spinning axe propel you through water as a meme and he actually did it, 10/10 best modern 3D fantasy shooter I've played.

Chunky polygonal levels and enemies with low-res textures, paired with current-gen lighting techniques to make for a fantastic atmosphere in every sense of the word. The game also has sprite weapons that are normal-mapped to give them a feeling of depth while still evoking that classic Heretic feel. And they're pretty fucking awesome in concept, too. The Celestial Claw is basically a rocket launcher, but instead of rockets it uses planets plucked out of the multiverse and shrunk down into projectiles. That's METAL AS FUCK. \n\nTLDR Very very good retro FPS that hits all the marks.

At this point I've played through two episodes on AMID EVIL (max) difficulty. Some big positive points:\n\n+ Fantastic level design, I haven't seen such well designed levels since the good old days of doom/quake/duke nukem/unreal. The levels from the first two episodes feel like a mix of Heretic and Quake. The secrets in them are also really good, not too easy to find, but also not impossible if you look for them. The level design is arguably one of the best things about the game, for me at least.\n\n+ Great sounds, not kidding, really impressed with every single sound in this game. Very powerful sounds in general, but not to the point that they become overwhelming. Along with this, also really good music, similar in mood to Heretic but then slightly heavier.\n\n+ The general feel. Movement and scale-wise the game feels great, it's fun to hop around. The weapons generally feel good, especially the crystal mace thing is very satisfying to use. The ambience feels fantastic, mainly thanks to the above two points.\n\n+ Balance. If you use one weapon too much, you'll definitely run out of the type of mana that it needs at some point (also making you unable to use the other weapons that use that type of mana), so there's not an abundance of resources in the level to the point where it becomes trivial. Additionally, it seems that each weapon seems to have a specific use case, though some are slightly less frequently useful than others.\n\n+ Some of the enemy designs are very cool, though I also have some gripes here.\n\n+ Stability and performance is great, no problems here whatsoever. Configurability also seems just fine, I was able to tweak the game to my liking in  terms of sensitivities, FOV, crosshair, video settings, etc\n\n\nThere are some small things that I somewhat dislike though:\n\n- Somewhat simplistic in mechanics, compared to the older games at least. There's no inventory system and no armor. Heretic for instance had some very interesting inventory items that were fun to use, likewise with some of the other shooters. The \"mega\" items here also somewhat disappointing so far. The weapon arsenal, although really quite fun, also feels a bit limited, would love to see more weapons at some point (but not too many of course). All in all it feels that some depth is lost compared to those games.\n\n- It's annoying that the weapon powerup gets triggered by weapon fire, several times I had been forced to activate it because I wanted to shoot a shootable button. It also kinda prevents you from having fun with destroying the environment (statues etc), because you'd trigger it then, but this is a very minor issue of course.\n\n- Some of the enemies ruin the combat a bit, such as the very fast melee ones that home in on you and can attack from some very weird angles through the sharp turns they make (e.g. they walk off a staircase and then immediately zip towards you). The main problem here is that I would love to just pull out the axe and smack them in their face, but the axe doesn't seem to have much of an impact if you don't soften them up first, and they will ALWAYS hit you if you even attempt to do melee, so it's better to just +back and kill them like that, which is frankly a very boring thing to do. Some sort of stun effect from the axe would help here, I would love it if the axe became a bit more fun to use, I use it whenever possible/feasible (final blow, etc). Maybe I'm just a bit spoiled by the melee combat that was in the new shadow warrior games (1 and 2)\n\n- Not sure if it's just me, but the game feels a bit easy on the maximum difficulty (AMID EVIL difficulty). As long as you keep the melee enemies at range, there's basically no problem in dealing with all of them. The only difficulty arises from moving/anticipating things wrongly and getting cornered, or eating too many enemy projectiles, or getting cheeky and trying some melee which always gets punished.. Along with this the first boss is ridiculously easy, since he's so slow and barely shoots anything (seems to have a single attack), but I guess this is alright for a first boss anyway. But to put this differently: The game feels alright for me on this difficulty level on a first try, while in my opinion there should be even harder difficulty options for when one gets accustomed to the game.\n\n- The directional sound is frankly quite bad, but so far directional sound has been an issue in many of the UE4 games, including UT4 pre alpha itself, so I'm not sure if this is something that the game does wrong or an engine issue. I do have to say that pinpointing where some enemy sound comes from is difficult if they are nearby, especially if they are below you. But I think this is fixable.\n\n\nI have to stress that these are VERY minor gripes though, compared to the things I like about the game. The game is a GEM, anybody that's a fan of the legendary old school shooters (in particular quake and heretic) should definitely give it a try, and even if you do not know these games, you're in for one hell of a treat with this game if you like fast paced first-person shooters.

Smooth aesthetic, keeping in tune with the era of gameplay, and thoughtfully designed levels with good amounts of awe and exploration to be had. Slick movement and maneuvering with a fun, but limited variety of weapons, managing the soul power is a nice twist on the formula, though I wish we had an abillity to delay the activation of it. Running into a red switch with full soul power sucks!\n\nA few minor complaints would be a lack of enemies that really shake things up on arrival. I'm only 4h into the game, but even on the hardest difficulty the game seems to lack a bit of the \"teeth\" because no enemy ever appears that I truly dread facing.

Level design follows cues from Quake 1, with plenty of fancy walkways and arches, large cathedrals, and the various catacombs of said cathedrals.\n\nAs for combat, AMID EVIL actually draws some inspiration from the title Painkiller. As you kill enemies, you'll absorb their souls. After enough souls are consumed, the next time you attack, you'll engage in a \"SOUL POWER\" mode. This lasts for a decent amount of time, and each weapon acts differently during it. The default Staff that usually shoots a few bolts of energy here and there suddenly becomes more menacing than the Plasma Gun from DOOM. The Trident makes dudes explode in about a second of sustained fire. The planet launcher (it's hard to explain) now launches suns.\n\nThe game promises 7 episodes, and the one I've completed contained 5 maps, with the fifth being a boss fight.

It's an amazing game in every way except for one.. The graphics. I am not nostalgic for Quake like graphics, and I only wished it had modern graphics. \n\nLooks like New Blood Interactive heard my (and many others') cry.. They made Amid Evil. And it looks amazing. Not exactly in its graphics per se, but the environments look epic and the lighting is top notch. Some areas that I came across made me go wow. What's more? It plays even better than it looks.\n\nThe movement is awesome as well. It feels like it has weight, while at the same time you're moving at high speed. The weapons feel meaty as well and satisfying to fire (or cast). \n\nAmid Evil has the 'collecting souls' mechanic, like you did in Painkiller. Once you fill up the meter, you turn invincible (technically) for a small period of time. You do take damage during the time, but your weapons get a huge buff, so you could quickly delete any enemies in front of you.\n\nThe levels are huge and superbly lit, and have that 'hardcore game' feel.  You're never sure  what could be next, as you feel like you're falling deeper and deeper into a pit  (sometimes you do so literally). \n\nOverall it is shaping up to be one of the best games I've ever played already. It feels great, looks great artistically, and sounds great too. Mustn't forget to give props to Andrew Hulshult for the music. If you like Dusk, you're going to want to play this.

We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play

For example - certain enemies are really nasty if they get up close, and knowing that there's a place you can skitter back to and strafe them will make the difference between taking a hit or not.\n\nThe level design is amazing. The starting zone has portals for easy, medium, and hard difficulty - which are respectively easy, medium, and hard to get to. There's a harder than hard evil difficulty that you have to find if hard isn't hard enough. It only gets better from there. The ambient sights and sounds are fun to look over (I spent a bit on the first level standing at a high point that looked over where I started the level), and puzzles that require some spatial memory and reasoning to figure out. And there's just enough ammo to do self-imposed challenges like one-weapon only runs or no-health runs if you're really looking for a challenge. And hunting secret areas is another thing you can do - there's a nice counter in the tab menu, one that's usually telling me I'm missing one or two secret areas despite hunting for the better part of an hour. \n\nIt kind of handles like a faster Deathmatch Classic from pre-Steam days. Unrealistic fantasy weapons like a sword that shoots ranged slices through the air, or a literal planet-launcher that you can rocketjump (planetjump?) with. An axe that essentially turns into a blender if you use it during soul mode aka \"all your weapons are supercharged\" mode. The axe is the only non-ranged weapon, and if you want to use it you're gonna need some pretty good reflexes.\n\nThere are a few shortcomings - I've only made it through the first half dozen levels, but the AI seems easy to game. Certain places will get enemies stuck, or they'll flip out and be easy pickings. Some parts of the terrain are glitchy - which sucks if you're running backwards and get your foot stuck on what seems like an invisible hole. And maybe it's a personal preference but some weapons just aren't practical given that they share ammo with another weapon (though they are fun).\n\nBut seriously, in all this is a great game if you like running around blasting things that rush up trying to cut off your face, with some puzzles and platforming mixed in. Using a whisper's edge to counter a sword blast from a baddie is very satisfying - and using soul mode to power up your weapons and blast everything is fun - lots of power, but you still take damage and can die if you forget your mortality.\n\nHighly recommended.

FPS lovers in general will enjoy this for sure, as it brings up the best in the genre while working in that original Quake-age taste. Be warned, though: graphics are not realistic, game-like choices will surely appear down your way and skills needed to go through are quite different than those required for modern FPS (No cover, no reloads, just plain old run, shoot and strafe... And mind your step, lest you fall to your death!). It floats my boat. How about you?\n\n\nThat being said, let's give out some details.\n\nLike many players around here, I'm a huge fan of Heretic/Hexen series. For me, it was the best fantasy FPS experience to date, by far. It goes without saying, then, that I've been eager to see more of this game right here (this being the main reason for the sudden purchase at early access).\n\nAnd I gotta tell you, I've got that nostalgic feeling by playing my very first minutes of this one. It's been a while since I last took on a FPS, and I'm quite rusty, but still, this immediately reminded me of the good old days of demon slaying back at the cursed docks of Heretic. \n\nControls are very fluid and mechanics are spot-on to me. Character movement flows well within the map, with responsive inputs and a satisfying shooting experience. Weapons are a pleasure to use so far, and the map is well-structured, ready to host secrets of all sorts, rewarding exploration and allowing for a lot of loops as you hunt for keys and slay sentinels of at least four distinct kinds. \n\nThe graphics are perfect for the approach the devs have in mind, taking me all the way back to the good old Quake days. There's a filter applied over it (or at least that was my impression) that made the image a bit granulous, giving it an interesting 'vintage' aspect. Another thing that I have to mention is the font of choice for the menus, screaming 'Iron Maiden' as soon as I booted the game! That's very refined and adds yet another nostalgic tone to the experience. \n\nMusic is very good, arranged to match the environment. At some point it made me feel as if trudging around the water levels from Heretic once more, with a primal, yet subtle, tune in the back to match the pace. \n\n|'ll be playing more of this as time allows and I'll be sure to update this thread, as well as the video feed back at the channel!\n\nTHREE-HOUR UPDATE: So far I've crossed a few maps and went through a boss battle. The game seems well-balanced, with maps that unfold in an elegant way. A true stimulus to exploration and memorable encounters, as the topography contributes to strategy-building and secret-finding. Dialogue between dev and player through hints is well defined, granting a number of ways to work the maps around.\n\nThe only issue I found is a recurring stuck enemy by the third level IIRC. Something minor and honestly to be expected at EA. \n\nSTILL Totally worth it! \n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1520913126, "timestamp_updated": 1521047563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40778885": {"recommendationid": "40778885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007146188", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1520912251}, "language": "english", "review": "Snagged a key for this back in November-ish.

Just wow, this game is excellent. I've been only 1 hour in so far, but I can already tell, that this game will definitely be added into my collection of favourite first person shooters! \nThe level design is nicely done, not linear, but also not open enough for you to get lost and roam around the level for good five minutes before you find where to go next. The enviroments and overall graphic style look really nice and provides really unique atmosphere, together with all the sounds and amazing soundtrack. I also enjoyed a bit of the story here and there. It's not something very important for most people who will buy this game, and for me, it also wasn't, but somehow, it made me want to know more about the world I am currently in and get to know the culture of all those enemies I am fighting against. Speaking of enemies, I really liked the design of all of those I met so far, and also enjoyed their aggresive AI, which is really well done, even though the levels are usually consisting of multiple floors and stuff lying on the ground, I never noticed any of these enemies get stuck, so whoever programmed the AI, good job! And the last thing I want to talk about are of course the weapons. There are currently seven of them, each of them has it's use and each of them feels really unique and fun to play with. They also have their OP alternative fire mode, which triggers after you collect enough souls from enemies (nice tribute to painkiller). \nSo, to sum it up, for current 15\u20ac price, it's a must have game, for every old-school FPS fan like me, especially for those, who enjoyed playing Heretic and Hexen.

The weapons all feel great to use with my personal favorite being the mace that impales enemies to walls in a similar manor to painkiller's stake launcher. The levels and gameplay are well made and offer a decent challenge especially on higher difficulties. The graphics are also very pleasing to look at and have low requirments to run at a decent framerate. Amid Evil also has next to no bugs from what I have seen by playing.

And if you really wanted to redraw them, why not redraw them totally, instead of badly tracing some of the dynamic characters? The Stone Guards and Arno in particular look horrid.

You find the original review in the comments; hope you still agree, it's helpful.\n\nStill not even worth a cent for nostalgic reasons. At least here.\n\nIt has it's charm and it's fun to play, if it could be played. Several of the 12 puzzles have bugs known since release. Some of them make the game simply not enjoyable, like graphical issues, or the infamous mirror machine bug, up to unplayable, when the game f.e. generates an unsovable puzzles in Bubble Wonder Abyss, or doesn\u2019t alter the reflections properly in the mirror machine.\n\nFurthermore, occasionally players reported their game simply won't start at all, none of whom ever stated if the the issue could be resolved or not though. In the case of corrupted save files, which also still happen, and making the game unplayable, the community manager at least posted a workaround solution. [1] It's no proper fix, but as the save game is written into the registry, it may help getting the game running again. \n\nBy now chances of a fix for any bugs are zero. While there are some very dim signs of some people actually still work on the game, it seems likely, that the Steam version was abandoned, right after the Amazon Kindle version, afaik. The only update for the Steam version released in March 2016, while the Windows Store version [2], the itunes version [3] and the Android version received more updates, the latter even until January 2017 [4, 8].\n\nOther requests wont get any reply as well, like adding the sound effects for movement from the original. The \"foot sounds\", as someone informed me, apparently even were in the game at some point during development and taken out because \u201ein scenes where multiple Zoombinis were moving it resulted in a cacophony\u201c [5]. They opted to remove them, instead of polishing the game before release; this sums up the overall impression of the game.\n\nOr adding the other languages, in which the original game \u2013 French and German - was available. Contrary to what I wrote a few month ago, the game in it\u2019s current state could only easily support several languages on written only level. For the audio files the game would currently indeed need different branches, which would come with different Unity assets archives, in which the files with voice lines would match the choosen language. Now it may be like that the game can't support multiple languages itself, but the effort it would take to create those other .assets-files is basically swapping out about 150 .wav-files [6]. Not much work at all, as some more knowledgeable gamers informed me. While my assumption of a support of multiple languages in game was incorrect, its falsiness gets undermined by the little effort it would take to give us French and German voices - so a bit given, a bit taken.\n\nTo sum it up, the devs and the publisher of this game currently... well, follow the sales and their work. The Steam version didn\u2019t really sold great so far. [7] And furthermore, the Android and iOs versions seem to be the ones, they used for their research project, which includes the Zoombini game. [8] Without great earnings, and no way to utilize Steam for their work as well, it's no wonder why they ditched the support of this version so quickly.\n\nIf you going to buy it, don't do it here. Here it probably will stay buggy till eternity.\n\n[1] http://steamcommunity.com/app/397430/discussions/0/1290691308573770308/\n[2] At least I guess the vaguely promise in this Facebook post is directed at Windows Store Users, since here wasn't any update \u2018little later\u2018 - or any update at all. https://de-de.facebook.com/ZoombinisGame/posts/589176631266630 \n[3] Updated: 20 December 2016; Version: 1.0.5 - https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/zoombinis/id961739806?mt=8\n[4] Updated: 11.

Given how fantastic an edu-tainment game the original was, you'd think that all that and more would make this game the superior version. In my opinion...\n\n...it's not...\n\n...or at least it isn't yet.\n\nProbably the most noticable change to people who played the original game is the redesign of the Zoombinis themselves, as well as that of the backgrounds. All of the backgrounds have been redrawn, and overall, they look really cool! As for the Zoombinis have more of a horizontal oval shape as opposed to the original egg shape, and their features have been redrawn to look either better, or completely different. I think they look pretty cute this way, and it would be a great change if they blended in with everyone else! Although the Zoombinis have been redesigned, every other character in the game has been ripped from the original and they had their pixels smoothed out. Even though the nostalgia factor from this is nice, they feel very out of place when viewed next to the Zoombinis, especially considering that they didn't even bother to give the characters any new frames of animation to make them look smoother. In fact, in some cases, it appears the animation has gotten worse! In the original game's puzzle with the frogs, the frogs had very neat authentic looking hopping animations. In this version, their animations have been dumbed down so that they just kinda move to each lilypad.\n\nI'll spare you the other aesthetic errors I've found as they are relatively minor. honestly, my biggest complaint is that this version is actually very glitchy. I've run into puzzles where I'd let go of the mouse and my Zoombini would just hang in the air, forcing me to leave it behind and ruining my perfect runs. As far as I can tell, the game is just a port of the original with new graphics. How did they manage to screw that up? To be fair, it's been a long time since I've played the original, so it could have been just as glitchy as this game is, butit doesn't make it any less frustrating. if the original did have the glitches, then this would have been a great opprotunity to fix them.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, I really didn't regret getting this version of the game that much. Again, at it's heart, it's the original game with really good new/revamped graphics. All of the puzzles are the same as before and all of the great voice acting from the narrator to the pizza trolls is still there. If you haven't played the original and wanna give it a shot, this is probably a good way to do it! I give the game an 8/10.\n\nIn conclusion...\n\nHip hip!

As an adult, I still love the logic puzzles it presents to the player; it's still a challenge no matter how old you are.  When I heard about the Kickstarter campaign to bring this game to the modern era, I immediately got on board, and I'm glad I did.\n\nThe goal of the game is to bring groups of creatures called Zoombinis to their new homeland by navigating through mutiple puzzle levels.  They all involve different types of logical thinking, though they never stray too far from the basic \"trial and error\" approach.  Some involve set theory, multi-dimensional thinking, or recognizing patterns as examples.  They start out simple (and if you're an older player, you may find the first couple difficulty levels tedious because of that), but as you successfully bring groups home, sections will increase in difficulty, and that's when the challenge really kicks in.\n\nIf you've played the original and want to know the differences between that and the remake, the main difference is graphics.  The original 16-bit artwork was great in the DOS era, but that was locked at 320x240 resolution (maybe 640x480, but regardless, it looks really tiny on today's monitors).  The new version is made for bigger screens and the artwork has been totally redone, and it looks gorgeous.  The Zoombini sprites have been updated, though many other in-game sprites are unchanged.  The sound clips are all the same, though some have been shuffled around a bit and others are absent in places I would normally expect to hear them.  It's a bit weird, but if you've never played the original it won't matter to you anyway.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend picking this up.  It's great for kids as well as adults.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: I nominated this game for the 2017 Steam Awards for a category related to games that make you suspend disbelief.

However, if you're able to find the original version of Zoombinis, I would advise you to play that version instead. My gripes with this version are not the game's puzzles (as frustrating as they are), but with the bugs and inconsistencies left in.\n\nI recommend playing this version for its speed and accessibility, though. Except for the intro cutscene starting the game up for the first time, every other scene as well as each level transition can be skipped. The game length is also shorter; it requires only 400 Zoombinis (25 trips total, assuming no lost Zoombinis) instead of the original 625 (about 40 trips, assuming no lost Zoombinis). The sprites have been updated as well as all twelve puzzles and four difficulties.\n\nWhat's problematic (in an annoying way, not game-breaking way) are the technical problems still present. Most of the breaking bugs have been fixed (listed in the forums), but problems like inconsistent hitboxes still exist, such that clicking on one Zoombini ends up on clicking on another; little details omitted due to technical restraints, such as the walking sound effects no longer in-sync and/or present.\n\nPerhaps the worst feature is not only no Cloud Saves (for a Steam game), but trying to back up your save is a chore itself. There are more details in the forums, but it's not as simple as a single file, but something to do with the Registry files. So say your hard drive or such breaks (like mine) and you invested plenty of hours, there's (a lot of) frustration when you find out about this afterwards and then have to start over.\n\nConclusion: The puzzles are still great; even better is the option to practice any level at any difficulty. (I do not recall the original allowing for that.)

I was very happy seeing a remake for modern devices. Finally I can play this game without the trouble of setting up a windows 98 virtual machine... Or can I. While in terms of gameplay I adore the puzzles and couldn't praise the game enough, this remake fails in many areas. If you can't play the original, then try this one when you can. If you still have the old one running, don't bother.\n\nI'll be blunt: I played the original game a lot and while it's nice to see other people will now get to play it, this remake is quite the letdown.\n\nThe Logical Journey of the Zoombinis was beautiful. With carefully drawn animations on top of quality painted backgrounds (in glorious 256 colors), a great soundtrack (of midi files) and lines voiced in multiple languages, the game was a piece of art. The Zoombinis reboot is quite disapointing in comparison. The cartoonish look is charming but animations are terribly choppy, the sound effects glitch and often get cutoff or are simply missing, the backgrounds have much less interactive details and the overall look and feel is a lot less polished. Even if I wasn't comparing it to the original, this games feels unpolished.\n\nThen comes the gameplay. While the original game had ruber-band difficulty where the game would become much harder very quickly for players which never failed, the reboot drags on forever before making things interesting. The ability to create twins has been removed, which caused many issues and balancing concerns in the original. The practice also gets its own button instead of being hidden behind a keyboard shortcut. Good thing they kept it in.\n\nI've faced a couple gameplay bugs so far, but I was playing on Linux with wine back then (which isn't supported by the creators) so I can't blame the developpers for that - but I can blame them for not porting the game to Ubuntu - especially considering the game was released on mobile.

Interactive Environments\nYou can click on the backgrounds for animations. E.g. Clicking on the fire causes 2 sticks to jump out and start a fire.\n\n5.

I remember playing this game on the computers in my third grade classroom whenever it was recess on a rainy day. Zoombinis a puzzle strategy game where you must guide a heard of blue innocent creatures called Zoombinis to a safe haven called Zoombiniville (great name). Each puzzle is a point-and-click as you spend the game thinking about how to apporach each puzzle without putting any of your Zoombinis in harms way. Think of it as a kiddie watered-down version of Lemmings without the stress of keeping track of every single member in your heard. Each puzzle gets more complex as your progress and after carrying one heard all the way to their safe haven you must direct the next group down that same path. To avoid repetition and boredom the game has branching paths  where you can choose the sets of puzzles you want to complete and this makes solving these puzzles more worthwhile. The game is also nice enough to increase the difficulty by the time you've done at least one or two runs of a certain path. There's even a practice mode to help train you on the puzzles that give you some trouble. The game's graphics have also been enhanced from the original game's format. I like how some of backdrops looks like paintbrush strokes. This game can help anyone improve their critical thinking skills if they spend enough time learning the ropes. $15 isn't a bad price, but if possible, wait until the Steam sales for a price cut.

The main reason being that they either A: Hold the players hand through the whole thing, resulting in the player not learning anything. B: Are boring to the point where just playing the game is tedious. Or C: Don't keep a player invested enough to get the most out of the game.\n\nZoombinis however avoids each of these issues. For the first problem I listed, most games feel the need to make the puzzles they provide insultingly easy or outright give the answer to the player, Zommbinis however will only give the player what they need to complete the puzzle and nothing more. Leaving the player to figure things out for themselves.\n\nAs for the second problem, most educational games feature bland enviroments, characters, and very bland music. Zoombinis avoids this by delivering beutiful enviroments that feel alive, characters that have actual personalities, and music that you will remember for years. (I know I did)\n\nAs for the final problem, most educational games don't offer much in terms of variety, often times players are met with the same puzzle over and over again. Zoombinis however avoids this by having each puzzle be different, and even in some puzzles that feel similar to each other like the Allergic Cliffs and the Stone Cold Caves, have something that sets them apart from each other. Not only that but due to the games steady difficulty curve the game stays fresh for far longer than most.\n\nHowever while I will continue to praise this game for being such a masterpiece among educational games, it does have its flaws much like every game.\n\nFor one, the game does become boring after you've saved a couple dozen zoombinis, and some puzzles on the higher difficulties can prove very difficult, even for some adults. However apart from those flaws, everything else is just nit picking.\n\nAll in all, I strongly believe that Zoombinis is one of the finest games for any child and adult. The game is fun and beneficial to children but can provide a welcoming challenge for adults.

In fact, I still have the old CD but unfortunately, it doesn't work on my current laptop. I recommend this game overall because the essence of it and the puzzles are still pretty much the same, and that's what really matters. That is not to say that I don't have a few complaints about this game.\n\nMy most practical complaint is that you now have to click and hold/drag in order to move the Zoombinis around, which is a pain compared to the old version where you could just click to pick up a Zoombini, move it around without holding any buttons, and click again to set the Zoombini down.\n\nAdditionally, the windowed version doesn't fit my screen properly, with the bottom slightly cut off.\n\nI had trouble clicking some of the Zoombinis in the Crystal Caverns in both the windowed and non-windowed versions. It seems to be random at what time and which Zoombinis are hard to pick up. (Also on that level, some of the crystals you can chose from aren't well integrated graphically either. For example, the sneakers stick out. If a crystal is partially behind another crystal, the Zoombini on the back crystal will still show up completely in front of the front crystal, which I guess makes sense since you would want to be able to see the whole Zoombini, but there are far better fixes to that like spacing the crystals apart so they don't overlap in the first place.)\n\nThe new background graphics are absolutely gorgeous (I love the little transition drawings, too, nice touch), and the difference between the style of art for the background and the characters doesn't really bother me. What does bother me is that they aren't integrated well in many spots. For example, in the Stone Cold Caves, the Zoombinis don't follow the path exactly-- like for the top left one, the Zoombinis go halfway off the path for upper part. Even worse, there are some parts where the Zoombinis stick out of the background when they aren't supposed to, like when entering doors in Hotel Dimensia or, more noticeably, when traveling through the Crystal Caverns and not going behind any of the support beams. I'm disappointed that with all the effort put into making the game look nicer, mistakes like this would slip through. Also, the Zoombinis look simply shrunken down for the Titanic Tattoooed Toads in an awkwardly pixellated fashion. The font for the Zoombiniville sign looks rather slapped on and not well integrated either.\n\nMost of the sounds are essentially recycled from the first game since the sounds were fortunately high-quality enough to be used again-- which is great because I loved the sounds for the first game. However, they aren't really improved from the first game; there are still awkward overlaps of some audio clips-- like the first time I visited Hotel Dimensia in this remake, the squirrel talked over herself at one point in her introduction. Even worse, some of the sounds that I loved have been taken out. For example, in Mudball Wall, the sound of the mud being sucked up is gone-- and not even neatly taken out, just awkwardly clipped out to my ears-- as are the sounds of the Zoombinis crash-landing and making cute \"oof\" noises. I would really like all those sounds to be added back in; it's just strange and even discontinuous for only some parts of the mudball making and firing process to make noise but others not to. Additionally, the Mudball Wall sounds now kind of awkwardly overlap when a mudball is being made at the same time that the Zoombinis are being fired over. The only sound I appreciate being gone is the annoying jangling that comes from a spring-footed Zoombini carrying a pizza. (I can't believe pineapples got put in as a topping...)\n\nIt's sad that while Mudball Wall's efficiency was awkwardly increased, nothing was done, as far as I could tell, about Bubblewonder Abyss-- it's still as much of a drag to wait for the Zoombinis to drift across as it was before.\n\nAnyway, the game is still fun overall; if you're new to it, you likely won't even find what I complained about to be a problem since a bunch of them are differences between the original and this version.

The graphics look a bit better and it plays well on the Mac. It also gets difficult rather quickly, despite being what should be a comparatively simple puzzle game. I'm only on the second difficulty in some areas and that's pretty tough. Maybe I just never saw this, but I don't remember there being a specified number of zoombinis you had to rescue from their first home, as in there are like 400, I think, to start with, and every saved bunch decreases that number until, presumably, 0. I remember the part where you can see how many zoombinis you save and there's a limited number you travel with for each journey, but I don't remember it having an end goal of rescuing ALL the zoombinis. I seem to recall it was just an infinite number of them. So I like that change. I don't know what happens when you've rescued them all. Probably just game complete. They also - from what I can recall - added some minor animation in Zoombiniville. As you rescue more zoombinis, you can see buildings appear. More huts show up. I think they also added some brand new buildings.\n\nI have found a bug. The crystal chamber glitches out sometimes - I can't pick up new zoombinis, although I can pick up new crystals and I can move to the next area, leaving behind the zoombinis I haven't tried to help. And even when the whole zoombini side isn't frozen, it's a pain to try and pick them up off the shelf.\n\nI do think that the \"help\" option is kind of silly. I understand the \"help\" of repeating what the narrator says so you can look at it, since that does occasionally give you a clue for what you're doing, but for most of the puzzles it is completely useless. The rock puzzle is essentially just keep guessing until you figure it out.  The hotel puzzle makes no sense whatsoever outside of easy difficulty, and gives you the least margin for learning error of all the puzzles in the game. There are no clues that I can find, whatever the help says about \"you have all the information you need to solve the puzzle\".\n\nThere are a few UI issues. I don't think you can change the difficulty manually, like I remember doing when this was a CD game, which is incredibly frustrating. I like the puzzles outside of the hotel puzzle, and if I could just lower the difficulty for that one to bypass it, I would use that route. As it is, I avoid the route entirely. I also don't see a way to skip through the mini cinematic stuff, like when a zoombini gets knocked off something when you screw up and they recover. You have to wait until they finish moving and whatever interacted with them finishes talking. This is incredibly frustrating on the rock troll puzzle, where you have to sit through dialogue after nearly every single move. There's also no way to know how many tries left you have on the rock troll puzzle. I have yet to lose any of my zoombinis on that, even on the hardest difficulty, so maybe it doesn't matter, but it's one of two puzzles where you can't visually tell how many tries you have left off the bat (the other being the boat puzzle). Tecnhically that's four, but you can learn how many tries you have on the pizza puzzle pretty easily, and the same is true for the other one.\n\nI also have no idea what was behind making a rock troll in a game for Elementary School students say \"move it toots\" to what essentially a blue pebble with legs of some kind. It's the only problematic dialogue I can think of in the game and it is so incredibly random.\n\nOverall it's a nice nostalgia trip. Maybe a nice puzzle game for children.

I still have the CD! I tried to install it on Windows 7 and you can only get so far before the graphics card just errors out and displays everything in inverted colours or worse.\n\nThis remake, while close to what a Zoombinis game ought to be, is not what I had hoped it would be.\n\nWhile the graphics have been updated to a very high degree and the animations have been redrawn etc for all the characters, and allowed for proper resolutions higher than 640 x 480, the charm of that delightful original game has sadly been lost, and that's really what I wanted to see again. It's a shame because the graphical update is simply fantastic, and the inclusion of the ridiculously enthusiastic announcer and other voice and musical content from the original game is spot-on. However, there's just no charm to it any more. \n\nThe Zoombinis themselves move at the pace of a crippled snail - it's become a chore just to watch them move to the next place - and there's no sound for their footsteps like in the original. Zoombinis with feet would have steps, the wheels would make engine noises, springs... spring noises. When they ride the rollercoaster in the crystal caverns, they would yell out 'wahey' or 'yippee' on a successful run, and it just felt so lively and excitable.\n\nThe issue with the charm of the graphical update is that the Zoombinis themselves suffer from the TV Tropes entry \"Conspicuously Light Patch\". This is where, because of their drawn style, they stand out way too much from the beautifully drawn backgrounds, as the obviously only animated figures, whereas in the original, they had lighter outlines and shades to match the background, like they were meant to be there. Here they stand out so much it's almost painful to look at.\n\nWhat's ACTUALLY painful to look at is when the Zoombinis walk over a patch of the background that's actually in the foreground. In the original game, at the Crystal Caverns, it was possible to see the mine-cart Zoombini travel behind the supporting struts of the track. In this release, the characters are always, without fail, on the topmost layer of the foreground. It's particularly noticeable because of the way they stand out so much from the background, too.\n\nThe worst thing about the game is the hotspots. Good luck trying to enter your name on the very first screen of the game. I couldn't until I restarted the game in windowed mode. Perhaps resolution plays into it too. I'm not sure. I just know that you will have issues clicking on certain things.\n\nAt least Mudball Wall survived. ... well, partially. As I said, the Zoombinis' walking speed cripples the pace of the game when you have to wait 20 seconds each for them to get into position. Maybe I'm being nitpicky. The puzzles are sound and, well - puzzling! Especially on the harder difficulties. It's a decent game; I do recommend Zoombinis. But I personally wouldn't recommend this specific remake.

A sa date de sorti en 1996, j'avais 9 ans. Ce f\u00fbt un des rares jeux vid\u00e9o que mes parents ont accept\u00e9 de m'offrir. Ils y voyaient l\u00e0 un moyen ludique d'am\u00e9liorer mes facult\u00e9s d'observation et de logique et de r\u00e9flexion, tout en m'amusant. Et ils n'ont pas eu tort. Y jouer \u00e0 fait parti de ces moments cruciaux qui m'ont fait d\u00e9couvrir et aimer le jeu vid\u00e9o. \n\nLes Zoombinis est petit puzzle game - \u00e9ducatif - qui s'appelait \u00e0 l'origine \"The logical journey of the Zoombinis\". Car oui, comme je l'ai dis, tout sera question de r\u00e9flexion et de logique. \n\nVous commencerez par cr\u00e9er vos Zoombinis. Ils se diff\u00e9rencieront par leur type de cheveux, les yeux, la couleur du nez et leur moyen de d\u00e9placement : pieds, v\u00e9lo, rollers etc... \nEt toute la logique des tableaux sera bas\u00e9e sur les ressemblances et diff\u00e9rences de vos Zoombinis. Except\u00e9s certains mini-jeux comme \"le bon, la brute et le gourmand\" o\u00f9 vous aurez a r\u00e9aliser la bonne pizza, avec les bons ingr\u00e9dients (ahhh, nostalgie). \nLe but du jeu \u00e9tant de faire voyager vos zoombinis jusqu'\u00e0 Zoombiniville, le risque \u00e9tant d'en laisser derri\u00e8re vous, en cas de succ\u00e8s partiel aux puzzle. \nGlogablement, les mini-jeux sont originaux, intelligemment r\u00e9alis\u00e9s et amusants. Vous en profiterez pour faire la rencontre de personnages plus farfelues les uns que les autres ! \n\nVous aurez \u00e9galement le choix de la difficult\u00e9 : de \"not so easy\" \u00e0 \"very very hard\" pour vous entrainer. Dans le mode \"journey\", l'acc\u00e8s aux modes de difficult\u00e9s seront d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9s lorsque vous aurez pu laisser passer suffisamment de zoombinis. \n\nJe regrette seulement qu'il n'y ai pas de version fran\u00e7aise.

Patriarchy/10\n\nReal Review (Video) (No foul language edition!):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbure20r1GU&feature=youtu.be\n\nReal Review (written):\nZoombinis is a game about logical puzzles for most children between the 1st-5th grade area. It's a well-done tool to teach your child about logical problem solving. It's also a great trip down memory lane for former players and man-children such as myself.\n\nFor newcomers:  In the game, you must escort 16 zoombinis at a time through various obstacles. You create these characters yourself or randomly generate them. Their appearance will be used in most of the logical puzzles throughout the game. One thing that might get to some kids on their first few playthroughs is that the game doesn't give a bunch of information on its rules but your child will figure out the jist of how the game works and a bit longer for how each puzzle works. There is also a practice mode for risk-free play and this is a good thing because if you make too many mistakes on one puzzle in the story mode, you will lose zoombini's. Practice mode is a nice system - for children who might have a tougher time with logic puzzles - to get used to each puzzle before tackling them with a full party of their own zoombinis.\n\nFor returning players:\nThis new version of zoombinis should work on any OS you throw at it. I am playing on Windows 10 and I haven't had any issues. The other nice thing is they improved a lot of the original audio files. Music sounds a lot better, although character voice quality remains the same. This version also includes redone backgrounds in a 16:9 resolution which fit right in with the style. A tricky thing to do but they pulled it off. In game achievements and trading cards are also in the gmae as well as captions, spanish subtitles. The game also runs at 60 fps in most areas.\n\nMy only complaint is the lack of resolution options or a proper windowed mode. Clicking off of my monitor (the cursor is not locked to my main like it should be) causes the game to minimize but without my monitor have a flickering black screen so it's this sort-of fullscreen-windoed mode going on.\n\nThis is a great iteration for new players and a nice trip for old ones.

As I grew up, I began to forget about this game. Years went by, then I suddenly remembered, and wondered if I would ever get the chance to play it again. Enter TERC, who have released this remake of the original title, Logical Journey of the Zoombinis (1996).  Yes, this is a game for children, but I so happened to play this game for years as a kid. Due to that, I just had to purchase this title upon immediately seeing it had released. \n\nFrom an adult perspective, the puzzles aren't too challenging, but you may not know what to do straight off the bat. From there, it won't take too long to figure out. If a child is playing this (depending on their age bracket), I'm sure they'll spend a decent amount of time on each puzzle, probably asking for assistance along the way - I know I did when I was younger. Hopefully they'll learn a thing or two along the way. And, if it gets too easy, there are various difficulty settings you can bump the game up to.\n\nThe developers of this remake have kept to the games roots in terms of the audio, with the dialogue, score, and sound effects remaining the same from the original game. It's definitely noticeable, however it's a nice throwback and it adds to the nostalgia. From the visual side of things, the game has received a nice graphical upgrade.\n\nI probably won't play this for lengthy periods of time at once, but I will boot it up for when I want to remember those good times as a kid. I don't remember completing this game as a child, so it'll be nice to go back and achieve that.\n\nThis is a charming and well made remake.

It's basic enough for an eight-year old but has enough foundation and staying power to still be a fun diversion to me two decades later. The difficulty scales up gradually the more Zoombinis you manage to get from start to finish, to the point where things get legitimately REALLY DIFFICULT to solve. Now if only we could get Alien Tales the modern treatment!\n\nAs far as port jobs go, this one seems pretty bang-up at first glance, but the threads start to show under closer scrutiny.\n\n+ Everything's redrawn for HD support while staying pretty faithful to the original.\n+ All the old voices and music clips are there in their 90's low-fi glory.\n+ Seems reasonably well optimized and stable.\n\n~ Newly redrawn scenery has bizarre choices of colour pallette, apparently in the name of making things seem less cheery and more adventurous. Some of them are pretty nice, at least.\n\n- No manual or instructions for any of the games.\n- Apart from the Zoombinis themselves, most of the other character sprites are clearly low-effort traces of the original animation cels.\n- Loads of sound effects missing.\n- Titanic Tattooed Toads, which was already the weakest point of the game, is now drawn out AND lacking almost any animation.\n- Some pretty serious glitches, like difficulty never advancing, not being able to interact with the Zoombinis on Mirror Machine, and Bubblewonder Abyss generating unsolvable layouts.\n- English is the only spoken language available, where the original was typically also available in French and German. This may not be of huge significance to those playing it for nostalgia, but the game was a great incentive as part of a second-language curriculum for children and now that aspect is gone.\n\nThat being said, the underlying framework holds up well and it's a nice nostalgia trip that I would recommend.

I remember playing this in class and loving it, foolish declaring to my teacher that I'd complete it before the term was up. She said I wouldn't and for once she was right. I never completed this game and probably never will. I even bought a copy to play at home after the term was up, had many cracks at it and gave up just as many times. Anyway it's nice to have a version that can be played on modern systems. The updated graphics are beautifully cartoonish, the movement of the Zoombinis is much more fluid. Thankfully the voiceovers of the narrator (Who always reminded me of Basil Fawlty), and the highly memorable characters like the pizza trolls are all the originals. The only change I'm not so fond of is not being able to create two of the same Zoombini anymore, meaning it's more difficult than the original (something I once thought would have been impossible). Still the number of Zoombins you have to rescue has been reduced so I guess it evens itself out a tad. Also, one tiny gripe is that you can no longer move a Zoombini once it's been committed to a move meaning you have to think a bit harder before putting them in place, which isn't a huge problem, I'm just lazy. Also the old and new audio seems to be slightly off balance in certain places but they have done a fantastic job re-doing and in some cases adding background music. Honestly I could waffle on for days about this game, it's actually given me a bit of a nostalgia buzz, but I'll end it with if you're a fan of logic and math puzzle games that can make your brain hurt (don't worry the game does make it up to you with it's charm), or if you've got kids that can manage to put down their smartphone for half an hour every now and then, get this!", "timestamp_created": 1446085763, "timestamp_updated": 1446085763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18736799": {"recommendationid": "18736799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152310294", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475968509}, "language": "english", "review": "MORE TOPPINGS!", "timestamp_created": 1446085744, "timestamp_updated": 1446085744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18736553": {"recommendationid": "18736553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046719931", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514419150}, "language": "english", "review": "As a 6 yr old child this was my favourite game forever with a place in my heart.

As a child I sunk many, many hours into Zoombinis, and it taught me a lot about logic, problem solving and maths, and sparked lifelong interests in those areas - all while I enjoyed myself massively - it was easily one of my favourite games.\n\nThe game is a series of 12 puzzles, each having four difficulty levels that range from simple to teach you the basics up to hard enough to make anyone, child or adult, think a bit. These puzzles are interesting, varied and have really engaging theming, with characters that bring the world to life. There is an overarching plot where the player is helping all the Zoombinis travel across the map to a new home, giving a long-term goal.\n\nThe puzzles teach a variety of skills, all focusing on logic and problem solving, with a little mathematics thrown in. None of them fall into the usual educational game traps (quizzes, etc...), but rather teach by letting the player experiment, learn and apply their understanding in an iterative way - this is the best way to learn, and it is great fun. I never saw the game as 'an educational game' as a child, despite it teaching me a lot.\n\nMost of the puzzles involve sorting the Zoombinis (who are composed from a set of features - hair, eyes, nose, 'feet'), into groups or applying them to situations. For example, the first puzzle gives the player two bridges, each will reject Zoombinis with certain traits (that the other accepts) - the player must work out which traits are allowed on each bridge in order to get all the Zoombinis across. This is a simple start, but as the game goes on, the puzzles become deeper and more complex, with interesting solutions. The game slowly increases the difficulty, teaching the child how to think to solve the puzzles before hitting them with the hard stuff.\n\nThe characters are incredbily entertaining, despite being a puzzle game with little real interaction, the game uses environment, animation and some dialogue to great effect to breathe life into it's characters - the Pizza Trolls are a favourite, and are timelessly entertaining. I still find myself saying 'MORE TOPPINGS' along with Arno.\n\nThis is quite possibly the best game you could buy for a child, and the age range it targets is surprisingly large - the difficulties vary enough to allow children of all ages and abilities to enjoy and learn from it. At it's more difficult settings, this would even make a great alternative to a 'brain training' style game for adults - the puzzles get hard and interesting, no matter the age. This is a great game to play with children, (or for siblings to play together), although it is important to let children try, fail and learn from those failures, rather than pointing out the solutions.\n\nIf you have played the game before, you may want to know how it compares. The update itself is mostly pretty negligable (which is mostly a good thing) - the most important part being that it runs happily on modern systems.\n\nA few quality of life enhancements have been made - some of the slower animations seem to have been sped up a little to reduce the delay, but unfortunately a few places are still as slow as they were (particularly the mirror machine, which retains it's annoying need to flip the switch on and back for each Zoombini). A few of the animations also look a little odd (the toads jumping in and out, for example), but these are minor issues, and mostly a problem that won't affect the average player, only the veteran coming back where the puzzles can be solved quickly enough to make the delay seem longer, or notice the animation difference.\n\nThe graphics have been updated, but all remain the same at their core. Some places have been clarified a little (the placement spot for the Fleans has been made more obvious, the images in the mirror machine have been made clearer), but nothing changed in a substantial way. They look great, and retain all of the charm of the originals.\n\nThe game retains it's original sound, with the great music that is upbeat, with a hint of mystery, and the wonderful narrator, who adds humour and a sense of grand importance to what you do in the game. The audio quality is below that of a modern game, but I think TERC were right to leave it as is, the original recordings were spot-on, and a new version would have struggled to live up to the originals.\n\nJust as fun as it used to be, a little prettier, and highly recommended.

It has prettier graphics and can run on modern machines.\nWhen you start the game, you're tasked with creating your zoombini crew. They all have to be completely individual, and you create all of them from different parts.\nAfter that is done, you're given your first real puzzle. There are 2 bridges that cross cliffs, and placed over gigantic stone faces. You casually place your little friends onto the bridges and watch them cross. Until suddenly, one of the rock faces sneezes and throws your Zoombini back to where they started. At this point you try and put that same Zoombini onto the second bridge, and see that it crosses fine. That's how the game's puzzles are done. They don't explain to you what you need to do, it lets you do it logically. After trial and error you'll eventually come to realise that one of the bridges sneezes when a zoombini that has pink shoes on crosses it, however, allows all others. It's a fun process.\nThe puzzles mostly focus on logic through eliminating what zoombini can cross where.\n\nThe art style looks really beautiful. The backgrounds are painted very nicely, and the Zoombinis themselves look friendly and colourful. The music is amazing. A real nice mix of instruments, and really gives you the feel of the world. I love the voice acting. It's over the top, but really light hearted and funny.\n\nThe game is very simple. It's aimed at younger kids, although anyone can really enjoy it. I'm 20 and had fun with this. Don't get this expecting a puzzle game that will keep you scratching your head for minutes. You'll figure out each puzzle in a decent amount of time. There are harder difficulties you can select, which again aren't insanely challenging, but still fun. \n\nOverall, a very fun and simple game.

It does an excellent job re-doing the painterly background art, and preserving the brilliant voice clips of the original, plus, of course, the puzzles. The puzzles in Zoombinis have long been my gold standard for edutainment, and this remake doesn't change that. Players will stretch their pattern recognition and critical thinking -- the \"soft skills\" of math and science -- without being presented with any boring multiplication problems or fill-in-the-blank exercises.\n\nWhy, then, did I open this review on such a critical note? Because despite this game being released three years ago (it's 2018 as I write this), it doesn't appear the devs ever really \"finished\" it. The one thing they *didn't* copy directly from the source material is the Zoombini sprites, and it shows -- the new Zoombinis have no life in their animations. They move in a boring \"I just learned Adobe Flash!\" sort of way, with too many tweens and no smearing or squashing. It's a little thing, but it ruins my immersion.\n\nSo, overall, I would rate Zoombinis as 10/10, and this adaptation as 7/10.

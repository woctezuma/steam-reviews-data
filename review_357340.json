I remember when I bought it back when it was in alpha, and after testing it, was really pumped for it's release. The game itself did not disappoint at all, it's the most unique and fun 2D shooter I've ever played. What really got to me was how very few people play it and the servers were all dead, besides the occasional Wave Survival match. Still, while this game has insane potential for competitive multiplayer gameplay, the Singleplayer campaign alone makes it worth it : it's big, long, action-packed, full of secrets, and with a real sense of progression as you discover new areas and find more weapons to add to your collection. Classic Survival is, in my opinion, also a blast to play by yourself, and there's always the possibility to play local multiplayer. Of course, this requires you to gather a bunch of friends and some controllers, and us PC gamers may not always have many controllers available. If you do, however, then you'll have a ton of fun, because local multiplayer is really well-polished and one of the main features of the game, in fact. \n\n  Also, I should add that you will need a controller to properly play the game, and not just a cheap SNES replica, but a modern, full-featured controller. I personally use a Nintendo Switch pro controller because that's what I have available, you can also use Xbox controllers, PlayStation controllers, or if you don't have any of those, you can pick up a Logitech f310 for pretty cheap depending on where you live and it'll do the job just fine. If you don't have one and don't want to buy any hardware, then I guess you CAN survive on a keyboard, but it'll feel much, much better with a controller. \n\n   The game officially came out a year ago and never took off so I hardly believe the multiplayer situation will change much ; but while online gameplay is pretty much absent, there is an active community of modders and map-makers (because, by the way, the game includes a full-featured level design tool which is very powerful and probably what the devs used themselves) so in a way the game is not COMPLETELY dead.\n\n  Basically, get this game if you're interested in singleplayer or local multiplayer, make some awesome maps and share them if you want to, don't get your hopes up for online multiplayer since it's often empty or only a couple of gamemodes have people playing them.", "timestamp_created": 1514506203, "timestamp_updated": 1514506203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38705186": {"recommendationid": "38705186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312741921", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515193489}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Extremamente prazeroso quando se joga localmente, tanto co op como versus. \u00c9 fenomenal a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de desviar de um proj\u00e9til enquanto no ar, ou at\u00e9 mesmo o refletir.

I'm not asking you to change your opinion of Cobalt, but I wanted to share some clarity to why WASD is a separate game:\n\nWASD was designed to streamline the way players enter an online multiplayer match. Start the game and press play. Cobalt has both singleplayer and multiplayer, and each come with multiple modes and settings. Adding another game mode to Cobalt - with a completely new control scheme - would not help anyone.\n\nCharging $6.99 for WASD was necessary. Oxeye Game Studio needs money to survive. We went to great lengths to include our early backers by giving the game for free to alpha players, and having a 10% bundle discount for all Cobalt players.\n\nA lot of the work put into WASD is benefitting Cobalt as well. Cobalt currently has a beta branch (join our Discord to get access) that adds modding support and other fixes. We've already created a mod that adds mouse-aim to Cobalt, and when you play it you will discover why it was necessary to make WASD. This beta build will be put on the main branch \"soon.\"\n\nThanks.\n"}, "37881022": {"recommendationid": "37881022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153961804", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 11644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1520688928}, "language": "english", "review": "Slowwww motioooooon", "timestamp_created": 1511876154, "timestamp_updated": 1511876154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37836409": {"recommendationid": "37836409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066385251", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511827300}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great, unapreciated game, that is, to put it simply, dead.\n\n\nThis game is great fun, but there is not a single person online, most of the time.

Brought to you by Jeb and Co. at Mojang (the same group who made Minecraft), it features robots with consciences shooting and gibbing each other until one side is declared victorious in the local multiplayer, or simply flying solo, killing rouge bots in the campaign. The controls are very responsive and intuitive, controller-wise and on keyboard/mouse. I prefer to play this game with a controller for precise aiming and maneuvering (which, as a game enthusiast, I almost always despise because of the availability of a mouse on PC), so that is something to commend as well. The art is immersive and colorful, very well detailed, and will make you lose yourself quickly in the feel of it! My hours don't properly reflect how much I've played this game because it was in beta off of Steam for a good eight to twelve months, but that shouldn't be the only dependency on a person liking a game. Never had any technical issues playing at all, even in beta.\n\nOverall, I give it an 8/10 for style and ingenuity! Very well made and will always go down as a classic for me.

[/h1]\n\nThis game deserves WAY more praise than it gets. It's 2D sidescrolling action platforming at its finest, however be warned that this game doesn't have conventional play by any means. It's main combat style is heavily oriented around this game's unique Rolling mechanic. You don't aim with a mouse, so the only way to shoot above or below you is rolling, not to mention it can deflect bullets, increse speed, chain combo kills, stomp opponents, and entertain me for hours!\n\nNot to mention its SUPERB soundtrack and graphics! The lighting is incredible, the sound design is top-notch, and its production quality is above and beyond any other 2D sidescrolling platformer I've EVER played! It has endless polish, a banger of a soundtrack, a beautiful artstyle, tons of content, online multiplayerplayer, a huge story mode I have yet to finish and SO much more!\n\nAlthought its difficulty is immense, and the difficulty curve is hard to cope, I think this only adds to the experience. It requires split-second timing and quite a lot of strategic planning with how you approach certain enemies with different weapons, but really that's more of a plus than many negative reviews give it credit for. If you're struggling with this game, don't feel discouraged! Skill comes with practise, which comes with time! I'd reccomend the arcade mode challenges to practise your skills.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game. Extremely well made. My biggest quip and my only problem is how  it was marketed. Cobalt gets barely any spotlight, and as such suffers greatly. Mojang, publisher of Cobalt, developed the biggest hit game in history, Minecraft, and yet they totally failed when trying to raise Cobalt. It's a real mystery to me how it flew so low under the radar. Barely anybody plays it, so nobody's online half the time. It's a real shame.\n\nAnyways, buy it. It's worth your time, and it's more than worth 20$. Also, thanks for sticking around and reading this whole review, I really appreciate your dedication. If you got this far, you deserve to play Cobalt, so do yourself a favor and buy it.

The gameplay wants to be a twitch reaction action shooter. But the controls are a) seemingly different to be different and b) absolutely not made for twitch reaction gameplay.\nThe biggest point for this is that in twitch action combat you want to use the right weapon in the right situation. Let say you shoot an enemy in the distance and next you want to beat another enemy close to you over the head with the shovel. Instead that you simply have a closecombatbutton in this game you need to first change to the closecombat weapon and then use it. Same counts when using grenades.\n\n2. Autoaim is a luckshot if it hits what you want to hit or if it works at all, especially when doing the rollmaneuver. Actually aiming isn't really a thing aside from you standing on the spot to do it which in the quick battles means you get killed on the spot.Actually hitting anything is a clunky mess.\n\n3. Hope you are lucky punk! Because if you get killed in battle from one moment to another seems to be simply based on luck. A lot of the game is badly readable as in the overall design is done in a way that you can't really read what the enemys are doing next, you don't know if the reflect roll is gonna work this time or you suddenly die for some reason. You don't know if it is now better for you to ride animals or rather not (didn't seem helpfull but who knows). You get a lot of numbers for different items in shop and upgrademenues but it never FEELS like things are improving. The gameplayfeel is a mess if that makes sense. The game a has a lot of details in it (lockpicking doors, taming and riding mounts and birds, placing grenades and mines, talking to npcs and shopowner) but a lot of it dopesn't really feels fleshed out or serving any purpose. There is a lot of love to the detail in here that doesn't really add to the playability of the game. \n\n4. The worst thing however is the checkpoint system. AGAIN for some reason a gamedesigner meant the outdated concept of lifes is a good idea. But it is even more confusing. So you have a limited amount of lives to respawn on checkpoints. These respawns makes sure that you respawn while what you have done to the level so far (fought certain enemys, opened certain doors etc.) stays the way you left it. One of the problems of that is that you loose all weapons and items you had on the spot you died. So you are now going back to that spot while being underarmed for the enemys that may wait there for you, not to mention that some of the items seem to vanish iunstead of dropping. This adds to the already frustrating combat where you may survive or not, where the slow motion feature and the autoaim feature and the  repelling of projectiles and grenades may work... or even not.\n\nThe whole game feels... poorly thought out, the pacing seems off, tha game itself explains itself rather badly and the difficulty seems random and more luckbased then anything else.", "timestamp_created": 1487029149, "timestamp_updated": 1487029149, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.396998", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29875676": {"recommendationid": "29875676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173857903", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493639078}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc9c4\uc9dc \uc798\ub9cc\ub4e0 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \uc644\uc804 \uc88b\uc74c", "timestamp_created": 1486913493, "timestamp_updated": 1486913493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29698319": {"recommendationid": "29698319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142035634", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486856837}, "language": "english", "review": "Ignore my play time--This game is amazing, This is a must buy for Max Payne and indie game fans. 9.7/10\nP.S FUCK YOUUUU IGN", "timestamp_created": 1486228627, "timestamp_updated": 1486228627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452675", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29531642": {"recommendationid": "29531642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079482355", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519439260}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful and super innovative shooter.\n\nReal pity IGN have it a terrible rating.

Damage is rather high, and it doesn't take a lot of shots to take out your opponent. There is lots of room for action movie style slow-mo bullet dodging and parkour. Don't give up right away, because you might not get it right away. However, if you do gain skill at the combat, you'll find it really fun.\n\nAs for game modes, there's Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Plug Slam (CTF), and Waves Survival, and Story mode. Waves survival is the most fun solo, but the others are pretty good too. Using the workshop, It's possible to obtain maps from alpha, which were in a game mode called Classic Survival, and this too is buckets of fun singleplayer. When I go solo, though, I find myself mostly playing Challenge modes and Survival modes, and I enjoy them a lot. Survival modes are even co-op. The story mode is not bad, but it's too easy for an experienced player. It could be a lot of fun if you were newer, but for people who've played tons of the Alpha, and become really good, it's just a little dull. There are also Combat challenges, Puzzle challenges, and Speed challenges. These are solo only. You can, however, compete scores with your friend. They're really fun to try and figure out how to do, and you'll end up playing them over and over again. You can even set the world record, if you're good enough. When the game first started, I actually briefly held one, so that was cool.\n\nGet this game if you want a fun, simple time with awesome 2D action ranging from hardcore stealth to running and gunning, to slow mo badassery.\n    By the way, I played a TON of alpha before the game was released, so my playtime does not well reflect my legitimacy to review.", "timestamp_created": 1482597313, "timestamp_updated": 1483194085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618126", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28560884": {"recommendationid": "28560884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031375033", "num_games_owned": 755, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494775508}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game!

I dunno, I just wasn't very interested), but the multiplayer/arcade mode is phenomenal.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, there aren't a whole lot of people online at any given time. There are peak hours/days where you might get a full server, but my experience has mostly been starting a server and just playing against the bots until someone joins and you can play with one or two (sometimes three) other people for a little while. There's a variety of fun gamemodes, and while there's a bit of a steep learning curve (particularly because most of the people playing have been around for quite a while and are really good), the community has been very friendly. When I was still learning to play, this one guy switched to a different map and gamemode just to take the time to teach me what has proven to be the most valuable technique that I currently know.\n\nThe gameplay, though, is obviously the selling point. And oh, it sells. The fast-paced action, intense moments, slow-mo exchanges of gunfire, impressively challenging bots and phenomenal players, all make for a wonderful experience, and I cannot tell you how many times I've wished that I record whenever I play the game, not just for my own awesome moments, but ones that I've seen other people make.\n\nIs $20 a reasonable price for this game?

You can bounce enemy's bullets off your head to either redirect the bullet away, or (if well timed) bounce it straight back to them, dealing damage or even killing them; you can also punch or shoot grenades, sending them away from you or again, back at your opponent. Another important fact is that it has a \"bullet time\" feature, where the time of the local area is slowed to allow more complicated maneuvers.\n\nWhen it comes to single player, it features a complete campaign and challenges, with a scoreboard to compare yourself to other players.\n\nThe multiplayer is where this game truly shines though, you can team up in survival against wave after wave of enemies, or battle it out in one of the P.V.P. modes. It includes a deathmatch gametype,\na \"team strike\" in which you are put in teams, fight, and then spend points on a better loadout, first team to eleven rounds won wins,\nand a \"plug slam\" which is what you get if you crossed football (soccer) rugby, or American football with their deathmatch gametype, their are two goals (one for each team) and a \"plug\" in the center, once you pick up the plug, you must throw it into the opposing teams goal, however, you cannot shoot when holding the plug, so you must avoid any confrontation with the other team that you can.\nIt also contains a bot feature, so if their are not enough players, AI can fill their place.\nAny of these game types can also be played with just these bots and no other players if one so wishes to do so.\n\nAll in all, Cobalt is a game that you can, and will, spend many hours in, trying to shave the second off that one speed challenge you just can't seem to get under mountain hammer time, obtaining a higher score then your friends on one of the combat challenges, getting 100% on the campaign, or even just matches online.", "timestamp_created": 1468193083, "timestamp_updated": 1468193083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24238953": {"recommendationid": "24238953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091501253", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460528756}, "language": "german", "review": "ich finds eigentlich ganz cool, aber 20\u20ac ists nicht wert :o", "timestamp_created": 1468180050, "timestamp_updated": 1468180050, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24174967": {"recommendationid": "24174967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314437666", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496848105}, "language": "turkish", "review": "M\u00dcTH\u0130\u015e B\u0130R OYUUUUN ! \u0130ND\u0130RMEYEN GER\u00c7EKTEN P\u0130\u015eMAN OLUR.

I'm proud of what it has become. It had potential back then and they surely used that potential. \n\nCobalt is a 2D Shooter-Platformer. \nWhile those are fun by themselves, Cobalt overdid it and added a enormous amount of features to enhance that genre. \nA few of these features are:\n\n> The bullet-deflecting dodge-rolls, which also change the direction of the character as he rolls, allowing for incredible trick-shots or other fun things like using a high-powered weapon to roll and shoot the ground, launching you upwards or forwards, depending on where you are facing.\n\n> Time-distorting \"Reaction Enhancer\" which automatically slows down time whenever an iminent threat is about to obliterate you. Sure, this may sound like something that would make a game way too easy... But that is not the case at all. The slow-mo surely allows you and others to decide what to do in life-or-death situations that would normally destroy you before one could even see what happened, but you are slowed too and often these situations are not evadeable.\n\n> Semi-Open-world story mode. It's episodic, unlocking more areas as you progress in the history and \"To the right\" is usually the correct way to go. But there are always plenty of ways to go where you want, depending on what kind of character you are building for yourself. The worlds are also full of secrets to be found and the occasional side-quest that will give you rewards beyond money, like yet another way to approach the boss. \n\n> Character and weapon customization is a very important thing is this. It allows you to choose if you'll be the kind of character that takes it in the face and laugh at their puny guns, the guy who snipes them from afar before they even see you, the ninja that causes the local guards to disappear misteriously even few seconds, etc. Weapons and equipment can also be upgraded to have bigger magazines, laser-sights, scopes, silencers, etc. For a 2D shooter, this is an impressive feat.\n\nMultiplayer is also fantastic with friends, specially on lan-parties. \n\nThe bad? Maybe two things. The first one, which didn't bother me but can be a problem to some, is the learning-curve since Cobalt has odd button patterns for a first timer and can get confuzing, but once they are mastered, you'll get shot in the face less. The second is a minor problem, where if you TAB out of the game while in full-screen, it cuts the window and move it up, making it impossible to readjust without quitting the game and opening it again.\n\nI would certainly give this game a 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1467862987, "timestamp_updated": 1467862987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.955446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24132082": {"recommendationid": "24132082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243337682", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 8896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519495677}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool", "timestamp_created": 1467805217, "timestamp_updated": 1511398097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.399737", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24082088": {"recommendationid": "24082088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076629529", "num_games_owned": 628, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514742798}, "language": "english", "review": "2D unreal tournament with rolling, slowmotion and BIG arsenal of weapons.\nGood party game with splitscreen", "timestamp_created": 1467642621, "timestamp_updated": 1467642621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24060367": {"recommendationid": "24060367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132097636", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482864376}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr gut umgesetzter Minigame-Shooter f\u00fcr zwischendurch mit gut umgesetzter Story und Multiplayer Modus, welcher leider fast immer leer bleibt da das Spiel nicht so bekannt ist, aber trotztdem eines der unterhaltsamsten Games in meiner Bibliothek! :D Definitiv weiterzuempfehlen!", "timestamp_created": 1467577688, "timestamp_updated": 1467577688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24053376": {"recommendationid": "24053376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266858322", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520336437}, "language": "english", "review": "THE GAME IS F#$%^&* AWESOME\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467563016, "timestamp_updated": 1467563016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24035203": {"recommendationid": "24035203", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965986699", "num_games_owned": 536, "num_reviews": 189, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469213679}, "language": "english", "review": "I am not sure what I expected, but this game is just wierd.

When using sword/fist to reflect explosives and rolling you can reflect bullets, when things get shot at you everything goes slow-motion so you can avoid and reflect anything.\n\nYou have a lot of customisations to make your charecter the way you like, many colours to choose from.

Omg...\n\nALRIGHT, lets get started...\nThis game is definitely great, only the campaign itself already pays the price I gladly paid, and that's for a lot of reasons but for the sake of recommending the game, I will enlist some of them...\n1) Cobalt (the character itself)\nDamn this guy is funny to play with, I've never really enjoyed reading interactions between characters, but this little robot robbed me a LOT of giggles, damn it's amusing... hahaha\n\n2) The combat is F-U-N as hell and intense if you have at least something that resembles a brain inside your head... People are crying about controllers but even playing online with a keyboard I've won several matches against guys using XBox controllers, so yeah, get good and stop bitching, IT IS WORTH IT... Plus, if you want a game that is like every other, this is not for you, go expend your time and cash on things that you've seen before, but don't blame the games for your lazyness...\n\n3) The story is engaging (you don't notice the time passing) and the maps are fun to explore (something I never thought I would say of a 2D game... Since I don't like exploring, at least I didn't on the other games) and thats probably because of the fun movement mechanics, exploring the places to find secrets is also pretty fun. There was a guy on a negative review... Hold a sec, lemme get it... \" And in some places you are trapped and you are not given any clues to advance.\"... LOL... Srsly, do you think that if you are in space, and you need to write a report, your spaceship should call you saying that it's time to do so??? I won't even lose my time explaining any further... Tipical carebear that can't stay 1min without the game telling what he needs to do...\n\nSo yeah... I definetly love this game... So competitive, the Slo-mo mechanic is SO intense and so much fun. You may ask me \"Gentleman, I'm startled, how come that you, a person of so much class and impecable behavior came to be so stressed while writing this review?\" and ladies and gentlemen, the only reason I'm mad is because this game is nearly PERFECT and with a bigger comunity it could be ONE OF THE BEST... Seeing carebears of nowadays pisses me off...\n\nThank you for reading my thoughts (even though they are some little angry thoughts hahahaha) and YES I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES COMPETITIVE GAMING, even the problem with ping would be settled with a bigger comunity, but with no further do, I hope you have a great day (or evening, who knows).", "timestamp_created": 1466985272, "timestamp_updated": 1466985307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23841349": {"recommendationid": "23841349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167417976", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 182, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467130506}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich habe mich schon immer gefragt was dieses Cobalt eigentlich ist denn viele haben es beim Starten von Minecraft gelesen ich bin auch einer davon.

This is something that can only be fully understood once you can play multiplayer deathmatch at sufficiently high level. I have played single player for 4 or 5 hours, but all of the rest was multiplayer deathmatch.\n\nBecause the combat in Cobalt is deep and refined.\n\nEach minute decision of when to spin, when to jump, when to air jump, and on which direction, creates a *very* fluid and natural response in the player character. The result is that movement alone is a skill that you can spend hours upon hours mastering \u2014 and the range of possibilities is so vast that after practicing just movement for many hours (yes, I spent several hours jumping around alone in DM maps) the skill cap is still nowhere to be found.\n\nOn top of this, every weapon is its own delicious little niche of discovery. Take grenades, for instance. The path trajectory of grenades is influenced by your movement in multiple ways: (1) grenades will go further the longer you press the fire button; (2) grenades will inherit the speed at which your character is moving; (3) spinning allows you to throw grenades on any direction by correctly timing the release button, and (4) some grenades bounce off walls, some explode on impact, some get stuck to walls. These four factors multiply into *so many* possibilities! With the right sense of the thing, you can learn to place a grenade almost anywhere at almost any moment, with a good idea of when it will blow up. Someone is about to fall on top of you? Spin an explode-on-impact grenade directly above while falling down. Opposite team is rushing through a fixed path in large numbers? Spin a grenade in a long, tall arc to stall them from a safe position. Grenade throwing is a huge skill all in itself, and can make or break an entire game.\n\nOr take punching, for another unpopular example. To properly punch your adversary requires a mix of timing, prediction (of what he will do), jumping and spinning (to avoid his shots), so that if you can do it properly the visual end-result looks as if a robot ninja from hell is warping a vortex of pure kung-fu on his unwitting prey. If you add on top of that that punching the ground or the wall will push you away from it, you will come to realize that even the damned melee weapon is beautifully designed.\n\nAnd I could go on... I'm sure there is plenty of things I didn't discover!\n\nLet me give you two parting tips for playing multiplayer: You can configure your keyboard to have three different keys for immediately shooting each category of weapon (melee, fire, grenade), and three different keys for selecting the weapon in each category. (By default cobalt you have three keys for selecting the weapon in each category and one fire key to fire the weapon in the category that was last selected; this will become a roadblock if you keep at it)\n\nMuch luck and have fun,\nBruno\n", "timestamp_created": 1461493149, "timestamp_updated": 1461493149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22590796": {"recommendationid": "22590796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160358917", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460832589}, "language": "english", "review": "Eh, it's cool, I guess...", "timestamp_created": 1461427457, "timestamp_updated": 1461427457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458302", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22588794": {"recommendationid": "22588794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258251098", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460846090}, "language": "spanish", "review": "esta muy bien", "timestamp_created": 1461421583, "timestamp_updated": 1461421583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22575103": {"recommendationid": "22575103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104189585", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467111725}, "language": "italian", "review": "sono indeciso sulla recensione di questo gioco, poich\u00e8 \u00e8 divertente e vario, ma NON CI SONO GIOCATORI, nemmeno nel free weekend ce ne sono stati, quindi NON COMPRATE QUESTO GIOCO ammenoch\u00e8 non lo compriate insieme a qualche amico.", "timestamp_created": 1461359302, "timestamp_updated": 1461359302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.995006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22572104": {"recommendationid": "22572104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013504399", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497792073}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game in alpha, it took a while but it as come out as amazing as I thought it would!

It proceeds much like a Metroidvania, except that the journey is a purely linear one with no abilities to unlock to open new areas to explore.\n\nThe controls are a little odd. You have to hold Up or Down in order to aim, which stops your movement unless you're sliding down the hill. To melee you have to first hit X to switch to melee and then hit RT to attack, instead of X just being a dedicated melee button.\n\nAnd then we come to the first boss fight, an exercise in going around a large room activating consoles while killing constantly respawning enemies. It's about as fun as it sounds, and it first introduces Cobalt's frenetic, chaotic combat, where you need to roll to deflect shots, shoot / hit incoming explosives to deflect them, and to pray. Success seems equal parts skill and luck as you're rolling and blasting and hoping you kill everything.\n\nAnd after defeating the first boss, you get to do it all over again 5 more times, go through a similar set of maps to reach the same exact boss fight, just in a different room with different respawning enemies.\n\nThis is where the quantity over quality makes itself felt. Each of the 6 areas plays out exactly the same, with the same exact un-interesting boss fight at the end of each one. There's a plethora of weapons to collect, each with more stats than you'd find in an ARPG, but few are truly memorable. There are likewise armor upgrades, 5 items for 5 slots, that feature such dramatic differences as a 0.4 increase in damage reduction. \n\nThere are even animal enemies to summon or tame and ride, but they're all disposable.\n\nAnd then there are bugs, from small things like how the Time Guardian never introduced himself and yet my character referred to him as such, to the game breaking bug after beating the 2nd boss fight. An item was supposed to spawn, but didn't, leaving me stuck and having to quit out and repeat the fight.

Also, sometimes the lag never recovers and the game is \"frozen\" eternally, forcing you to leave the lobby.\n\nFor a game designed to be a fast paced shooter, where the fidelity is high enough to dodge/deflect bullets or explosives... the netcode is simply too terrible to allow that to happen. \n\nWhen it was working it was an alright game.

Which means that shooting is on two buttons. Why not just aim with the mouse as in Trine? Or only where the character is looking as in Samurai Gunn/Broforce/Duck Game?\nWhy are the keys locked to arrow keys, and I cannot use WASD? It is unplayable on keyboard + mouse, I mean keyboard since mouse is not used. Edit: The keys are rebindable, but the sheer amount of buttons required to compensate for not simply using the mouse to aim/shoot/roll/change weapon type makes it seem like a spider is the only creature that would be comfortable in playing this game.\n\nSo I switched to controller, but the game feels sluggish and approximate, especially with the button to \"auto-aim\" placed on the movement stick.\n\nThe only nice feature is a dodge-roll that can also deflect enemy bullets. Quite important to master, considering the huge amount of enemies to fight at the same time (and all the more infuriating with the unpractical control scheme).\n\nThe game features a single-player campaign (can be played in coop), and multiplayer (local and online). It has a lot of features, but I can't get over the gameplay to appreciate anything else the game has to offer. Even accessing the campaign missions is slow and complicated.\n\nIf like me you are picky about controls, especially with games where you have to fire guns, you can give this one a pass.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=671015980", "timestamp_created": 1460907145, "timestamp_updated": 1461383734, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545108", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22477839": {"recommendationid": "22477839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034924122", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460900286}, "language": "english", "review": "Campaign is ass\nControls are ass\nWeapons are ass", "timestamp_created": 1460900328, "timestamp_updated": 1460900328, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22472363": {"recommendationid": "22472363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146967341", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491566880}, "language": "english", "review": "when I starte playing, I played with a controller.

Play story mode a bit (or a lot because there are loads of things to do), play a variety of gamemodes with your friends, including classic deathmatch, but also original gamemodes like Plug Slam, where the object is to get the 'ball' into the opponents goal by any means necessary (think throwing, shooting, exploding).\n\nThe singleplayer modes are plenty difficult, and you will come across situations where you're surrounded by legions of robots and because you were stupid like me, forget to stock up on ammo and have to resort to punching them to death (which is difficult but you feel like a badass when you succeed). This is one of the most fun parts of the game: you can do some crazy ninja shit and kick some real ass once you get good at it. And you never stop becoming better at it.\n\nMost gamemodes are also available online, which is also loads of fun when you don't have friends. There is also an extremely expansive map editor, which can lead to amazing things if you think creatively. I learn new things everytime I open it.\n\nThe visuals are great and the weapons feel very satisfiying to use. The soundtrack is brilliant and really fits the game well! I've almost never had problems with lag either, and if I did, it was because I created a tower of about 30 giant mech robots all firing homing missiles stacked on top of eachother in the editor.\n\nThe only issue I see with the game (and it's arguable it's even the games fault) is that there aren't that many players. This means you'll only see a couple online games at a time.

But I'll try my best. Cobalt is a platform-shooter game. There's singleplayer modes and multiplayer modes, as most of you have come to expect in shooter games. But Cobalt adds in battle mechanics that are not comparable to any other game. There's rolling, extremely satasfying (I probably spelt that wrong, didn't I?) matrix-style slow mo, more rolling, interesting aiming mechanics, more rolling, and generally just a lot of rolling.\n\n The keyboard controls seem a tiny bit weird at first- seems a little more like a browser game then a Steam game- but I've actually gotten used to it after not very long, and you can modify them if you're not happy. There's also different ways to play the game. There's campaign, which can be played by yourself or with someone else too. There's local multiplayer, which can be played by yourself against bots or with people on your wi-fi. And of course, there's multiplayer, which needs no explination. There's also gamemodes for multiplayer (local and normal multiplayer), which is where it gets interesting.\n\nFree For all is self explanitory- everyone for themselves. There are team options though.\n\nTeam Strike is team deathmatch but with class options. Think of Battlefield but the match only lasts 3 minutes at most. You buy \"classes\" with points gained from winning.\n\nPlug Slam is football with guns. You get a plug and try and put it into the opposite team's goal. \n\nSurvival Mode is where you have to fight off waves of robots. Yeah, I don't know a lot about this gamemode.\n\nCombat and speed challenges are quite interesting. Combat challenges are where you are given a task, e.g. rescue 3 hostages, and are given a score by the time it took you to do it and the efficency (how many enemy bots you killed, how much damage you took, etc.)\n\nSpeed challenges are where you have to get from point A to point B in the quickest time possible. There may or may not be enemies in your way.\n\nCampaign is also a lot of fun. You play as Agent Cobalt who is trying to find out what happened to a human settlement. But there's more to it. You can go to dances for no reason whatsoever, roll, train endlessly for combat even though you are already a master at it, roll, make friends with birds and feel bad about life when they die, and more rolling. I hope you like rolling, cause if you do you're in for a treat with this game.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1456589804, "timestamp_updated": 1482782786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

excellent combat that still gets better as we speak thanks to continues development. Sometimes auto-aim can be a drag but you'll get used to it and work with it.\nThere is online multiplayer but not many people playing, so probably local is the way to go. Online is certainly possible and fun, only it's possible to have 0 people online.\nThe story is alright. The level design is a bit open so sometimes you fall or die and then there will be some boring backtracking and finding your way. The story is fully 2 player coop so that's good.\nI don't know why everybody hates the keyboard controlls. I own four xbox360 gamepads, but I prefer to play this game with the keyboard. It works fine to me.\nThere are challengen you can complete which are pretty fun.\nThe game isn't too expensive, maybe wait for a sale but that could take a while. The game is pretty new in the time of this review.\nMaps are lots and can be made yourself with the level editor. It's a little hard to use but you'll find out how it works. Just remember to check the wiki if you don't know what to do.\n\nI really like this game thanks to the combat, the keyboard controlls work fine to me and I'm pretty good (not to brag or anything).

I can honestly say it's in my top 10 games of all time. I have 100s of hours not logged on steam from all the years. \n\nThe two main parts of the game, that make it stand out from all other titles, is: Slow-Mo and Rolling. These two mechanics combine to make one of the most unique and satisfying experiences I've had in gaming.\n\nWith the main points out of the way, some pros:\n\n-Endless replayability.\n-Enjoyable learning curve.\n-Quirky and beautiful graphics.\n-Enough gamemodes to keep you engaged.\n-The soundtrack is minimalistic but genius.\n-Story mode, which I can't really comment on since I haven't completed, but so far it's great.\n-Local Co-op, so if you've got some friends to play with it takes the game from awesome to REALLY awesome.\n-Tooooons of different weapons to get acquainted with, everything from machine guns to scimitars, sticky mines to plasma pistols, tazers to wrenches, rocket launchers to sniper rifles, and everything in between. No matter your preferred combat style, your needs will be met with the vast array of weaponry. Not to mention other gadgets to augment your experience, such as jet shoes and shields.\n-You can ride giant carniverous space hamsters.\n-Steam Workshop, so users can make maps.\n-The best pro is that there are no cons.\n\nSo yeah. I urge anyone who's looking for a fresh kind of game to pick it up right now. Worth every cent.\n\nUPDATE: Still play this game every week.", "timestamp_created": 1456511506, "timestamp_updated": 1480387672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21474465": {"recommendationid": "21474465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259167294", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475476961}, "language": "schinese", "review": "I hope this game can have the Chinese,because my English is not very good.", "timestamp_created": 1456493388, "timestamp_updated": 1456493388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21469012": {"recommendationid": "21469012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072730712", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519695502}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is killer. +1", "timestamp_created": 1456466114, "timestamp_updated": 1456466114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501280", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21455242": {"recommendationid": "21455242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003463252", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456324128}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is going to easily become one of my favorites.

These are much better than the default ones in Gold edition IMO.\n\nCobalt is the very definition of a mixed bag. The best way to describe Cobalt is as an engine. This game manages to juggle a story mode, an arcade mode with bots and local multiplayer, an online version of said arcade mode, and an extensive, albeit hard-to-use level editor that lets you replicate nearly everything if not everything that can be done in the normal maps. Because that's what Cobalt is: an engine. The combat system is very unique with rolling and the addition of auto aim, (which is not analogous to aim-bot; it has time-to-aim, innacuracy, etc.) The giant roster of weapons and equippables is nothing to scoff at, and lost but not least it's all moddable to my knowledge.\n\nSome negative reviewers have voiced distaste in the game because they bought the game for 1 reason, i.e. to play the story mode and only the story mode, which, while the story mode is good by itself, it's by no means the whole game, and you're very much limiting your enjoyment if you only experience one way the engine has been used. Story mode is extensive but it doesn't even show all the mechanics the game has, albeit most of them. The best thing I can tell you to do is, after story mode, play some of the arcade modes, and then try to play local/online multiplayer if there are players for either. And if you're feeling particularily invested try out the editor for yourself; there aren't many online guides but there should be enough to get you started.", "timestamp_created": 1455474965, "timestamp_updated": 1499158439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21209449": {"recommendationid": "21209449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043572926", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481794152}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my first review for a game. I don't usually write reviews, but I felt like I should weigh in on this.\n\nBottom-line: this game's good. \n\nIt's pretty difficult, but it depends on your skill as a player, rather than artificial difficulties (like traps, attacks you couldn't see coming, etc). The music's nice and atmospheric, and keeps up the tension as you explore the game world, looking to avoid getting overwhelmed by multiple soldiers. The graphics are crisp and high-detail, and the game's pretty well optimized, to boot. \n\nThe multiplayer's surprisingly lagfree and is pretty deep, as well - for example, rolling can change how and when you attack, and also reflects bullets. So it's pretty much mandatory if you want to play singleplayer, even more-so online. However, rolling all of the time becomes a burden, like dodging or blocking all of the time in a fighting game, as when you're in a roll, you can't stop rolling, and a shot that hits your feet will damage you. So you have to mix it up, time your rolls, and move around to avoid dying, haha.\n\nThere's a ton to do in the game, and there's room for improvement, as there's also additional game modes that are present on the Workshop maps. For example, Classic Survival mode is not like the regular Survival mode. In Classic Survival, you don't face off against discrete waves, but rather deal with enemies as you explore the game map, searching hidden alcoves and safes for loot and weapons. Classic Survival's probably my favorite game mode, haha.\n\nAnyway, my opinion's that this game is EASILY worth more than $20.

Si el objetivo era pelearse ahora adem\u00e1s tendr\u00e9is que pelearos por coger esa dichosa arma que tanto os gusta a todos.\n\nPlug Slam: Volleyball a lo bestia. El bal\u00f3n aparece en medio del mapa, esperando a que marques un satisfactorio gol que acaba con una explosi\u00f3n de luz y contigo volando con una preciosa estela del color de tu equipo... \u00a1Boom!\n\nSurvival: Sobrevivir a oleadas de enemigos que pasar\u00e1n de darte puntos para comprar equipamiento a darte motivos para no salir sin tu escudo.\n\nHablar\u00e9 del modo historia, aunque solo me lo he pasado una vez. A mi parecer, algo prescindible, no me ha dado muchas horas de juego, aunque s\u00ed que me lo he pasado bastante bien. Es perfecto para hacerte con la idea del juego, las mec\u00e1nicas y la f\u00edsica tras \u00e9l, si no te fue suficiente con el tutorial. Adem\u00e1s, el trasfondo no es uno cualquiera. Si te gusta la ciencia ficci\u00f3n no perder\u00e1s el tiempo.\nNo es un simple modo historia, sino que adem\u00e1s trae consigo niveles de desaf\u00edo puzzle, contrarreloj y de combate, a los que puedes jugar tambi\u00e9n fuera del modo campa\u00f1a y conseguir logros complet\u00e1ndolos todos. \n\nHablando de logros, Cobalt tiene un mont\u00f3n. Para algunos necesitas haber jugado a todos los modos de juego, y otros implican colaboraci\u00f3n de amigos.\n\nSi tu intenci\u00f3n es pasar el rato jugando a este juego, prep\u00e1rate para que pasen horas y horas. \n\nLos \u00fanicos puntos malos del juego son la frecuencia con la que este es actualizado y la practicamente inexistente comunidad que lo sigue. Es frustrante entrar al modo multijugador y no ver a nadie jugando casi nunca, y ver que desde que lo compraste no lo han actualizado ninguna vez. Pero no le quita la diversi\u00f3n que traen sus mec\u00e1nicas. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1454979696, "timestamp_updated": 1499891702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21062978": {"recommendationid": "21062978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071011665", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454970175}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than sex.", "timestamp_created": 1454970087, "timestamp_updated": 1454970087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21062065": {"recommendationid": "21062065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071586934", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518841680}, "language": "english", "review": "Great single player and multiplayer experience.

Not only this, but they were backed by Mojang- A new testament to the reliability of small-team game developement.\n\nCobalt is a game of reflex, maneuverability and precision. There is no shortage of skills and strategy to be employed and the skill ceiling will leave casual gamers and veterans alike in awe of the possibilities of team composition, movement, vantage points, and finger dexterity.\n\nOne of the coolest features of Cobalt is the Time Dialation mechanic which slows time locally (relevant to each player) giving players more time to react to incoming projectiles. It is this mechanic (which I assume was a pain in the ass to get working consistantly for multiplayer) which enables players to perform feats which would simply be impossible in other platformer/shooters. \n\nThere is a copious amount of weapons, accessories, and characters ensuring that every thinkable playstyle can be catered to and employed successfully. This is especially useful for players hoping to customize their online experience, essentially allowing users to create their own classes in multiplayer matches and by extension, a new meta game for each lobby you join.\n\nFans of PVP gameplay will get hours of enjoyment from this title.

Had a lack of content, polish, and major bugs, but the core concept was solid. I played it on and off for a few months, then forgot about it for years until it got its full release on Steam. I redeemed my code from the alpha version, and tried it out.\nThis game, at a 20$ price point, is unbuyable. It lacks content, and has so many game breaking bugs I would call it an Alpha rather than a full release. I've crashed no less than 16 times playing for a little over an hour, and encountered odd lag in multiplayer. The controls for keyboard are awful, and overcomplicated, so I played on controller, which was mediocre at best. The story seems fine, albeit not voice acted or interesting apart from the gameplay, and the multiplayer is night unplaybly buggy. The funnest part of Alpha Cobalt was removed (the survival mode, like Horde mode/COD Zombies), so I can't really rate that. This game has good core gameplay, but lacks in controls, stability, and content.\nIf this were priced at 10$, you might actually find some people to play with in the multiplayer, which is dead (3-4 players online at peak hours.).

Fast forward two weeks, I had purchased the alpha of the game and vested a good 20 hours into it.\n\nCobalt's emergence from alpha has been a progressive and evident one. This 'version 1.0' of Cobalt is chuck-full of features that make the game limitless in fun and interest: multiplayer is awesome, and the story mode is quite imaginative as far as platformers go. The map designs by the developers are just the tip of the iceberg, as you can design your own maps & levels.\n\n$20 is not too much, might I add, for a game that has this extensive amount of gameplay. I have already sunk countless hours, and I'm not kidding when I say this game is still highly playable after 2 and a half years of playing it. It has a novelty, succession of updates, and evident quality.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that Cobalt is 110% awesome, however. There is a learning curve and rather difficult controls. However, some messing around and patience is sure to get you a control setup you will enjoy. I find that anyone that complains of the game's controls has always proven impatient or ends up enjoying the game once they grasp the understand of 'how to play.' The great thing is that the controls are customizable and I understand gamepad support is available.\n\nOverall, the game has an outstanding blend of fast-pace and slow-mo shooting action, accompanied by some great creative direction in design. As far as platformers go, there are few as good as Cobalt. As far as [i]combat[/i] platformers go, there are none as good as Cobalt. The novelty, playability, design, and organic gameplay that Cobalt provides is one of the most unique and imaginative platformers around.

Either getting to a secret area or going through a challenge fast.  The story is quite vast and being given multi-choices in what you want to say is well rated.  I don't see a problem with using the keyboard to play this game like others.. where its only arrow keys and then z/x and the weapon wheel keys are a/s/d and V or hold a weapon key to reload..

Awesome things! If you don\u2019t want to read all of this just know that this game has almost everything that a futuristic platformer and shooter game can give, and even more! You probably will not be disappointed.\n\n[quote]- Careful \u2013\n- Actually large opinion from here -[/quote]\n\nFirst, how you maybe saw in the store, cobalt is an action sidescrolling shooter with a vast list of mechanics and gameplay. Roll, throw, shoot, punch, dodge, hide, sneak, kill, buy, upgrade, hack, dance, etc... And now it has a cooperative Story, so let\u2019s go slow and part to part, because Cobalt has a lot to give.\n\n[b][u]Modes[/u][/b]\nIn the Alpha we had various game modes and now that the game is released the Story Mode joins the pack with also a lot of new mechanics that gives the game much more richness.\n[list]\n    [*][b]Story[/b]\n-In Progress-\n    [*][b]Challenges[/b]\nThe challenges were the most stressful, but at the same time fun, mode of the game. And they still are. A bunch of maps with some complex game mechanics and true action combat, perfect to train and improve our abilities in the game 'cause the AI is merciless and you are squishy as little bunny.\n    [*][b]Deathmatch[/b]\nThis is good to train yourself in an ambient with permanent action and to think how things works in Cobalt. What the weapons do, how take intense moments were if you miss your shoot you die and loss... Pretty intense and insanely fun.\n    [*][b]Team-Strike[/b]\nThe deathmatch for friends, to hate your friends or try to humiliate the AI... if you can, like I said before. The AI is respectable and pretty hardcore if you want it to be. The bots just know the perfect aim, time and everything else to destroy you and give an incredible match.\n    [*][b]Plug Slam[/b]\nThe Plug Slam is the classic Capture the Flag, but adding throwing! You must go to the rival base and get their Plug while defending yours from them. The first one to retrieve it to his own base get a point and the games are played at the best of three. It\u2019s a nice mode thank to the gorgeous maps and the throwing and rolling, if you domain them. It puts this classic mode in a new level of strategic that is worth the try.\n    [*][b]Survival[/b]\nSurvive waves of enemies, put yourself at the limit of patience and fail a lot. Protect Bopo Brains may be easy at first, but you must choose well your equipment or the next horde will be the last. Pretty different from the original Classic Survival, which was some class of sandbox map, the Survival puts out the exploration to give space the action and preparation to the next challenge. A really nice and recommendable mode to try yourself in huge hordes of enemies scenarios.\n[/list]\nI must say, also, that you can add all kind of map to the already large amount of maps, and that the Classic Survival (That I love) is not dead and you can play it from the workshop in maps made from the community.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]\n\nNow that you know the mods of the game, is the turn of the amazing mechanics to play it.\nThe Tutorial sums up pretty much of them, giving you interactive practice to get along with the controls and try them the times you want. It also explains the advanced things like Roll to shoot up or how to even punch rockets to redirect them. Passing the Tutorial is not enough to master this\u2026 but at least it lets you know about them and it\u2019s something not many games do at the day.\n\nThe most basic tool is the Rolling which lets you do almost anything. Get speed is one of the advantages but bouncing back the enemy bullets it\u2019s priceless, especially when one of them actually kills the shooter that tries to kill you first! You will find you rolling all the time in the end.\n\nAlso, the game values al sort of strategic you can think. From being a Tank, armed with shields and Rolls that let no one harm you\u2026 or be a sneaky shadow and get you enemies from the back. You can Climb walls and hide, or climb them and disappear from the sight of the enemy. And if you make a bad roll and didn\u2019t bounce back some bullets there\u2019s no problem because you get a second chance as the Brain inside your robot, flying clumsy around trying to reconstruct yourself.\n\nThere are LOTs of ways to play this game and that\u2019s another reason why I recommend it. You can play the way you want, or all the ways if you want!\n\n[b][u]Map Edition[/u][/b]\nThe map edition is one of the finest things about the game because the huge materials and possibilities it gives. You can make simple arena maps or put your life on it and do the most complex thing you ever do. The possibilities are almost infinite with it and it\u2019s proven in the Workshop where from a few days of the launch it blows of maps and things that the community has made.\n\nYou have all the tiles, all the NPCs, all the weapons and all the tools to make your Challenge, Deathmatch, Survival, PlugSlam or whatever youwant-map here (Just for the little price of a headache, maybe(?))\n\n[b][u]Controller Support, Co-Operative Play (Online or Local), Achievements and Workshop[/u][/b]\n\nAll of this just sums up for the game and make it worth the investment even more if you play with friends. The Story can be played either alone or with someone; the same is for the other game modes. If none of your friends have the game the Local play is equally fun and the Controller support make it easy to set up.\n\nThe Controller Support is amazing, even if you didn\u2019t use an Xbox Controller, with a PS2 Controller and the adapter you are ready to go an configure it the way you like. The customization is core in this game.\n\nThe Achievements brings you nice challenges to get better and better and there are a lot of them. And Workshop has one of the best community\u2019s I ever see, with awesome maps and things to share.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\n\nFrom my point of view, Cobalt has a lot to give and it\u2019s totally worth to give a chance if you like the kinetic fast passed shooting combat with rolls, climbs and a bunch of things to do. The game was amazing during the Alpha, and now that it is released is a total blast.\n\nIt will not let you down.", "timestamp_created": 1454578873, "timestamp_updated": 1454578892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598540", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20946877": {"recommendationid": "20946877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052109360", "num_games_owned": 1000, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 276, "last_played": 1520873060}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought the game during Alpha\nDidn't follow the hype\nBlew me away", "timestamp_created": 1454578566, "timestamp_updated": 1454578566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20945879": {"recommendationid": "20945879", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973172334", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 3139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518580254}, "language": "english", "review": "After purchasing I jumped right into the survival mode to give it a test run.

The lore behind the game is intriguing and leaks through into some of the arcade mode maps, which I think is a really nice touch.\n\nGraphics: 9/10. It's not beautiful pixel art and it's no Mona Lisa, but playing some of the custom maps completely convinced me that this game can look really amazing.\n\nSound: 9/10. The music is catchy and memorable and the sound fx perfectly match what is happening in-game, slowing down when the time dilation kicks in. I can't think of anything I would change here.\n\nGameplay: Beyond 10. In an age of games where the gameplay is often left to one side, Cobalt turns around and says \"here's what it means to be a gameplay focused game.\" The entire game is physical and feels very natural after a while at the controls. There are really endless possibilities to what can be done inside the Cobalt engine, which is why I'm incredibly excited to see that there are already modding possibilities. Never before have I played a game that creates so many awesome moments. Doing a backflip over a missile whilst shooting your gun at a grenade so it bounces off a wall and into another player is just tame to me now. This is the game that will make you squeal, will make you sweat and will make you feel like the most awesome person in the universe.\n\nCobalt sets the bar for gameplay now. Forget Mario, forget Smash Bros, forget every other game under the sun. I will never be able to look at another game again the same way. If you think this is just another arena brawler like Duck Game and Towerfall then think again. I can't play those kind of games anymore without thinking \"man, I'd rather just be playing Cobalt.\"", "timestamp_created": 1454563512, "timestamp_updated": 1454563512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.756127", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20943996": {"recommendationid": "20943996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096595477", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513135929}, "language": "english", "review": "Haven't played story so far, but back in alpha and beta the mutliplayer was so much fun!!!

The combat mechanic is definitely the reason people will end up playing the game, with pros and cons of the game here:\n\nPros:\n-Awesome rolling mechanic, the thing makes combat insanely skill based with infinite outplay potential.\n-Slow motion to help out with the sticky situations\n-Local and online multiplayer, with options to change game modes, maps, ranked/unranked, etc.\n-Story mode, which can get fun at times (more about that in the cons)\n-Full controller support with decent mapping and control.\n\nCons:\n-Slow motion in 4 player deathmatch gets really hectic at times, as you may be trying to get into the action, but the other players are constantly in combat, triggering slow-mo for everyone\n-Campaign is pretty crap. Story is meh, and it spawns you in a spaceship without telling you much of what to do, kinda like the \"find out yourself\" vibe that Zelda II: Adventure of Link gave. (whether or not it exists physically, that game doesn't exist in our hearts)\n-NO MOUSE SUPPORT. Absolutely disgusting having to control the menus with controller or keyboard. Duck Game can get away with it because the menu is literally in-game, but this game is different.\n-Controls to switch between weapon types can get overwhelming at times, lots of players are franically switching to grenades instead of their gun or melee weapon, etc. (on controller, I don't use keyboard)\n", "timestamp_created": 1454474772, "timestamp_updated": 1454474772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20925259": {"recommendationid": "20925259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112922918", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486257943}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes yes YES!!

Dialouge is actually kind of fun and will leave you laughing.(Just remember your ABCs cobalt) The developers are AMAZING, they are helpful, answered my questions personally, and even played with me WUT!? Many thought this game was abandoned for a long period of time, but its my guess they were spending that time adding the LOADS of content that is in game now.\n\nI played probably 50+ hours of the alpha and know a lot about the multi player, survival, team strike etc. Am excited to explore the new features and additions. Despite probably a crash or two every hour the alpha was a fun experience by itself which should say something. Oh and if you have a gamepad USE IT, the keyboard controls are extremely bizzare especially if you are a newblett.

There also seem to hav a lot of little interactivity thingy which I really like (you can mount certain creatures, get a bird and see it dies by a rocket 5 seconds after,...)\n\nI tried some of the challenges and that seems to be fun, there is a leaderboard so you can compare your score to other players and try to be the best (carefull, it's addictive as hell since a challenge doesn't take more than 30 seconds) ;)\n\nThe sound design is amazing, musics are nice and you won't believe how much diversity the devs could offer you with \"blip\", \"bloup\" and \"biip\" sounds.\n\nApparently you can unlock things, which I always appreciate.\n\nSo... well done devs. Your game was amazing 5 years ago, and you managed to make it even better now :)", "timestamp_created": 1454465269, "timestamp_updated": 1454465269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20923554": {"recommendationid": "20923554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218538757", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502818946}, "language": "english", "review": "Plays similarly to smash bros.", "timestamp_created": 1454464799, "timestamp_updated": 1454464799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20923478": {"recommendationid": "20923478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042396044", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520127096}, "language": "english", "review": "If this game was a pepper, I would eat it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(That means it's a good game.)", "timestamp_created": 1454464423, "timestamp_updated": 1454464423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 53, "weighted_vote_score": "0.410894", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20923103": {"recommendationid": "20923103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011861037", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475472144}, "language": "english", "review": "First Impressions Video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8m_prqz0g4\n\nCobalt surprised me.  I came in expecting another side scrolling shooter and found a much more intricate and complex design with some real character to it.  The graphical design is stylized and matched by ambient as well as beat heavy music.  The audio thump of weapons firing, punches connecting and robots being gibbed is satisfying every single time.\nIt is easy to tell that this is a labour of love.  Oxeye has been working on this game for 6 years, and it shows.  With multiple single player and multiplayer methods of playing, and the idea of having a full toolset to make your own levels is really cool.  So far, this title is an interesting diamond in the rough.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that it is without problems.  The review build I was provided by Oxeye seems to not recognize options changes.  I couldn\u2019t change resolution or graphical quality.  The toolset opened to scripting errors and I did have the occasional crash when attempting to make options adjustments.\n\nAll of that said, for $20 you can do a hell of a lot worse and if it gets a large enough install base to where the multiplayer maintains an active community, I could see this game lasting quite some time to take advantage of those free updates Oxeye has promised.  I look forward to seeing what else Mojang might consider publishing.\n", "timestamp_created": 1454462610, "timestamp_updated": 1454462610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20922991": {"recommendationid": "20922991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041935493", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1521336301}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Matrix Simulator 2016 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a more serious note, this game has been indevelopment for five years.

While not hard to find, the story contains some secret areas with powerful weapons or loot that are rewarding to find. The story also contains a few puzzles such as searching the area for a \"plug\" to put inside of a slot to advance or, as I\u2019ve seen so far, three different kinds of lock picking. One where it is stylistic of a tradition lock with the pins and you have to listen for a click, one with the rotation locks that you'd see on a locker where you turn it until you hear a click then turn in the opposite direction, and one where it plays you a tune and you have to adjust some notes until you match it. There are also boss battles that are very fun to do. The story is great and while giving you a decent amount of lives it can still be challenging as you can die very quickly and in rapid succession if you\u2019re not careful. As I have not gone too far into the story I can\u2019t comment anymore about it but i have picked up blue prints and I know there is an upgrade/blueprint mechanic. There is also a hub area on your ship where you select which mission youd like to do.\n\nThe fighting mechanics are some of the best I\u2019ve ever seen in a game, just take a look at the videos. There is so much to learn how different weapons react to many different variables. Such as how you can shoot a grenade back at your opponent or how you can roll the bullets away. There is lots of freedom in movement which is great.\n\nNow for the couch co-op/multiplayer/single player with AI games such as \"death match\" \"plug slam\" and \"team strike\" they are a ton of fun to play with others. in all these game modes you can select a starting character to keep things new and switch weapons out on the map. Also i forgot to mention, there is a very nice array of weapons.\n-death match: your standard death match game as you would assume.\n-plug slam: a 1 flag CTF style game mode but usually in a small area. Changed from the standard ctf mode of the ALPHA on decent sized maps, this new tweak seems to try to make the game faster paced. You spawn with a plug in the middle and try to \"slam\" it into the other person\u2019s goal. This can be done by shooting it, throwing it, creating an explosion by it to propel it, or anything else this game allows you to do. You can also shoot the plug away from your own goal just as you can shoot grenades.\n-team strike: a usual 8 player game mode where you get one life and can get upgrades on your class before each round with money from kills. a lot of fun and it makes you change up your play style a bit since you have one life. Probably my favorite game mode but i have not gotten too far into the tweaked new CTF game mode.\n\nChallenge modes are also in the game. For the competitive player. There is leader board to see who has the highest combat score in combat challenges and fastest completion speed in speed challenges where you try to complete a level as fast as you can.\n\nThere is much more I could type about but this is the main points. I skipped over a lot. Check out the tutorial videos on the basic of \"offence\" and \"defence\" to see some more.\n", "timestamp_created": 1454443065, "timestamp_updated": 1454443065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20917462": {"recommendationid": "20917462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064550827", "num_games_owned": 689, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488402550}, "language": "english", "review": "I may not have played it very much on Steam, but this is an awesome game!\n\nThroughtout the Alpha not very many bugs where discovered, and I think it'll be the same through Gold (from what I've discovered yet, that's about right)!\n\nCobalt is awesome playing alone, and absolutely EPIC if you have 1+ friend(s) to play either campaign (yes it's also coop) or any other game mode!", "timestamp_created": 1454441259, "timestamp_updated": 1454441259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20917278": {"recommendationid": "20917278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179795166", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517146375}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!\n\nThe graphics, gameplay, robos, tamable space hamsters, and everything else in this game is truly spectacular.", "timestamp_created": 1454440722, "timestamp_updated": 1454440722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20917268": {"recommendationid": "20917268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048183682", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513796145}, "language": "english", "review": "\"It's like Smash Bros. with guns. 10/10\"\n\nIn all seriousness, I have a lot of fun playing this game because it has a well designed combat & upgrades system, an interesting story (not outstanding, but interesting enough), online multiplayer, and high-quality 2D graphics.

This is a finished product and while arguably a tad overpriced at this point (I paid closer to \u00a35, 4 years ago). I still feel it an easy recommendation to those intrigued by the prospect of a skill based side scroller.", "timestamp_created": 1454432728, "timestamp_updated": 1454451657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20914691": {"recommendationid": "20914691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040588682", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455367699}, "language": "italian", "review": "Possiedo questo gioco dal 2011, anno che pubblicarono la alpha e devo dire che ha fatto parecchi passi avanti!\n\nAspettavo da parecchio la storia e il multiplayer online e devo dire che ne \u00e8 valsa la pena. :)", "timestamp_created": 1454432286, "timestamp_updated": 1480286933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20913945": {"recommendationid": "20913945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012665474", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505408075}, "language": "english", "review": "Punching rockets back at your enemy mid-air in slow-motion, ~8 hours campaign and challenges.\n\nGreat Game - Buy it! :)", "timestamp_created": 1454429538, "timestamp_updated": 1454429538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.985918", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20913470": {"recommendationid": "20913470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028717427", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460652468}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego que sorprende, tiene un modo historia muy divertido (sobretodo si juegas con amigos) y ademas es bastante dificil.

Timing and skill is quite important when it comes to combat, which makes it that much more satisfying.\n\nFirst, I should mention that you can't aim freely in this game. You shoot wherever the character is facing, which is left or right. That is unless you hold the crouch or sneak button. That makes your character aim at the closest enemy automatically. That's how you can take out enemies on ceilings, or in the air. Your character will also auto-aim at enemies while you roll.\n\nRolling has other uses as too. If you roll into an enemy projectile, then you will deflect it and avoid taking damage. If it hits your head directly while rolling, then you'll deflect it at your enemy and in turn hurting them. However, if the projectile hits your feet while rolling, then you will take damage. It's little things like this that continue to make the gunplay interesting in this game.\nOne detail I love is that if you time it just right, you can punch the ground as you roll to launch yourself into the air.\n\nYour arsenal consists of melee weapons, firearms and thrown objects. All of these add variety when it comes to destroying your foes. It's fun stuff!\n\nThere are two modes to choose from.\nStory mode will have you making your way through huge levels, navigating different paths, completing puzzles, picking doors, discovering secrets etc. It's similar to other \"metroidvania\" games if you want a more direct comparison. This mode is also sprinkled with a few cutscenes and dialogue, which are generally quite funny and well written.\n\nThe arcade mode pits you in constant action. You can choose combat or speed mode here. Speed mode has you try to navigate through levels at high speeds, where combat mode lets you wreak havoc. You've got shields, cool armour and tonnes of enemies to mow through. You feel like a badass.\n\nMy only gripe with the game so far, is sometimes you'll want to break a barrier above you, and since it's not an enemy, your character will not auto aim at it. That means you need to roll and time your shot in hopes that it'll hit the barrier. It would be nice in cases like this if you could aim upwards.\n\nI absolutely love the soundtrack. A lot of it consists of 80s dark synth-y type of stuff, although it's got quite a variety.\n\nLastly, in all games, I always find myself moving my character to the music. Crouching to the beat and turning with the melody. This game actually rewards you for it! If you do certain actions in the rhythm, it gives you points. I just love that little detail, as it encourages you to have fun with little details like dancing to music.\n\nOverall, I think it's a really solid game, with a lot of variety when it comes to game modes, and the combat is really what takes the cake.

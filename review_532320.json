The game takes full advantage of my 1440p 144Hz monitor, which I legitimately wasn't expecting due to the game's origins. Sure, it's completely barebones otherwise and the keyboard+mouse controls make unmodded Dark Souls 1 feel like Quake, but it's a pretty good experience with a gamepad, especially since the original was full of Wiimote waggle which is replaced with the A button.\n\nThings to note:\n\nThe level of detail was made for the Wii's 480p resolution. The level of detail was not modified in the PC version, so pop-in is extremely noticeable at high resolutions.\n\nOnce again, a gamepad is absolutely recommended for this game. Although there are keyboard button prompts, the game is close to unplayable using a keyboard.\n\nThis is a straight port, so there are no quality of life improvements whatsoever apart from the gamepad controls. Issues in the first game (such as only saving at the start of its fairly lengthy levels) have not been improved upon.\n\nMenu assets and FMV cutscenes are still in SD resolution.\n\nSo it's a completely barebones port, but the unlocked framerate, good performance, and gamepad button prompts make it preferable to emulating it in Dolphin.\n\nNow a short few words about the game itself.\n\nI really liked this game as a kid. The graphics were almost on par with Mario Galaxy, and the gameplay (though it had problems that annoyed me even in my young age) was fairly enjoyable. Playing it now, it's still quite a good game, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Jet Set Radio and gameplay similar to the painting part of Splatoon.

That\u2019s a nine-year gap between the original version and its solid PC port. You got that right since de Blob is a great remake, if you will. It runs and looks best on its PC version, but that\u2019s hardly news for Steam gamers. I never played the console or mobile counterparts, so I really didn\u2019t know what to expect and I was still pleasantly surprised. The concept and characters are the initial project of several students from the Utrecht University. THQ were impressed by what they saw and bought the rights to de Blob franchise.\n\nThe Wii version was apparently very popular and the sales figures alone, prompted developer Blue Tongue Entertainment and publisher THQ, to begin work on a sequel, which launched in 2011. If we ever wish to see de Blob 2 on the Steam Store, then we should hope that the current title fares as well with the buyers and players as it does with the critics. And in case you were wondering (since Blue Tongue closed its doors in 2011), this PC port has be skillfully adapted by Blitworks, industry veterans which have ported to PCs, countless quality games in the last decade. History lesson\u2019s over.\n\n[h1]Story [/h1]\nPlayers assume control of \u201cde Blob\u201d, a cute little abstract creature formed from certain liquids such as water or paint. We\u2019ll just call him Blob from now on and refer to him as male, despite no clearly defined gender. Our hero is part of the revolutionary Color Underground. A guerrilla on a mission to free their homeworld and its capital, Chroma City, from the evil clutches of the INKT Corporation. The antagonists are more likely resembling  an oppressive regime and an occupying army, than a firm. Comrade Black is their supreme leader and his goals seem simplistic and confusing at the same time. INKT wishes to rid the world of color and impose a literal black & white vision in regards to all aspects of life. \n\nI am fully aware that de Blob is geared towards a younger audience, but that\u2019s no reason for adults not to enjoy it and look for a deeper meaning than \u201cthose are the bad guys and you fight for the good ones\u201d. Some mature themes do surface, such as intolerance and how to perceive or deal with it, along with tyranny and complicity to it. The silent majority and the need for a providential savior. Do not get me wrong, the game is light-hearted in nature and that is perfectly fine. Yet it is far from superficial since it contains sufficient metaphors for most gamers to enjoy discovering them.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics engine in de Blob is custom made in-house while getting some assistance from the Havok physics engine. This practice of using middleware is quite common for the video games that can afford it and Havok  physics are among the best in their branch. It would have been easy to just say that the game has aged well, but de Blob has been adapted to PC. I hope you realize that console or mobile games have to sacrifice \u201cminor details\u201d such as antialiasing or shadow and lighting effects in order to ensure at least 30fps. The PC port I\u2019m reviewing today? Runs buttery smooth on 4K@60fps. No crashes, no glitches or bugs. The camera controls are a bit finicky, but that\u2019s not something practice won\u2019t correct, by the time you spent an hour in-game. Soon enough you\u2019ll be doing all sorts of stunts while wondering how you became so skilled at it, in such a short time span.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nIf you think de Blob is just another 3D platformer on Steam, well the soundtrack insists on proving you wrong. Most platformers I played so far on Steam, had a handful of annoying or repetitive sounds which couldn\u2019t even qualify as a worthy OST. Blob gets to bring Chroma City back to life (and color) while being constantly accompanied by a selection of jazz and disco songs. These instrumentals playing in the background offer players the chance to choose between them, at the start of each new area. They are designated as \u201cmoods\u201d and they really offer a replayability factor of their own. As a self-declared fan of instrumental music (from epic to jazz), I couldn\u2019t be more happy with what I heard while playing de Blob!\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nWatching the game\u2019s hero paint the city, one building at a time, you begin to understand why the gameplay is so captivating and even inspired the Splatoon series. Chroma City under INKT is a literal blank canvas just waiting for the skilled hands of a determined painter. Blob takes his freedom figher role very seriously and he\u2019ll get plenty of help in his crusade to bring color back to every corner of the city. Speaking of which, Chroma is divided into separate areas which you may revisit anytime after you brought them back to their former glory. Based on how many challenges you completed already, new sections and unlockables become available.\n\nIt may seem like grinding but it pays off in the end, to paint a large percentage of each distinct area of the city. In a way, de Blob also reminded me of Lantern, an indie game which featured a similar mechanic of bringing color back to an otherwise black & white environment. For something as simple as this, it\u2019s satisfying to see it in action but Blob ups the ante by performing all sorts of stunts which really portray him as Chroma City\u2019s very own superhero.\n\nAs you can imagine, Comrade Black and his henchmen will put up an increasingly more concentrated fight against your efforts to restore peace. INKT shall not only summon tough foot soldiers carrying their titular ink guns, but also throw all kinds of mechanized units, which require both patience and dexterity from Blob, if players wish to succeed in defeating them. Ink will quickly deplete your hitpoints (more precisely, paint points) so you must find a water source as soon as you get hit by \u201cinkies\u201d. You can discover most of the painting mechanics by yourselves and the game features some very thorough tutorials along with low-difficulty initial challenges which manage to accommodate even genre beginners.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nDe Blob\u2019s hands down one of the best 3D platformers I ever played and since I no longer own a console nor do I intend to own one in the foreseeable future, I\u2019ll have to contend with the genre representatives on PC. Most console ports to PC are abysmal from a technical perspective but luckly, de Blob is a noteworthy exception. For the sheer amount of activities and replay value, I\u2019m more than willing to agree that its current Steam price tag is justified, even without those extras which Steam collectors covet. Perhaps Trading Cards may be added within a future update? I\u2019m hoping more for a de Blob 2 Steam edition, to be honest. It has to happen sooner rather than later.\n\n [h1]Strong Points[/h1]\n+ Beautiful visual style.\n+ Relaxing gameplay and sounds.\n+ Plenty of challenges and free roaming levels ensure replay value.\n+ Humorous approach to dark themes, such as tyranny or intolerance.\n\n[h1]Weak Points[/h1]\n- Camera controls and angles take some time getting used to.\n- No Steam Achievements nor Trading Cards.\n\n[b]Rating 90/100 [/b]\n\n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews]Imperial Reviews[/url] and [url=https://www.ticgn.com] The Inner Circle Games Network[/url]through the generous contribution of Nick Edward.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1496180396, "timestamp_updated": 1496222747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758956", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32057662": {"recommendationid": "32057662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019387262", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502014733}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game from along time ago!\n\nPros\n+Casual\n+Relaxing\n+Good Music\n+Lots of challenges\n+Good controls\n\nCons\n-None that i currently know of\n\nIf you like chill games that have good music and vibrant vibes get this game.", "timestamp_created": 1496129939, "timestamp_updated": 1496129939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559194", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31972995": {"recommendationid": "31972995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005184552", "num_games_owned": 1366, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495585485}, "language": "french", "review": "ces cool tu peut peindre avec ton cul", "timestamp_created": 1495804528, "timestamp_updated": 1495804528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31834630": {"recommendationid": "31834630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288073861", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511488955}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE THIS GAME.

INKT has invaded the colorful resort you live in and is sucking the colorful life out of everyone and everything they can! As de Blob, you need to take it back!\n\nI\u2019m Thomas from WeiseGamer.com, and this is my review of de Blob, developed by Blue Tongue Entertainment and Blitworks, published by THQ Nordic.\n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1]\n\nThe evil INKT group has invaded, and they are removing the color from everything around you! You have to re-color the city, painting the town red, and blue, green, purple, orange, all the colors!\n\nThis game just recently came out on Steam on April 27th; however, it was on the Wii and I think some other consoles previously. This reboot brought updated graphics as well as a few other things, and as a game I had never heard of before, I quite enjoyed it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nDe Blob is a simple game with simple mechanics, but it\u2019s quite fun. I truly had never even heard of this game, but when I started to check it out I thought it was something similar to Splatoon, and found that it may have some similarities, but it\u2019s truly its own unique platformer.\n\nAs de Blob, your goal is to get the world around you back into color while taking out the evil INKT corporation. You collect various colors, and using them can mix paint to form even new colors. So, if you remember your basic art class, you can mix red and blue to make purple for example. Within each section of the world, you have various side quests or tasks to complete, and this combined with just adding color back to the buildings around you will give you the ability to progress and move into the next region.\n\nAt its core, de Blob is a fairly simplistic platformer. The added ability to kind of wall jump to spring yourself around, collect various things like color patterns, finish side quests, and what amounts to be a fairly simplistic story line, really round out the gameplay to be a fun experience I plan to go back to. Wrapping up this section, there is a multiplayer mechanic as well as a free roam mode, and though I didn\u2019t get a chance to play the multiplayer, I believe there is a lot of fun to be had here as well based on gameplay I\u2019ve seen.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nVisually, this game is beautiful. Sure, it starts off with everything in black and gray around you, but as you start painting the world these gorgeous splashes of color come out. Saturation is quite high in the environment, but it fits for this style of game with bright colors, happy citizens (after you save them), and an overall feel good experience that was such a nice thing to experience after just completing Outlast 2 recently on stream.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nMoving into the audio, I was very impressed by what the developers did here. When you start a level, you can pick the mood of the music you want to listen to and there are quite a few options, all of which were great, and even some more genres to unlock later as well. I really loved the soundtrack and it just fit perfect for the atmosphere.\n\n[h1]Replay-ability[/h1]\n\nReplay ability wise, the game actually has a lot to offer. Outside of the various story missions, you receive a rank on every area based on how well you did. There are various collectibles in each area, and trying to 100% everything will take a lot of time. You have free roam options, and multiplayer as well, and really this makes a complete package that should give you well above your money\u2019s worth in my opinion.\n\n[h1]Overall Wrap-Up[/h1]\n\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend de Blob if you are looking for a casual indie platformer that has a lot of fun mechanics and collectibles. I feel this could be my next time killer, when I just want to relax a bit, play something casually, and slowly unlock everything in the game. For $14.99, I think it\u2019s priced competitively to where you can feel happy with the value you get. Combine the gameplay with great visuals and audio and you have a complete package.", "timestamp_created": 1493852083, "timestamp_updated": 1493852083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31532139": {"recommendationid": "31532139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050650418", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495901146}, "language": "english", "review": "Space Hopper: Paint Edition\nIf you played this on the Wii, I recomend getting it for PC, It'll be a very nice nostalgia trip.\nIf you've never played this before, what are you doing reading reviews, buy the game, play it and enjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1493849968, "timestamp_updated": 1493849968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31529187": {"recommendationid": "31529187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090403312", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495207925}, "language": "french", "review": "WOWOWOWOW !!

The game\nII. The reboot\n\nI. i won't talk long about the game(mainly because there are already enough talking about the game itself), i like the story, love the idea behind it, only thing which isnt that good is a lack of variety sometimes but thats ok but don't expect too much replayability.\n\n\nII. the reboot dissapointed me in some ways, the resolution of all the cutscenes, texboxes and the menu stayed the same. \nthe graphic in general didnt really improve with the exception that its rendered in 1080p but nothing else, and since the original game is a bit old some of the little creatures seems to consist of only 10 polygons. The main thing which is negative here are the bugs, there are sometimes missing textures (believe me theres no bright pink/magenta in the game) then the best time is the time of the run in which you achieved your highscore so it could display like in my case 66min instead of 20 or less. The controls are pretty good for controller (with some exceptions in camera control which sometimes does some wierd things) i don't know about keyboard though.\ni also think they missed an opportunity by not inclouding steam achievements.\n(small sidenote: the game has no 21:9 support whatsoever :/ but can't really expect that but would have been a neat addition for ingame time and maybe higher res than 1080p)\n\n\nAll in all if u haven't played this game at all i'd definitely recommend it, if u have already played de Blob and really liked it and don't have it lying around anymore sure go for it but if u have the ability to play it on your normal system then this won't be a huge step up and i think your money would be betther invested otherwise. \n[spoiler] eagerly waiting for the sequel to get ported [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1493604725, "timestamp_updated": 1493605016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479024", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31475205": {"recommendationid": "31475205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216004748", "num_games_owned": 719, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493504879}, "language": "french", "review": "Le jeu passe bien et se montre amusant, m\u00eame si j'ai pas vraiment encore compris le but.\nConcr\u00e9tement, il vous faut \u00e9craser des petits monstres innofensifs pour leur piquer leurs pigments de couleurs et ainsi colorer la map qui semble \u00eatre victime d'une dictature for\u00e7ant se habitants \u00e0 vivre dans une ville morose de couleur blanche.\n\nLe multi est tr\u00e8s sympa quand il y'a du monde aussi.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Wv6lweZfBg", "timestamp_created": 1493595382, "timestamp_updated": 1493656269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31468069": {"recommendationid": "31468069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031146382", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499217411}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a really underappreciated game when it released.

Y la visi\u00f3n de estos chavales no fue otra que un futuro dist\u00f3pico donde el color de la ciudad (llamada Chroma City) ha sido robado por la malvada corporaci\u00f3n INKT.\n\nEl proyecto fue un \u00e9xito y asombr\u00f3 en varias ferias, este prototipo para PC pod\u00e9is descargarlo y jugarlo, es curioso ver lo diferente que era sobre el juego final. La licencia fue adquirida finalmente por THQ y el juego fue finalmente desarrollado por dos estudios in-house: Blue Tongue se encarg\u00f3 de Wii y Helixe de Nintendo DS.\n\nY result\u00f3 en lo que he mencionado al principio, el mejor juego de Wii no creado por una first o second party de Nintendo. Un juegazo super original en su concepto, con un rendimiento sobresaliente incluso en el multijugador split-screen para cuatro jugadores, con una banda sonora absolutamente brutal (para mi la mejor de Wii), largo y cargado de carisma. En mi opini\u00f3n el \u00fanico fallo que le vi era un control mejorable, no era malo pero la acci\u00f3n m\u00e1s usada (el salto) estaba mapeada moviendo hacia arriba el Wiimote, lo cual era tan impreciso como cansado (despu\u00e9s de hacerlo mil veces).\n\nLa idea de de Blob es ir pintando un sector de la ciudad, activando eventos una vez se llegue a un porcentaje determinado y finalmente pasando al siguiente sector, para repetir la operaci\u00f3n. El nivel de pintura puede aumentar pintando la ciudad (...) o superando misiones, las cuales normalmente se resumen en destruir esto, pintar aquello de determinados patrones, ir de aqu\u00ed a aqu\u00ed, etc. Las misiones de pintar son las m\u00e1s aburridas, pero excepto en el nivel de Los Jardines Colgantes, no son obligatorias en ning\u00fan otro nivel.\n\nA mayores de la historia principal, muy divertida e interesante, existen retos extras tan espectaculares como bien planteados. Invitan a superarlos y darle algo m\u00e1s de vida a un juego que no es corto.\n\nSobra decir que no me lo he pasado en 10 minutos. Ya me lo he pasado varias veces en Wii y doy mi opini\u00f3n. Me lo volver\u00e9 a pasar en Steam pero no por el momento. Solo lo he probado por encima para ver lo esperado: Que va perfecto, que el aumento de resoluci\u00f3n favorece al juego, que no creo que tenga assets en HD (aunque da el pego) y que el control de mando (XBOX 360 en mi caso) es perfecto y da mil patadas al control con el Wiimote. Me he pasado el primer nivel y cero problemas.\n\nAqu\u00ed os dejo el blog de los estudiantes que crearon el proyecto original.\n\nhttp://blob.oogst3d.net/\n\nY un v\u00eddeo completo del juego de Wii que grab\u00e9 hace a\u00f1os, por si alguien tiene dudas de c\u00f3mo es.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hGIxcJxt54M\n\nEdito: Finalizado y no he encontrado ni un solo fallo. Dir\u00eda que como \u00fanico punto negativo es que la c\u00e1mara vibra al ser rotada en espacios cerrados, que no puedes inclinarla demasiado (supongo que sea una limitaci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo original) y que Blob sigue qued\u00e1ndose pegado en algunas partes del escenario.

its entirety...\n\nThis is a good game, it can get annoying at times because there's a simple formula that the game doesn't change through its entirety, after a while of just playing it feels as if the game is somewhat trying to \"artificially\" extend its duration by just having you go to, admittedly, different locations, or levels, that sadly just look different, but have the exact same objectives, and challenges than all of the others.\n\nThe enemies do get tougher as you progress, usually they require you to crush them by jumping over them, but eventually they'll require you to do the same while being of an specific color.\n\nThe idea of the game is that you get this massive areas that are both black and white, the objective is to color them by touching them, or alternatively, interacting with them, in certain cases, under specific circumstances.\n\nAs you move through this massive levels, that probably will take you more than 20 minutes or so to complete each of them, you'll find certain challenges that follow the same structure and are given by different characters.\n\nOne gives you objectives that are specifically related to painting massive \"tactical\" buildings, you do this by interacting with some form of station that makes you sacrifice a particular number of your life.\n\nYour life is measured by how much paint you consume, you consume paint by crushing, similarlly to other enemies, units of specific colors.\n\nThe colors you can get are always primary colors, that then you can combine to create more elaborate color combinations, but combinations that are still limited.\n\nThey are diversive enough however, to give you an actual feeling of change, and energy after every \"consumption\".\n\nThen you have other activities, ones that are races in which you need to follow \"flares\", others in which you need to beat a series of enemies that spawn when triggering the specific challenge, and finally, and probably my least favorite of them all, some that require you to paint certain structures with an specific color.\n\nGiven that you need to change colors sometimes between each set of structures, and the only way you can paint said structures is by touching them, this resulted in a lot of different accidents that would make me have to repeat certain challenges.\n\nThe game never got frustrating because I was loosing or anything like that, the game frankly for the most part is fairly easy, but the frustration comes from the way its difficulty is implemented, not so much because it relates to the same difficulty you've encountered in other games.\n\nOne of the most enfuriating things I found about this game, ended up being the sense of direction, what I mean by that, is that in plenty of different cases, I just didn't know where to go, and I would just remain during the same area, painting stuff, and messing around with respawing colored sentries until I would get bored, desperate, or both, and simply started wandering through the map, avoiding obstacles, and enemies, as well as even the act of painting certain buildings, just to try and find the exit.\n\nThe other issue I have with it is that the game just keeps going on, and on, and on.\n\nHad the game skipped the last couple of... Say... 4 levels, it would have been fine, its not that I hated those last 4 levels, is that they felt unnecessary, because the formula of the game is the same, the objectives are the same, and so it starts fun, but frankly, the execution of this very simple concept can, and will, at times get redundant and tedious to partake into.\n\nEven then, however, the game has such a fantastic charm to it, I mean just the simple idea that the whole game is about coloring the world, quite literally, I just think that's a very creative way of handling a very beautiful, and relatively \"basic\" thought.\n\nThe characters are fun, and even if they don't talk that much besides in cutscenes, they managed to actually be quite distinctive from one an another, whilst also oozing charm, I didn't want anything to happen to this characters while I was playing it.\n\nAnd even if the game at times, can surprisingly, be incredibly dark, for the most part it always had a positive, and genuinely \"fun\" result.\n\nI really liked the game, but it isn't exempt of issues, and repetition, induced by its poor sense of direction, and its \"artificial\" lenght.\n\nFor the most part tho, I really enjoyed the game, it is a very beautiful, and charming experience, it's fun, and it's pure, it's innocent, but it respects my intelligence as a human being, it isn't a \"dumb\" game by any sense of the word.\n\nI recommend it, just, developers, if for one reason or another you're reading this, just make sure that you \"promote\" this game a bit more, I don't even know if that's possible up to this point, but I heard of this release because I frequent websites like reddit, and other similar ones, users, and fans, let me, as well as others, know about the existence of this version, then, an upcoming one at that.\n\nI believe the low player count has to do with that, and it can't be only attributed to the fact this is in a way a \"cult classic\" that at one point an time, was only available for a now, \"defunct\" platform.\n\nI guess I can only thank for the preservation of this game, the fact that this is an actual good version to play, run, looked, and played with a regular 360 controller perfectly fine.\n\nSo I recommend it, just get it on a sale if you can, and come open minded to it, you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1515187360, "timestamp_updated": 1515187360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38986131": {"recommendationid": "38986131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117345880", "num_games_owned": 1008, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514922723}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a pretty interesting game up until I landed on a platform in a weird way and caused the game to hard lock and needed to restart my computer.

Chances are I wouldn't run into this issue again, but getting burned this bad when I was almost finished with the level just left a bad taste in my mouth.  Also the camera was pretty wonky at times, and I found myself getting stuck on the corner of buildings quite often, which for a platformer like this pretty bad.  Cool concept for a game, just a poor execution with the really long main levels.", "timestamp_created": 1514923005, "timestamp_updated": 1514924541, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.367653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

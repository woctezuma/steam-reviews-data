It's Sturmovik? Well, F**kwolf would've been a much better name for a plane, anyway.\n\nLet's just say it hasn't aged well. The planes and custom missions and stuff are great. Planes even look good from the inside. The game is a... semi-sim? No idea. It feels somewhat realistic (not a pilot here!) and yet the physics are silly enough that you can't imagine real planes handling like that (you can turn the plane upside down on the runway without a lot of speed, effort or damage to the plane :D )\n\nI'd say the game excels in how much it wants you not to play it! Tutorials are excruciatingly boring and non-interactive with MS Paint text written over in red font. Not in comic-sans, sadly. The interface is terrible. It's both badly designed and bad looking. I had some pains getting it to run on Win 10 64-bit and now that it runs it's not as smooth as one would expect. The terrain looks like crap, so much disappoint. Graphics partially look like they were bad even when the game was new. The loading times are annoying, and omg how long did those last back in the day?! How is this being sold for 10 euro? There's abandonware out there that's worth more than this.\n\nTL;DR\nA confusing sim-y game that demands a joystick, a crapload of patience and a time machine to transport yourself back to when this was worth playing.\n\n[h1]4/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1516460312, "timestamp_updated": 1516460489, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39463894": {"recommendationid": "39463894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067062125", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "last_played": 1516389492}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0432 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435 \"\u0410\u0432\u0438\u0430-\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\"! \u0414\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0430. \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0451\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u0430 \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441. \u042f \u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0438 100 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u043e - \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e 10 \u0438\u0437 10!\n\n\u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441 \u0432 \"STEAM\" \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \"1C\" \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \"AleXserver\" - IP 217.78.176.50:21000 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438, \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0438.", "timestamp_created": 1516384696, "timestamp_updated": 1516384696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39426555": {"recommendationid": "39426555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056586583", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1516509649}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally glad to have this masterful game under my library, this has made many great memories, and it always feels good to go back into this game.

I do think you will want a flight stick if possible, and you can get by with a standard joystick, but this could be difficult with just a keyboard and mouse system.   \n\nI read a few other reviews, and none seem to talk about something special with this game, it is VERY VERY VERY modable. For Example:  The B.A.T Mod adds 2X the planes and some are the planes that never really got off the drawing board.  Also the mod adds jets, and does try and update the graphics somewhat.   Now with the mod it can change the requirments of your computer to need a more modern computer.   The BAT mod adds about 62 Gig of fixes, add-ons, missions, campaigns, and other good stuff.  (The Mod is not on Steam, you will have to google, find, then download and install it yourself)\n\nThis is my GOTO game, it is the game when I am board and just wanting to kill time.  I recommend it 10/10: But remember that it is a Simulation at heart, so don't expect the game to hold your hand as you fly around.

This is not a flight simulation, there are no startup procedures, the only thing you can turn on to make it more realistic is engine overheating, but all you have to do to control it is keep your throttle at 90% and prop pitch at 80%.  The cockpit is very boxy and you feel like your face is smooshed against the sights unless you put your FOV all the way back which makes spotting even harder.  Shooting down aircraft is pretty easy, even agile planes are fairly stable and once you get one burst off, their engine will just catch on fire. \n\nBasically I'll put it like this.  If the only other flying game you've played is war thunder, then this is a step up for realism and you can have some fun.  If you've ever played Cliffs of Dover on realistic then this is a major step down.  Don't get me wrong though, even if the planes are easy to shoot down, they are still fun to blow up.  The mission editor is really good too so if you want you can just spawn in ~500m from an enemy already in the air and dog fight them.  But since the takeoff is so easy and all you have to do is press \"I\" to start your engine then there is no point in starting on the ground (unless you've only played war thunder).\n\nAs for bombing, I haven't tried it because my experience with the fighters was so god awful.  I watched a video though and it looked like the bombsight was the same as in war thunder.  All you have to do is press some buttons to adjust the sight, similar to sighting in a gun on Arma, kinda just a couple clicks and your good to go.\n\nIf it's on sale for like $2-5 then go for it but I'm just warning you, even with the massive amount of content, there's not much you can do since the planes all pretty much fly the same and taking off from a runway to travel anywhere to fight will be pretty useless unless there are like 10 planes because chances are you won't be able to spot just 1 or 2.  Taking off and bombing something might be fun but I assume it would get boring after a couple times since the maps are so big and there is no engine managment you have to do and I don't even know if theres a way to accuratly navigate, It would just be: Press \"I\", climb, turn on autopilot, switch to bomber and increase bomb sights, bombs away, done.  At least in Cliffs of Dover you have to do the whole startup, manage your engine, navigate correctly, and you'll actually be able to spot your target before your right on top of it.\n\nTo give you a quick comparison, I have like 30 hours or something close to that in Cliffs of Dover, and I still sometimes accidently crash a plane during take off or landing, but in this I have taken off and landed perfectly every single time...2 hours played...also shot down the enemy in like 1 minute my first dogfight.  One burst hit him and his propellar just stopped moving and his plane caught on fire...\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1493528714, "timestamp_updated": 1493528714, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.305118", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31437970": {"recommendationid": "31437970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029789989", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 5601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509732994}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1493466132, "timestamp_updated": 1504419227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.319874", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31366242": {"recommendationid": "31366242", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981057746", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1515611137}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0439, \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432. \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u0438  \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443. \n\u041b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043b \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0434\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439, \u0438 \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0431\u043e\u044e, \u0437\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043e\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u0441 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0445\u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043d\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0432 \u0434\u043e \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0438.\n10 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1493160767, "timestamp_updated": 1493160996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585868", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31330138": {"recommendationid": "31330138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119097146", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486862020}, "language": "english", "review": "spicy", "timestamp_created": 1492989437, "timestamp_updated": 1492989437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31190291": {"recommendationid": "31190291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046431799", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491603815}, "language": "english", "review": "Get this.

It has many aircraft, single missions and even multiple campaigns to choose from. Thanks to the modding community there are many comprehensive mod upgrades for this game. Graphics, sound and flight characteristic improvements in the community mods that make this game almost the visual eye-candy that IL-2: Battle of Stalingrad is. The thing about IL-2 1946 is it covers all aspects of WWII flight combat from The Battle of Britain, The Western Front, Africa, The Eastern Front and all the Pacific battles. There are many aircraft to choose from and with the community mods the aircraft fly and look spectacular. \n\n12.4.2 is the latest and probably last version of this game, which is what you get when you purchase this from steam. I personally use HSFX mod for this game and you can easily find download information on the net or through YouTube videos for install. It\u2019s very easy and mainly just a few downloads and easy install instructions.\n\nMake sure you have a flight stick. Even though you can fly without one its recommended. Take the time to setup your flight stick in-game and you will not be disappointed with this game.

Selbst die Sp\u00e4teren ableger wie Battle of Stalingrad kommen nicht ann\u00e4hernd am Realismus an. ich kann lediglich  im LAN und gegen Bots teilen.\n\nf\u00fcr den recht g\u00fcnstigen Preis von 10 Euro (oder bei keysites 3-4) bekommt man eine Anf\u00e4ngerfreundliche und zugleich Hardcore Simulation dank beliebig einstellender Effekte. Wind, Turbulenzen, Truddeln ist alles einstellbar. Start und Landung  werden dadurch auch durch eine echte Erfahrung auf h\u00f6chsten schwierigkeits graden. Die schwierigkeit auf einfachsten grade kann man mit War Thunder RB vergleichen. auf Mittel schon fordernd. auf Experte wirste dich \u00fcber jeden Kill Tierisch freuen. Kurz gesagt die Flug Physik f\u00fchlt sich bombastisch an. das Schadensmodell l\u00e4sst sich auch sehen. man kann jedes Flugzeug sehr Detailreich zerlegen mit seiner Bewaffnung. man merkt jedes Loch den Flugmodell an. F\u00fcr die Fanatiker unter euch kann man dann noch jedes kleine Detail vom Flugzeug Steuerbar machen. Gemisch, batterie und all das Zeug wo ich nie durchblicken w\u00fcrde alles einstellbar.\n\ndie Steuerung (erst Tastatur sp\u00e4ter Joystick gewechselt) ist selbst mit Tastatur ganz angenehm, trotz typischer Pfeiltastensteuerung. man kriegt erstaunlich gut was gerissen mit etwas \u00fcbung auf leichteren Schwierigkeitsgraden. auf h\u00f6heren schwierigkeitsgraden herrscht dann Joystickpflicht denn dort brauch man dann pr\u00e4zise und sanfte bewegungen da man sonst ins truddeln und weiteres kommt.\n\nFlugzeuge...... zeigt mir ein Simulator der mehr bietet. ihr werdet ihn nicht finden. von 1930 bis 1945 ist eigentlich jedes bedeutende Flugzeug der Krieges dabei. es gibt sogar ein paar echte flieger aus dem jahre 1946 wie die P80 oder die Mig 9 aber auch ein paar Prototypen die es nur als Blaupause gibt wie die Ta 183 oder eine version der He 162. Mit weit \u00fcber 200 Flugzeuge auf seiten der Allierten, der Wehrmacht, den Japanern und den Russen. also auch Britische, Italie\u00e4nische und anderen Nationen sind dabei die zu den Allierten oder zur Wehrmacht geh\u00f6rten. wem es aber dann doch zu wenig wird hat eine gro\u00dfe auswahl an Mods. von 1 WK bis Moderne Jets ist alles dabei. wer also mal einen Nervenauftreibendem Fight mit 150 KMH in einer Holzmaschine haben will holt sich die flieger des 1WK. wer allerdings Taktisch mit Modernen equipment bei weit \u00fcber 1000 KMH K\u00e4mpfen will kommt nicht an Flugzeuge wie die Su25, Mig 21, F18 und Co vorbei\n\njetzt (immerhin f\u00fcr viele ein NoGo) die Grafik. es ist von 2006 also erwartet nicht den sch\u00f6nsten ausblick der Welt. der Boden ist einfach nur ne flache Landschaft mit ein paar \"B\u00e4umen\" oder viel zu kleinen Geb\u00e4uden. Die Flugzeuge sind aber Wesentlich Gut detalliert und darum geht es ja immerhin. F\u00fcr mich ist die Grafik kein Problem aber es gibt ja so manche leute die erwarten von Spielen wie dieses das sie ausehen wie ein Film. wer ein sch\u00f6n aussehendes Spiel haben will sollte lieber zu IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad greifen was aber wesentlich unrealistischer ist und nicht ann\u00e4hernd soviel inhalt bietet.\n\n\nFazit:\n+Realistische Physik (Flugmodell, Schaden)\n+Eine Menge Flugzeuge\n+Pr\u00e4zise Steuerung\n+Leicht und Schwer zugleich\n\n-Grafik \n-Musik (zumindets geht sie mir auf den.....)\n-Multiplayer Tod\n-Modding nicht leicht\n-paar verbuggte Flieger wie die Bi-6.\n\nInsgesamt ist es ein MUST HAVE f\u00fcr Flugzeugbegeisterte wie mich. dieses Spiel bietet mehr inhalt als die meisten Vollpreistitel jemals bieten werden und das f\u00fcr nur 10 euro.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1475944336, "timestamp_updated": 1475944336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25898685": {"recommendationid": "25898685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173853781", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504511039}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Great Game!!![/h1]\nThis game has tons of planes to fly but it does take a while to learn how to fly as you need to memorise lots of controls.

It's nothing like War Thunder, but instead better. For one, you can play offline against bots in 'Quick Mission Builder'. Two, with mods, you can fly the B-29 without having to spend 15 days online to unlock it [War Thunder, looking at you]. Some great mods to have with this is SAS Mod Loader, as well as AI Flyables. AIF allows you to fly the B-29, B-17, and even the Cherry Blossom [or 'Ohka'] kamikaze jet, as well as other aircraft. The damage modeling in this game could be better, eg. I was shooting a B-29 with the Me-262 [1946 version] and the wing just snapped right off like a twig. Also, you can't do any good crashes without skill, as in you'll explode if you flip upside down in a bomber on the ground. Overall, I rate this game a 9.5/10. The next IL-2 game I'm getting is Cliffs of Dover, if it'll run on my potato computer. But I can run 1946 at full graphics at the cost of 800x600 Res, so I think it'll run with some graphical tweaks. Anyways, If you're looking for a simulator that's not too challenging or not too boring, but also realistic, then you're in luck. I got this game on sale, for $6 CDN. I highly recommend this game to anyone who even knows only a little bit about WW2. It'll help you learn a little. The only complaint I have is the damage model needs to be a little more realistic.

I remember getting the original IL-2 Sturmovik/Pacific Fighters pack way back in 2005 as a starry-eyed little kid. I was fascinated with aircraft from this era and it's the main reason I know how much about them I do today. And then, suddenly, this new, vastly superior version appeared! I never begged my parents for something so badly in my life, but I NEEDED this as a child. And so I made the money to buy it. Best idea ever. It doesn't show it, but the amount I have played this game in so many situations must easily be at least 4,000 hours before getting it on Steam alone. But enough of my life story, let's get into the review of this.\n\nWhat makes this game appeal to someone like me? Vast amounts of aircraft stock in the game, hundreds of AI ground/naval vehicles to populate maps, and the fact that there's actually a very intuitive mission maker within the game itself. Throw in one of the newest massive modpacks (CUP/HSFX/DBW/etc.) and you're suddenly thrown into a game with hundreds of aircraft, amazing graphics, great missions, historical skins, and even more ground/naval cannon fodder. I greatly appreciate the attention to detail (especially for a game released in 2006) and historical value of this game. Some things aren't perfect, but hell, this was released almost a whole decade ago and is still rated as one of the best WWII Combat Flight Simulators out there.\n\nWell, that's great and all, but what are some dislikes? Well, I would say the graphics are fairly bad, but I cut it major slack for being made in 2006. There's also the incessant lawnmower for 90% of stock aircraft engines. Plus that music. I love the original 2003 vibes of the original and Pacific Fighters combined, but after playing both for 11 years, that has gotten under my skin to the point of muting the music. Some of the controls are difficult to master, and the game itself takes years to master. Hell, when I first started the series, it pissed me off. The tutorials and such are honestly shoddy and you really can't play this well without a joystick, but with even a low quality one in your hands, you can become proficient. All of my dislikes besides the joystick near-necessity (not really a complaint in my opinion) are with the stock game, and mods 100% cure all.\n\nPros:\nHeld up to time amazingly well\nCan be very relaxing\nAmazing 3D models (for the time)\nGreat flight characteristics\nIn-game mission editor\nMillions of options for custom missions\nNear-overwhelming amounts of mods due to roughly 10 communities, creating a very customizable environment\n\nCons:\nGraphics (Can be easily modded)\nSounds and Music (Again, mods)\nLack of hands-on tutorials\nAlmost requires joystick (But it's a simulator, not some arcade game)\n\nOverall:\n9/10. My all-time favorite WWII FCS, and one I've easily sunk thousands of hours into before adding to Steam. Supreme amounts of replay value, obscene amounts of content, and the best installment (personal opinion) in the series that set the foundation for modern WWII Flight Combat Simulation games to this day.", "timestamp_created": 1472117680, "timestamp_updated": 1472117680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25113225": {"recommendationid": "25113225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121983564", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498086852}, "language": "finnish", "review": "cyka", "timestamp_created": 1472047457, "timestamp_updated": 1472047457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25025507": {"recommendationid": "25025507", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991153471", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471064981}, "language": "english", "review": "I realise this will probably be downvoted into oblvion because of the rabid fanbase but it deserved an honest review.

I'm sure there is a very niche group of pepole that enjoy this level of masochism but frankly im just not seeing it. Now dont get me wrong i love flight games but this is a billion steps too far.

If you expect to be able to get off the ground when you start playing this you are gonna have a BAD TIME!!!! Thiis is a game that is HIGHLY over rated by its reviews and I will be requesting a refund so that I can get the Enhanced Edition of Assault Horizon a game which is extemely UNDERRATED by its reviews. I should add that the AI in this is severly broken enemys and allys both cheat like mad and none of the AI observe the realistic physics and often cannot land/take off themselves without crashing or running into a control tower.

It's not really a game but rather a WWII combat flight simulator with incredible depth and a large selection of available planes that come with great mechanical detail. Before you purchase or play this game you need to be prepared for that. Furthermore you have to prepared for the fact that there is no easy way in. You will need to spend several hours before you can even hit an enemy once. If you don't have a big interest in WWII warbirds from both sides there's nothing to keep you intrigued other than the gameplay which is incredibly customizable and deep though.\n\nEnter the big asterisk. Everything you get from the game is what you bring into it. There's no storyline, no interesting campaign, just no character to any of it, nothing to welcome you into the world of historical air combat. The \"training\" is laughable and the included missions are plain boring and uninspired. Unless you want to delve deep into the mission editor you're lost, the quick mission builder is less than stellar. The community is not very helpful either when it comes to modding the 15 year old engine so with every aspect of Il-2 you're basically left to your own devices. With a little effort from the developers this could have been a wonderful experience for a wider audience. Much older games like the Red Baron series have shown what an immersive campaign mode can add to a simulator. \n\nI can still recommend Il-2 though based on its mechanical strength and commendable wealth of content. Ever since my earliest childhood I've been a hardcore airplane nerd and just being able to fly my fantasy league of planes into combat with my entire keyboard scattered with shortcuts is enough to recommend this simulator to like-minded inviduals with too much time on their hands. Everyone else will be left standing in the rain. You will need patience, dedication and a good joystick and even then it's no guarantee you will like it.

In its current 1946 edition, you have a whopping number (229) of planes to choose from as well as dynamic campaigns for almost every theatre of operations from that war. The amount of setting customization is also an integral part of this game. You can never claim that it might be too difficult since you can tweak the options until you play an almost arcade version. And yet, this title is best played on a flightstick. The mouse and keyboard do a decent job, but they are far from ideal and this game takes some time getting used to, especially with the taking off and landing parts (both skippable). Age had taken its toll on the general aspect, but Sturmovik 1946 is far from bland looking and the sound score fits the game perfectly.\n\n[h1]Strong Points[/h1]\n+ Nice graphical details.\n+ Excellent diversity in both missions/campaigns and in the airplanes themselves.\n\n[h1]Weak Points[/h1]\n- No Steam Trading Cards or Achievements.\n\n[b]Rating 9/10[/b]\n \n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/sgiveaways]SUPER Giveaways[/url].[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1467528621, "timestamp_updated": 1472033739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665819", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23975265": {"recommendationid": "23975265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178159617", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513719955}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1467349990, "timestamp_updated": 1467349990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503976", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23952806": {"recommendationid": "23952806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172244531", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512849802}, "language": "czech", "review": "This is the best flight combat simulator ever\n", "timestamp_created": 1467288059, "timestamp_updated": 1467288059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23942118": {"recommendationid": "23942118", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963783942", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463775138}, "language": "english", "review": "$2.49 for the best ww2 CFS ever made??

(Oh yes). \n      +Flying a fighter and setting someone on fire or blowing an engine out of a twin engine aircraft or just shooting planes down in general is very very rewarding.\n      +The game has national voices. That means you'll her \"Cyka Blyats\" and \"UUURAAAAA\"s when you fly Russian.

When I saw it on steam I knew I had to get it and so far im not dissapointed. Im running Windows 10 and i've encounered no problems with it, I hope it's the same case for you if your looking to purchase.\n\nAnother heads up is that there is no mouse joy (you can't use a mouse to fly), that's fine for me beacuse I have a joystick but you will need either that or a controller (if supported). You will also need to have a thorough look at the controls. The game can be very difficult at times, remember to find FOV (Field of View) in the options menu and set bind keys to increase or decrease the FOV. Also have a look at the difficulty setting, there you can change things like blackouts and redouts, realistic pilot damage, head shake, etc. If you are in a struggle tweak around at the settings.\n\nGraphics still sort of hold up, its really not bad, there is no shading or ambient occulsion but still manages to look good. Just remeber to run the game with OpenGL, as it looks much better! (In options menu) When you first get into the game set up the game with the controls and setting you want. then head into either the tutorials or head into quick mission builder, here you can pick where you want to fly, who you want to fight and you can choose from a large variety of planes. There are a total of 4 nations to choose from.\n\nIf you are looking to buy this game, I hope this will help you, the only reason I made this \"review\" is because I saw people raging in the reviews cus they had no idea what was going on. Anyways IL-2 is still a lot of fun to this day and I still enjoy a battle now 'n then. I love this game and hope you will too.\n\nEDIT: You should Run the game with OpenGL, not DirectX as graphically, it looks a lot better!", "timestamp_created": 1466172850, "timestamp_updated": 1515514913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23572470": {"recommendationid": "23572470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058925509", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505662708}, "language": "german", "review": "FLUGZEUG !", "timestamp_created": 1466009478, "timestamp_updated": 1466009478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23548596": {"recommendationid": "23548596", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963324418", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500875767}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ucd5c\uace0 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc74c!", "timestamp_created": 1465890420, "timestamp_updated": 1465890420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23515012": {"recommendationid": "23515012", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994358795", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 86400}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd been flying for the better part of an hour over endless, shimmering blue waves before they came into sight. At first I thought it might be just a trick of my brain, as I had been straining my eyes toward the horizon for a long time. But no, it's not my imagination, there are the faintest shadows against the sky in the hazy blue distance. First just a few, then more, and as I fly closer they elongate and begin to take shape. A squadron of heavy bombers, at least 20 of them by looks of it, and they are on their way to drop a hundred thousand pounds of high explosives on our airbase. Well, not if I have anything to say about it.\n\nI pull back on the stick, climbing above the scatted, puffy-white stratus clouds and putting the incoming bombers a few thousand feet further below me. I let them come sliding underneath, and then I roll left and dive. The Gs push me back into my seat and I feel the blood rush from my head but I modulate my dive to avoid losing consciousness. In what feels like a matter of a few heartbeats I drop out of the clouds behind the squadron and get the tail-most bomber in my sights. The tailgunner has seen me and he opens fire, but its too late. A short burst from my cannons sets their right engine on fire. Another burst and the wing snaps like a twig in a gale, the bomber pitches sharply up and then topples over to the left. Thus begins their death spiral down into the sea below, a trail of black smoke highlighting the bomber's final path. I see a few white parachutes open along that trail of smoke but the helpless bomber crew no longer interest me. I'm getting near enough to the next bomber that their gunners start to open up, and white phosphorous tracer rounds are streaking past my cockpit glass. Cool, calm, collected... I feel the exhilaration of the kill but I ride the adrenaline smoothly.

I want to share with you my impression of Il2 1946 !\n\nThe game is still the same like 10 years earlier. The mechanics work great and feel realy realistic if you keep the right config. The game does also make a lot of fun if you play with your own rules and does never get boring. I have to admit that  I tried to play with Joystick and also just with my keyboard. I noticed that the experience you get while playing with a Joystick is much better because the aircrafts are better to fly and coordinate especially if you want to kill someone.\n\nIt is still possible to fly via only keyboard but i would not recoomend this at all. Less fun and feels less good.\nAll in all the Game is worth it just for nostalgia reasons alone but also for its cheap prize. 10 Euro isnt that much at all and for 2 Games its perfectly fine. Considering its works on every Windows like mine (Windows 10) I highly recommend you to buy this game.\n\nI`ll hope I could help you with your decission.\nYour german pall Ashoka Tano", "timestamp_created": 1463764077, "timestamp_updated": 1463764175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23095888": {"recommendationid": "23095888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005971335", "num_games_owned": 498, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 30779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515199206}, "language": "english", "review": "Still the best combat flight simulator I've ever played, and has *tons* of content.

so let's get right into this review. \n\nI'll start this off with, this might be one of the greatest World War 2 games I've ever played, and it is also very high up there on the best games I've ever played. This game has everything a good World War 2 dogfight game should have, and everything that its closest modern competitor, War Thunder, doesn't have. First, it has good controller compatibility (using outside mods, but still). Another thing that I cannot emphasize enough on, is the career. You can select from any country that had a flying airplane (and was important), and you can create your pilot, select your rank, earn rewards, and rank up. It's all pretty crazy. Now, I can't rate the multiplayer due to the fact that I haven't tried it, so I'm going to skip to the mission builders. Now, there are two kinds of mission builders, quick and full. Now, think of quick as sort of your instant action, you select your opponents, select your plane, select the number, select the map, and play. There is a couple additional features, like the mission type or the altitude, but those aren't as important. Then there is the full mission builder, the spot that I've spent the majority of my time in. You can select from a huge number of maps, then deploy the planes, artillery, boats, buildings, trains, bunkers, cars, motorcycles, etc. The list goes on. You then deploy waypoints and ya'll battle it out. It truely is amazing, for an early 2000s game, like 2001 or something is when it came out. This comes with a bunch of DLCs and additional content for only $10.\nGraphics\nAged very well. They are not bad, they are in the middle, but they still look fine for when it was made. \n\n\nTL:DR \nGameplay - 9/10\nContent - 10/10 \nGraphics - 7/10\nMission builder - 11/10 \nOverall - 92.5% Which is practically an A-.\n\nI may be overselling this game a little bit, but it is just plain amazing (haha get it?). I highly advise you buy it, unless you don't have a controller or flight stick, then don't buy it. If you're using a controller, download one of the many keyboard and mouse to controller programs like this: http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/\nHave fun and be Germany, they have sweet planes.\nSuch as the Me-262 with the 50mm cannon.\nYes.\n50mm.", "timestamp_created": 1462079391, "timestamp_updated": 1462483069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503224", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22722004": {"recommendationid": "22722004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163027933", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509464105}, "language": "finnish", "review": "this game is best", "timestamp_created": 1462019469, "timestamp_updated": 1462019469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22713595": {"recommendationid": "22713595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055470254", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513820785}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best flight sims also pretty cheap.

It just BARELY ran on my cheap, office desktop, and i had issues with the CPU overheating because of this game, but I played anyway because it was AMAZING. I had always been a fan of the WW2 flight sims from Microsoft, but this was a cut above. I really felt like I was IN the plane, not on a simulator. \n\nI had heard a lot of people saying that 1946 wouldnt work on Win 10. Recently, I heard a large number of people had success getting it to run. Since I hadn't enjoyed the game in 6-8 years, I dropped my $10 on trying it - and was blown away by how well it held up! See, I had just bought IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad a week prior, and was (still am) in love with it. However, I loved reading about all the old planes as a youngster, and to be able to fly 229 of the most famous, and the most obscure, aircraft of the era is like a dream come true. \n\nThe only gripe some may have are the interior visuals - they look very dated. They are, however, immersive, and entirely 3d, so It isn't unplayable. The exterior visuals really hold up well. If you compare it to BoS or Even \"Rise of Flight\" you can tell it's a bit older, but it still looks good. The worst textures come from ground units - tanks, jeeps, AA positions, all look like theyre from the 1990's, but since you won't see them for more than a second, I really don't notice.\n\nIf you're a Win 10 user, thinking about trying the more expensive BoS, maybe give this a try - I find myself playing it more than its hotter, newer sibling.\n\n:::UPDATE:::\n\nI ordered a USB Bluetooth adapter for my PC, as I play several controller-based games also. I neglected to remove my controller from both the USB charging cable, and the bluetooth device manager, and it ultimately deactivated my joystick. Once I realized the error, and removed my PS4 controller from the computer entirely, my joystick began to work again.

Although some other, like Battle of Stalingrad, has better graphic and physics (it's almost a decade now, of course physics gonna be improved), none have the same feeling, planes diversity, combat diversity, location, as 1946 has to offer. The flight sim itself can be set to multiple level of realism, allowing new rookies to take control with confident while learning to fly with easy flying mode, and allowing hardcore ace to feel the wind flow through the wing, to feel the recoil, and to feel the aircraft itself with full realistic setting.\n\nOkay, what I mean \"easy mode\" is that it's a simplified mode. It's not a face-pace arcade mode like War Thunder. The mission is the same as full realistic setting, only simplified some matter, like no spinning. Also, no aiming helper either. If you're looking for War Thunder's alternative, you're coming the wrong way. IL-2 1946 is far more realistic than War Thunder.\n\nBeside, another advantage is that they're freaking LOTS OF PLANES!!! More than 10 of Yak-9 subtype, 20 of Spitfire's subtype, dozen of A6M family, lots of Bf-109, etc, most come as realistic as you could find, and some paper planes are also fitted well within the game.

IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 it is!\n\nIL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 is a classic WWII plane simulator with many planes to fly. If you'd ever like a classic dogfight with a friend, this game is good. It is also a good game for stuff like LAN-parties as it can host servers on LAN-only.\n\nThis game might be really old, but it is just an absolute gem. It works on new computers (tested on Windows 10 and a gaming PC bought in the beginning of 2015, works perfectly fine in Full HD resolution). The game can literally work on any calculator you own as it is like 10 years old.\n\nDon't let that fool you though, this is quite a good plane simulator. To start up your plane, you need to do a lot of stuff before going into the skies. Physics can be as realistic as you want them to be. Unrealistic physics are the most fun, since can bounce into the sea and still fly, but realism mode changes all that except graphics-wise.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\n+ Both realistic and unrealistic can be amazing in their own ways\n+ Runs basically on any computer that uses Steam\n+ Compatible with new screens\n+ Hilarious glitches\n+ Great choice of WWII planes and even prototypes\n+ Great for LAN-parties\n\n- Quite an old game\n- Graphics are not the best in the world\n- Unrealistic mode glitches are fun, but sometimes not fun for your opponents\n- Render problems at some points (just check my oil lake pictures, that is meant to be a river and a lake)\n\n\nI CAN recommend this game to anyone who likes their plane simulators, but not everybody will like this ancient gem.

The campgain is a great time waster and has lots of good story to it.

The aircraft selection is massive so there is bound to be something you'll like flying. (my personal favourite is the Spitfire Mk.IX series. ) You can change the difficulty settings to configure the game from a semi-realistic flight game to a hardcore sim.  In the Campaigns (some of which are dynamic) you can find yourself dogfighting over the lakes of Finland, intercepting bombers over Stalingrad, operating from carriers at Midway, escorting B-29s over Japan and much more.\n\nThe game is old so the Graphics aren't insane but gameplay-wise it's awesome.\n\nDespite most the negative reviews, you do not need any kind of specialist equippment like Joysticks, Rudder pedals or Track IR.  My friend, Shas'O Bongosun, (who has flown over 200 hours in the game.) only uses keyboard and mouse and he's a good pilot.

If you get this game, one of the first things that you will notice about it, is that it isn't exactly the easiest game to learn to like. The tutorials that are available to you do not put you at the controls of the aircraft you're being taught to fly, but rather make you watch another person fly it the way it's supposed to be flown. Really, the only true way you can learn to play the game is to start it up, and begin playing it immediatly. No tutorials, no help. Trust me, you will die. A lot.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and tell you the things that you likely won't like about this game at first. 1: There are no \"Real\" tutorials that teach you how to play as I've said before, meaning the only way for you to learn to play the game is through jumping right in.\n\n2: The controls and flight characteristics are very realistic, meaning that if you haven't played a Flight Simulator before, there are hundreds of ways that you can screw yourself over without actually getting into combat, such as putting yourself into a Flat Spin, Stalling Out, Ripping Your Wings, Overheating Your Engine, etc.\n\n3: There can literally be a use for every single button on your keyboard, meaning that hitting one wrong button can mean instant death.\n\n4: This game is unbelievably difficult to master in terms of everything, from flight controls to maneuvers to landing.\n\nWith all of these negativities said, it doesn't sound like a very fun game, now does it? That's where you're wrong. I believe that the people that made this game were absolute geniuses. This is the number one thing about this game - you need to be patient. You will die several times before actually learning to kill anything, but once you do learn, once the little mechanism inside your brain clicks with this game, it will be one of the most fun World War Two Flight Simulators you've ever played. \n\nThe Bottom Line is, this game isn't for people that give up easily. This game is for people who are patient, and people who are willing to learn. Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes I do, but only if you are willing to learn the complexities of it.

You can see realistic aerodynamics, ballistic trajectory,  angle of attack stalls, overheat, spins ( you need to know how to proper get out or it will spin until hit the ground ), torque effect, potential energy, and much more.

It is a shame that BoS and CloD failed to deliver.  All they had to do was take the original game and make the graphics pretty.  The details and amount of content in IL-2 Sturmovik 1946 is far superior.  The community is small but strong.  The problem is that there are so many mods for the game that the community is split up.   I was so hoping that these new titles would unite the community under one patch and allow these games to thrive.  Unfortuanetly they were unable to deliver so i find my self playing a 11 year old game that is better then anything out there.\n\nWe can't really blame the devs for everything the die hard community is very demanding.  I think 1946 hit a perfect balance of engine managment that neither of these new games do well.  None of the settings for the engine managenemt in 1946 would cause you to blow the engine unless you ran it full  throttle and let if over heat or played with the prop pitch and over spun the engine.... there was engine managment but very little of it was engine breakering unless you were really pushing the limits. CloD i can't take off without blowing a gasket or perforating a radiator and I don't know why which just makes it so frustrating that I have no interest in learning, so only the die hards will play this game so the community will be small which will make the Devs little money and low motive to update or release patches.  This can already be seen as the community of die hards has taken this over releasing their own patches for the game.\n\nBottom Line is I am just disapointed and will have to wait many more years for a decent flight sim to come out and actaully push my graphics card and wow my senses.

If you just want to mess around with the crash physics or anything else, you could always just do a quick mission. This game is excellent, I HIGHLY recommend it. But if you already own it, be sure to install the HSFX mod that enhances the game's sound effects, adds newer aircraft (such as the F-86 Sabre and MiG-15 and MiG-17) as well as letting you fly (nearly) every aircraft in the game possible.

Dieses Spiel ist kein kurzfristiger Spa\u00df, sondern einer den man sich erarbeiten muss. Ich vergleiche es deshalb gerne mit Dark Souls der Simulatoren, wo jeder Funke Freude, sei er auch nur so klein, hart erarbeitet werden muss, wodurch dieses Spiel aber auch gleichzeitig so belohnend ist. \n\nWer mit Flugzeugsimulatoren noch nicht viel zutun, hatte sollte dennoch zulangen, da das Spiel spottbillig aktuell verkauft wird und auf gog noch billiger f\u00fcr gerademal 4\u20ac~.\nWenn es Fragen gibt k\u00f6nnen, diese gerne gestellt werden, so auch Anfragen zu Multiplayern etc., da ich mit anderen Piloten einen Server betreiben, mit eigenem Mumble (sowas wie TS\u00b3) und eigenen Tools f\u00fcr das Spiel.

Whether its making your own Career as a fighter over Stalingrad, or making your own Insane missions in the great mission builder, this game is the best Combat Flight sim i have ever played.\n\nDynamic campaigns mean you'll never quite have the same mission twice (Although alot of the times you'll be doing the same thing depending on your aircrafts role, but in different locations against different amounts and types of enemys) while still getting in Historic battles such as Stalingrad, Berlin, or Midway (And everything between). If thats not your thing or you feel its too repeatative, then check out the mission editors.\n\nQuick Mission Builder is an easy and fast way of making anything from Bombing missions to straight up massive dogfights. You simply just choose what aircraft you want to fly and how many squadmates and your Allies and Enemys, Pick the loadouts, skins, and countries. (You can fly an American plane as a German if you want) Then get into the action and deal with whatever you threw at yourself.\n\nFull mission builder is a bit different.....and i mean alot different. You control every aspect of basically anything. Control weather, time, Cloud height and make buildings and objects. You want a plane to take off, fly to somewhere along a specific route and altitude? Done. You want to patrol something? Done. Do you want Tanks and AA guns on the ground supporting or making your own Ground offensive? Done! You can even position Static cameras for those moments you just want to sit back and watch the carnage. Blow up and damage cities with a simple slider and clicks. Hell you can make planes Kamikaze things if you do it right. One of my personal favorites is to make roughly 50 aircraft, Fighers, Bombers, whatever, and fly them straight it to a massive area filled with AA guns and just try to survive for as long as you can while watching shit get blown up.\n\nAll and all i would give it a 10 out of 10. The only big downside i see is that there is alot of planes you cant fly, (there is still a good number of flyable ones though ;3 ) but i know there is mods out there that will litterally make everything flyable and even add more. Fuck you can get Atomic bomb mods if you want. The modding comunity is amazing.\n\nAnywho thats enough of my rant.

Then select old_version, ignore the code box, then apply. It'll start!\n\n\nAn oldie but a goodie!\n\nIL-2 Sturmovik has developed from an Eastern Front ww2 flght sim into an absolute monster! It's detailed, unforgiving at times, takes effort to get into, and has a steep learning curve. Despite, or because of all of that, it's an awesome game. Given it's pretty old now, most mid range systems will do well with this. The graphics were good for its time, and still hold up ok in the sky. \n\nThere's a huge online community of verteran players making all sorts of custom missions and skins for this game. Skins are easy to import. \n\nThese days there's plenty of action for the other fronts of WW2 as well, especially in the Pacific.\n\nDamage is well modelled, flight characteristics have been well researched, with only a few glitches, and aircraft interiors are beautifully done. Oleg , the man who started all this, was insistent that no aircraft be imported until the cockpit was fully accurate.\n\nI'd recommend this for someone who has an interest in flight from this era, and is willing to put in the hours to learn to fly adequately. I'd suggest starting not in your favorite aircraft, but something more forgiving like an IL-2 to learn to fly. Eventually you'll be able to handle other aircraft no problem. Landing is a big challenge, I've played over 2000 hours on this game back in its CD only days and I'm still  more nervous about landing than combat!\n\nThere's also some \"what if?\" aircraft included, hence the title 1946. They're fun, and make for an interesting experience, but don't add to the realism. There's some fascinating player made 1946 missions out there well worth playing.\n\nThis is not for the casual gamer. I can't stress this enough.

It has become a bit of a cult following with several loyal players continually playing, hosting, creating skins, missions and campaigns. \n\nIt is probably one of the longest running dedicated combat sims which though using a limited and dated engine, is still able to satisfyingly emulate the widest scope of aviation combat centered around World War 2 in varying difficulty levels and complexity. It has over 150 flyable aircraft from varying aspects of nearly all theaters of operations as well as associated maps. It includes pilot campaigns from nearly all sides, a quick mission builder and a full mission builder. But most of it's contemporary strengths come from beautifully made skins, missions, campaigns and utilities from it's many followers and fans that run the gamut of historical to flights of fantasy. \n\nIt's latest version is 4.12.2m (which is the latest steam version - No patching needed!) which has been officially updated by a group called Team Daidalos (rumor has it they are even working on 4.13!) has added flyable aircraft, tweaked graphics and sounds and additional mission building options and objects. (it even now has the option to add 3rd party \"Online sounds\" and still be a 'stock' game) It's multiplayer capability is via Hyperlobby where you can usually fly and/or host missions, join dedicated server maps, or get limited help from people there.\n\nBesides the stock game, many have added one of the popular mods to add even more popular aircraft, different flight models, digitized sounds, improved graphics and mission building options and objects. (Most mods can be switched to stock easily via a simple program).\n\nIt has the added advantage of being able to run smoothly (A critical point in combat flight sims) on most older systems.\n\noh, I have purchased 2 retail box versions and the steam version so I've played a bit more than 10 minutes..  :)\n\n(I have \"Il-2:Cliffs of Dover\" and \"Il-2: Battle of Stalingrad\" and I [i]still[/i] enjoy \"Il-2 Sturmovik:1946)", "timestamp_created": 1419658680, "timestamp_updated": 1419658680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13586514": {"recommendationid": "13586514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158682823", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450765774}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3044\u30be\uff5e\u30b3\u30ec!(\u3054\u6e80\u60a6)\u3000\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3080\u306b\u306f\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u68d2\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3060\u30be", "timestamp_created": 1419507534, "timestamp_updated": 1419507534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461930", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13565692": {"recommendationid": "13565692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080280619", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505888883}, "language": "english", "review": "My first impressions after about a day:\nI decided to start a hungarian campaign in this game, and to my surprise found it to be extremely in depth and of high quality.

J\u00e1 tinha reparado que os gr\u00e1ficos do jogo eram excepcionais para a \u00e9poca e a jogabilidade prometida parecia \u00f3tima. Ainda assim, nunca consegui aprender a jogar direito. Naquele tempo, eu mal sabia uma palavra de ingl\u00eas e n\u00e3o conseguia entender praticamente nada nos tutoriais. Logo, qualquer dificuldade para aprender a jogar podia se dever \u00e0 minha incapacidade para entender os tutoriais.\n\nComprei o jogo novamente este ano com a esperan\u00e7a de jogar o que n\u00e3o pude h\u00e1 cerca de dez anos. Embora os gr\u00e1ficos dos cen\u00e1rios estejam muito aqu\u00e9m dos padr\u00f5es atuais, os avi\u00f5es ainda s\u00e3o bastante detalhados e bem modelados at\u00e9 para os jogos de hoje. J\u00e1 quanto \u00e0 jogabilidade, eu diria que o jogo \u00e9 realista at\u00e9 demais. Isso n\u00e3o deveria ser um problema, at\u00e9 porque poderia ser facilmente resolvido com os tutoriais (que, hoje, j\u00e1 consigo compreender). A grande quest\u00e3o \u00e9 que h\u00e1 milh\u00f5es de tutoriais e aparentemente todos s\u00e3o apresenta\u00e7\u00f5es de, no m\u00ednimo, dez ou quinze minutos mostrando como pilotar o avi\u00e3o, sem dar nenhuma chance para voc\u00ea fazer na hora o que est\u00e1 sendo ensinado ali. Se voc\u00ea tiver (MUITO) tempo e paci\u00eancia para assistir \u00e0s apresenta\u00e7\u00f5es e ficar testando o que aprendeu no jogo propriamente dito, recomendo comprar este pacote. Agora, se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tiver (meu caso), garanto que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o vai conseguir pilotar nada. Qualquer manobra com o avi\u00e3o faz com que ele entre em estol (stall ou perda de sustenta\u00e7\u00e3o) e caia. Voc\u00ea pode at\u00e9 desabilitar o estol e outros milh\u00f5es de poss\u00edveis problemas aerodin\u00e2micos. Isso vai fazer com que o jogo fique menos realista, mas garanto que o avi\u00e3o n\u00e3o vai ficar t\u00e3o mais f\u00e1cil de pilotar.

The game had a number of substantial updates since its release, with the most recent being just last year (2013), though I'm not so certain if the game will see as much now with Battle of Stalingrad on the table. A plus in my book, some aircraft that have multiple crew stations can be manned by human players in multiplayer, so there's a possibility you can even get friends who don't care for flying to join in.\n\n If you're looking for a solid World War 2 to 1946ish era flight sim, this is a safe pick and you especially can't really go wrong with it if you get it on sale. If you're new to the flight sim scene, I would suggest trying the A6M but be careful of your dive speed. If you excede 350mph, you could cause damage to the airframe --even to where the wings tear off...\n\nEdit ( undated ) : I was just thinking about this review the past few days and it occurred to me that I should mention (emphasize) that this game is a flight sim and not an arcade style flyer. A flight stick is highly recommended for this game because flying with mouse and keyboard is going to give you a pretty lousy experience.\n\nEdit ( 2017/06/28 ) :\n I haven't looked at this review in a while but the game came up in conversation recently and I thought I would check on the status of its updates. Steam only updates the game to 4.12.2m while  C1 has released patches up to 4.13.3m with a smaller fix in 4.13.4 (see Link 2)\n\n  - I don't keep up with the online community but apparently 4.12.2m has the largest selection of mod packs and I don't know what the majority of online servers are running. The best thing to do in that regard is to do some research on your own and decide what direction you want to go.\n\n \u2022 If you want to patch up to 4.13.4 , look here :\n     http://www.mission4today.com/index.php?name=Knowledge_Base&op=show&kid=584\n      Then look here :\n     http://forum.1cpublishing.eu/showthread.php?t=229975\n\n \u2022 If, for whatever reason, you need to roll back to 4.12.2, you can look here :\n     http://www.sas1946.com/main/index.php/topic,55464.0.html \n\n \u2022 Two large communities you can look at, including mods :\n     1)  http://www.mission4today.com/index.php\n\n     2)  http://www.sas1946.com/main/", "timestamp_created": 1417441761, "timestamp_updated": 1498690741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13172367": {"recommendationid": "13172367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165887586", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476469648}, "language": "english", "review": "Hellooo. I used to have IL-2 Forgotten Battles, but I decided to replace it with this. I have only played a little bit, but I think it is enough to write this review. Buying the thing was pretty simple but I had problems starting the game up. It was extremely frustrating but I submitted my problem to Steam Support, got an answer instantly,  followed the instructions that they gave me and it worked perfectly. IL-2 is of course getting old, but it has it's advantages. It plays very smoothly on my computer (A windows 7 that is kinda clogged with stuff that has built up over the years) and you get more options than newer sims. I thought this would be a good purchase instead of a newer one, since I get so many aircraft. IL-2 Sturmovik Battle of Stalingrad (recently released) is a great, high-end sim, but you can only fight with Russian and German planes and during the same time of year and the same location. This was a better option for me because I can fly what I feel like flying. Just today I reanacted Pearl Harbor, then I flew a 1944 USAAF mission over Europe. Also the game has language of course, and some noseart is a little, well, you know. But this can be fixed. You can switch off subtitles, and for languages that you can understand you can simply delete the \"bad word\" files. And nose art files you dont approve of can be deleted also. If my instructions arent very clear, I'm sure you can look up how to do it. Anyways, the aircraft selection is wonderful, you can fly aircraft from all the major powers, (some smaller countries too). You can fly alot of stuff from 1930s biplanes, P-51s, all the way up to late WW2 jets, including some wacky German experimental aircraft. Also, a very neat feature is that you can take a picture of your face and use it to make your own pilot! You can zoom in on your plane and it's you in the cockpit! I love it. You can create your own nose art and slogans too, along with entire paint jobs. But I dont know a whole lot about that besides adding art and text to the plane. So yeah, overall I would recommend it, it works for me. \"You stay classy\". *clicks tongue, puts on goggles, and flies away* Merry Christmas by the way.

They're better at carpet-bombing and torpedoeing.\n-A few missing planes from the aircraft selection, I unfortunately didn't see any P-40Ms, or any F8F Bearcats, still a very wide selection, again, most of it can be fixed with mods.\n\nTo sum it up, with how many pros I gave this game, this game doesn't lack in anything really, it does it's job, an air combat sim. I found it hard to find any negatives, but if you've got the money, definately buy the game, it's well worth the price if you're a fan of WW2, and or aircraft.\n9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1416491163, "timestamp_updated": 1461084751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447245", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12941276": {"recommendationid": "12941276", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971995637", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413175468}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game ,may be old but still lots of content being made for it visit the SAS forums a must very replayable lots of mods and mission and campaigns and a full mission editor that isnt to hard to grasp to make your own missions .", "timestamp_created": 1415997189, "timestamp_updated": 1415997189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999286", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12932513": {"recommendationid": "12932513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048895197", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 14759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504413905}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing simulator, you need to buy it.\nI got a couple of mods installed, but it is absoutlutly amazing.\nLove it, Mustangs in there, all amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1415936600, "timestamp_updated": 1415936600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12883778": {"recommendationid": "12883778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005578711", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1355731200}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd rather watch paint dry than play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1415683579, "timestamp_updated": 1415684211, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.139115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12883654": {"recommendationid": "12883654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040337513", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477338878}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply the best flight/combat sim I have ever had the pleasure of playing.", "timestamp_created": 1415682654, "timestamp_updated": 1415682654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12821213": {"recommendationid": "12821213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010323831", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508398775}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0433\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0437\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u044e \u0430\u043a\u0441\u0451\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0443", "timestamp_created": 1415309237, "timestamp_updated": 1415309237, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.339365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12817279": {"recommendationid": "12817279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012844553", "num_games_owned": 1335, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416575351}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor simulador de la WW2, lejos.

If you can get your hands on a joystick that will handle Pitch, roll, Yaw, and throttle, that's optimal. If you can only get a stick that does Pitch, roll, and throttle, like the logitech Attack 3, you can do what i do and plug in another usb controller (ps4 controller, wired 360 controller, anything with a stick) and map the rudder to one of the sticks on that.

It is then up to you to choose a country to work for and do what you do best, that is sabatoge of enemy bases. After choosing your country, you will be brought to a menu where you are given a briefing on your mission.  Here, you can customize John's loadout, equipment and even choose apropriate camoflauge for the mission.  You are then thrown into a giant open world map, with multiple routes to complete your objective. you are also sometimes given a set of more than capable AI teamates.  This is all very nice and well implemented, it's just to bad that they didn't focus more on the \"game\" part of this \"game\"\nThe amount of controls for this game are absolutely ludicrous.  You will probably end up having to rebind and memorize over 100 different keystrokes just to make the game playable.  After that, you will of course try and move to your objective. However, the developers of this game didn't understand the concept of a \"stealth\" game.  Any time you try and move john around, you might as well be playing the sound of a b-52 bomber over a boombox at full volume.  It is not remotely possible to sneak around in this game.  On top of this, if you try to turn John around to fast or make to sudden a move, he will fall over to the ground faster than a boombox playing the sounds of a b-52 at full volume being hurled out the back of a b-52.\nYou might be thinking now \"Well if I can't get close to the enemy, I'll just take them out from far away.\"  That's just the problem.  Every weapon in the game has no silencer. You might as well be firing rockets, dropping bombs or shooting a .50 cal machine gun at them.

(except the Nazi secret aircraft added in the 1946 edition).\nYou can play story campaigns, dynamic campaigns and single missions.The game includes a very advanced campaign editor that lets you create your own campaign and missions.\n\nTo truly have fun in this game you need to play multiplayer or get into the modding scene. However matchmaking is not possible from within the game and you need to get Hyperlobby (which is free). Once you have that installed you can easily join multiplayer matches.\n\nA huge (and still active) modding community keeps adding new content and really adds to the games replay-ability.

Being thousands of FT/Meters up in the Blue Yonder is still kind of nerve racking on a Modern Commercial flight. Let alone with 1940's Tech and Enemy combatants trying to ruin your experience a la The Sun to Icarus. \n\nConsidering the age of this Fine title it's still Very Much a Beautiful ode  to those who actually went through this interesting era in History.\nDetailed damage modeling from portions of your Aircraft getting blown away, sometimes affecting your Plane's controls an functions. Fuel leaks & Fires, Instrument Panels destroyed in the Cockpit.  Pilots can be Wounded in various locals of Body causing control to get progressively worse as you bleed out or Insta-Death. \n\nAll Depending on where the plane was hit.\n\nTurbulence, Wind, Stalls, RedOut and BlackOut from pulling hard G's is also modeled. \nAll wrapped in a lovingly crafted Flight Engine, that still stands well against Time. Allowing you to take to the AirWar with a Ridiculously extensive list of flyable Machines each with their own Characteristic Charms. \nIt culminates into a package that breathes Visceral Life into those Noble Duels between Men at a time foregone; The perfect melding of Man and Machine...Air Combat of WWII.\n If that's what you're looking for then, IL2 1946 completes the mission....Like a Ace.\n \nOfficial patches dropping seldom to maintain the game and still adding Planes. Not to mention the likewise Legendary Modding Community. That is Still active in bringing Great content such as Skins, Cockpits, Planes, Gfx packs, Sound Packs, Maps, Missions & Campaigns. New Theaters to Fly even, WWI(DBW1916)& JetWar '56!

RPGMaker is a useful tool which you can use to create interesting games, but the Steam store is flooded with cookie-cutter save-the-world RPGs. I've enjoyed many RPGMaker games, though pretty much all of them were horror games that had little do with actual fighting.\n\nMy initial misgivings, understandable as they were, were quickly dashed with clever, witty writing. This is no Shakespeare, don't get me wrong, but any game that gets me to laugh for a minute straight as a result of a well-delivered joke is fine in my book.\n\nThis isn't to say the experience is all about going from one joke to another. It's more like a mission to stop evil interspersed with enjoyable banter and serious moments, bolstered by an interesting selection of metal music.\n\nI liked the fact that exploring the world was a reward in itself, not just a way to accrue experience points. I have to admit I've never played a game where the heroes remarked on the stuff they were finding. All too often you find strange objects in other games and no one even bats an eye. This game has spoiled me in this regard.\n\nThe battles were ok. They weren't frustrating or anything, and there was a large variety of mooks to defeat, but at the same time it all flew by really fast. Maybe I'm just too used to this. I did, however, like the in-battle dialogues, they spiced things up during the big encounters.\n\nAll in all, this game was a pleasant surprise and I've enjoyed every minute of it. I'll be keeping tabs on what the dev cooks up in the future. Perhaps a sequel?

Its world is full of small details, such as funny notes and Easter eggs.  Each character you encounter has their own dialogue, much of it being absolutely hilarious.\n\nMy one criticism of the game is in that some of the dialogue feels a little forced when attempting to be dramatic, similar to an epic B movie from the 80's.  While this is a criticism, it's not actually a detracting factor and actually seems to enhance the experience.  While playing Metal as Phuk, you might experience a feeling similar to, say, watching the original Evil Dead; there is comedy, there is drama, there is an element of horror, but most of all there is a feeling of \"god dammit, this kicks ass\".\n\nIf you are looking for a difficult game, this isn't it (nor is it intended to be).  Metal as Phuk is intended, as the creator notes, to make you laugh.\n\nOn a technical note, due to the engine used to develop the game, you cannot change resolution so when you first launch the game it will come up in a small window.  To fix this, hit ALT+Enter, and you're off living the Fullscreen-Fantasy^TM.  You may also want to adjust your volume prior to starting the game, as the music is as loud as it is rockin'.\n\nOverall, this game is a must have.

You really need to be a fan of various metal bands and the genre in general to pick up on a lot of the jokes, but yeah, it was pretty cool.

By end game that's not much of a problem, since the final dungeon is pretty damn short.  However the final boss leaves a lot to be desires, since its a forced loss fight, if he had enough strength that he wiped your team within 3 turns that'd be one thing.  However most of his moves take quite a bit to kill you.  It's made worse by the fact that his only screen nuke (fire breath) is well fire, and all your characters RESIST FIRE!   This is such a dagarn joke when you fight him.  Plus its kind of a rule that you do not have a forced loss final boss unless you have a game that's a direct sequel, but maybe that's just me.\n\nHowever I think that based on this game they will make a far more enjoyable sequel, and I'm looking forward to playing whatever it is!", "timestamp_created": 1512318351, "timestamp_updated": 1512318351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.392857", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38025928": {"recommendationid": "38025928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440834666", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512294031}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful and hilarious adventure of epic metal proportions!\n\nDo you like fantasy?

Any game that takes on the Metal genre is already a great game.  But now can that great game become something I really love.  I could name a few examples where I expected this to happen but didn't.  I could also name a few that barely where even a bit better than my expectations simply cause it's claims to be a metal type game.  So in this case I'll grade this game in two ways.  One, how it compares to other games in general and two, how it compares in the Metal genre of games.\n\nI did not go into this game with very high expectations.  As stated previously it can't be all that bad after all it's got Metal as a backdrop.  So comparing it against other games in general I'd say it met or overcame my expectations.  The only negative in general thing I have to say about the game overal is the lack of graphical settings but I soon found myself forgetting about that and enjoying the story/gameplay/music/fights/explorations just to name a few things that helped me forget.  I'll mention the others below when comparing it against Metal games.  Seriously, great, funny story telling even if you don't get the Metal references that are a plenty.  The turn based combat is simple to pick up and easy to plan your attacks.  The art work isn't perfect but it sure as hell isn't any where close to the worse I've seen.  Overal I'd leave you with this.  I have a major gaming ADD problem and using a first time out in a game I'm lucky to play an hour.  Next thing I new I was at 2 1/2 hours in this game and it was past my bedtime.\n\nNow to compare it against other Metal games this is one of my top 2 or 3 games.  Hands down the most fun, less stressful, great metal riffs (although I wish it had a bit more to begin with), and helped me totally escape reality.  OH and I laughed so hard at this game.  Any metal head will love the metal references.  They are in your face.\n\nThanks Crankage Games for a fun game.  I think sometimes developers forget the fun part in gaming but you sure didn't.

I wasn't expecting much when I picked this up. I fully expected this to be just another generic rpg maker game, with just some shameless metal pandering tossed around here, and there. I was pleasently wrong about this game.\nThis is a rpgmaker game, and there are some stock assest used here and there, but surpisingly this game has a decent amount of orginal assests. The soundtrack deserves  a special mention as it is really great, and the dev should consider having it up as a DLC option.\n\nMetal as Phuck has great atmosphere and many moments that will make you think \"damn that was phuking metal.'\nThis game  isn't your standard recruit the character, do their little quest and then forget they even exist, until some plot makes them relevant again  later in the game.Each of the characters have distinct personalities, will give their take on things, and will be very talkative throughout the journey. The banter between chracters reminds me very much of the old Lunar jrpgs. Also just like Lunar most  objects are interactive  rewarding maybe finding items. some character comenting on it or even a  small amount of xp for clicking the random thing. People with OCD beware as you will be clicking up a storm trying find everything.\nPlenty of metal references are littered thoughout the game, some are mainstream freindly, with others being a bit obscure that will make you smile if you recognize them.\n\nThere are a couple of  negatives though. The battle system is for the most part cookie cutter rpgmaker fare with the standard attack, magic, item etc...options. The game is fairly challenging, but the afortmentioned bare basic battle system doesn't light the world on fire in the excitement category. Metal as Phuk is also on the short side. If you count my idling  you can beat this game in under 5 hours.  In a way that can  be a +  as it is a very entertaining 5 hours, and  Metal as Phuk does not wear out its welcome like a lot of other comedy focused rpgs end up doing.

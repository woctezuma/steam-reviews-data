We don't know if the developers will implement smart or stupid design decisions. And we don't know it will be worth the $47, or $19, or $1 they'll charge for it.\n\nYet all the reviews here are reviewing that hypothetical nonetheless, rather than the extremely tiny demo in front of you.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nNevrosa: Prelude isn't a game. It's an interactive trailer. The install takes far longer than exhausting its content, which is about 10 minutes if you don't know what you're doing, 2 minutes if you do. That's not an exaggeration. That's why even a 50 second trailer video (in Steam) repeats so much of itself. There is nothing more to see in Nevrosa: Prelude.\n\nSo watch the video, then see if you feel like doing it again interactively. \n\nI don't recommend it because I don't recommend advertisements to people. There are plenty of free VR games out there that respect the player's time by giving them something to play. The Lab. Bullet Train. Lucky's Tale.

I liked this. There were had other novelties as well, such as the ability to die, and the spider-key interaction -- don't touch the sides! Making the player tiny (and redirected walking in general) is in my opinion, the most effective, and immerse VR locomotion system, and should be employed whenever possible.

The wonderful pixel art, the interesting enemy types, the sleepless David Stark who, even though the game keeps popping up with problems, continues to bring out as many updates and patches as humanly possible all add to a wonderful game which never ceases to bring me amusmant in a gaming community so badly plagued by meaningless games or half finished projects which showed such hope. And although David himself may not see this, I would like to say, redouble your efforts because your are being backed and cheered on by a community who honestly enjoy your game. Furthermore as a final note your game is truly a memorable one.

If you are watching the videos and looking at it as someone who likes designing ships, but really would just like to play an RTS, it's something less of a no-brainer as designing is by far the more indepth part, but obviously something about the game is appealing to you, or you wouldn't be reading these reviews!\n\nBasically, airships is a sort of super-lite 4x. You design and build ships using a plethora of different modules, and send them out to fight other fleets and conquer cities on a real time strategy map. This will earn you more funds for bigger, better ships, as well as various technologies that you can then incorporate into your ship. The combat itself is pretty much what it looks like in the videos, but can actually involve some fairly complex tactics.\n\nCons: Campaign isn't super fleshed out and is pretty simple in terms of what you can do. That said, it's evolved a TON since I bought this game a couple years ago, and is going in a good direction - it's gone from being basically just a map to look at in between fights to a fully moddable strategic game in and of itself, with a few different neat features. Still, this game is fundamentally a sandbox game, which depending on what you like may grow dull, and while a story may come some day, it's not a priority. \n\nThere's some limits placed on ship design, such as number of crew you can have, that might seem kind of arbitrary to someone with a decent PC, but are there to keep people with potatoes like mine from having performance issues. \n\nFrom my understanding multiplayer only gets turned on at preset times unless you're playing a LAN game, mostly in an effort to have enough players online at the same time to make it fun.\n\nPros: Pretty much everything else, it really is a well-made, well-designed game. \n\nIt will run on crap computers. \n\nShip design is deep, and everything is easily moddable. \n\nActual combat can require a bit of skill. \n\nYou can't tell from the video, but the explosion effects, the smoke (it will build up and linger if there's no wind on a given map), the impact of cannon balls, it's just all very well done and the game itself is incredibly beautiful. \n\nThere's a replay feature that allows you to replay literally any fight you've had with the computer controlling both sides, so you can easily make .GIFs (using the built in button) or videos of cool stuff like you dumping 40 marines on to the top of an enemy blimp.\n\n\n\nTo restate it, the only reason I would not recommend this game to you is if you don't think you'll have fun designing airships and landships and forts and such, because it's a crucial, and often time consuming ('easy to learn, hard to master\" type time consuming), part to the game.", "timestamp_created": 1513639160, "timestamp_updated": 1513644579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38387361": {"recommendationid": "38387361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297481183", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1514052867}, "language": "english", "review": "Anyone who says this game is bad is stupid.

Also, the soundtrack is incredible (10/10 would buy if for sale).\n\nPROS:\n-Sold as advertised (i.e. not misrepresented)\n-Awesome music\n-Effective graphics (though simple, the style conveys actions and details surprisingly well)\n-Balanced gameplay\n-Easy to learn, hard to master\n-Variety in parts and A.I. fleets\n-Environmental factors\n-Creative universe (i.e. well designed and unique)\n-Individualization of gameplay\n-Low cost (compared to, say, Avorion)\n\nCONS:\n-Missions are more extensions of the tutorial\n-Conquer mode can be simplistic at times, random at others\n-Targeting system, especially boarders and planes, could use some improvements (note: this is not to say make module targeting possible, but maybe module type)\n-Occasional glitches/crashes (rare or non-obstructive)\n\nGrade: A (90-95%)\n\n...When you realize your LARP-ing the Fleshcracker...\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1503786910, "timestamp_updated": 1503786910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34511008": {"recommendationid": "34511008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348556743", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509782506}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f60\u4e70\u4e86\u5c31\u77e5\u9053\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1503770924, "timestamp_updated": 1503770924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34453959": {"recommendationid": "34453959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129005199", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503682481}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u770b\u5230\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u8111 \u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u53e3\u5f84\u8d85\u5927\u7684\u70ae\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u5728\u6211\u7684\u5efa\u9020\u5217\u8868\u91cc\u6ca1\u627e\u5230\u662f\u548b\u56de\u4e8b", "timestamp_created": 1503557026, "timestamp_updated": 1503557026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34452825": {"recommendationid": "34452825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052646279", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513138993}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay is awesome and in depth, I have stayed away from multiplayer for now so can't speak to that.

Lets start this,\nAirships conquer the skies, I originally picked this up during the summer sales despite it not being on sale. I never really got into any conquesting and semi real time strategy games in the past. These would include games such as Europa universalis and others. However this blend of strategy and building fuse to create a really memorable game. Already just for those facts and the incredibly fun conquest mode, you should pick up this game. Anyway, enough of my experience, here are some pros and cons:\n\nPositives:\n   -Very good building interface\n   -Varaition provided by the customization of flags\n   -Huge variation in weapons and parts in each ship\n   -Very fun multiplayer\n   -great community workshop (and a good community)\n   -Early acess!!! (so more updates and content is most likely to arrise in the future)\n   -Can work on very bad computers (toasters even)\n   -Clean aesthetic\n\nNegatives:\n   -The Boarding AI can be a bit fiddley sometimes\n   -The Conquest mode does get easier over time\n   -Can get a bit repetitive after a while\n\nAll in all I think that Airships: Conquer the skies is a great game that I will definetally play more of in the future. If I was to suggest some changes they would be centered around the points below:\n\n    -Possibly a conquest style multiplayer mode?\n    -The inclusion of boats\n  \nWelp,\nKeep up the good work David Stark, very good game :D", "timestamp_created": 1499360304, "timestamp_updated": 1499360304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33284640": {"recommendationid": "33284640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039251376", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499791959}, "language": "french", "review": "un petit jeu sur lequel j avais des vu depuis un moment mais n osais pas l acheter par peur de decepttion et finalement apres avoir sauter le pas je ne le regrete vraiment pas! ce jeu est une petite merveille et les graphisme en 2d pixeliser ne gene en rien le plaisir au contraire je trouve qu ils ont tout a fait leur place dans ce jeu, la conception des vaisseau est tres bien foutu et intuitive les combat sont epique et la difficulter assez bien gerer \nc est vraiment un bon petit jeu que je recomande, il a un grand potentiel et je lui souhaite de reussir!", "timestamp_created": 1499276108, "timestamp_updated": 1499276108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33284054": {"recommendationid": "33284054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079430411", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507370883}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is like 20 dollars but it has everything!\nDesign fantastic airships to rain destruction on your enemies, or re-enact 9/11 except with warships against plebs\ndesign fearsome fortresses to be rammed into\nbuild flying troop carriers and steel other countries better warships\n\nYou know that gaint spider mecha thing from the western movie Will Smith was in?\nBuild that you can, but with even more gun!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499275195, "timestamp_updated": 1499275195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33272385": {"recommendationid": "33272385", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968847284", "num_games_owned": 598, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 1701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499972360}, "language": "english", "review": "Very very fun game but it has some bug problems. it hangs at times for a long time.

You can watch your crew run around your creations fighting fires and repairing and such.

There is a campaign mode where you can battle against AI for control over territories, or you can just build stuff and test in combat editor if you want. \n\nBattles are chaotic at times, but almost always a blast to watch your creations battle it out, with details like ammo, coal and even water to put out fires, you will need to make sure you have what you need to keep your armada fighting.

My expectations were exceeded however.

Some of the things to be learned were in the tutorial, the rest was in experience. This game is not for those who aren't willing to try, try, and try again and learn from their own mistakes. \n(And look up info like managing your empire's police force. That took me way too long to figure out). \nThe end result is a whole empire that you can confidently call your own.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe playerbase is very sparse so online matches are an impossibility. Hopefully though as time passes, the playerbase will grow and new updates will continue to fix bugs and add new features to play with. I will admit though, I would like to see a multiplayer conquest mode because the AI can only do so much in the single player. \n\n\nConclusion: \nIf you are a patient person, then go ahead and pick this game up if you like to build war machines to create empires or just really like steampunk RTS vehicle builders.

The design interface is easy to use, and the individual components and necessary considerations have already created quite a lot of depth in a game that is not even released yet.  As a helpful hint for anyone that plays the game, try using the overlay tab in design mode.  You can build bombers, big ships with lots of cannons, ships with troops for boarding, tanks, and so on, and so forth.  I found combat in the game to be satisfying, and have already spent quite a bit of time testing the ships and learning the problems and strengths with each design, which has led to an awful lot of adjustments.

Being a simple pixelgame makes it different but is not an issue, on the contrary it gives it a nice twist. \nSo what do you do? You build air and/or groundships to take and hold cities, then increase your defensive power with buildings. You build and control all.\n\nWhat I like is being able to build and configure my own stuff via the moduels. Being free to make your own designs is a whole lot of fun. I also like that in conquest mode every city has a tech you get if you capture the city. New tech means new toys for the deisgn, but keep in mind that if you don't have the tech you can't use that certain design. I also like the difference in arsenal and armor.\nWhat I don't like at the moment is:\n[list]\n[*] Not really enough info on pros/cons per weapon and armor. The info that is there is much same same on all stuff. Even if steel is said to withstand everything smaler than a cannonbal, how good is it againt grenades and flames? What is the differense in the mechanics for HP and protections? Having a list of pro/con would make it easier to know how to use weapons and armor to the fullest without having to do the tedious work of trail and error (which still might not say enough).\n[*] In Conquest the AI seems hell bent on ganging up on you, being able to make alliances and starts of with tech while you are alone (can't make alliances) and start with no tech. So far the only time I've had a problem with this is on the largest map (on medium difficulty, not sure I wanna know how Hard is).\n[*] Gamespeed in battle; I often feel that normal speed is a bit to fast for me to get a overview on the battle, but the 1/4 speed is just that much too slow. I hope that there will be made an option for 1/2 speed.\n[/list]\n\nAll in all, I like the game and I take into account that it is till only early access. A lot might happen along the way.\nWhat I hope for is much more options for the cities and empire, like researching and diplomacy. What I'd also like to see is customization for the map when starting a conquest game; number of cities, enemy empires and degree of mobspawning.\n\nTL;DR - Building Steampunk ships is fun, but keep in mind that it's early access.

Si vous aimez construire des tas de machines avec un syst\u00e8me simple, alors vous ne pouvez pas vous tromper avec celui-l\u00e0. C'est r\u00e9p\u00e9titif au bout de quelques heures mais on y revient avec plaisir pour exp\u00e9rimenter son dernier mod\u00e8le tout \u00e0 fait magnifique. Et c'est bien plus accessible par exemple que Space engineers. Par contre le multijoueur est vide. Donc on se contente d'exp\u00e9rimenter son mod\u00e8le tout \u00e0 fait magnifique en solo contre l'IA.\n____________________________\n\nbar\u00e8me \u00e0 titre indicatif (c'est un ressenti personnel - sans \ud83c\udf74\ud83c\udf79 aux \u00e9valuations n\u00e9gatives)\n\ud83e\udd44 s'il vous pla\u00eet juste une cuilli\u00e8re pour go\u00fbter\n\ud83c\udf59\ud83e\udd44 juste un bol de temps en temps mais pas tous les jours\n\ud83c\udf59\ud83c\udf63\ud83e\udd44 rudement bon dans son genre mais... mais !\n\ud83c\udf59\ud83c\udf63\ud83c\udf71\ud83e\udd44 miam excellent, manque juste un petit qqchose !\n\ud83c\udf59\ud83c\udf63\ud83c\udf71\ud83c\udf79\ud83d\ude0d (vous je sais pas mais) jusqu'\u00e0 l'indigestion\n____________________________\n\n[h1]Le temps d'un caf\u00e9[/h1]\n\nMerci encore une fois \u00e0 celui qui me l'a offert. Car j'ai longtemps louch\u00e9 devant ce jeu sans me d\u00e9cider \u00e0 l'acheter, \u00e9prouvant une certaine fascination pour ce jeu de construction qui avait l'air diff\u00e9rent et pl\u00e9biscit\u00e9, m\u00eal\u00e9e de crainte de ne pas parvenir \u00e0 faire un truc fonctionnel et une certaine r\u00e9ticence devant la 2D. En fait mettons fin au suspens tout de suite : c'est super simple, super dynamique, super passionnant. Apr\u00e8s essai, ce jeu est une merveille.\n\n[list][*]Un syst\u00e8me de construction simple avec d'immenses possibilit\u00e9s[/list]\n\nDans ce jeu, on peut construire soit des a\u00e9ronefs \u00e0 h\u00e9lices, soit des tanks \u00e0 chenilles ou pattes m\u00e9caniques, soit des fortresses. A partir d'un m\u00eame syst\u00e8me. Ecran divis\u00e9 en 2 : \u00e0 gauche des parties \u00e0 poser, au milieu une grille o\u00f9 les poser. De l\u00e0 on peut visualiser l'int\u00e9rieur (modules de construction) ou l'ext\u00e9rieur (armures). Ce qu'il faut garder \u00e0 l'esprit c'est que chaque module requiert de l'\u00e9quipage et p\u00e8se un certain poids. Et plus une armure est solide, plus elle est lourde. Donc il faut parvenir \u00e0 un \u00e9quilibre entre un design solide et bien arm\u00e9 mais co\u00fbteux, ou quelque chose de l\u00e9ger et rapide mais fragile. Vous aimiez exp\u00e9rimenter en jouant aux lego ? C'est de \u00e7a qu'il s'agit ici.\n\nPour faire un a\u00e9ronef il vous faut (chacune de ces choses sous la forme d'UN module \u00e0 poser, c'est tr\u00e8s simple) :\n\u25c7 une h\u00e9lice \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 gauche, on peut en empiler plusieurs et plus vous en mettez plus \u00e7a donne de la vitesse\n\u25c7 une chambre de suspendium, c'est ce qui fait voler l'a\u00e9ronef. Un cristal repr\u00e9sente 2000 de portance\n\u25c7 des r\u00e9serves \u00e0 charbon pour alimenter les h\u00e9lices et cristaux de suspendium\n\u25c7 des trappes d'approvisionnement pour le charbon, l'air et l'eau\n\u25c7 une passerelle, c'est le centre de commandement pour diriger l'a\u00e9ronef\n\u25c7 des r\u00e9serves de munitions pour alimenter les armes\n\u25c7 des quartiers d'\u00e9quipage\n\u25c7 des postes d'incendie pour \u00e9teindre le feu\n\u25c7 des armes qui n\u00e9cessite des marins\n\u25c7 des couloirs pour faire circuler l'\u00e9quipage, acc\u00e9der aux diff\u00e9rents modules, renforcer la structure. A la place on peut mettre des ponts (couloirs non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s o\u00f9 les marins courent super vite) ou des structures et portes coupe-feu optionnelles (super prot\u00e9g\u00e9s o\u00f9 les marins vont lentement).\n\nLes modules d'armement principaux (il y en a plein d'autres : lance-flamme, roquettes, torpilles, harpons, etc.)\n\u25c7 canon, arme de base puissante qui perce les blindages\n\u25c7 fusil, arme de base pr\u00e9cise mais qui ne perce pas les blindages\n\u25c7 grenades, arme \u00e0 tir courbe\n\u25c7 b\u00e9lier, pour foncer sur le vaisseaux ennemi et paf !\n\u25c7 commandos parachutistes : \u00e7a sert \u00e0 capturer les b\u00e2timents ennemis en se rapprochant assez pr\u00e8s. Sinon bah, ils s'\u00e9crasent au sol\n\u25c7 canon de DCA pour les forteresses et les tanks, contre les a\u00e9ronefs\n\nLe but c'est de placer les modules vitaux (centre de commandement et chambre de suspendium) hors de port\u00e9e des tirs. De faire un design qui permette aux marins de circuler rapidement partout dans des couloirs prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. De renforcer la soldit\u00e9 du b\u00e2timent sans sacrifier son altitude et sa vitesse. De placer des armes pour viser dans toutes les directions.\n\n[list][*]Un mode campagne non sc\u00e9naris\u00e9 pour tester ses magnifiques mod\u00e8les[/list]\n\nUne fois le tuto termin\u00e9, il est temps de choisir son blason. Certaines formes offrent des bonus : \u00e9teindre les incendie plus vite, viser plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, etc. Et ensuite, on se dirige librement soit vers le multijoueur vide... Donc achetez-le pour le solo. Soit vers l'\u00e9diteur pour cr\u00e9er des trucs librement. Soit vers un mode avec 7 missions pr\u00e9sentant de courtes mises en situation. Soit vers le coeur du jeu : le mode campagne al\u00e9atoire non sc\u00e9naris\u00e9, dont on peut param\u00e9trer la dur\u00e9e et la difficult\u00e9. \n\nLe principe, c'est que chaque ville poss\u00e9d\u00e9e rapporte un revenu \u00e0 la minute. Avec ce revenu, il faut renforcer ses forteresses en d\u00e9fense et construire des tanks et a\u00e9ronefs en attaque. Ca sert aussi \u00e0 r\u00e9parer les b\u00e2timents, soudoyer les unit\u00e9s ennemies, inciter les villes ennemies \u00e0 la r\u00e9volte (vachement dur), ou payer un espion pour une petite chance de d\u00e9truire des b\u00e2timents ennemis (fonctionne mieux si ils sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 abim\u00e9s apr\u00e8s une attaque). L'IA est tr\u00e8s agressive m\u00eame en facile. Elle attaque sans cesse, nous ou une autre IA, renforce sa ville avec un nombre impressionnant de forteresses, produits des unit\u00e9s sans arr\u00eat. Notez qu'il est possible de sauvegarder les mod\u00e8les de b\u00e2timents, heureusement. Ce qui est tr\u00e8s pratique pour en produire beaucoup sans avoir \u00e0 tout reconstruire. Il y a aussi des mod\u00e8les basiques propos\u00e9s \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents tarifs, pas les meilleurs \u00e9videmment pour nous inciter \u00e0 construire mieux.\n\nDurant les batailles, il y a un bouton pour se d\u00e9placer, un pour agripper un b\u00e2timent, un pour se retourner en d\u00e9placement, un pour viser manuellement une cible, un pour aborder un b\u00e2timent, un autre pour privil\u00e9gier les r\u00e9parations de telle ou telle module, un pour \u00e9vacuer un b\u00e2timent et... un pour fuir la bataille pour essayer de sauver les restes quand tout va mal. Bien s\u00fbr fuir en d\u00e9fense fait perdre la ville.\n\n[list][*]Quelques rares d\u00e9fauts[/list]\n\nFaiblesse du jeu. Quand il n'y a plus d'\u00e9quipage ou de module appropri\u00e9, un a\u00e9ronef s'\u00e9crase. Quand un a\u00e9ronef s'\u00e9crase sur un b\u00e2timent ennemi, \u00e7a d\u00e9truit en grande partie le b\u00e2timent s'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renforc\u00e9. Que se passe-t-il quand on laisse volontairement sa flotte au-dessus des b\u00e2timents ennemis pour qu'ils finissent par s'\u00e9craser dessus ? Une victoire moche.\nAutres d\u00e9fauts mineurs.

It needs a lot of work and DESERVES a lot of work but I've already got my \u00a37 worth.\nI've not even played with ground vehicles yet. And not touched the multiplayer which I suspect could be a huge amount of fun going up against friends and their creations.\n\nI looked at the screens and thought, god that looks bad. And yes, I think it's just a tad too 8 bit for my liking (ship creation is a bit baffling at first when modules look so scrappy) but once you're in combat it's very cool. Especially when there's a lot going on.\nWhen you have your first big stand off involving 10 ships/vehicles or more - and you're rolling out a new, untested, expensive destroyer you're just praying will stay in the air - it can be quite thrilling. A giant, mechanical monster rolling over the hills at your city (which is likely a tiny shack) armed to the teeth can give you a true O..M..G moment.\n\nYou'll be encouraged to build multiple craft to complement each other. And with the module options (building blocks for your craft) open to you, which is a fair number, there is already great tactical scope and entirely different combat.\n\nTutorial is solid. Music and sound is also pretty good for what it is.\nNeeds a lot of polish and is mostly a very good foundation for something excellent. Quite happy to back this and watch it grow.\n\nRight now, if you're not into multiplayer, completing the map (which if you're a natural may take way less time than me) may leave you a bit disheartened and cause you to move on.\nBut if you're fascinated by the mechanics there are other modes to play.\n\nMy dream would be to see a huge open world map. Much, much better cities (I want to see them and feel like I'm fighting on the front line). Much more feedback from ships during combat.

Issues continued.\n\nIn game, the tutorial doesn't explain controls at all, but I figured them out. The ship doesn't fly to where you tell it to, it often goes too far ahead, or not far enough, sometimes by very signifigant amounts. The flip ship button doesnt work at all, making it impossible to pass a very early tutorial level.\n\nAll this being said, the game looks really cool, and it is sad that I can't play it.

One will face additional difficulty through financial management, varied weather, spy operations and the occasional wildlife incursion.\n\n[h1]Customization[/h1]\nIt starts with the emblem, which is personalized through style, symbols (with optional bonus) and colors. Then there's the created designs that involve construction, armor, paint, decoration and naming. Creations can be up- and downloaded from Steam Workshop, while Mods can enrich the design space with various assets.\n\n[i][b]If Lego was invented in pre-world war Italy, it might have looked like this[/b][/i]\n\nAnd on that bombshell, I will conclude this review.

Instead of just sending their ship straight at your guns, the AI will continue to manuever it's ships all the time to get in your ship's blind spots and vulnerable areas.\n-Good pixel graphics, also makes it easier to design complex ships and for the community to make mods.\n\nCons:\n-Unexpectedly taxing. Even in 1v1 battle between big ships the game can lags quite a while. Also the graphic setting isn't comprehensive enough.

Build > Test > Fight > Refine. Simply put this is a 10$ sidescrolling airship combat game where you design and make airships to fight in a global war or in singular battles. \n\nThe game gives you tons of toys to make ships with and seeing how your ideas work out is amazing. It's this great puzzle that is immediately easy to understand. You want to build the most efficent ship possible. This means balancing space, excess modules, cost, weight, firepower and more. There are even challenges to build ships with cost restrictions. Building a ship with 10,000 monney? EZ!  Try and build an efficent ship and fight your buddy for  200$? It becomes this twisted challenge of fitting everything to be in the right spot. Which only makes larger ships feel that much more puzzling. Do you need an extra fire station? It could save your ship but you could also spend that elsewhere. That Heavy Cannon could do you well but would you want 3 cannons instead? Can you fit that? Do you spend for more ammo? Extra Fuel? Barracks? Spider drones that board the enemy ship and beat the living daylights out of it?\n\nAll of these systems are great and the developer is a neat guy that is very open with the community. If you doubt yourself on this game still then let me sell you on one last thing. I built a ship and tossed it into combat, the SS Maiden's first flight was to fight a gunship of similar build. I readied myself and started the fight. One of the neat features is that you can see each individual crew member fight. So my eye followed a man and watched as he loaded a cannon. Back and forth he went tossing cannonballs and gunpowder and whatnot into the cannon. Eventually my ship took a hit, his crewmember dies horrifically and he struggles to put out the resulting fires. Eventually he becomes too wounded and falls. Another crewmember dragged him to the ships icu and he was attempting to heal up. I wanted nothing more than for this little GI to make it home to see his family. I could have almost seen him, white knuckle gripping onto the last leg of life after losing his friend to a rougue cannon shot.

Even just boldtyping the top catagories in the lists would go a long way in helping this.\n\n    The combat interface was pretty easy, I really enjoy watching the little people try uselesslyrepair or put fires out of systems aboard the ships. Armor seems a bit weak. And the AI is a bit lacking in the building and ship choices that it chooses. I feel like the important parts of combat are all there, but perhaps at a little bit of the wrong pace at places. Like for instance the inital stages of combat are really fast paced, a little to fast imo, only to wind down into this long slog of blowing to pieces a building that takes like 5 min with the time set to ffwrd. I personally would like to see the whole thing slowed way down. like having to deal with coal shortages or ammo or fire or whatever, and really having those priority command buttons mean something. I didnt find much of a huge difference when changing command selections from firefighting to movement priority mainly because the whole combat was to fast to make a difference to what your pawns are prioritizing. Perhaps slowing down gameplay and making the battlefield bigger vert and horz would help. make it feel a little more like im flying this ship around and less like im bouncing around in a bathtub.\n      I would say an expansion of structures, peices, weapons, really just more options in general would be amazing when it comes to building ships. I found myself mostly limited to trying to figure out how to place hallways properly in order to make sure my ships didnt fall out of the sky due to lack of coal. Also it seems like if your going for ship to ship combat focusing on ship survival and upgrades, perhaps the surviving crew from a previous battle could also gain some kind of bonus to aiming or speed or whatnot. Also is there a reason there is a 120 person limit to the crew inside the ships? \n\n         Now on to the overmap, while I really like the style youve got going I think the edges could be pulled in a bit. I found myself wondering why there was this whole other page to the map that I felt like I couldnt see. I personally would like to see a way to improve my cities, IE building an upgrade to the shipyards.. or even making a shipyard upgrade as a part of the modual building system, so I would have to work in building and protecting my shipyards in combat. Same goes for additional resource production, I feel like the game would be much more expansive if I could somehow grow the cities I have captured.\n\n\nNow this is the first real review ive ever written on steam so I hope that says something about the level of respect I have for the developer for making this  game.

I've got 20 hours in. I feel distinctly qualified to write a review at this point. So far I've completed the tutorial, beaten the Conquest mode on easy, with a large map and I've made a plethora of craft of vastly varying effectiveness. So here goes...\n\nI obviously read reviews. I did so before I bought this one. It sounded interesting enough. I like to play games with all kind of contraptions you can slap together and hope to hell they dont fall apart because you missed this or that or you Tim \"The Tool Man\" Taylor'ed it and it blows all to hell. Love Kerbals! This isn't Kerbals. This is little pixelated airships. Well only as little as you make them and trust me you can make some monstrous shit. The cool part is every piece is doing something. Ammos stores are reloading the guns. Guns are blasting away. Firefighters. Marines and Guards. Crew bustling around. Couple dudes in the back throwing coal into the engines to keep the damn thing in the air, however briefly. Everything works. Can't wait to see what new modules get added later on. I'm excited at the possibilities here.\n\nDownsides? For $10 bucks I can't bitch in the least bit. I put 20 hours in and I'm still having a blast. There are some things that certainly need polished and expanded upon. Conquest is fairly lackluster at this point. Build some ships and tanks and decimate your enemies or get blown to flaming bits laughing maniacly while a sky full of shrapnel rains down around your feet. There are spies  you can send but I haven't found much use for them, far as I can tell they just tell you the stats about a town you'd already know if you'd had the balls to conquer it. Thats all there is to it, really. The combat and tinkering are really the meat and potatoes. You can build defenses at your towns, so far I've found them expensive to maintain and not as effective as the crafts. I could see this getting expanded upon though, hopefully. It would be great if you had to produce the coal and ammo you use, research new techs, trade goods with allies. Load up your ships with supplies for an extended siege. That would be insane. The possibilities are endless.\n\nI'm glad I bought this rough cut and I'm sure the developer can turn it into a gem given enough time and effort.

This game supplied that and so much more. The ship creator is very easy to use and accessible so it was enjoyable to build ships from the start.

It was a few ours into the game I found out that a module gains health for every tile next to it occupied by modules. This lead me to make new designs and redesigns of my ships.

The tutorial is fairly decent and making your own designs is pretty fun. The battles are definitely fun. \n\nThere are only a few flaws to me. Unless I've missed something, you can't queue up build orders in the campaign mode and building in that mode is a chore. I wish I could open up a menu, click on a design, and click on provinces to queue up build orders. Another room for improvement is the campaign. Larger maps, diplomacy, economy buildings that increase a province's income but can be bombed/destroyed? Lots of possibility.\n\nThere a few more minor gripes. Mostly UI/user input related. My fingers still want to press F to flip a ship in spot, but that just changes crew focus from whatever I had it at to firefighting. I have to M->F->Click. Reboundable keys would be great. If they're a thing, I haven't found them easily. \n\nIt is interesting that there's definitely a niche for all types of designs. When I browsed through the achivements, I saw one called Dogfight, a multiplayer achievement for building a design that costs $200 and winning (I think). I tried it out in campaign with a very cheap $185 airship with a single bomb bay and was surprised that a small swarm (2-3) could wipe early game defenses very easily.\n\nAs the campaign progressed, though, they started falling off in terms of effectiveness. Low flight ceilings meant they would get chewed up by the increasingly powerful enemy fortifications and couldn't just bomb enemy airships by flying over them. To compensate, I built a $200 variant without the bomb bay, but with more lift and with rifles instead. \n\nThey didn't do so well because the balloon/whatever that kept them afloat could be shot out easily. I could use a different module, which would be inside the ship and armored, to provide lift, but it definitely wouldn't be a $200 ship anymore.\n\n$200 fortifications? Ha. I build a long wall of cheap outposts armed with rifles and a flak gun. So cheap, it used brick instead of stone. Needless to say, enemy bombers made my life hell. \n\nThis game is fun.", "timestamp_created": 1470382339, "timestamp_updated": 1470382339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24717053": {"recommendationid": "24717053", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963657925", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499740530}, "language": "english", "review": "They laughed at me because they thought I had built a ship without weapons.\n\nThey stopped laughing when they discovered MY ENTIRE SHIP WAS A WEAPON.\n\n10/10 would ram enemy ships out of the sky over and over again.", "timestamp_created": 1470356748, "timestamp_updated": 1470356748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 79, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694497", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24707297": {"recommendationid": "24707297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171190694", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 4944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508814951}, "language": "german", "review": "tolles spiel, macht viel spa\u00df, kreativ.", "timestamp_created": 1470315195, "timestamp_updated": 1470315195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24674895": {"recommendationid": "24674895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130886863", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1514579970}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game, kind of confusing at first but I would really recommend this to anyone looking to buy it.

The developer and the community are both very active and the game, while short on content at the moment, is still quite playable and, in my opinion, quite excellent at this early alpha stage and will only get better with time.\n\nPickup Airships - you won't regret it!

Even when it is on the low graphic settings. Only played for a few hours, and gave up. \n\nThe dev contacted me as a result of the original version of this review. He seemed like a nice guy and was keen to fix the issue. He asked me to send the log file, which I did, and it appears that this a known mac fault, so shouldnt be an issue for PC players. \n\nAt present there isnt a known fix as he is just in the process of trying to track down the cause. He asked me to send him some more log files, but as I know the game will crash every time I play it I'm going to struggle to get the motivation to launch it again, especially since I have a load of other stable games I bought during the sale. \n\nI like the concept of the game. From what gameplay I saw, this seems like it could have been fun. However I found the crashing so frustrating that I would struggle to recommend this to anyone. \n\nWhile the dev seems like a great guy, the game has an incredibly negative community, so I would suggest you stay clear of it. \n\nEdited 10/07/16 after discussions with the developer.\n\nEdit 06/07/2017: Almost exactly a year later, i gave this game another try.

The ship building and operating looks very complex on first sight but turns out to be of little or no concern since everything in the ship is automated and there is literally zero micro management needed to fight a battle. The ship building is the only redeeming quality of this game, it's cool to make your own ship but you have a limited size and the number of diferent modules feels quite limited.

So I am going to bump this to positive, since it was kind of a mixed review before and it looks like the developer is responding well to criticism :)  That being said, it still is mostly a sandbox game despite these fixes, the strategy layer just is not that deep and only a few ship types are worthwhile, but it's a lot better in that regard in any case.\n\n\nOld review:\n\nI think the game is going to be great eventually, but at the moment it's really rough around the edges and just doesn't have a lot going for it in single player.\n\nPros:\n-Coolness factor (I mean, army of airships man)\n-Sounds like it'd be really fun multiplayer if you're into that\n-Varied ship design\n-You can probably have a bit of fun in single player if you intentionally gimp yourself, like do a single city survival or something\n\nCons:\n-AI is pretty terrible at designing fleets\n\n-The single player mode is like civilization but:\n*Has no limiting factors to curb snowballing, it's actually accelerated since damaged vehicles usually last several fights\n*the largest map is very small, I defeated the largest on highest difficulty in like an hour\n*defenses are worthless maintenance suckers, you're better off building a rifle tank and running around pillaging to get quick cash\n\n-There isn't a lot of strategy once you build fleet and actually fight, you generally know ahead of time what you're going to do.  It's not like you'll run into an enemy fleet that actually make you think, it's mostly just fling your guys at the enemy and hope for the best.\n\n-Pretty poor balance: spamming rifles will tear things apart, marines will give you free ships.\n\nI'll change this review to positive when more work is done on the single player side, but for now I would say it's only worth it if you're getting this for PvP.", "timestamp_created": 1463373211, "timestamp_updated": 1503660809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570024", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23014173": {"recommendationid": "23014173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060542618", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498528865}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games I have ever played. I know, that is hard to believe, but hear me out. I was sceptical at first, but then I started playing it. Airships has as much depth as From the Depths, but is simple enough to learn in a few minutes. Here are my pros and cons. Remember, this game is very much in an alpha state.\n\nPros:\n- Easy to learn\n- Runs well\n- Satisfying combat which never gets boring.\n- Despite the pixelated visuals, it looks amazing. Not just due to its lighting and textures (which are good, but not outstanding), but its detail. If you zoom in on your ship, you can see crewman rushing around the ship, making repair, carrying shells to load into cannons, shoveling coal, and aiming and firing the guns. It is really amazing. \n- Easy to use editor\n- Sandbox for testing your creations\n- Fun and simple overworld in conquest mode\n\nCons:\n- Crashes frequently\n- AI can sometimes be ridiculously overwhelming in conquest mode.\n- Conquest has no diplomacy. You always are at war with everyone, no matter what. It could be great if you could establish alliances and trade. The conquest mode is also too short. If the pace was slower, it would help the game greatly. In conquest mode, it seems as if the only way to win is to buy as many cheap ships as you can, and then blitzkreig all your enemies. It takes away from the grand strategy portion.\n- Game will not work without internet\nConclusion: Despite a few balance issues and crashes, it is definitely worth the buy.

The controls are very simple (mouse clicks), and it is enjoyable.\n\nBut, to get the most of this, you are going to spend a lot of time in building your own designs.

Hundreds of different parts that perform a specific funtion are available. A bridge to command your ship, coal rooms to provide fuel, ammo storage to distibute ammo, the list goes on an on. There are tons of weapons, armors and other combat enhancements as well. And all of this before you even engage in real time fights with your creations. Issue orders to gain the advantage. Rain hell from above with a 20 cannon compliment airship. Use a boarding ship to board and take over other vessels. The tactical situations are endless. The 2-D graphics are amazing and very much compliment the desiging and action. Watch little crew members run around the ship performing different functions as you battle. Fires break out commonly and will slow the action on whichever part of the ship is on fire. It almost feels very much like FTL in that regard. If only in FTL, it was all realtime.

However, it is already a very playable game that, although somewhat Spartan (See: Starkly functional, not kicking people into pits) in it's presentation don't let that fool you.  There is quite a bit going on under the hood.\n\nThe theme reminds me of World War I scaling combined with H.G. Wells-like steampunk and fanciful technology with just a little sprinkling of fantasy in there.  The world is locked in bleak war with giant airships and landships at the front of the battle.  Rather than helium, your airships are held aloft with \"suspendium\", either as a dust in balloons or as a sort of engine housed in the ship's interior.\n\nShip design is an interesting balance between weight, lift, propulsion, durability, crew requirements, and cost.  Sure, you could sacrifice some armor to drop some weight and add an extra weapon, but you risk going up like a matchstick if you do.  Or perhaps you want to build a secondary suspendium chamber for extra lift and redundancy in case the other one is taken out?  Good idea, but remember that you need coal to power the various functions of your ship, which means more modules, more weight, more cost.\n\nYou also can design \"land ships\" which is pretty much the same as designing an airship sans lift components.  Instead you have a selection of mech-like legs and tank-like tracks to choose from.  They don't have the advantage of flight, but this also means weight isn't quite as much of a concern and they can make great, heavily-armored, mobile anti-air platforms as a result.\n\nLastly, you can also design non-mobile buildings as the centerpieces of defense in your territories.  You can really stack on the armor and weaponry there.  Just be sure you design the building to be resistant against fire, invasion, and attacks from multiple angles! Careful though, every module in this game has weight and physics and it's a huge disaster if parts of your structures begin to collapse on themselves!\n\nThere is a campaign to be played which is at the moment extremely simplistic but fun.  You send spies to neighboring states so that you can see their defenses.  Then you pay to sabotage them or build up your forces enough to overcome theirs and then invade.  As you control more territitories you gain more income, technology, and ship building ports.  Ships have upkeep costs to consider, and you need to budget your secret police (to prevent enemies from sabotaging you).  There isn't much to it other than that.\n\nThe game really expressly shines in the design and combat aspects.  The interface for design is a little bit cumbersome, but doesn't detract from the fun of snapping together modules on a grid.  There is also a bit of a personal touch there as you create unique shapes and decorate the ships with paint, banners, and decals.  You can then test your designs against the AI (or pit AI against AI) in the sandbox combat arena.\n\nThe combat itself can be pretty exciting despite how simple the game looks.  The way your crew operates reminds me a lot of FTL without the micromanagement.  That is to say that your little air sailors really do move around the ship and man the various stations, but you don't control them directly.  When you give the order to move, the crew runs to take coal from your coal stores and shovel them into the engine.  When you fire on a target, some sailors man the weapons while others haul up ammo.  Fires break out and sailors scramble to put them out with water, etc.  As you lose sailors in battle this diminishes your capabilty to run your ship efficiently, or can often leave you dead in the skies.\n\nCombat is impactful, with holes being punched through armor, and entire sections of your ships being blasted apart.  Fires break out and burn out of control.  Boarders scramble in through your windows using their tiny little grappling hooks.  Battering rams smash you to pieces.  It's all pretty intense and battles rarely play out the exact same way twice.  Sometimes a very lucky shot is all it takes to entirely turn the tide.  Other times what seems like a bad thing - like your ship falling out of the sky - might end up a good thing, like that falling ship absolutely squashing an enemy ship that was unlucky enough to be underneath it.\n\nThere is multiplayer here but in an extremely limited fashion (EG - no multiplayer campaigns), but that could possibly change down the road as this game is still under development.\n\n[i]Fire up the suspendium chamber if you...[/i]\n\n[list]\n[*] Are looking for a creative tactical combat game.\n[*] Love building and iterating designs.\n[*] Are a fan of all things steampunk and airship.\n[/list]\n\n[i]All hands abandon ship if you...[/i]\n\n[list]\n[*] Really want a lot of flashy visuals.\n[*] Prefer a lot of micro-management or direct control.\n[*] Desire deep multiplayer.\n[/list]\n\n[u]The Bottom Line[/u]\n\nThis game was a delightful surprise for an Early Access title.  It offers quite a bit of meat at the current stage of things, and is what I would call \"fully playable\".  I've already sunk many hours mostly just designing ships and combat scenarios alone.\n\nWith that said, there are some definite improvements that I'd love to see.  First in my mind are the landships.  Unless they are absurdly large, they are sort of ironically terrible at traveling on land.  This makes them far less generally useful than airships.\n\nAlso some aspects of design likewise seem entirely more useful than others.  Other than in cheap, small, suicide attacker airships, I found that using suspendium dust balloons is of pretty dubious use other than as a supplemental means of lift to suspendium chambers.  They are always targeted first by AI and are destroyed very easily.  So creating a giant Zeppelin-like craft or a Final Fantasy style airship isn't terribly feasible.\n\nIt'd be great to see traditional matchmaking for multiplayer as well as multiplayer campaigns someday as well.\n\nAll in all, though, it's all very solid and very fun.  If the screenshots/videos of the ship building appeal to you at all, then this is already a must for you.

version Alpha 8.14).\n\nThe game is as it says on the tin, design air (or land) ships in a steam punk environment, and send them against your enemies.\n\nThe design of these ships is also quite sensible, since there are lose conditions that may hit you at any point during battle for each one of your ships, which you can mitigate based on how you assembled your vehicle.\nBuild your ship poorly, with only one access corridor to the water supply, and you're going to have a bad time. Especially once the coal store ignites.\nRun out of coal for your \"suspendium\" engine that keeps your airship afloat, and you will fall out of the sky.\nRun out of ammo, and, welp, all those giant cannons you have there might work as a battering ram if you're lucky.\nDon't have any water on board? Have fun watching the ammo store turn into a fireworks show when it inevitably catches fire!\nDon't have any guards on board? Have fun letting your enemies capture the ship and turn it against you.\n\nThere are very many pieces of a ship you can use to assemble essentially whatever you can think of, provided you stay within a few specified constraints, which you can change, depending on what you can afford. Most of these restraints from what I've dealt with had to do with overloading my vessels by adding too much gun, or by trying to armor my entire tank with bricks (harder to break completely compared to metal which doesn't like to explode).\n\nAt the moment there are 2 gamemodes.\n\n1. Combat mode, which is as you would guess. Throws you onto a blank map, where you deploy your own, and you enemies ships, duke it out and see what happens. This mode is essentially the sandbox mode of the game, as there are no financial restrictions. This is also the only mode that is currently available in multiplayer.\n\n2. Campaign mode is a mode where the game generates a map for you and up to 12 other AI empires to face each other with reasonably good tactical battles and planning.\nAt the moment the campaign is a bit thread bare as the only language any empire speaks seems to be \"shoot them in the face\". This isn't exactly a bad thing, as the mode is quite entertaining, especially since the AI does seem to be quite competent with how it handles it's forces and resources.\nEach city captured will have different resources or tech you can exploit, like cheaper wood for example, reducing the cost of wood armored ships, and maybe a different city will have the technology of flamethrowers. \nUnfortunately at the moment there is no way to steal, research, or reverse engineer tech without taking the city which contains it, but this is a flaw which I can see being fixed reasonably soon probably, considering we are still in early(ish) alpha. I've completed my first victorious large campaign in just under an hour, granted most of that time was spent designing ships to counter my enemies.\n\nThe game itself is actually very pretty considering the pixel art graphics, and can run on essentially a toaster oven.\n\nI feel the current price of 9.99 is actually quite a reasonable price for the game with the current ammount of features present in the game, as this game is quite the time sink if you want it to be (I've probably got about 6 or more hours in offline mode that steam doesn't track).

I've barely tapped the surface here, but I could spend hours and and hours designing and testing ships.  I've spent 5 hours so far on my first design.  Haven't even touched land vehicles.  I did make a huge land base building that was pretty sweet.\n\nThe different types of strategies for ships are mind-boggling.  You can create ships that have a high vertical ceiling that can then drop bombs on your enemy, or you can create a fast ship for ramming your enemy, or you could just try to get close and board the enemy.\n\nAnd the multiplayer works flawlessly.  For a game that doesn't look all that awe-inspiring on the Steam Store, I'm amazed at how well everything just works.  You create a game, set a point limit, and can either choose to use a single giant flying vehicle, or a squadron of little ones, or a mix of land, air, and static buildings.  Just everything about this is so well-designed and works so flawlessly.

Even in its current state every weapon, component and ship class feels useful when designed right. A battering ram can turn that dreadnaught into a dread NOT.\n\nFighting:\n\nWatching those brave little men scurry about their ships is engrossing, but combat often becomes hectic enough that watching would be unwise. Tactics and placement feel as important as the designs themselves. A hefty broadside of gattling guns doesn't mean much when your enemy is sitting 200m above your ship's max service ceiling, bombs dropping.\n\nPerhaps the most intense moments are when the ammo runs dry and it becomes a demolition derby.\n\n\nThe dev is very active in the community, and has probably responded to every post in the forum I've read so far.

I am not an expert review writer, but I will try to say why I like this game.\n\n1: COMBAT. The combat is fun and can be challenging. It also makes maneuvering the possibility between winning and failing. But maneuvering isn't the only combat important thing. You also need the right ship loadout for the right enemy, for almost every battle. There isn't any stock ship design that I know of that is capable of handling any situation. Being outnumbered is also a way to decrease chances of victory, even if you outgun the opposition.\n\n2: SHIP DESIGN. You may have played some type of game in the past where you have a set ship shape, and possibly even systems. But in this, you have extreme control over your ship design. You can make unrealistic looking ships, cool looking ships, and any other ship shape you can thinks of. This also goes for weapons.\n\n3: FUTURE POTENTIAL. This game has SO much potential to be one of the best 2d airship construction games out there at some point in the future. It could even be tough competition in its current state! I can't wait to see what the grand release update will be, as that is usually the biggest and best update before release from early access.\n\nSUMMARY: This game is destined for greatness, and all you have to do is buy it. It will not be a big bother on even some of the older kinds of computers. The combat systems are great, the building system is great, what are you wating for? Its waiting for you!\n\n(If you are still skeptical of this, just look up some of the most recent videos on the internet for this game.)", "timestamp_created": 1455748977, "timestamp_updated": 1455748977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21284312": {"recommendationid": "21284312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118951582", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505095237}, "language": "english", "review": "I was thinking about making a simple game for myself and my friends that was a 2d pixely airship game and then i found an advanced one. the mecanics are great. need more items to build with but its early access.", "timestamp_created": 1455748446, "timestamp_updated": 1455748446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21283993": {"recommendationid": "21283993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031263686", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507816460}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, lots of parts and lots of potential for creativity.

There's landships and buildings too, each of which is just as engaging to create and build as the floating beasts you normally focus on. For example, I've built the HMS One Punch (with dual giant rams) for the express purpose of destroying all of the enemy ship's faces. But just one glance at the weapons shows everything from cystalline lazer cannons to rockets, and gives any wannabe crazed engineer all the options in the world for awesome designs. However, while decorations are alright, paint in this game quite frankly looks atrocious; so honestly I just keep wood looking like wood and so on.\n\nI've yet to try multiplayer, but it seems like it would pretty fun with friends if you establish certain rules first. The single player is more than enough to satisfy me at this point. Also, ship boarding exists, which is the single most important feature I've wanted in any airship game ever.\n\nBut is it worth it?

This happens both when a ship is bisected and when it explodes into several large fragments.\n-Marines and commandos have unbelievably good pathing for an indie game. You can have several ships in  row in deadlock with enemy ships (where your ships are equals signs and enemy ships are minuses: ====-----) and tell the soldiers in your rearmost ship to board an enemy ship, and the men will exit their ship, get on its roof and walk or jump along all ships in the intermediate distance (friendly and enemy) if doing so allows them to reach their target. If an enemy ground installation has an island directly above it preventing close access, you can position yourself above the island and your men can jump from your ship onto the island, and then from the island onto the building. The island isn't a static movement zone, just a piece of terrain that's loosely classified as a ship. Incredible.\n-Ground walker mechs have highly adaptable footwork. I regularly see walker mechs climb on top of friendly and enemy landships in the course of movement, in fact this can be used to bridge otherwise impassible terrain. One time I saw a two-legged mech balance both feet atop a tree stump in the middle of combat.\n-Anything can be built from tiny mail blimps and little interceptors to kilometer-long battlecruisers super heavy dreadnoughts with hundreds of visible men aboard (these are legal in multiplayer while playing 10k-limit games, it should be noted) from the same component parts (of which there are many, many).\n\nAs you can see this is an incredibly deep, dynamic and potent game.

There is lots of battle strategy and positioning, which sorta reminds me of FTL.\n\nSome minor shortcomings however: The game seems to have been designed around combat, which it should be. The combat is pretty polished. However, the conquest is somewhat lacking, especially with economy. There is no way to augment income without taking cities. This forces an aggressive early game. By mid-game the map is relatively stationary, and the game is more or less decided. Some fixes could be civilian buildings which generate income, or maybe even forming alliances with other players (temporary of course).", "timestamp_created": 1455388374, "timestamp_updated": 1455388374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21183018": {"recommendationid": "21183018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010522160", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512598538}, "language": "english", "review": "Spent the whole morning taking over a whole map only for my capital to lose a battle due to a lack of ammo.

I have not played the multiplayer very much, but the single player is some of the most fun to be had with 10$ that you'll ever find!\n\nThe graphics are neat pixel art, and available in a wide range of resolutions. Very crisp, though sometimes the colors can be a little bland (menus and such tend to be all brown or black, which is to be expected of the genre yes, but perhaps a little higher contrast would make things easier to see).\n\nGameplay is extremely solid. I've only encountered extremely mild bugs (a certain airship design never replaced the cannon when repaired, I had to refit it with one every time). You use the mouse to select commands for the airships (usually just movement) and this can seem simplistic at first, but quickly gets hectic once you start having more than 6 ships in a battle at the same time, which is by no means a bad thing! (protip: try to manuever your ships so that when one goes down, it doesnt take 3 others directly below with it, causing a massive fiery explosion destroying half your fleet).\n\nsound deisign is spot on, weapons have varying sound effects that allow you to tell what is being fired by listening alone, music is good, though there's only like 3 different songs in the whole game. You don't really notice this though, as i'd liken it to the hangar building music in Kerbal Space Program; just sort of there, not really in the forground.\n\nSome changes i'd love to see would be a custom sizing option for the menus, with the building menu sometimes it's difficult to select which module you want (at least on my 1080p screen, not sure about smaller resolutions). It would also be wonderful to see some more offline modes, perhaps having only a single airship and upgrading in order to complete tasks or something. \nAnd finally, I would love to be able to personally change which workers do what, or at least assign them myself. for example, if I have 6 airshipmen, an ammo depot (4 workers max), two cannons (1 worker each) and a water tank (2 workers max), the game will automatically decide where the workers go. so i might have 2 workers on the water tank, two for the cannons, and two for the ammo depot. But sometimes i'd rather have 3 on the depot, and only 1 on the water tank. nitpicky perhaps, but it would help a little.\n\noverall fantastic game, extremely enjoyable. Nothing glaringly wrong.

With these sort of building games, its usually easiest to just make a hulking juggernaut that wipes everything out. While this was the first thing I tried, I realized even this was pretty difficult. The game was balanced so that the larger your ship is, the more difficult it is to distribute resources and fly quickly.

I can't stop playing it.

This is really irritating, but it can be solved by going to the options and having it use the system cursor.\n-Sometimes placing balloons actually lowers the service ceiling. I know there's probably some weird math behind it, but it seems counterintuitive to me.\n-I wish I could stay in battles longer just to see what happens.

The AI flank you attack you were you are weakest and even fight over certain areas that provide advanced weaponry which you can attack yourself and gain the ability to use rockets or flamethrowers etc. The AI is amazing because certain AI empires use the same tactic against you and you can use that against them while others will learn new tactics as they defeat empires or form alliances.

Click on a city and you are presented with side-on view of the city surrounds and any buildings, airships and landships located there.  \n\nLevel 3: \nEach vehicle has a distinctive, often animal like, shape and can have 'scary' looking warpaint.  The shape of the vehicle is a direct result of what it actually needs to successfully move and operate.  Nothing you see is pointless.\n\nLevel 4:\nNow, zoom in to one of the vehicles and notice the individual rooms, with corridors and ladders connecting them.  It's like a little city within each vehicle.\n\nLevel 5:\nPick one of the rooms and zoom in further and you can see tiny men actually operating the weapons, transferring coal/ammo from stores, putting out fires, reparing armour, resting in berths, using repair rooms, controlling the vehicle etc.  \n\nNow realise each of these men is essential to the operation of the vehicle but can be killed in battle. Amazing!\n\n\nPros:\n\n* Such an original game, there is nothing else like it.\n\n*  Great feeling of controlling an empire of hundreds of fantasy war machines and thousands of poor little men needed to operate them. \n\n*  Nice flexibiliy to play battles as a fast action game or a slower tactical game thanks to the time controls and spacebar to pause.  \n \n* Excellent feedback on what is actually happening during a battle thanks to 'speech bubbles' from your men when the vehicle takes damage, fires break out,  crew-members die, the battle is lost/won etc.\n\n* If you don't like the built-in vehicle designs, design your own using the in-game designer and see if you can do any better.  You can also design and build static buildings (ie fortresses) and these are essential for defending a city.\n\n* Really unique and stylish presentation style for an indie game.  The typeface, colour scheme, campaign map graphical design and UI style are all very well done.  \n\n* Music soundtrack is stirring and suits the theme of the game perfectly.\n \nCons:\n\n*  Still in EA/alpha so there are a few performance issues with large battles, but the developer is aware of these and is looking to fix them asap.\n\n* There are not many players playing multiplayer games at present.  I play single player only and love it, but if you need multiplayer you may want to wait to see if the community really grows.\n\n* Some minor UI issues but these might just be my own preferences.\n \n\nIn summary, highly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1449545402, "timestamp_updated": 1449546299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19541486": {"recommendationid": "19541486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143322820", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507754300}, "language": "english", "review": "I reviewed this game a while back and i said that it was really good then. It has only improved since then and I feel like I should write another review. This is absolutely one of my favorite games and I cant reccommend it enough to anyone who likes steampunk themed, pixelated, warfare. \n\nThe vehicle editor is easy to use and great fun to experiment with, between airships landships and buildings there are plenty of strategies for crushing the enemy. \n\nMultiplayer is a lot of fun too. I admit Ive only used the LAN multiplayer with my brother but it works great, I only wish that the vehicle price limit could be higher than 10,000. (EDIT it now goes to 100,000)\n\nAs far as combat there are two ways to play, single battles where you set up both sides for testing out new or modified creations. The other is conquest mode, you get a choice of map size and AI difficulty before you begin, the conquest maps are different every time and each city you capture offers bonuses allowing you to cunstruct new ships. The AI can be very aggressive or very defensive but once you figure out which they are its a lot of fun to adapt a strategy to try and beat them. \n\nIn combat everything works really well. Its very rewarding to see airships I designed blowing apart enemy airhips. The explosions are fantastic by the way, I love the way burning debris falls to the ground after a room explodes. I suppose my only real complaints would be that I would like a button to slow dowwn time because giving orders quickly when Ive got eight different Ships is hard, and Id like the combat zone to be longer so I can give my first set of orders before the enemy starts raining shells on me.\n\nEach weapon has its own pros and cons so they dont all feel the same, not everyweapon wil work for every situation either which is nice, keeps me thinking. The armor system is also done well, better armor is heavier so theres a tradeoff between durability and speed/lift.\n\nThe developer is great, super active with news about updates and how the game is progressing. Updates somtimes feel far apart but thats because each update contains a multitude of new features and improvments and so far Ive found no bugs in the game either.\n\nSo  Ill just say it one more time, this game is awesome! It has continued to get better and better and Im really excited for the next update too.

relatively simple but lends itself well to the game. The game shines in its mechanics and depth of detail (each crew member and is modeled with his/her own duties, ship systems such as coal, ammo and water run in real time, if you lose a significant portion of your crew certain systems will be resource starved). \n\nThe particle effects are amazing and it's so satisfying taking in the battle damage endured by your airship/vehicle in a smoke filled sky above the burning remains of your enemy.\n\nInitally from youtube videos I was under the impression it was a turn-based game but this is not the case.

The cool down timer for giving commands to your ship (longer the bigger your ship is, can be shortened by adding bridge/cockpit modules) adds an extra dimension to battles where planning and preemptive positioning are rewarded.\n\nThe game has its rough edges but is supported by an active developer with plans for new features in the future such as adding monsters and random encounters in conquest among other things.\n\nConclusion: Great game with an enjoyable multiplayer.

You are given a number of possible modules, which you then can arange to build mainly airships, but also tanks and towers.

If, on the other hand, fleet command or hectic micro management is not your cup of cake, then remember, in this game size matters.

There is a lot of stuff to build with and designing huge ships is fun.  This game reminds me of games from the mid-90s with its art-style.

Flying Forts? Beutiful Ships that look lovely while on fire? Bombers that can't get more than 20 meters off the ground? You see it, you build it, you realise it doesn't work and you improve. Great for replayability and Fun!\n\n-All ships and Building have weaknesses. Built an amazing flying fort that's basically immune to all weapons and can keep flying basically forever? Lol you just got rammed by a fireship and are now buring falling out of the sky. \n\n-Campaign map is pretty easy to work, could do with some more work but it's simple and it works nicely. \n\n- Can build individual ships and refit old ones to adapt to new enemy ships and buildings. This would be further made better if the AI was better and the enemy ship veriaty was improved. \n\n-Varied Combat\n\nCons/Would be cool:\n-Sometimes Crashes but that doesn't become a problem if you safe often. AutoSave Feature would be great! \n\n-Campaign Map could be a bit more complex and a few more features regarding economy,defence and happiness could be added. \n\n-Experience for Ship Crew would be 10/10, would stop me just scrapping amazing ships that have been to hell and back that i've become attached to. \n\n- \"Technologies\" could be researched/ stolen/ reverse engineered from captured vessels. \n\n-More Diffuculty in taking over cities and more diversity in types of cities you're taking over. E.g a captitol cities or larger cities  could be bessieged/ bombed to reduce the defences of that city. This would make taking this more of an achievement. \n\n-War would cost rescources not just money. Not enough steel for ship aromour? Gotta use wood.

Sadly, there is no modding support for now, but the updates bring new stuff, so it's ok.\n\nFun!\nAmong other stuff, you may see: big battles, small battles, a ship you were building for an hour is falling apart because you pressed a wrong button, small cute men run around your ship, small cute men killing each other on your/enemy's ship, small cute men jump from one ship to another accidently falling (wich is even more fun), small cute men dying in agony all around your ship/fortress, firethrowers (yes, baby), meet cool men in glorious battles high in the sky, crash two (or more) big airships into each other, annoy the dev about updates and new features (and if this you can do anywhere, ...), see those updates and new features!

Designing your own Airships is a really fun experience, and seeing how well your ideas match up in real battles makes this game, at least for me, a very addictive experience. I\u2019m still pretty bad at actual combat, but I\u2019ve enjoyed trying to \u201cout design\u201d the enemy. I\u2019ve always wanted to know what an RTS would be like if *I* could design the units, and with Airships, I get the answer. \n\nIts worth mentioning that this is an Early Access game. I\u2019ve scored a few of these games, and while I\u2019ve seen a lot of customers who are really happy with Early Access, I know some people prefer to wait. With the pace that David Stark (the main dev) is updating Airships, I think we all see a promising future, but if you are looking for the final, complete Airships experience, you might want to wait. Having said that, the Airships that I\u2019ve played on Steam is quite different from the Airships that I played when David Stark and I first talked about the score\u2014 this guy is serious about keeping the game updated, and working toward a solid, finished product.

Its that I enjoy building something and then watching it blow up.\nWhile Airships at first seems daunting with the amount of pieces and customization offered. Becomes easier as you begin to learn the ropes, and what is required to make one of your ships float. Suddenly you find yourself making massive vessels that would make the Highwind blush. \nWith a focus on strategy and action, the conquest mode is enjoyable and fun. However I find bases to be slightly under powered and needs some sort of a boost. \nThe true fun lies in its creation and combat mode. Where you can set up huge battles with unlimited resources. Watch as your titanic ships battle to the bitter end. The game does have a few hiccups though. \nA tutorial would've been nice. It takes an hour to learn how to play. Steam workshop support would be amazing and more control over the level design would be awesome as well.\nIn all Airships is a fun game and has a overwhelming amounts of customization for your Airships.

They also quite clearly move around the ship doing various tasks, such as feed coal into the engines, running engines, aiming guns, reloading guns, commanding the ship (from the bridge or cockpit), repairing the ship, defending the ship from invaders, and many more things (too many to list).\n~A campaign thing that is a bit simple at the moment, although the dev is working on making it more interesting.\n~Ship customization\n~Realistic Heraldry, which affects your ships though some bonuses depending on what you choose.\nThese are just a few of the many good points of this game.

Arishps: Conquer The Skies combines a good strategy game with all the fun of building your own kind of fleet.  Even it is an early access game is already good for playing and makes a lot of fun. I can't wait to see the finished game and all of its new coming features. \n\nAbout the game itself. You are playing a nation starting with a small city on the map. You can choose between different map sizes (small, medium, large) and you mainly control your fleet over this map. Then you can start bulding a Airship in the city and construct one by yourself. A plus point here is that you actually don't need a tutorial because there are a lot of helpful information within the game and game itsel is good to handle.\n\nIf you want to built your own Airship you need a lot of different modules so that your ship can acutally fly or shoot...Moreover think about the money. A complex high armored Battleship is nice but it is actually even better when you have the money to bulit it ^^..So you always have to think about to balance between Airships, Money and Defense. So actually you can very, rebuilt, refit your ships or defense structure which is really nice and brings a lot of varity in the game. \n\nWhat more is there so say......\n\nAirships: Conquer the Skies is one of the few really good Early Access games. So far it is working fine and makes a lot fun. I can't find any serious bugs or problems within the game.

Pretty good for a \u00a37 early access game. \n\nPROS:\n- Insane ship customisation, seems like 100+ parts (and this is only the first public release) some of which are decorative, utility, or weapons. You can have things like a sickbay, crew quarters, various armours, different cannons and propellors on a tiny or huge ship. Or you can glue a giant dick banner on the side of it. \n\n- Pretty intense, epic combat. My eyes hurt from watching various cannon balls and shrapnel fly around everywhere, ships falling out of the sky and exploding on the ground, swashbuckling crewmates boarding enemy ships via flimsy ropes and watching your little guys run around inside your ships fixing things and dying. Amazing.\n\nCONS:\n - Although you build little defensive structures around your cities, they are basically just the same as ships except they can't move. No advantage really to investing in these, might as well build more ships.\n\n- Battles seem to last about 45 seconds, even the largest ships run out of ammo very quickly and its annoying how often ships will just seemingly explode after taking one hit. \n\n- Very limited single player campaign at the moment, just about 6 or 7 cities on a map which can be easily taken by 2 or 3 ships. I pretty much beat it in 10 mins. \n\n- Picking certain things for your custom banner will actually determine which perks you get, meaning that you have to pick the icons for what perks you want, meaning you cant actually make the banner you want because you wont get the best perks. Don't really see a reason for this, just make the perks a seperate thing. \n\nOVERALL , this game is really fun so far, the cons are things that seem like easy fixes to me (just rebalance ammo and add more defense structure parts) if you like games like Pixel Pirates or SPAZ, this game is for you. The simple pixel graphics might not be for everyone but if you can get past that this game has some potential. \n   \n", "timestamp_created": 1424884591, "timestamp_updated": 1424884591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821083", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14648777": {"recommendationid": "14648777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007928072", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424791036}, "language": "english", "review": "Now this is what early access should be about. \nNot unfinished sheit, but unfinished greatness with flaws.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/qWytQCkLFP4\n\nThe game revolves around as the title would spoil to you, airships. *gasp* \nDesigning airships, building airships, flying airships, fighting other airships with you're airships, destroying enemy bunkers with airships, defending you're empire with airships and invading other empires with airships.\n\nDid I mention the airships? \n\nYou can create almost anything with the tools you've been given, want a cheap ship with a bunch cheap guns? Rifle it up! If you want some more uumpf then cannons and bomb bay doors will do the trick.\nOr if you are a brute you can just ram you're ship against the other ones.\n\nOf course you can't build a ship with a ton of guns and ammo and expect it to fly very well without a bunch of lift and propulsion modules which you have to take into consideration while building them.\nCrew is also important for everything from getting the ammo to the guns and operating them, or controlling fires and helping wounded comrades to the sickbay if needed.\n\nThe other limiting factor of you're imagination is naturally the cost of the airships and the bank vault of you're empire.\nIf you want bigger ships, then you must invade the other nations of the world and destroy the defensive buildings and airships stationed there. Which in turn makes the empire bigger and more cash come in from the newly acquired cities.\n\nBe careful though! If you take your fleet into the enemy city and you yourself haven't produced any defensive buildings for the protection of you're citizens, the enemy can and will take you're city.\nThis way the game also has small strategical elements to it.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode but I haven't been able to try that as of yet, but I can imagine people coming up with all kinds of amazing airships to destroy one another.\n\nGraphics are cute but at times its hard to make sense on what's going on because of them.\n\nThis is still in early access so if you absolutely don't purchase these things then don't but this game is in my opinion a diamond compared to other stuff that early access has given us.\n\n\nSo I absolutely do recommend this game even in it's incomplete form.", "timestamp_created": 1424880253, "timestamp_updated": 1424881396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39369321": {"recommendationid": "39369321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313559770", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 631, "last_played": 1516162416}, "language": "english", "review": " A really fun game. you can spend hours building and designing your own airships, and walkers and testing them out in battle.

It has a great ship-building environment coupled with a satisfactory combat system which makes for a really fun and challenging game experience. The wonderful modding community serves to improve my game experience further. Also, I am thoroughly impressed with the work on the game's soundtrack. Some of my favorite video game songs come from just this game alone. \n\nThis game is not quite perfect yet, though. \n\nOne thing that I would definitely like to see improvement and further development on in the future is the mission creation system. I feel like it has a lot of potential to become something great, but it seems to be held back a bit by some deceptively small details. First off, the text fields are a pain to work with, since there is no way to go back a few steps and, say, correct a small typo. Making them work more like standard HTML text fields would be appreciated. Second, adding in NPCs (Monsters) should be improved, specifically with putting them on the player's side. When this is attempted, the NPCs go comatose and sit (float) there like rocks. Having some monsters on the player's side (maybe even under their direct command) could make for some interesting missions indeed.\n\nOther than that, I really enjoy the game so far and can't wait to see where Stark takes it next.", "timestamp_created": 1521168114, "timestamp_updated": 1521168114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40834437": {"recommendationid": "40834437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025862705", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 164, "last_played": 1521142737}, "language": "german", "review": "What I enjoyed about this game:\n\n- endless options for trying different strategies, using custom airships, 'landships' aka tanks and fortresses\n- using dozens of different components that behave recognizeably different and allow many weird and special builds\n- with simulated crews, fuel, ammo and fire control systems\n- while everything but the ground is completely destructible component by component\n- leading to LOTS OF FIRE, EXPLOSIONS AND FALLING DEBRIS THAT IS SMASHING INTO OTHER STUFF, LEADING TO EVEN MORE EXPLOSIONS!!!\n- Dragons.\n\nWhat I didn't (yet) find perfect:\n\n- Single player conquest makes up the major and most interesting part of this game so far (in my opinion). Multiplayer is still being in an early phase of development and I haven't tried it yet. It comes with a couple of problems though:\n    - No diplomacy, no economy, intelligence system is boring, there are rewards for capturing cities but they feel stale \n       (especially when it's just another special weapon you can't usually use in your ships; chances are, you are not going \n       to plan a new ship from scratch just for using this weapons, because it doesn't even matter).\n    - After you have figured out the right strategy, it will work consistently practically all the time \n       almost independently from what the AI is doing. This game yet isn't what I had hoped for regarding strategic options.\n\n\nIf you would buy the game only for the battle simulator part of it, like to have a lot of options of destroying your enemies, this is worth the purchase, but it's gamemodes are still pretty rough around the corners.

The game plays like a RTS with player able to give each ship commands. A great feature is the inclusion of individual part damage which effects the overall performance of the entire ship. This game provides endless fun and performs really well.\n\n[h1]Game Breakdown[/h1]\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\nThe gameplay of this game is introduced well by the great tutorial provided. It teaches the player how to use the ship designing tool and control finished ships in combat. The player can then pick from a multitude of different modes such as multiplayer, missions, and a conquest mode.\n\nThe mechanics that are explained are ship designs and combat. Many factors go into ship design. An airship must have sufficient lift so that it can stay afloat and there are many pieces that do that. Most of these engine pieces must be run with coal, so coal store must be included on a player\u2019s ship. This coal weighs the ship down again. Designing is a huge balancing act to try and make sure that a ship is can fly and perform tasks while simultaneously being powerful. A few are other block types are: weapons, propulsion, support items, supply hatches, armor, control modules, and crew. If any of these pieces are destroyed they stop working, so it is important to protect pieces that are vital to ship operations.\n\nWeapons allow ships to fight one another in combat. They each have strengths and weakness. Some guns like the cannon are great at breaking enemy armor but they take a lot of ammo from ammo stores and can take a while to reload. Propulsions allows your ship to move from side to side. Support items include coal stores, ammo stores, repair bays, and water station which put out fires. Supply hatches are required in ship design because they are where they are resupplied by towns in conquest mode. Armor protects a ship against attacks but the heavier a ship is, the more engine power it will need to gain any height in the air. Finally, control modules allow the player to give commands to the ships RTS style and crew is required to man the stations.\n\nConquest mode is the most detailed mode and the most fun in my opinion. Airships becomes a grand strategy style of game where each city gives a player income and a perk. The player must build a fleet of airships, land ships, and defensive buildings to simultaneously attack other cities while defending one\u2019s own. This creates a fun resource management game as a player\u2019s fleet can only be as big as their income allows. There will even be a multiplayer version to play with friends!\n\nOverall, this is a great strategy that contains endless amounts of fun and enjoyment creating and battling ships.\n\n[u]Sound:[/u]\nThe weapon fire and impacts are so satisfying. The cannons and rifle shots against crumbling wood makes the player feel like a true commander. Fires burn and whoosh, firemen spray water to put out fires. It is this huge cacophony of sound that makes it feel like a player\u2019s ships are truly in a warzone fighting for their very lives. The music is full of war song style compositions. Lots of loud trumpets create tunes that make victory feel all the sweeter.\n\n [u]Graphics:[/u]\nAirships uses a simple pixel art style. I am awed by how much detail is put into such small sprites. Every crew member is visible in a ship doing their jobs, and they are all crisply discernable. Different parts are also easy to tell apart as they all use mainly one color, besides the weaponry.

Simple yet complex.  Your ship(s) crew runs about executing their tasks while you attempt to destroy ships/buildings/monsters before they destroy you.\n\nThe airship construction is engaging and allows the player to elegantly balance several variables while optimizing a ship for battle.\n\nThe battles are surprisingly complex.  The enemies and physics engine are formidable.  The player battles for both effective ship control and the enemy's defeat.\n\nPros:\nFun ship construction\nCan be run in a pure 'creative' mode to build ships\nCrew interactions are complex/immersive\nDev seems to be updating again after a long hiatus\n\nCons:\n2d/16bit-really kinda looks trashy.  A 2d battlefield is silly.  I played better 2d/16bit games in the 1980s.\nBattles can be frustrating due to poor control.  Not enough control feedback to let the player know what is happening.\nLore and genre is garbage - nobody cares.  Writing is easier than coding.  Make a better game, the lore can evolve on its own.\nStill early access after all these years.  Will possibly (probably) never be realeased.\nFlaws in game design are abundant.  How do you go around a tree on a 2d battlefield?  This kind of crap is just bad design.\n\nUltimately, I give this a +1 mostly because I miss Choplifter.\nPAY NO MORE THAN $5 ON SALE - IT'S KINDA JUNK.", "timestamp_created": 1517416776, "timestamp_updated": 1517417055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39737951": {"recommendationid": "39737951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178448077", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517610160}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game; infinite replay value here!

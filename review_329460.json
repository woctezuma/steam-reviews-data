It's got the content and production value, it's just got one questionable decision in how you progress the game is what's keeping it from being nigh perfect in it's own right.\n\nSo, would I still recommend it?

Like most games of this genre, and most games in general, I highly recommend using a controller. I imagine I might be giving an opposite review if I had to play this on a keyboard, something that was never designed to be for video games, let alone video games like this. So this is coming from someone who used a controller. \n\nThe graphics bring me right back to my childhood, as does the music, the sound effects and the storyline. It's a simple race against the clock game. You can take as long as you'd like, and get a simple \"clear\" reward, but in order to unlock new levels you're going to need to go faster. It is very challenging, but unlike many other games, if you die/lose it's 100% your fault, not poor design. \n\nI got this game on sale after it being on my radar for a very long time, and I'm so glad I did. If I had to go back and pay full price for this game, I would do it in an instant without a second thought. This game is worth the full price and then some. \n\nTypically I like to play a game for a couple of minutes (5 to 10 max) and then give it a review.

You can combat enemies (and interact with some obstacles) with both Rex's spin attack and, cleverly, the emissions from your rocket boots. You earn stars by completing the level and, optionally, by doing so without dying and/or doing so within a challenging time constraint. The progression scheme is reminiscent of Super Mario 64 - you choose non-linearly from an assortment of levels until you have enough stars to unlock the boss battle, and beating the boss unlocks a new assortment of levels, and so on. Coins scattered around the levels can be exchanged for a plethora of cosmetic items and color schemes for Rex, and easter-egg-style \"treasures\" encourage pushing the envelopes of the level designs and finding ways to explore out of bounds. Couch co-op (!!) is available if you don't wanna go it alone.\n\nThe controls are tight and responsive - Rex does what you input, when you input it, nothing more, nothing less. Controls make or break a game like this, and it's refreshing to feel a game get it so right.\n\nThe graphics are of the familiar SNES-era cutesy pixel fare; Rex's design especially stands out as charming and appealing.\n\nThe game is both challenging enough (in level design) and forgiving enough (plenty of checkpoints) to appeal to most players interested in this sort of game. But the additional challenges offered are where JumpJet Rex really, truly shines. If you want JumpJet Rex to be [i]hard[/i] hard, it'll step up to the plate and bare its teeth in no time. The game is fairly short, but earning all the stars in the game is no small feat - no-death level runs and especially time-attack level runs get absolutely brutal, but never artificially so. No random agents of death - what you see is what you get, and if you die it's your own damn fault! Just how I like it! Online time-attack leaderboards ensure that there's always a time to beat, propelling the replay value to phenomenal levels. And if that isn't enough for you, RageQuit Rex mode tasks you with completing the entire game on just three lives. Good luck with that.\n\nAside from the couch co-op, multiplayer Arena and Dino Race modes are available; I have not yet had the chance to experience them well enough to assess here.\n\nThe soundtrack consists of well-crafted true-to-hardware chiptune, which is admirable, fitting, and sounds great. That said, though, to me the tunes were less memorable than I'd have expected considering the notable talent involved. Personal taste only - there's nothing at all objectively wrong with it, and you may well find that the tunes stick with you more than they did to me!\n\nThe boss fights that keep the gates to the next levels are underwhelming when you figure out that the devs intend for you to cheese them to get that time attack star, and indeed every boss in the game can be cheesed disproportionately easily. Fortunately there are few of them, and even cheesing them is admittedly fun.\n\nThough the game gives you a radar to locate the rings you must collect, there are a few levels that were designed with what I felt was an excessive amount of non-linearity in order to get you mixed up and lost. Though, again, they are few and far between, they were the only ones I didn't particularly look forward to replaying.\n\nOn that note, this game cries out very, very loudly for a level editor. As I understand it, the resources just weren't there, and more than two years out from release, it\u2019s not likely to happen. That's too bad. I certainly can't hold it against the game or its developers.\n\nOverall, do I recommend JumpJet Rex? Well, yes! Very much so. I can't remember the last time I played a game of this genre that was as satisfying and such an apparent labor of love as this one. If you're into this sort of game, absolutely give it a spin!\n\nPros:\n-Precise, satisfying controls\n-A blast to play and especially to challenge yourself\n-Appealing art direction\n-Challenges add lots of replay value\n-Challenge is never artificial\n-Heaps on the difficulty if you ask for it\n-Allows comfortable pacing if not looking for abject difficulty\n-Lots of game modes\n-Couch co-op!!\n-Time attack leaderboards give you more incentives to push yourself\n-Lots of cosmetic customization\n\nCons:\n-Soundtrack is serviceable but not really memorable\n-Boss fights exist to be cheesed\n-Rex's spin attack radius could be a little bigger\n-Some level designs are disorienting\n-Late game difficulty tapers off a bit\n-Could be longer\n-Online co-op not available\n\nConsider trying if you like:\n-Old-school \"Nintendo-hard\" platformers\n-Time-attacking, speedrunning\n-Setting your own pace and difficulty\n\nConsider avoiding if:\n-You don't like to replay levels\n-You don't like games on the shorter side\n-You want something more relaxing than challenging.", "timestamp_created": 1508384557, "timestamp_updated": 1508384557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35801650": {"recommendationid": "35801650", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976799778", "num_games_owned": 850, "num_reviews": 308, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508264389}, "language": "german", "review": "JumpJet Rex ist endlich wieder ein Spiel mit Dinos.

There are a few visual bugs on walls, making them overlap awkwardly. But apart from that, the art design is clear and only requires some familiarisation with different hitboxes. Apposite to its visual presentation, its background music consists of a set of lively chiptune pieces, rounding off the overall impression.\n\nGameplay wise, JumpJet Rex manages to hold the balance between moments of frustration and the drive to improve. It's less a game of reflexes and more of timing, evaluation and muscle memory. The controls initially seem floaty, but really are tight, precise and responsive after the first few minutes of play. Most importantly though, there's no random bullshit. Every situation is solvable and learning how to cope with difficult enemies or levels always feels like a great success.

The devs are great and responsive, I found a total of two bugs during my playthrough of the game and after I recorded a short vid of what I did to cause the bug and I showed it to them they immeadiatly patched the game to fix it. The levels have different challenges that you have to complete which gives the game a good sense of replayability if your a completionist.

I would give this game a solid reccomendation, if you are having trouble with the final stage just dont bother with it.

I liked the NES style story cards, and wish there had been more because the developers did a great job with them. \n\nIn the levels, there are also collectibles, coins and rubies that earn you \"money\" that can be used for purely aesthetic reasons. You can buy different heads, scale color, boot color, and jetboot trail color... I suppose this is nice for the multiplayer modes, but I didn't feel compelled to play more just for the coins. My impetus for replay was more so the leaderboards and star system, which make for a fun little exercise in seeing how much you can \"perfect\" a level. \n\nAnyhow, there's a free demo for this game, if you're still hesitant, try that for sure.

Now, I\u2019ve never seen a platformer built entirely around this one mechanic before JumpJet Rex. Maybe some game has done it in a similar fashion, but JumpJet Rex does so to a level that I have to imagine is greater than most other similar attempts. \n\nIt isn\u2019t your average platformer in that it includes a leaderboard for each level making it a race against time, or rather your or the world\u2019s personal best as well as a non-linear level path that forces you to complete every stage to a strong degree. It also includes various multiplayer LAN modes.\n\nNow, I\u2019m speaking completely on assumptions but the thing is that JumpJet Rex is so well polished that it feels as if, well, it could have been a big game Super Nintendo. I grew up with Super Nintendo and thus, as the console that introduced me to gaming, I\u2019ve a lot of experience on this console and games somewhat similar to JumpJet Rex.\nWhat JumpJet Rex does is put you in a new, yet relatively familiar, world. It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re playing B.O.B. with infinite jetpack abilities. But JumpJet Rex makes it feel as if some new life has been breathed into the genre. To be honest, it feels like a game anyone could have made too which is really cool if you\u2019re an aspiring game designer or programmer. It gives you something to mimic that doesn\u2019t feel out of reach. Finally, I believe this is a game anyone who is interested in creating videogames should try out at least once.\n\nIn conclusion, for a score, I\u2019ll give the controls a 7/10, the graphics an 8/10, and finally the gameplay a 7/10. The game could have been better but considering the feel it\u2019s a very good game and is sort of inspiring in its own way. This equates to a 74 out of a possible 100.\n\nLike, comment, subscribe.

It clearly has plenty of buyers and players, but it's still seemingly not often mentioned. Even after reading some of the criticism (not that there's much anyway) I am still flabbergasted as to why, because it's easy to see just how much of a labor of love this game is (and I'll note right now that the game controls great, don't know why that was an issue for anyone). Much care and thought has been put into the game, what with the level design coinciding with the strict yet still possible time limits given if you choose to speedrun levels. This is mixed with some legitimately nostalgic aesthetic touches which show that the people who made this game clearly were alive back in the day long enough to know what it was like. This isn't just any ol' imitation, I could legitimately see a game like this having been around back in the 90s on the SNES (not the NES despite the style of the soundtrack; the graphics are too nice for the NES otherwise), and as a child I could imagine this being my favorite game.\n\nAdmittedly, as an adult it's not my favorite, as it can be frustrating at times, particularly when attempting to obtain some treasures in the game, though it is due to a legitimate toughness as opposed to any glitches or nigh-impossible fake difficulty. Though the game does get harder, it does become more rewarding to play as you feel like you actually accomplish things when you obtain victories, even minor ones, as the game takes practice rather than luck. This is the case whether you are speed-running, exploring to find secrets, or just breezing through the levels, and it's great that all of those options are available. The game retains its challenge either way since you'll be facing actual platforming (or \"platflying\") challenges, especially when treasure-seeking. I will say, however, if you do happen to just play through the game in a \"Point A to Point B,\" manner, you are not going to enjoy this game nearly as much since, especially for ten bucks, the game can actually feel like a great adventure (yes, adventure).\n\nThough I said it's not my favorite game as an adult, the passion the developers show here seeps into my heart and makes me love it just as much as they likely did, and so I still find this to be among the greatest games on all of Steam, possibly even the best of the retro-throwbacks I've played (if not, it's damn close).

It simultaneously attempts to be both a platformer in which you go as quickly as possible and try for the best time, and a platformer in which you hunt down secrets and get all the collectables. Neither of these goals are accomplished well.\n\nThe air dash is extremely inconsistent and hard to control, and didn't even work half of the times that I tried to use it. Every trap on the map is on a global timer, which makes sense on paper, but it starts as soon as the level loads; this means that getting the best time will sometimes require you to guess when to actually start moving around so as to be able to bypass timed lasers and moving enemies. This also makes getting 3 star ratings extremely obnoxious to get, and certainly not worth the effort for achievements.\nCoins are strewn about the levels, encouraging you to pick them up, but most are far too out of the way to be able to still get a good time. There are also collectables and warp zones (for lack of a better phrase) that are only accessible if you go the completely wrong direction. Some collectables, as far as I can tell, are entirely unobtainable as well, and exist only to taunt you. \nGraphically, this game is a fairly forgettable 2D pixel art style.

Not for lack effort, but because it's just not feasible. I'll go into why later in the review.\n\nJumpJet Rex is a colourful speedrun game about a dinosaur that collects stars to save the universe. Something like that anyway. There are some 30+ delightful little worlds with each type of world (ice, desolate space base, etc.) seeming to have their own little chiptune to go with it. And these are some damn good chiptunes. I bought the game through Chrono GG so it came with the soundtrack and my god was it worth it. Definitely got some workout tunes out of it (should I ever be finish my selection of podcasts). Really, have a listen to some of them. You can also customize the appearance of your dinosaur, 4 elements. Head, skin tone, shoes, jumpjet particles. But that's dress-up and I don't find it particularly enjoyable. \n\nIn each level you collect rings to unlock the gate. Pass the finish line and you've completed it, you earn a star. You can earn up to three stars per level. One for completion, one for not dying, and one for speedrunning. You need to collect some number of stars to unlock the next few levels. Simple enough. I usually settled for completing without dying to grind stars because I only needed to be careful to progress. But some levels are easy to speedrun if you take advantage of checkpoints (and dying). So I took those too. You can also download ghosts within the game of the top players in the world or people near your skill level to see how they do things. So it provides a good improvement tool within the game, well done. \n\nAs the game goes on, and certain elements get added to the levels, I saw some SIGNIFICANT frame drops. Like, we're talking 2 fps frame drops. The culprits seem to be certain environmental objects. Patches of thorns that disburse leaves and these globules that travel up and down. And it became a real pain on a particular boss fight called 'Seedmour' in which the level is full of these thorn patches so after maybe a minute of fighting the boss you'd be unable to do anything for several minutes due to the fps drop. Alt-tabbing seemed to help, but I don't know for sure. That boss fight was a particularly annoying because after dropping the boss's health to zero you also had to ground-pound it before it got back up and if you happened to be stuck in 2 fps time when that window presented itself... prepare yourself to have to hit it again because there's no way you're going to do it in time. And this is why I haven't finished the game. Because in the later levels this becomes a constant issue and you kinda need the frames in a speedrunning game if you want it to be fun. (I suspect the issue is some kind of garbage collection or object recycling code).\n\nOther than that though, the game is brilliant.

A 16-bit arcade platformer, TreeFortress Games\u2019 prehistoric space escapade merges the divergent sensibilities of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, into a game that is as smart and enjoyable as Super Mario, and as undeniably cool as Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nFirst order of business: JumpJet Rex puts a dinosaur in space. Through a feat of Cretaceous engineering, dinosaurs developed space travel, and just in time, as a meteor has just been spotted with \u201cextinction\u201d written all over it. Outfitted with the best jetboots and novelty headwear money can buy, Rex must race back home to earth or become the last dinosaur alive.\n\nJumpJet Rex knows, with absolute conviction, exactly what it is. It\u2019s a game where a dinosaur can and should wear an eyepatch. A game where collectible golden stars are the key to everything, and the best way to the exit is whichever makes you look the coolest. JumpJet Rex understands the earnest appeal of Sonic in his prime, blown out to a degree only the insertion of dinos could bring about. He hasn\u2019t inherited the blue hedgehog\u2019s patronizing finger wag, but it isn\u2019t hard to imagine Rex as Sonic\u2019s coolest unnecessary side character.\n\nBut lest TreeHouse Games\u2019 jet hopping reptile be too heavily compared to Sega\u2019s functionally irrelevant mascot, JumpJet Rex also borrows liberally from other notable 16-bit platformers, while allowing itself space to develop its own personality. JumpJet Rex is about speed, but for the sake of precision more than novelty. Even if you neglect to go after the speedrun star attached to each level, JumpJet Rex has a way of making quick movement feel imperative. Partially, this is on account of most levels being designed almost like race tracks, whether linear point-to-points or arena stages that task you with collecting a certain amount of rings as quickly as possible. Mostly, though, you want to move fast because it feels cool to do so.\n\nJumpJet Rex controls like an absolute dream, allowing you to dash and hop around obstacles like the world\u2019s premiere jet fueled acrobatic dinosaur (which you likely are by default). By opting for a less rigid movement system than most platformers, JumpJet Rex allows for a great deal of personality in how you navigate levels, a quality that begins to show more and more when you start attempting more difficult runs and need to develop personal strategies to clear them.\n\nPlaying JumpJet Rex is incredibly rewarding because it successfully blurs the line between playing as the developer intended, and playing however feels best to you, lessening the frustration of sussing out a level\u2019s path and turning it into a sort of reflex puzzle. The last few stages (and the very last one, most especially) do an agonizingly good job of disrupting this recipe, being both several orders of magnitude more challenging and tedious, but if nothing else these levels can almost always be brute forced without any real penalty for doing so. It\u2019s a crude compromise, but it gets the job done.\n\nJumpJet Rex\u2019s last few stages were an unfortunate end to an otherwise shockingly entertaining experience, but it speaks well to the game that even after such a miserable time beating my head against its final level, I\u2019d still happily jump right back in to everything before it. That might be a bit like cutting the mold off a slice of bread and making a sandwich with it, but if it still tastes just as great, I can\u2019t complain too much.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2016/08/11/jumpjet-rex-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1470969813, "timestamp_updated": 1470969813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24730351": {"recommendationid": "24730351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127047900", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470426173}, "language": "french", "review": "Petit jeu de plate-forme tr\u00e8s sympa mais pas assez connu, dommage :) !

Its is colourful, charming, addictively fun, and very frustratingly difficult! As is the style with the retro 2D platformer, Jump Jet Rex throws its hat into the ring as an easy to learn, insanely difficult to master platformer. The aim is to simply collect all 3 \"stars\" in a level, awarded to you if you complete the level within a time limit, complete the level without dying, and one for just getting through the level at all. The challenge comes in the fact that the player needs as many stars as possible to unlock more and more levels in order to complete the game. You'll find yourself going back to old levels in the hope of beating it quickly this time, or without dying this time, all with the objective of collecting those prescious stars. The gameplay as one may expect is controlling a small dinosaur with jet shoes. That concept alone is endearing but the player can also fully customise the apprearance of their rex and their jet shoes. You'll be flying, jumping, and boosting your way through treacherously difficult mazes and obstacles. The game also features boss battles which offer a nice change of pace. Overall, this game is recommended for fans of old-school 2D platformers, the kind that are so addictive yet will have you screaming at your screen in fury at how difficult it is.

You control Rex, a tyrannosaur astronaut whose job it is to save Earth from an incoming asteroid. The gameplay consists of navigating your way through a number of 2D levels \u2013 40 to be exact \u2013 plus four boss stages.\n\nThe core gameplay is fairly simple \u2013 the central premise is that you have a pair of rocket boots, meaning you can jump an infinite amount of times in the air, boost yourself straight up at a high rate, boost yourself sideways at a high rate (which launches a mid-range projectile in the opposite direction), or do a butt stomp to deal damage to something below you. You also have a bicycle kick which deals damage in all directions around you.\n\nThere are a number of enemies. Some of them can be killed with some of your attacks, while others can be temporarily stunned. More interestingly, most projectiles can also be destroyed by your attacks, allowing you to defend yourself from them.\n\nThe bosses all have large numbers of hit points; three of them are fairly standard \u201clarge hit point gauge\u201d bosses, though each of them has a way to be killed much more quickly. The final boss has two phases, and the first phase regenerates, making it easily the hardest boss in the game.\n\nThe primary goal is of the game is the three stars you get for completing each stage; you need a certain number of stars to unlock more stages, and getting the \u201cproper\u201d ending requires you to get almost all of the stars in the game. One star is awarded automatically for completing each stage; this is generally not a terribly difficult task, as there are checkpoints in the levels and most of the stages are pretty generous with them. A second star is awarded for completing a stage without dying, and a third star is awarded for completing a stage within a certain time limit. You don\u2019t need to accomplish both optional tasks in one run to get all three stars, but on many of the stages, the time limits are tight enough that you cannot afford to die, or can only die once, to get the time. Because the stages are persistent after your death, there are times when dying and respawning closer to where you need to go can cut down on the time needed to beat a level, and a few levels require you to do so.\n\nThere are optional bonus levels and collectibles in almost every stage which unlock cosmetic improvements to Rex\u2019s home base. In addition, each stage contains a large number of coins and gems which can be collected in order to purchase cosmetic items; collecting all the coins gives a coin bonus, and eventually, an achievement for doing it in every stage.\n\n\n\nOnly the very final stage in the game does not have checkpoints, and it is a borderline platform hell level, making it pretty annoying.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty tough as far as such games go; it took me about 7 hours and 40 minutes to 100% the game according to the in-game timer. It is nowhere near the difficulty level of, say, a game like Super Meat Boy, but it is still fairly tough. The real challenge mostly lies in the speed runs, though in a few levels, not dying is the more difficult challenge.\n\nBy and large, the levels are decent enough, but it is hard to shake the feeling that, for the first 3/4ths of the game, there isn\u2019t much to denote your progress. The stages get gradually harder, but only the final nine stages really feel all that different from what came before. The game never gets too difficult (save for the final, checkpointless stage which is a borderline platform hell level, which is a bit frustrating) but apart from the final area there is little sense of progression.\n\nThe game mechanics and level designs are decent enough, but the stages aren\u2019t terribly pretty and are pretty bare-bones functional, as is typical in such retro games.\n\nIn the end, I can\u2019t really recommend this game, but not because it is bad. It is not bad. It is decent enough and I didn\u2019t feel bored while playing it. What the game suffers from is being mediocre. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it, but it is pretty much exactly enjoyable enough to keep the player from getting bored, never so good that you get actively excited about it. You just aren\u2019t missing anything by never playing this game. And if you aren\u2019t missing anything by playing a game, why give up eight hours of your life to do so?", "timestamp_created": 1462662908, "timestamp_updated": 1462662921, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639914", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22852484": {"recommendationid": "22852484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010630805", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462817862}, "language": "english", "review": "JumpJet Rex is a fantastic new take on the precision platformer genre. The first few levels aren't fantastic but they let you get to grips with the controls and prepare you for the faster paced, more dangerous levels to come. \nThe main focus of the game is to use Rex's foot mounted jets to stay off the ground and keep a solid momentum while jumping, flying and propelling forward through each level; collecting coins and jumping through rings along the way. Level design is very creative and although the levels are short the game encourages replaying them by offering rewards for no death runs as well as speederuns. Those are optional however so more casual players can still enjoy the game.\n\nJumpJet Rex isn't perfect, however. The soundtrack is quite good but a bit repetitive and the controls could be just a little tighter. There are upgrades to be unlocked as well but they're all entirely cosmetic. I think it would've been nice to be able to buy a few upgrades to jump higher or move faster.\n\nOverall I'd say it's worth the low price as the gameplay manages to be both unique and familiar at the same time, not to mention an absolute blast to play.", "timestamp_created": 1462658986, "timestamp_updated": 1462659140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22848123": {"recommendationid": "22848123", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970827515", "num_games_owned": 1162, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462724821}, "language": "english", "review": "To claim this game is shovelware is to lack understanding of what that term even means.

All the while you\u2019ll be dodging spikes, missiles, robots, and zombie like plants from a variety of settings such as space, ice, and jungle worlds. Upon completion of the level you will be awarded stars that are required to progress the game further and unlock the next batch of levels; you are awarded one star for simply completing the level, one star for completing the level without dying, and a third star for finishing the level within the given challenge time limit. Along the way you will be able to collect numerous coins that can be used to purchase adorable cosmetic items for your tiny dino hero. \n\nThe game boasts a gorgeous hand-drawn 16 bit retro art style that harkens back to the old days of the Sega Genesis. The game thrives on its fast paced race against the clock and one hit heart system that combine for at times, quite the punishing experience. The controls are fluid and responsive, whether you are jumping, dashing, or rolling, if you happen to die you won\u2019t feel cheated because the controls were at fault, something that is crucial for a 2D platformer of this speed and difficulty.

I've spent almost all of my time on this game speedrunning it rather than trying to go through and 100% the game, so I feel like this would help people looking for something fast to play.\n\nTo begin, this is basically platformer, except you get to fly around so there's no actual platforming involved. Much of the challenge comes from a few enemies and obstacles scattered around. The amount may vary from no enemies and only a couple thorny bushes to 50 lasers shooting at you at once. Each map is a course where you must go through rings to complete the level. \n\nThis game offers fairly simple movement in the form of flight that is nice for casual runs, but it can be very fun to utilize to its full potential in speedrunning. This is obviously subjective, but the movement is extremely fluid, making it so the only reason why a person would fail would be due to their own ability. \n\nOnce you move into the actual level design, that's when things get a bit murky. I don't want to talk badly about the levels since anything can be speedran if you put effort into it, but some are extremely difficult and require a great deal of time and patience to do at the speed of top runners. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is something to think about if you're just looking for a fun and easy game to run. This game focuses quite a bit on ILs, so getting top times on each level could take quite awhile. I would say there is massive variety in the levels so I would also let that be known.\n\nThis game offers a ton of things to collect in each level if anyone ever wanted to attempt to speedrun 100%, so that's a plus for dedicated people looking for some replay value. I wouldn't say it's to the point of obnoxiousness, but some of the levels are fairly difficult to 100% complete, which is where the speedrunning part becomes a lot more challenging to master. \n\nOverall, I think this is an excellent game with an active community and plenty of room to improve on. It has simple mechanics that take time to master and a hefty amount of content to explore, which is great for people looking for a lot of replay value.", "timestamp_created": 1442855530, "timestamp_updated": 1442855530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17960540": {"recommendationid": "17960540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076721797", "num_games_owned": 681, "num_reviews": 434, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441811482}, "language": "english", "review": "First playing through all the levels and collecting stuff, I was a little indifferent. It was decent fun, but it was kind of on the easy side. Didn't really stand out.\n\nGoing back and playing through in speedrun mode after I knew the levels kind of well, I got it, yeah. And going through and getting good times on individual levels by themselves, too, I got it. This is a great speedgame, but a relatively easy game on its own, for a platformer at least. It's like, a casual speedrunning game, or something. There's not a lot of competition in the leaderboards though, unfortunately.\n\nThe bosses all have a trick to them that basically trivializes them but fighting them any other way is tedious, I find them very weird. Sometimes it feels like my dash input was being dropped, or the dash cancel was being dropped. Not often, but I noticed it, felt weird when it happened.\n\nGame looks nice, probably not enough levels, only about 45 and only a few take more than a minute when speedrunning, ends up feeling really short. Not a fan of some of the grindy achievements, but they're optional and most of the achievements are good.\n\nIt's fun to play and optimize the levels and that's about all I could really ask, just wish there was a bit more of a challenge to it overall but ehh!

There aren\u2019t as much levels in it (and they aren't as hard as in SMB) but the length of a stage is much longer than in SMB.\nYou are a T-rex in space (a dinonaut to be a precise) who has the task to plant a bomb on a meteorite aiming for the earth (to prevent the extinction of all dinosaurs).\nRex is equipped with a pair of boots which allow him to fly indefinitely (dash, rocket and unlimited jump). Of course you can\u2019t just fly how you want. The levels are so designed that you have to carefully utilize your abilities to reach the end of a stage in one piece.\nIn each level are 3 stars to get: one for finishing the stage, another one for beating a certain time limit and a third one for reaching the finish line without dying. As you collect stars you unlock more stages. \n\nBesides coins you collect in the levels, which you can spend in shops to customize Rex from tip to toe (different heads, body- , jumpboots- and jet stream-colors), you can also find hidden items in each stage which are merely decorative (referring to the gaming society and pop culture) but still nice to have because they aren\u2019t easy to find and give you a feeling of accomplishment.\n\nAdditionally to the normal levels are 4 boss levels. Those fights are entertaining and at the first sight very hard. But as soon as you look through the enemy and recognize their weakness you can finish a fight in a few seconds (which is also necessary to get the time star ;)).\n\nThe 8-bit graphics are nice to look at; the different themes of the stages are good conversed to the player. As you would\u2019ve thought the music is 8-bit chiptune. There are some tracks that I really like and furthermore none of the soundtrack gets annoying as you might have thought. Certainly the music and the graphics are not for everyone but if you are fond of 8-bit music and graphics there is no reason against JumpJet Rex (regarding the art and music).\n\nI\u2019d recommend the game to those who\u2019d like the 8-bit style, a challenge, and have no problem with doing a level over and over again to fully complete it (For your info: it is not necessary to get ALL stars to finish the game, 2/3 are sufficient to complete the game).", "timestamp_created": 1439340657, "timestamp_updated": 1439340852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17482911": {"recommendationid": "17482911", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960295217", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439266845}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7a5\uc810\n- \ub2e4\uc18c \ud22c\ubc15\ud558\ub098 \uc798 \ub514\uc790\uc778\ub41c 2d \ub3c4\ud2b8\n- \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc640 \ub3c4\uc804 \uc695\uc744 \uc790\uadf9\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uad6c\uc131\n- \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud14c\ub9c8\uc640 \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ub808\ubca8 \ub514\uc790\uc778\n\n\ub2e8\uc810\n- \uc2a4\ud53c\ub4dc \ub7f0/\ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\uc5b4 \ub9e4\ub2c8\uc544\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c\uba74 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc190\ub300\uae30\ub294 \ubcc4\ub85c\uc778 \uc5d4\ub529 \ud6c4 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\n", "timestamp_created": 1439267242, "timestamp_updated": 1439267242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17474746": {"recommendationid": "17474746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118849367", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439620085}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u0438\u0447\u044c \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438-\u043f\u0440\u044b\u0433\u0443\u043d\u0446\u0430\u043c\u0438", "timestamp_created": 1439223730, "timestamp_updated": 1439223730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452374", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17473614": {"recommendationid": "17473614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053747987", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464536604}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended.

I clocked almost 10hrs so far without any co-op or another difficulty and im still not finished.\nThe game really reminded me of Blues Brothers from the SNES sometimes. You have your basic abilities at your hand and need to get good with them to beat every level and get every star. You will rage a lot but mostly due to your own failure in timing or wrong technic in using the abilities you have at your command. I noticed that first hand as I progressed further into the game, at first some time based stars in the earlier levels were impossible to get for me but later on I just breezed through them as I mastered Rex movements more and more.\nThere will be challenge, but dont be afraid to take it.

Which you can use to buy skins. Nice!\n\nCons:\n\n- Engine: One main problem is its performance. I play it on an i7 quadcore with an ok gaming video card.\nIn a ridiculous resolution (1280x720). And the game lags in huge levels. I even got the feeling, that sometimes when I hit a button it just doesn't react at all. So there seems to be a technical problem in the core engine.\n- Speedrunning concept: The developers want you to speedrun the levels. There is a bonus if you finish within a narrow time limit. But you just don't see enough in a lot of levels with your small point of view. So sometimes, suddenly, out of nowwhere, an enemy appears or a big block goes straight towards you. And you don't feel like you had a lot of chances to avoid it, except for learning the level by hard. Wrong approach in my opinion.\n- Boss fights: The bosses mostly annoy me, they are hard but not in a good way. Hard to describe.\n- Full price is too expensive. I paid 5\u20ac during sale which seems ok, but it is definitely not worth 15\u20ac.

Stars you collect unlock more levels, and you gain a star per level completed, as well as up to two additional stars for completing a level with no deaths and within a strict time limit.

Collectables include getting 100% of the coins on a level, finding things to spruce up your dinonaut base, and unlocking pieces to customize your Rex with.\n\nAfter you're done with Adventure mode, there's Speedrun mode (for, well, speedrunning) and RageQuit Rex mode (complete the game with three lives, lose them all and it's all over.)\n\nOverall it's a very fun game. Movement feels nice and fluid. The soundtrack is really great, the background music gets stuck in your head and the sound effects feel good. Some of the artwork is really nice, particularly the boss designs and ending screens... but sadly the in-level graphics are a bit on the bland side. The level design is a little repetitive too, which you notice on your fourth time navigating a twisty spike-filled corridor.

The length of levels are about on par with 'The End' in super meat boy being ~45 seconds, however some maps can be upwards to 2+ minutes long featuring a multitude of paths to take or being a long path filled to the brim with traps.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game are the Jump jet boots Rex wears. The boots allow him to jump anywhere in the air as much as he'd like, but if you wanna go fast, you can dash sideways, stomp down for faster falling speed, or boost upwards which is faster than spamming jump, but is initially much slower. Overall I love those boots, it's surprising how creative you can get with some obstacles and saving a lot of time on a nice chunk levels.\n\nThe goal of each level isn't necessarily just beating them either, Like Super Meat Boy there's a par time that they push you to complete under, in my case they seemed pretty fair with a few curve balls they throw in to catch you off guard and force you to think out the box. Then there's deathless runs, which can be absolutely brutal on the late levels that can be ~2 minute long runs of non-stop pain for your Dino. There's two other goals that aren't necessary for getting the ending, grabbing all coins, and finding all secret loot stashed in the levels, so if you're a completionist, expect some hunts for specific coins or treasure.\n\nAll in all that games pretty great, albeit a little short for my tastes. I'd definitely recommend it to fans of challenging platformers, there was a lot more fun than frustration and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\n\nAs of this review I've completed the game, 3 starred all missions, and collected all secret items so feel free to use that for a reference for the length of the game, although the game definitely has high replayability, and if you're crazy about getting those small times to earn nice spots on the leaderboards, then expect a lot more hours invested.", "timestamp_created": 1433201732, "timestamp_updated": 1433201732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16097381": {"recommendationid": "16097381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046495652", "num_games_owned": 2193, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487321690}, "language": "german", "review": "[h1]Review: JumpJet Rex [/h1]\n\nDie gr\u00f6\u00dften jemals auf diesem Planeten lebenden Lebewesen waren die Dinosaurier.

Rex, Raumschiff und Level wurden liebevoll gestaltet und lassen mit Sicherheit so manches Nostalgikerherz h\u00f6her schlagen. Dabei werden unterschiedliche Themen verwendet, wie z.B.

DIe Levels sind abwechslungsreich und teilweise stark unterschiedlich entworfen und selbst beim x-ten durchspielen bleibt der Spielspa\u00df nicht auf der Strecke. Warum?\n\nGanz im Stile der alten Vorbilder ger\u00e4t man bei Rex unter Zeitdruck, wenn man das Level mit Bestnote abschlie\u00dfen will. Dabei hilft die intuitive und simple Steuerung. Oben, Unten, Links, Rechts + Alt f\u00fcr Raketenantrieb, mehr braucht der moderne Dino nicht. Hat man das Level erstmal beendet, kann man nicht nur gegen die eigene Bestzeit antreten, sondern sich auch weltweit messen. Geist runterladen und los geht`s. Hinzu kommt die Jagd nach versteckten M\u00fcnzen und Sch\u00e4tzen, mit denen Rex seine Heimatbasis versch\u00f6nert oder sich im Shop optische Ver\u00e4nderungen kauft. Das reicht von F\u00e4rbung der Haut, Stiefel oder D\u00fcsen bis zu v\u00f6llig neuen Gesichtern, die den kleinen Kerl im neuen Glanz erscheinen lassen. F\u00fcr Abwechslung und Motivation ist also gesorgt, nicht zuletzt durch den tollen Soundtrack, der Ohrw\u00fcrmer garantiert. Wer die Rettung der Dinoheit nicht allein angehen mag, nutzt den Koop Modus und fliegt mit Freunden durchs All. \n\n\n[h1]Big Text, Quick Facts: [/h1]\n\n[b]Pro:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Am\u00fcsante Hintergrundgeschichte + charismatischer Dinoheld\n[*]Gelungene Retro-Optik und Soundtrack mit Wiedererkennungswert\n[*]40+ unterschiedliche Level, inklusive Bossmonster und Bonuslevel\n[*]knackiger Schwierigkeitsgrad im Gedenken an Spiele der 90er\n[*]Unz\u00e4hlige Gestaltungsm\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr Heim und Held\n[*]Dauermotivation f\u00fcr Perfektionisten mit weltweitem Vergleich\n[*]Lokaler Koop sorgt f\u00fcr Spa\u00df im Quadrat\n[/list]\n\n[b]Con:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]In Anbetracht der Story-L\u00e4nge erscheint der Preis von 14,99 \u20ac f\u00fcr das Spiel und besonders 6,99 \u20ac f\u00fcr den Soundtrack leicht \u00fcberzogen. \n[/list]\n\n\n[h1][b][u]Zusammenfassung:[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nDer Tod war meist nur einen Raketenschub entfernt, aber nie hatte ich das Gef\u00fchl unfairerweise das zeitliche zu segnen.

When it was fully released, it went on sale, so I decided to pick it up. I was skeptical at first, but I didn't regret it at all.\n\nThe thing you'll be doing in the game is just getting to the exit of levels. To do so, you can jump an infinite amount of times with your jet boots, dash left or right, hold a button to fall faster, or hold a button to fly upwards faster than you could jump, although this is difficult to control. Projectiles shoot out of your jet boots each time you jump or dash. If you jump, they shoot downwards, and if you dash, they shoot out in the opposite direction you dashed. These can be used to attack enemies and bosses, which makes boss fights unique and interesting. Although, there are only four boss fights. There are 37 regular levels, not including the final level. To unlock the door that leads to the level exit, you need to go through rings scattered about the level. Sometimes this just means finding them once and moving on to the next one, other times it means all the rings are on the same screen and you need to go through the same ring up to three or four times; there's an amount of time that must pass before you can activate the ring again. The level design is overall pretty creative, and many levels have their own little quirks.\n\nIt isn't as simple as getting to the end of the level, however. Three stars are available to be earned, depending on how well you do in each level. You can earn a star simply by completing the level, another by completing it without dying, and another by completing it in a certain amount of time. Completing a level in the target time is usually the hardest thing to do. Other levels are unlocked by stars. You can't simply just complete levels or you wouldn't earn enough stars. However, unlocking other levels is fairly easy. You can earn a total of 123 stars (of which I have earned 109). If I didn't want to, I wouldn't even have to complete the last levels of the game, since I had already unlocked the final level. The amount stars required for unlocking levels is very low, so don't worry about having to unlock every single star; some of them are very difficult.\n\nScattered throughout some levels are hidden collectables. Each time you find one, it is shipped to Rex's space base. It's neat to see the walls become decorated with various different things, although they serve no function. Also scattered throughout levels are coins and giant rubies worth 1000 coins. Coins can be spent at shops to customize Rex's appearance. You can customize the color of Rex's boots, the color of fire or whatever it is that comes out of his boots, his body color, and even his head; there are heads that make him look like Rambo, a ninja turtle, and even Megaman (this is the one I use).\n\nSo now for the little things. The music is... lackluster. There are probably around 10 tracks, and none of them are memorable. They're simply mediocre at best, and if a glitch occurred that would have muted the music, I probably wouldn't have minded. Graphics are decent. I'm disappointed that yet another developer chose to go with the pixel-art route, however. I'd like to see more... wholesome graphics. Controller support is good; if you use a controller with Xinput, button prompts change. I have 9 hours in the game and I have 109 of 123 stars. I'm not going to try to get the others, as the're simply too hard. For what you pay for this game, that's a pretty decent value for your money.\n\nThere's not much else to say, really. It's a simple game that does what it does well.

I would highly suggest you to pick up JumpJet Rex as soon as you can. \n[h1]  Video Review            [/h1]    \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK-NTMVTKlY\n\n-HiPFiRED  \n\n\n[i] If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]\n\n[i]Check out the Original Network Groups.

You\u2019d take a game, preferably one with action/platforming aspects, and simply attempt to beat it as quick as possible. Within the past five years, speedrunning has become a genre entirely of its own. While most speedrunning games still harken back to their platforming and action roots, they usually also feature a timer, a time to beat, and enough speed to make a cracked out Sonic drinking Red Bull get jealous. JumpJet Rex exemplifies speed. Paired with a colorful aesthetic and a bevy of extremely varied levels, you will be shaving seconds with pleasure in an attempt to see what comes next. Will JumpJet Rex speed it\u2019s way into your heart, or crash and burn? Let\u2019s take a closer look at JumpJet Rex.\n\nThe controls in this game feel extremely smooth. Most people haven\u2019t played as a dinosaur in rocket-boots before, but let me tell you that it\u2019s surprisingly much easier than it sounds. Hitting X will send Rex rocketing in the direction you are currently facing, with reckless abandon. This is the primary ability used to get through stages, along with your levitate ability which is activated with Y. Pressing A will allow an itty-bitty jump, and B will have Rex tuck his legs and butt-slam his way to the ground. You will need to chain all of these abilities effectively in order to avoid enemies, obstacles, and traps in an attempt to reach the end of the stage. Just reaching the end is enough to win a star, but each stage has two additional stars. One awarded for not dying. The other can be won by completing the course under the par time.\n\nThere are also three different game modes, so once you bumble your way through the story mode you can come back again and rage as you attempt to complete the entire game with only three lives. Finally in time attack mode, you can attempt to complete the entire game as quickly as possible and try to dominate the global scoreboard. Your efforts in game are always rewarded, usually with cosmetic upgrades but I can tell that even dinosaurs like to play dress-up. Currency is found in every level and, as with any good game, will usually lead you where you need to go. Level design is varied from arenas to sprawling mazes, and new mechanics (such as breakable blocks) are periodically introduced, which keeps things interesting for the player. As I stated before, the aesthetic is colorful and helps enhance the fun nature of the game. The music is good for the most part, though some tracks do slide into questionable listening material.\n\nThe sound FX get a bit repetitive after an extended period of play, as I\u2019ve found with most speedrunners. The story is also pretty generic and serves basically only to get the game started. Some stages are quite confusing, and you are sure to never get three stars on your first try. That seems to really be about it. There aren\u2019t a lot of negative points to JumpJet Rex, and while it could do with a bit of polish, I think what is offered currently is extremely solid if you\u2019re into fast-paced platforming with a winning aesthetic and a ton of replayability. I\u2019d like to thank TreeFortress Games for providing us with a review copy, and we look forward to seeing more releases of a similar caliber in the very near future.\n\nGameplay:\n\n    Controls- 10/10\n    Fun Factor- 7/10\n    Difficulty- 10/10\n    Replayability- 8/10\n    Innovation- 6/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\n    Graphics- 7/10\n    Music- 6/10\n    Sound FX- 5/10\n    Story/Lore- 4/10\n    Level Design- 7/10\n\nFinal Score: 69/100 for controls, difficulty, and level design.\n\nVerdict: If you enjoy shaving seconds off your time, Jumpjet Rex is a speedrunning treat.\nSummary: Speedrunning platformer with tons of customization, and a strict defiance of gravity.\n\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-jumpjet-rex/\nVideo review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nv54dB25sk", "timestamp_created": 1430567851, "timestamp_updated": 1430567851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491684", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15629326": {"recommendationid": "15629326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004005692", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430187344}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one small step for dino, and one giant leap for sauruskind.

It was updated recently (showing that it's not yet abandoned) with the last set of levels and clear plans for the forth (and seemingly final) boss so has much of the game completely built therefore.  The new update also included one of the most crucial things required by all games, a.k.a. an extensive settings menu that (finally) allows players to escape full screen mode and alter sound within the game engine.  The settings themselves are rather basic, but that is passable in this case due to the basic nature of the game.  Despite being basic, this game WILL kick your bum time and time again if you are a casual player.  It is because of this that I recommend the game only to cautionary players who are aware of it's potential difficulty.  It is one game which is hard but in fair ways, so pros at games like Dark Souls may not be phased, but normal players can expect a challenging game with much to find and more awaiting for those patient enough to wait for each update.\n*****That said, THIS GAME IS INCOMPLETE and therefore I advise extreme hesitation as you may not get your money's worth if the project fails.", "timestamp_created": 1427757622, "timestamp_updated": 1427757622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530298", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15103749": {"recommendationid": "15103749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037468781", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427605549}, "language": "english", "review": "All you do in this game is jump and shoot yourself forward.\n\nIt's not very long, not very hard, too repetitive and there's no upgrade or anything.

Skip to Early Access section to avoid]: I beat the game in speedrun mode, took over two hours straight for me to do. I was behind in the race I was doing at first, but I quickly took a lead in the earlygame as I went through all the levels I knew beforehand in a flash, giving be this big star lead over my friend.  But when I finally did get to the home stretch, my friend took the lead and ended up getting to the asteroid before me. I managed to catch up within 10-20 minutes, and I actually found the path before him, but I gave up on the path as I assumed it was the wrong one... Then he ended up just telling me because we were both taking so long on the level.  We both took a snack break, pausing our games at the same time, and after we continued, I lost.  I kept going though, as I wanted to see how long it would take me to finish my run.  Yeah... I actually liked the experience, but the fact that a single mistake would cost me anywhere between fifteen seconds and nearly a minute really added up.  (Anyone else just kept jumping into spikes? I know I did. Alot.)  I'll be playing through the regular mode 100% before I modify this to be a full review.\n\nBefore we go to early access section, just remember this.  IF YOU GET THIS GAME, IT WILL BE TOUGH.\n\n[Below was in Early Access, before the first boss was moved and some modifications to levels were made.]\n\nJump! Dash! Jump! Dash! Die! Repeat until level is complete!\n\nYes, this is a 2D classic-style platformer with a lot of hidden references.  I'll warn you this, it gives you infinite jumps.  Now you may think that's overpowered, but remember, the obstacles get pretty hard, and your afterburners are your only way of dealing damage other than ramming your head into some of the enemies.  One hit and you die.\n\nThis game is EASILY speedrunner friendly, and unique.  Heck, they even let you test out the controls on the title screen!  I love it when games let me do that.  Gives me a convenient way to warm-up pre-run.\n\nYou can customize the T-Rex you play as. (Spoiler alert: Mine already has a Megaman helmet!)  From colors, heads/helmets, boots, heck even to your boots' trails, it's all customizable.  The shop mixes up every 15 minutes of playtime after you leave the Dinonaut Base, so be ready to rush to the store and check it out if you have 2000 coins or so already!  (This timer includes time used resetting the level, from what I can tell, only time spent in the shop seems to not count.)\n\nThe difficulty? Oh, yeah, it's quite unforgiving, but only if you want that no death star...  Otherwise you respawn at checkpoints... UNLESS you play on the harder mode--it even has rage quit in its name... Listen, that mode gives you 3 lives and no checkpoints for the ENTIRE game if I understand it correctly.  I've only played up to the first boss so far, though, so I don't know exactly how hard it'll get.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it gives you 3 singleplayer save files, so you atleast don't have to delete all progress files every time you restart the game.  Not sure if the files are seperate in Coop or not yet.  The controls are VERY accurate.  Once you input a control, it feels basically instant responses, atleast with the Xbox 360 Controller that I was using.  Oh yeah, did I mention?  It supports controllers directly!\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent, infact if the soundtrack doesn't come with the game, I'll probably go ahead and pick up the soundtrack if it's cheap enough.  It's not often that I actually listen to the game's music/sounds if I'm not streaming my run, excluding certain games of course...  But this game easily passes to a point where I'll probably barely ever not listen to it.  Infact, this is probably one of the first platformers to make it on that list of mine.\n\nYou can directly challenge the WR IL times if you wish, thus if you just want to try to hit a IL record, you can easily get ready to do so through that.  You also can challenge your PB--infact it does so on its own if you already have beaten the stage before apparently.  It took approximately 1.2 hours for me to get through the first set of levels and the first boss in total, if you include trying to get the 3 stars in most of the levels and the time spent shopping/adjusting to the controls. (Which I got in all of them except the boss!)\n\nI'll likely come back and update the review if possible after I have more gameplay.  But seriously, it's 20% off until the 30th, and you get a 2nd copy to gift to a friend for free if you get it during early access?  It's easily worth the price tag for how much you can do in the game.

Seriously. Think old school 8-bit intense gameplay paired with speedrunning and avoiding life-ending obstacles. There's also boss fights like Mega Man and you gotta use your dino-jetpack to fight them. \n\nLevels? It's got a whole bunch. Each level has certain objectives (finish without dying, complete under a certain time frame, etc.) and you earn stars as you complete them. Earn enough stars, you unlock more levels and bosses and progress through the game. Don't fret though, you've got as many tries as you'd like to complete the levels, theres no \"game over\" waiting if you're not quick enough. But for real, be prepared to be frustrated on certain levels. Sometimes you'll repeatedly make the same mistake of boosting into a laser beam....and yeah, you'll get annoyed. But it's still fun!\n\nThe variety of level design keeps the game fresh as you play on and the cleverness of being a little dinosaur keeps it fun. If you collect enough coins while playing, you can buy aesthetic upgrades to change the appearance of your character and customize it to your liking. \n\nSo could I keep talking about the game? Sure. But ultimately you should really give it a shot and see how you like it. If you're at all interested in games that challenge your skills in a fun speed-run/platformer way then I think you'll like this game a lot. 8/10 (needs more dinosuars)\n\n*Updated: So the game has had a bunch of updates as its progressed. A new health system is in place so you can take a few hits before you're \"dead\". This makes the game not nearly as hard as it was before, but still challenging.

Being unable to assign buttons yourself and being a controler-less keyboard player, it's a real pain having to use the Alt key and Space key together (I'm on a Mac). I would like to be able to asign buttons myself.\n[*]The main character is pretty stiff to control. What annoys me the most is the \"Y\" button which is supposed to make the character fly, but the acceleration is slow and constantly jumping is faster. Same with the ground-pound, which has an acceleration too slow and letting the character drop down is as fast. Also, more precision is a little better.\n[*]The mouse should NOT be used at all in the game. It's a platformer, using a mouse is hellish in these cases.\n[*]The boss's life bar is often stuck behind him, making it sometimes invisible. The first boss fight (that's as much as I reached) takes a ton of time to beat.\n[*]The title screen confuses me. I prefer having a menu rather than controlling the character itself. Also, it is very confusing to understand what's going on.

I'm stuck in the past, rarely do I find a platformer that I feel can stand up to the SNES era.\n\nJumpJet Rex though, took me totally by surprise. I didn't expect to fall so hard and fast for this game.\n\nI always look for specific things in a platformer, a formula for perfection if you might:\n\nDifficulty - Is the game challenging? Will it make me shout profanities but still make me eager to go back for more? Check. JumpJet Rex is no easy ride, though the difficulty curve put in place is sublime. Not too fast, not too slow, excellent pacing.\n\nControls - I can get really wound up about clunky controls in platformers. There is a certain \"feel\" that needs to be reached. I have no qualms about the controls for JJR, very reponsive, reactive and creative.\n\nReplayability - Will I feel like playing through the levels again? Will I get attached to the world the developers present to me? JJR hits this mark splendidly. Not only can you complete the levels, there are plenty of collectables in place. You are graded on each level out of 3 stars. Completion, not dying and time. You need a certain amount of stars to prgress onto further levels, so you will find yourself revisiting levels, and I wa absolutely glad to every time!\n\nAppearance - Is the game easy on the eyes? How is the level design? Seriously, JJR is one of the most beautiful modern platformers I have played. The graphics are fun, edgy and cute. You can also customise your little dino, LOADS of options available. You can buy customisation items from a store, with currency you earn IN-GAME, or find them hidden within levels.\n\nBoss Fights - Will the boss actually challenge me? Will I feel the rage build up as I am slaughtered over and over again and feel like a champion when I overcome them? JJR delivers this. The bosses require you to figure them out. There is zero hand-holding. \n\nMusic - Will the music match the theme of the game? Will the music egg me on as I play through? JJR again, passes with flying colours. I usually game with my own music, but for JJR I absolutely love the soundtrack, it gets the heart pumping! Beautiful.\n\nIn summary, I can't reccomend this game enough to anyone, epecially if you enjoy platforming! Seriously, it's a little dinosaur with jet-pack shoes. Buy it, you wont be dissapointed.\n\nYours sincerely, an absolute platforming snob.

That game is soooo stooooopid!\" You may or may not have just said. \"That also came out in 2013!! Are you stuck in the past, grandma?!\" Haha okay there buddy, but seriously, hear me out!  \nIn my first dive in I found that the game was very easy to pick up; the controls were very responsive and so easy to grasp that within minutes I was literally flying through the levels like I was DINO-PETER PAN!  It feels like its at the right speed too - not too slow to make it feel clunky, and not too fast to make it overwhelming.\nThe art style is super cute - I just love my lil' Rex with his lil' cyborg eyepatch - did I mention you can dress up and customize Rex?  Yeah, you can DO THAT. And it's AWESOME. I may be just biased though because I'm a GIRL.  Who sometimes plays into GENDER STEREOTYPES.\nAaaanyways, the levels are quite diverse and I never knew what to expect going into each one, which is fun! I love mysteries! I mean it's not exactly Jump Jet Agatha Christie but y'know, it's cool.  In all seriousness though, the level design is tight. There's also no forced tutorial but rather a main hub where you can learn basic mechanics and manoeuvres either yourself or through training, which is a nice option. \nThis game, despite being so easy to pick up, is very punishing - something that it openly advertises, so that's probably what the devs were going for.

The problem with this one battle was that the pacing was so different from before - I'd been trained to just GO GO GO as fast as I could throughout the previous levels while in this battle I had to wait for the right time to attack - it was actually easier to stand still than to keep moving.  Despite this I've still really enjoyed JJR and heavily recommend it to anyone that is looking for a strong platforming game that you'll not only have a ton of fun playing but will also challenge you.

You mostly move around by dashing, dropping height, and jet boosting across traps, bad guys and spikes.\nSomething you don't see at first too is that this game has the level of detail that makes it so unique and awesome to come back to. Like finding secret stages, secret exits, hidden coins, collectible items that come back to your Space HQ and decorate it, all with adorable and awesome design and art tune.\n\nThis game right now is still in development, and even chatting with the players to find possible new awesome content. Right now it has quite a lot of content tho. A shop with very iconic references for unique outfits like Megaman's helmet, Castle Crashers, Sub Zero's Mask. And the shop randomizes which items you have available so it's a fun thing to check .\n\nEach stage is quite unique and the soundtrack follows the exploration-adventure theme fantastically.\n\nEven has some Speed Running mechanics and a game mode in the future, as well a Rage Quit game mode that I would not try since I would not have a death wish but awesomely referencing Michael from RT \"I believe\".", "timestamp_created": 1423244819, "timestamp_updated": 1423244819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524905", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14318022": {"recommendationid": "14318022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027461341", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445455944}, "language": "english", "review": "Where to even begin with?\n\nWell for those who are in love with the platforming genre, stop reading my review andbuy this game immediately.\n\nNow for the other I'll detail it a bit more ;)\n\nJumpjet Rex is a very fun, old-school yet modern platformer, but not your typical platformer. If you really need a comparison with other title, it would be a merge between Super Meat Boy and Fenix Rage. It's medium-paced, which makes it moderately \"hardcore\". By moderately hardcore I mean the kind of hardcore everyone can play, even casual players ;) So even if you're a casual player, don't be afraid by the trailer or the images !\n\nIn term of gameplay, you have infinite jumps and dash to the sides, with various hazards to avoid. Each levels contains 3 stars to get, the first one is obtained by finishing the level, the second one by beating a time limit, and the third one by not dying more than a set number of times (for the first levels it's zero of course).\n\nLast but not least, the game has a heavy customization aspect. If like me, you like a good game in which you can over-customize your character in quadrillion of possible ways then this game is definitely for you. Each customizable piece of the rex has many parts available. The pieces are head/skin color/jetboots trail color/boots color. That really makes for a big variety.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\nCouldn't recommend it more. I hesitated for a long time, and I was awfully wrong !

What was once believed to be  a hollywood movie, \"Jurassic Park\" turned out to be an actual real documentary about the events that took place on the island and documented the attempts that humans  tried to gain control over these dominant creatures.\n\nDue to unlawful experimentation the humans were able to give the dinosaurs extreme human like intelligence. It would ultimately be the downfall of mankind. Ever so tired of the villany of the humans, the dinosaurs rebeled against their captures and soon regained control of the island. Any attempts to reach the island were met with failure.\n\nFor many years the dinosaurs planned a way to rid the world of the human race. Using the data collected from the scienist that worked there, the dinosaurs were able to construct and weaponize a lethal dna virus that could kill the humans with imediate exposure. Once unleashed , the virus quickly spread; wiping out the entire human population. Dinosaurs once again ruled the earth.\n\nOver 5,000 years have passed since the virus wiped out humanity. As time went on the dinosaurs intelligence continued to grow as did their techonology. To overcome their problems with moblity they designed space ships and rocket boots that allowed them to move with great ease. It wasn't long after they started to colonize space, setting up many space stations and offworld colonies. The second era of dinosaurs looked bright.\n\nAlas  not all was well in the universe. A dark long forgotten force had grown angry at the dinosaurs. In it's anger it summoned a huge meteor to crash on the dinosaurs home planet earth hoping to wipe them out from existance.\n\nNow as a first responder: JumpJetRex, you must save your home planet from annihilation. Using your wits, and of course your rocket boots; you must overcome the many challanges that face you ahead.

You need to know you're gonna stop and kind of plan your routes about 1/2 second in advance, and BOY is it addicting.\n\nThis game will be speedrunners' dreams I think. No glitches, just pure timing and trying again and again XD.\n\nOh, and it can get quite difficult too. Some levels had me cursing like crazy, but you don't want to stop. It's like a light, colourful, 2D Dark Souls Sen's Fortress where you die in 1 touch from anything and you can't attack but there are no enemies. Yes. That's basically it. At times difficult as hell, but so satisfying when you DO IT.\n\nDo I recommend it? I sure do. Especially for the price. It's only going to get better from here on out. And oh boy... THE MUSIC.

The first boss was fairly straightforward once I realized I could shoot lasers from my boots, but still quite a challenge to beat without dying.\n\nWhich brings up the most interesting aspect of this game: The DIY difficulty. Any level can be completed by simply hammering through it and dying endlessly (all items collected are saved), but you'll only get one star. The other two are for not dying, or doing it under a certain time. I really liked this because it gave me a reason for going back, but also didn't halt my progress when I encountered a particularly difficult (for me) level. It's also much better than the seemingly arbitrary stars given out in Angry Birds.\n\nAs far as the mechanics go, I can safely say this game plays great with a keyboard and mouse. The controls are tight, and when I die it was annoyance with myself for rushing and not being careful, never with the game itself for being unfair.\n\nDefinitely recommend to regular and casual players alike, but if Super Meatboy is more your thing, this game (thankfully imo) is not that level of difficulty.\n\nIf you'd like to see a video of me playing the first few levels and first boss, I've included it below.

Even though there's a leader board,  I've found myself wanting to beat my own personal time over and over despite holding the #1 spot in a level.

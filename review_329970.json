Right now, I would suggest you look into War for the Overworld if you're looking for a dungeon-building game or RimWorld if you're looking for just a great simulation game period.\n\nOverall, I'm uncertain whether to refund this game or not. On one hand it shows incredible promise, like it could be a game I could really fall in love with. On the other hand it seems to have a long way to go yet and feels like it could just take a long time to get there or even not get there at all, who knows? In that sense a refund seems like the best option and I still could get the game again later on if it ever \"gets there\".\n\nWhat would make the difference for me right now when considering a refund would be for this game to actually offer something that I couldn't get anywhere else: massive combat with dozens of units and crazy roguelike spells and mechanics; a challenge mode where you have a small amount of time to finish a single scenario in a couple hours (instead of a full run); having a dozen Keeper classes to choose from, each with a unique playstyle...\n\nSure, it has roguelike-inspired turn-based combat and a Dwarf Fortress-inspired adventure mode but neither of them are that interesting to me personally and they're not the type of feature that will get me to stick around and wait for this game to become a fully featured title, sadly. If I actually want an adventure mode with turn based combat, I'll just a play a roguelike, which again, does it better than KeeperRL ever could.\n\nAlso, when compared to other games like RimWorld or War for the Overworld, KeeperRL seems to have zero Steam Workshop support. Mods are a great way for fans to pick up on the places the developers are lagging behind - especially a lone dev like Michal here... without mods and looking at the current state of the game, it just gives me the impression I will run out of content pretty quickly, even though I haven't actually played that far into the game.\n\nUnfortunately, the way the game is right now, it feels that I can just go elsewhere to get pretty much the same experience but with vastly more polished gameplay and literally hundreds of mod and scenario options from the Steam Workshop if I ever get bored with the base game itself. KeeperRL just isn't there yet.\n\nEDIT interesting chat I had with the dev http://steamcommunity.com/app/329970/discussions/0/1620599015910072094/", "timestamp_created": 1514814608, "timestamp_updated": 1515682116, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38880734": {"recommendationid": "38880734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071357691", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514676363}, "language": "french", "review": "Le concept est vraiment sympa MAIS le jeu est tr\u00e8s buggu\u00e9, lent, etc ... ce serait fantastique si il utilisait le moteur de RimWorld mais pour le moment je ne le recommande pas", "timestamp_created": 1514676470, "timestamp_updated": 1514676470, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38853295": {"recommendationid": "38853295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143115314", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514627447}, "language": "english", "review": "Started the game when it came out and have played every patch of the way.

More spells and the ability to pick and choose what type of a spell casting keeper you want to experiment with.  Arena to have prisoners fight.\n\t\n  I never felt like game mechanics needed to be fixed but the new improvements in the current version are great.\n\n\nRating today: 7/10  \n\t\n  The Keeper spells and powers have been weakened to the point that I don't want to use my keeper anymore and the overall effect is that when I close the game I feel dissatisfied with my experience.  I'm not sure why I can't put my finger on it.  The keeper seems more fragile and I would rather just leave him in the dungeon to farm mana.\n\t\n  NPC's run away and it seems like the only option when playing now is to use a bow and arrows instead of using cool magic spells.\n\t\n  The minion recruitment mechanic is great as well as other mechanic improvements.\n\t\n  The campaign mode makes sense when trying to isolate the keeper dungeon so that adventurers don't start on a map where every outlying village and tribe is already wiped out.  The downside to this is that it ruined the awesome sandbox experience that makes KeeperRL shine.  I know I can start a sandbox map by choosing to but this should be the primary default option when starting a new game especially for new players because this is the KeeperRL you want them to experience not the campaign mode.\n\t\n  I like the new content such as the vampire lord, zombie mausoleum, gnome dungeon and automaton.\n\t\n  What will make the game better:  Line of site for all minions in a team/group it sucks not being able to see your minions fighting just hearing stuff dyeing.  More content such as capturing a princess from a nearby kingdom.  More spells and the ability to pick and choose what type of a spell casting keeper you want to experiment with.  Make the keeper more powerful for instance being able to choose the spell lightning, fireball, summon skeletons, or cause a corpse to explode.  There should be a limit on what spells the keeper equips so you create a sense of experimentation and trying out new combinations.\n\nAgain to the developer thanks for a making a quality game that is far better than a lot of games being produced today.\n", "timestamp_created": 1505838360, "timestamp_updated": 1505838360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711056", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1508179633, "developer_response": "Hey, thanks for writing an honest review and for the solid feedback. You have a good point with the downsides of the campaign mode versus the single map mode. I've been aware of the issue. I think both have their place in the game, and I've been trying to make the campaign give some of the same experience as single map. If you could give more details on why you like the single map more then that could help me out.\n\nRegarding your other points.\n* The Keeper is not really weak compared to the previous versions, and there ways to make him very strong now, but you have to take risks in combat. In general, Alpha23 adds offensive spells and items that make spellcasters more useful in combat.\n* NPCs will no longer be running away in Alpha23\n* Common line of sight for all minions will be added in Alpha23."}, "35031776": {"recommendationid": "35031776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153779963", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505666381}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432\u044b \u0438 \u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0430\u043f\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0442\u044b \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u041f\u043e \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443 - \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f, \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0448\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e. \u041d\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430, \u043d\u0438 \u0443\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043d \u0438 \u0436\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0433\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438 - \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0443 \u043f\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043a. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446 \u0441 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u0432\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0448\u043a\u0443. \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430, \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442.", "timestamp_created": 1505677826, "timestamp_updated": 1505677826, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.389696", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35027915": {"recommendationid": "35027915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020532649", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506291667}, "language": "english", "review": "This title has been in development for a couple of years now, and I have to say, now that I've bought it, I'm a bit surprised by how many things that should be in the game simply aren't.\n\nHere are a few of my complaints from firing up the game and running a few Endless Modes to learn the game trial-by-fire style:\n\nThere's a serious lack of intuitiveness to the controls.  For instance, I found no quick way to to double-click or right click to center on a unit.\n\nWhen you're commanding a combat group, there's no way to scroll the screen to see what's happening on the rest of the map, short of giving up control of that group, scrolling and then taking over the group again.  In the middle of a combat this is really dangerous for your troops, but it's also doubly dangerous to not be able to keep an eye on your Keeper, who seems to have a penchant for getting himself in trouble, no matter how many doors you hide him behind.  In fact, I'm still trying to figure out how he got through a locked door when ants were attacking...\n\nThere aren't volume controls for music and sound, only on/off.  That gets damn annoying when you're trying to have a conversation online or off, so you have to mute the game or turn the music off.  (The music itself though is pretty good for an indie title.)\n\nEDIT:  For a couple of days I thought there was no way to alter the turn-based system speed.  Probably because there's little to no key info and no evident key-binding.  Turns out that you can click on the very easy to miss 'Speed' text itself in the bottom left corner to change the speed OR press 1-4 keys to go from Slow to Very Fast.\n\nThis really matters because combat itself can be over in a blink before you even see an enemy.   And beware archers firing from off-screen, which is an old pet-peeve of mine.  \n\nFactions have the uncanny ability to stalk the Keeper wherever he is.  In one game I was being chased by 3 factions that added on one after the other, until I finally was killed by an archer one turn before I was going to teleport away yet again.  There was no way to hide or wait for reinforcements.  Not a fan of that radar mechanic at all.\n\nLack of ambient sounds diminishes the feel of the world itself, and I really would like to see a sun/moon icon somewhere in the UI to keep easy track of the days and nights.  Some mobs simply can't travel in the daytime (i.e. zombies).\n\nIn addition, technical problems I've read about in other reviews are also hitting me in the Single Map playthroughs.  Severe slow-down that makes my current save almost unplayable.  EDIT:  I seem to have fixed the issue by altering the speed several times using keys 1-4.

The controls are lackluster and unorthadox, they also aren't very well displayed in the game. For instance, in order to shoot a bow you must hold alt, and then use the arrow keys to shoot. This means that the game does not allow you to shoot diagonally even though you can throw items diagonally. Which is a bit frustrating. Player UI also needs a big upgrade. It's a bit unclear how to take control of a creature, and once I figured out how to I wasn't sure how to let go control. You get the gist.

Instead of forcing the player to go down a written path, the player can choose where to begin his quest for \"glory\".\n\nThere's the two game modes: \"keeper\" and \"adventurer\". Adventurer is a bit more like an ordinary roguelike so if you like that rather than the typical dungeon keeper mechanisms (digging rooms and building necessities) then there is that for you.\n\nNew players need to be warned that even though it's supposed to be a bit like dungeon keeper, the saves for this game are save-on-quit. This means that you can't savescum your way out.

It's graphics may be simple (I love them), its UI a little clunky, and a little confusing in general, but its really a fantastic game. First off, you may think its a clone or ripoff of a certain keeper game... I will say, there is definite inspiration there, and a lot of similarity, but this game is different enough to keep you interested. If you like keeper games, you will most likely find some enjoyment in this game.\n\nOk, I'm not the greatest at reviewing... so lets put it this way. I read many reviews, and browsed the discussions before I bought this game. Most importantly, since the game is Early Access, I read the update history. Its all there, see for yourself. What do I see? Good reviews, prompt responses/solutions, and regular updates. To me, this screams potential for a game.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes. I am happy with the product I received for the money I paid, plus I'm excited for the next discussed update. See the news for info.\n\nWhat would I improve in this game? UI needs work (I think some of it is being updated next release, I may be wrong), and the game needs a tutorial (although, the discussed update will make the learning curve easier). Also I would try to add more \"mouse-only\" support, so the game can be played completely without keyboard. Also, I'd update the videos and screenshots on the steam page, the game looks and plays differently than those show. Finally, I've read the adventure mode needs work (but I've never tried it tbh).\n\nMy final advice: for any game, do the same. Check the reviews. Read the long hate reviews. Browse the discussions, see how long it takes for a random problem to get a response. Also, with any Early Access game, check the update history and news...... or take my word for it... if you like keeper games, buy it.\n\nEDIT: I've got my gf hooked on this game now, and had to buy her a copy so she'd stop using my library.", "timestamp_created": 1482790273, "timestamp_updated": 1483086467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545277", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28594477": {"recommendationid": "28594477", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993619562", "num_games_owned": 630, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478383464}, "language": "english", "review": "Still too much work to be done.

You build your own dungeon, which acts as a base to attract an army and forge weapons & armor.  Normally, all your creatures just go about their business, doing stuff like training, forging, sleeping, and eating.  They can be assigned tasks, or else the AI takes over and does pretty sensible things.  Time passes automatically.  At this stage you're mostly concerned with digging out tunnels and rooms, mining resources, and issuing commands to build stuff in your dungeon.  Watching as your little minions do their thing.  \n\nYou attract different kinds of creatures to your army depending on what you build in your dungeon.  It's a pretty neat mix of creature types, from orcs and goblins to vampires and ghosts, with different strengths and abilities.  You accumulate mana over time (or by defeating enemies) that can be used to unlock more advanced skills.  These skills generally allow you to build more types of stuff, like traps, weapons, and armor.  You can also unlock a variety of spells for use in combat.\n\nYou can also enter a turn-based mode where you lead an assembled army for raids against other dungeons and creatures.  You do this by controlling the leader.  The other members of the army will follow you and attack nearby enemies.  Combat is simplistic - to attack you just move your controlled creature into an enemy tile.  But you can also shoot arrows, or use spells depending on the abilities and equipment of the creature you're controlling.  To me, building up a powerful enough army was the more interesting aspect over the combat itself.  But it was fun to lead my army out and see what they could do.\n\nThe mix of real-time dungeon building and turn-based rogue-like combat is a neat blend, and works well.\n\nYour base can also come under attack, during which you can defend it in turn-based mode.  Or just leave your army to deal with the intruders in real-time mode.\n\nThe game is very stable - I experienced no crashes or even significant bugs.  The \"alphaness\" manifests in a few other ways though.  There is no tutorial, and extremely limited in-game help on how the game works.  Figuring out how to play involved lots of experimentation, or hitting up the forums when I couldn't figure something out.  Also, the game's mechanics are sometimes a little muddy - for example it's not readily apparent what all the dungeon items you can build are actually for.  I had to take a few run at things.  It wasn't till my 3rd play-through that I really felt I had a grasp on what I was doing, and was able to win the campaign.  It would be even harder for someone with little experience playing these types of games.\n\nThat's all fine, and no big surprise for an alpha.  Likely, something which will get worked out as the game nears completion.  But as of now, it's less \"hand holdy\" and accessible than you would expect from a finished game.\n\nThe difficulty balance will also still need some work.  Again, no surprise for an alpha.  But the initial enemies I needed to fight were quite difficult for my relatively weak army.  As I defeated enemies, I grew more powerful and eventually the remaining enemies became absolutely trivial.  There needs to be some kind of progression of more difficult enemies to fight.  At the moment I don't feel there's a ton of replay value, as I'm pretty sure I could now use my knowledge of the game mechanics to easily beat another campaign.  But I enjoyed it enough to recommend it.  The replayability may get a lot better as more balance and content is ironed out during early access.  Also, there are some other game modes like \"Adventurer\" (instead of \"Campaign\") which I didn't try.  \n\nThe interface is all menu driven, or you can use keyboard shortcuts.  It does a pretty good job of things.  But it takes a little playing around to figure how to do stuff like assemble an army.\n\nI enjoyed my time playing, and happy to support the dev while building a neat game.", "timestamp_created": 1480584221, "timestamp_updated": 1480584424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28108633": {"recommendationid": "28108633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025581192", "num_games_owned": 634, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480795997}, "language": "english", "review": "What are you doing here?

It's my new antfarm of choice - I spent time with the demo, then went in and bought it and 118 minutes later I'm utterly charmed. There's something very 90s about this game, from its rough GUI to the way the tile graphics catch at my imagination. It's not an intuitive game, or one that does any handholding - you have to figure out practically everything yourself, but that's fine! It's not like Dwarf Fortress where you're wrestling with the game itself to figure out how to play it - it's not too complex, so far, and I quite like the interface as it's very functional.\n\nSo what is it, exactly?\n\nIt's a mixture of Dungeon Keeper with Dwarf Fortress, where you're an evil mage who moves into a local fantasy realm with a hoard of imps with one goal: conquer everything. So you build into the nearest mountain and set up a little base - you need beds for your minions, a library for you to study in, a workshop to build traps - all of those standard workhorses. Your equivalent Dungeon Heart is you - you're the squishy Keeper, and if you die, it's over. So build your base deep into the mountain and plonk down a whole lot of traps between you and the outside world.\n\nDepending on what you build, different beasties come to join you - from cave bears to vampires - and you don't control them directly, most of the time. They wander around according to their schedules and explore or eat bandits or sleep all day, and I really enjoy watching them go through their routines. Depending on what they are, they can also spend time training or equipping themselves with new weapons, which is good, because the villains in this game are [i]mean.[/i] Especially elves, yikes.\n\nSo as you build you need resources - mine iron or granite out of the mountain, chop trees (all by marking the related zones with your cursor) - but the biggest bottleneck is mana. The game will tell you build a prison and torture chamber so you can torture innocents for mana. No. What you want is a library, so you can assign your Keeper to studying nonstop. That keeps up the steady flow of mana, which you then use to unlock things like building traps / learning spells / pig farming / etc. Kind of a weird design choice, but whatever.\n\nOne more thing: you can control your individual minions directly and set them up in teams so you can, say, take a group of wolves and lead them out to slaughter farm animals for fun and profit. You can do this with anything you control - your Keeper, your imps, whoever. It's a really nice system and it's fun to, say, go raid a cemetary full of zombies with a single wolf. Or direct your vampires personally as you're under attack!\n\nGameplay is turn-based, by the way. Think Nethack - you bump against guys to attack them, they bump back, you all move on a grid - it's nice and straightforward. When you're controlling your minions directly it moves to standard roguelike - they only move when you do - but when you're in the main mode it all moves - you can speed it up from 1x to 2x and so on. Or pause it!\n\nThe game is still early access, but there's enough here that I'm happy with it. It tickles that nostalgia bone something fierce, and I'm going back in to see if I can't figure out how to bring down those horrible elves. A few more notes, though: the dev is active, and even responded to a post I made on the steam forums quickly.\n\nThere are multiple gameplay modes as well - you can have campaign mode where you set up your mountain base mostly unmolested and lead raids into other maps - into user-made dungeons as well! - or there's single map mode, where there's no division between your base and the elves to the south. It's more cramped, but in a way I prefer as there's more life to it so far. There's also adventurer mode, where you're a single dude going on a more roguelike-y adventure, but I have't tested it yet.\n\nKeeperRL! It's still on sale and I like it. I've been warned that games are short and you're likely to see everything quickly, but psh, that's fine. What's there is working for me and I'd rec having a look at it to see if it also strikes your fancy. There is a demo on the website, but it's ASCII only so, er, use at your own risk.

There is no way of commanding your troops by selecting them and giving orders. You have to control a team that pretty much does nothing while your commander is being attacked. The combat is pretty much the worst I have seen in any strategy game.\n\nAs for the adventure mode, it is simply the \"Control minion\" mechanic. There is none of the common dungeon-crawler mechanics or commands. No interactions with NPCs, no shops, etc.\n\nIn the end the game tried to mash 2 genres together but failed to be even half of one of those.

Here is my time in KeeperRL\n\nI spawned and got killed by Lizardmen. Ok. Nice start.\n2nd time was longer and got be somewhere, but was mostly boring as no one attacked me.\nMy 3rd time was....interesting.\n\nI spawn in the new campaign world ready to sack and pillage this pathetic valley. So thing go as normal with building out the of lair and library stuff. I get a forge and worshop, and a training area, etc...\nI got a shitload of Orks and Goblins. I then aquired something I never really get. An Ork Shaman. His name is Shamrok leader of my army of green...nes....\nI leveled him up pretty far (17) he had all the spells my Keeper had (Master Level Sorcery). All was fine and dandy until I sent my Ghost to scout the Lizardmen Tribe....\nI possessed the Tribe Leader confident the other Lizardmen would kill him. No the oppisite happend I went back there with another Ghost moments after the find the Tirbe Leader which I named Ug ug, surrounded by corpses of his kin (there was like 6-8 corpses). He was wounded however as he had lost an arm and was bleeding so I left him to his fate to bleed out and die. Fate had differing plans however as not only he survived the \"attack\" he grew stronger...somehow...\nAnd after a few days...he attacked me with a HUGE fuckin' army. I lost alot in that battle including my strongest Warrior and Orge named Sterling (got his fucking head chopped off). After a long and bloody battle we sent the army running to the hills. And 3 Lizardmen even became Prisoners (they became human...for some reason...) and that extra boost to Mana income was pretty nice because round the clock torture...empowers you?\nThen came a time of \"peace\" with the Lizardmen as another Keeper known as the \"Beastlord\" had been annoying me for far too long. That war was short and onesided as my onslaught of Orks and Daemons destoryed everything they threw at us. There was a notible thing that did happen at this time however as I had spawned a Doppleganger named \"Cooper\".\nHE ATE MY ORCS AND A HARPY.\n\n\nNow the tides of war swell bigger than ever before. It had been 3 weeks (ingame) since the Lizardmen shizz. I send my grand army lead by Shamrok. When I got the the village...they had SO FUCKING MANY LIZARDS. My creature proved to strong...until the Tribe Leader Ug ug can to front lines AND BUTCHERED MY FORCES. He was weaving and dodging, taking hits like nothing. I sent Shamrok to smoke this fucker. HE KILLS SHAMROK BY CUTING OFF HIS HEAD.\nBut Shamrok did manage towound the Lizardman even further. As he used word of power. And blew off the Tibe Leaders other arm! Their army began to route and I butchered them like dogs and took their spoil. I built a great throne room in honor of my victory. I then get invaded by Elementals and die.\nSuch is life in KeeperRL.\n\nAs the writing of this the Adventure Mode just came out. Now of you exuse me.

You instruct your minions to carve rooms in the mountainside so you can populate it with various room types that attract new minions. There's a nice variety of minions you can attract and they are further classed into traditional humanoids and beasts. Each humanoid can be fitted with various equipment and spells to boost their stats. \n\nOnce your dungeon is large enough you will either be attacked, or begin raiding. Battles take place turn based. Once you get a feel for it, fighting boils down to moving your mob near the enemy, casting your keeper's spells, then holding the space button down until your units are victorious. The loot gained from these raids is mostly insignificant, and raiding plays little role in the game aside from being \"how you beat the game\". \n\nThe game lacks any sort of in depth tutorial, so at first the difficulty is very high as you scramble to bulid rooms and configure minions in an attempt to make sense of it all. Once you've figured out how KeeperRL's economy and minion system works the difficulty drops dramatically and almost every game is a guaranteed win. If you can sustain your dungeon long enough to get 20+ minions with armor, you will be more powerful than anything the game has to throw at you.\n\nLooking forward to playing this again as it comes along further. Despite my ciriticism this is a GREAT game. I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 in terms of enjoyment.

Easier said than done, especially with the recent addition of \"Campaign mode\" that spreads your allies/enemies to a randomly generated world map. In this mode you can even download and place enemy dungeons designed by other players as enemies!\n\nYou can't be complacent at all in this game... you can train your Keeper to the max and still be insta-killed by an invisible adversary. For example, yesterday I sent a team of vampires lead by my level 11 keeper to a tomb filled with level 2 zombies. Easy, I thought... until a sleep potion flew from the darkness, KO'ed the keeper and then a zombie proceeded to rip him to shreds. I was in a narrow corridor so the vamps couldn't help.

I've looked around trying to make this game run on at least decent FPS, tried re-installing, tried changing the core allocation, tried putting it on higher priority list, disabled one of my monitors to try it on solely on smaller monitor with decreased settings, uninstalled and re-installed my nvidia graphics, switched graphics between nvidia and intel and nothing works.

Sure it has its up's and down's like for example.... starting for the first time, and not knowing about Tree Spirits..... I learned the hard way with that one, cutting down loads and loads of tree's for that precious wood...... annnnnnnd suddenly a tree spirit appeared, Killing my imp's making it's way to my dungen entrance and destroying my entire dungen, forcing me to start over again then realising realising the situation i was in over the... Perma death. Soon as your \" Keeper \" Dies, It's all over boys. \n\nThis game is all about trial and error at first, much alike dark souls. You never know what you're about to face unless you poke an educated guess.  ( this game is nothing like dark souls btw ) So down to the point. I see alot of people compairing this game to Dwarf Fortress. Yes i understand how people would compare it to that game, However as of current state \" alpha 18 \"  This game is very far from Dwarf Fortress's Complexity and nothing alike. You just can't compare this game to Dwarf Fortress, other then the similarity's they share.\n\nWhat i like about this game the most, is you can do whatever you like. You decide weather or not you are good or bad. you can go around slaying innocent creatures and humanoids such as Farmers, Women, Children, Pigs, cows, horses for that oh so precious mana early game and ultimatly end up getting raided. Or you can play it peacefull early on and then decide to wreak havok at a later part of the game, when you have finally learned how to train your Minions up to be strong enough to take on a red dragon. ( which is srs buisness btw ) You can even decide at the begining of the game to go explore and see what's in the world. You may come across something interesting such as the Human keep and see all that free gold sitting there and think.... \" Holy hell look at all that gold!, its just sitting there.... Im gonna take it \"  Not realising what may happen if you do take that gold ;). \n\nThere are many supprises in this game that i cant even begin to elaborate on. There are Triggered events, that happen during the game when you least expect it. suddenly you are being raided by Bandits, Or the notorious Elementalist and you must defend your keeper otherwise... It's all over boys.\n\nNow there are some issues with this game, But the devs are TRYING to do their best to sort it out, they even go as far as asking for your save file to look into whatever errors/bugs you have encountered so that they can learn from it, I like this. It's actively supported and not forgotten about.( Like Dayz )\n I found it to be a bit of a learning curve at first. There is no tutorial in game currently, the dev's say they plan on adding on. In depth information about creatures is almost non exsistant on the internet but im sure they will eventually add in the information when they have the time. It is a little bit annoying having to learn game when there is 20% of the game that is roughly hidden to you, such as how minions are recruited, Learning the combat system and finding out the hard way, your minions just arent high enough level to go out and take on a bunch of bandits or elves... MY GOD I HATE ELVES.... So will you.....   But its all in good fun.\n\nI would reccomend this game if you are bored with everything else on steam that you've usually been playing and you want to try something new and differnet. If you've heard of Dwarf Fortress and have never tried it out before, i would reccomend you try KeeperRL. i gaurentee you that you will like it.

I love the depth of this game, the dynamics and how there are so many different types of monsters and allies.\n\nI however can not take on a single attack or defense wave.  There are always enemies that are level 20-35 that single hit my level 5-15 allies.\n\nMy Keeper never levels or uses the training the room.  If I take him out, he dies, if I keep him in, he stays at level 5.\n\nSo the game is the same every time, I build up my dungeon, finally go and try to explore and lose all my army by single enemy somewhere, or the enemies attack my dungeon and wipe everything while I can at most kill one or two things.

For me it is not playable on my macbook 2015 and on my dell 2016.\n\nSo if you like a buggy game that may be stable in a year... or not, buy it. But if you want a game that is playable at some point: don't buy it. The developer really have to focus on fixing bugs, also most are crashing the game and freezing the system on windows.

I won't lie the create a team thing was strange and i nearly gave up on the game because of it. when you click new team it pops up a menu that says drag to create new team or something along those lines. but what you actually have to do is click the minion above and then a menu for that minion pops up and you then click and drag to the \"new team\" option.  \n\nI can tell you right off the bat you wont get the best dungeon layout or understand the best way to start out without some trial and error also the ingame wiki is abit vague and im still trying to figure out how to get succubus to copulate since it is just grayed out for me. but otherwise i enjoy the game alot i've probably made about 6-10 different dungeons that all fell ( 11 is holding strong now that i have an idea of what im doing) it sucks restarting but i accept the flaws in that those dungeons and take what i've learned to make new and better and each time it gets better.\n\n word of advice thou to mess with dwarfs early on they F@@@ you up really easy. other then that avoid making too many  enemies early on so keep an eye on your exploring teams alot of factions have triggers say if you kill their people and one of the biggest ways to slow progress down if your not ready to deal with it is constantly being attacked and having to recoup. One more warning ill give beware of Dragon-Sickness ;D. otherwise enjoy the game\n\nRecommendations for dev: \n better ingame wiki/ tutorial for features: can be alittle confusing on what everything does when you first start out and what to do\n\nability to lock certain minions into tasks: ie stay in training (besides the times they need to fullfill basic needs sleeping eating etc or when i take control of the lead minion of a team)\n\nability to tell exploring teams not to attack unless they are attacked (avoid wars with lizardmen)\n\nability to tell a certain something to eat certain minions ones i select rather then random ones( at least it feels random)\n\nshop to sell excess or weak/not needed equipment too: say a demon trader or something that is sometimes summoned when you get a ritual room that you can buy select equipment to or sell equipment to for gold and have enchant weapons for you based on a list of all enchants ingame and then have a price in say gold or mana or both to enchant. \n\nseperate room that imps stay in when they are not in use or doing anything?: they seem to conjest at the doorways, hallways and front entrance and it slows down my teams even more when im trying to leave to raid. or they get in the way when im being attacked and get killed/seperate lead minion from my team. \n\nA way to pick what your minions make and say it gives a time limit similar to the cooldown on spells before its made and you can selet how many to make.\n\nwhen you drop an item that a minion is holding have it so they drop it in they room that is for equipment or everything if there is one. if there isn't then they just drop it.\n\ncertain items seem to disappear idk if its durablity or what but i had a strength gloves 2 def 1 str and boots that gave speed 30 2 def and they were gone from my keeper after i returned from a night raid. i killed one main human town a bandit cave and some kobolds in their den. if it is durability a value to show how long it lasts and an option to repair would be nice\n\nOtherwise great game cant wait to see what you come up with in the future for this game\n\np.s. is it possible to save worlds when keeper dies its game over but say  keep it so they cant be uploaded at the end since it wasn't one life victory it was however many deaths. say back it up to the previous day before keepers death so that you could try and see if there was another possible outcome or if in the end the dungeon wasn't good enough?\n\np.p.s how do you make the succubus copulate i have two now and the option is grayed out and the only one avaliable is rituals for both. I have a prisoner and have found two human settlements one major castle and one small town. plus i have orcs, orges, and goblins under my control  and both the beast and humaniond yet they wont give me the option?", "timestamp_created": 1457031234, "timestamp_updated": 1457154583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485339", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21436168": {"recommendationid": "21436168", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994834498", "num_games_owned": 654, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456365013}, "language": "english", "review": "After purchasing this game and playing for a couple hours, I have a first impression to make, provided that the developer keeps going. \n\nIt was a bit of work to figure out at first, but much like Dwarf Fortress, once you break that wall, it's amazing.

It needs better generation, while the random seeded generation is good, you will end up without a certain resource on occasion that or you will be digging random mazes throught the mountain getting to the ore veins. the games progresses to fast, when you start out it goes at normal speed then all the sudden the progression feels like it gets throttle extremly easily , then before you know it you have researched everything but humanoid and beast mutation and you are just trying to find a way to make the game last longer. \n One way the game could be improved greatly would be with Steam Workshop support.This could up the replay value by a MILE (or 1.609344 Kilometers for those of you not from the US) thus greatly improving the game. \nOverall rate 7.5/10\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is still in early access(EXTREMEly early alpha from what i can tell) This game IS most CERTAINLY going to be a TREMENDOUSLY AMAZING game when it is fully released. I hope this review can help those of you checking the game out and if the dev(s) read(s) this I hope you keep doing GOOD WORK and I sincerely hope this review can help you iron out some things.", "timestamp_created": 1450991693, "timestamp_updated": 1450991693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19827943": {"recommendationid": "19827943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144805326", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471661235}, "language": "english", "review": "Barebones at the moment, but enjoyable.

Special towards the unknown. They burned everything which is not right in their eyes. Imps, Doppleganger, Orcs. It doesn't matter. It's all the same for them. And then, one day, as it had to be, I turned. I don't know why, but I had allways dreams of the \"unknown\". Ofcourse I was too afraid to tell my family, my village. I don't want to end up in a fire where my soul burns for my \"sins\". So I fled. I decided to hide in the mountains where noone can see me. I also found a few new friends on my journey. They were Imps. My family was allways so wrong. They are just some harmless creatures (If you can stand the smell ofcourse). I told them who I am and why I am not with my kind anymore. For some reason they believed me. A few days later we made it to the foot of the mountain. Till then my \"power\" grew. The imps weren't friends anymore. They obey me now. There was some nice experiment I made with it. I told one Imp to scratch his arm until I say stop. Sadly I fell asleep because it was allready dark. He scraped with his sharp claws down to his skull and... beyond. It was a huge mess. Maybe that was the point where I changed. Ofcourse not just because of that, but also because of my family. I had to leave or I will die. Now someone else died because of me. Whatsoever we made it to the mountain. For some reason Imps allways have enough equipment with them to dig in dirt or rocks. So I made 'em dig. We build up our own basement, my power grew and grew and it lured more creatures to me. Willing to obey me.\n\nA few months later we found some dwarfs in the deep belly of the mountain. They noticed that we aren't normal anymore. We are, by far, not these creatures that we used to be. Our skin is.. white, because of the darkness in the inner of the cold rock. Our eyes, pitch black. The Darkness itself, took controll of our bodies.\nWe. Are. Death.\nNoone can stand in our way.\nA werewolf took one of the dwarfs and broke his neck with a simple strike. Meanwhile two other tried to overpower a doppleganger. Fools. They vanished as soon as the creature looked at them. There were about 14 of them in this cave. Now you can't tell anymore. The whole room is splattered with blood and flesh. I stand above the last of them who is asking for mercy. No mercy for them. Not for those who would kill [i]our[/i] kind. I rammed my sword into his throat. I can hear his death rattle. Blood flows into his throat and he suffocates on his own fluid. We gather everything together what we find. Weapons, armor, bows. We need them. Tomorrow is the big day. Revenge. Finally..\nI have lived long enough in this cold dungeon.\nTime to greet my old blood.\n\nWe started in the middle of the night, I spoke a spell on a raven, so he can scout the landscape for us. A few hours later we made it to the village. I can see the houses. The graveyards. The wheat field. Everything looks so familiar. And then I see it. A big black cross. It still glows a little bit from its last feast. This is why I came back. [b]Now its time for them to burn for their sins.

It certainly feels charming like the classic Dungeon Keeper which is borrows from more than a little. The top-down look works well and the simple indie graphics have their charm despite a lack of animations.\n\nWhere it shines is your ability to micromanage your dungeon layout and build teams of multiple units and take direct control of them to attack your enemies. Despite finite resources, particularly in the form of gold, granite, and iron, you will rarely feel too rushed and are given ample time each playthrough to develop your dungeon as you see fit, and once you've mustered strong defenses it's really up to you when you decide to set out and conquer.\n\nThe biggest downside of the game is the difficulty caps pretty early, despite having your dungeon attacked by enemies that can early on prove to be quite devastating, once you've figured out the basics of dungeon management you will be able to conquer with little problem, and as more enemies are defeated, your job just becomes easier and easier to the point that you could just zerg rush the enemy's base at the end and win with overwhelming force. Having the game come with randomly generated worlds was a nice touch but with the same type of enemies in each, it quickly becomes rather easy to plan a winning strategy.\n\nDo I recommend this game? If you love Dungeon Management, it's definitely worth picking up and it is a lot of fun to figure out, but if you consider yourself a strategy veteran you may find the lack of challenge in the game to be a serious detractor.", "timestamp_created": 1446818038, "timestamp_updated": 1446818038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.729604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18905215": {"recommendationid": "18905215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005781319", "num_games_owned": 536, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508658371}, "language": "schinese", "review": "2D\u7248\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u57ce\u5b88\u62a4\u8005+ascii\u6e38\u620f\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5341\u5206\u6709\u8da3\u3002\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1446802944, "timestamp_updated": 1446802944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18835620": {"recommendationid": "18835620", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970609941", "num_games_owned": 961, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511217299}, "language": "english", "review": "I played it for 9 hours apparently, but it felt like 2.

You get such awesome stories from it, like [url=http://www.timdenee.com/bronzemurder/]Bronzemurder[/url] (one of the more succinct, well-presented ones). \n\nI've always loved reading DF stories. But when I try playing it, even after sinking 20 hours into playing and working through tutorials, I'm still quite baffled by what to do, why things happen, or how to get things done. I've never had a functioning Fortress. I've never been able to figure out how to brew booze (which Dwarves need for life, like water). I think it has something to do with plants I have to grow, but I can't figure out what plants, how to grow them, etc etc.\n\nEnter KeeperRL.\n\nAfter 20 MINUTES into KeeperRL, I have a (rather haphazard, admittedly) [strike]fortress[/strike] [i]dungeon[/i].\nIt works. It functions. The game prompted me on the very basics I'd need. If I wanted to deviate from that, it let me; it even lets me turn off those hints... but it didn't assume, from the get-go, that I wasn't a new player. It never assumed that I wanted to spend as much time researching this game as it takes to write a college paper just to be able to play the game on the most basic level.\nThat's important in such a complex game! \n\nThe Dwarf Fortress game cycles like this: Play, Die, Boggle, Google. Repeat.\nBut KeeperRL cycles in like this instead: Play, Die, LEARN. Repeat.\nThat makes it, even in this Alpha state, far more enjoyable than the glorious complexity of one of its main inspirations, Dwarf Fortress.\n\nTL;DR, yes, KeeperRL is DF for sane people.", "timestamp_created": 1443035139, "timestamp_updated": 1477875320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784881", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17951662": {"recommendationid": "17951662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005439390", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 194, "playtime_forever": 2250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509603886}, "language": "english", "review": "Dwarf Fortress for sane people.\n\nVolume controls would be a nice addition.", "timestamp_created": 1441766267, "timestamp_updated": 1509666872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 59, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655747", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17949134": {"recommendationid": "17949134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029143495", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493335890}, "language": "english", "review": "Tentative thumbs-up.

Dungeon Keeper + a roguelike.\n\nThe DK mechanics are there: you'll be digging out areas and building familiar (for DK players) rooms in them.  You'll summon creatures, and set them about their tasks accordingly.  You'll build traps and doors, mine for iron, gold, and stone (each of which requires a storeroom), and construct equipment for your beasties.  But instead of the realtime 3D of DK and its ilk, you are presented an old-school roguelike UI with the sundry keypresses to boot.\n\nAs of AUGUST 23, 2015, the barebones mechanics are there.  All of the rooms work, monsters are summoned correctly, as go about their tasks and level up as you would expect -- even to the point where they will occasionally visit an equipment storeroom to grab any goodies that catch their eye.  The imp AI is especially good in prioritizing tasks you give them.  Grouping up critters and manually controlling them (the only real way to send out a raiding party/army) works fine as well. \n\nOutside of the barebones -- which as I stated before, actually work well, and is the most important feature! -- there's not much to do.  You obstensible goal is to conquer 5 enemy outposts to win the game.  When you attack one of the enemy races, they will occasionally send their forces to attack your dungeon; conquering the race ends that particular threat.  Nonaligned bandits will also show up.  There's a few other \"special\" events and areas, but the game as it stands right now basically revolves around building the best dungeon you can, then controlling your forces out to overrun the five \"good\" races.  The building part is pretty fun; the conquering is kind of a chore.  (Of course, it could be said that this repetitive pattern of build-then-zerg is part of DK's DNA, not a failing of KeeperRL).\n\nShould you buy the game now in its state as of this review's writing?  I'd say yes only if you acknowledge you're getting a game that has its core mechanics nicely in place, but not much to do with them.  Of course, you'll also be supporting the game's development into something bigger and better.  If you want a fleshed-out experience with lots of interesting decisions, I'd wait.\n\nOne thing that I do want note is that KeeperRL's DK design is nice and streamlined, and follows the original DK2 monster and item variety pretty closely (although it adds individual weapons and items for critters, which is nice).  I was uncomfortable with War for the Overworld's changes and additions to the DK roster, particularly in the way that many things were added simply for the sake of being cool rather than important to the game design.

The 5 resources are gold, wood, iron, granite/stone, and mana. The first 3 are used for building main buildings. They are Wood, Iron, and Granite, Wood is the most common. Gold is used for building structures to expand your maxium population, it can be found in chests, on people, or in your mountian. Mana is used for summoning imps, your workers, studying, and building certan rooms.  There are about 15 types of enemies, the most annoying are the tree spirits which come from trees. They will stop wood production by killing imps until you can get a good minion to kill them or until you get attacked by units that can kill them. Tree spirits most commonly spawn with 35 attack and 25 defense and they are at lv 15-20 and they can fly which means they can easily move over all water. Then their are the usual assulters or weaklings. They range from 10 attack to 30 attack and 5 defence to 30 defence. The attackers are from weakest to strongest: bandits, lizardmen and dwarves(they are together because i cannot diside which is strongest as lizardmen posion but are weaker than dwarves but the posion factor makes them almost equal) , and humans. The lords are who you must kill to stop invasion and make all of their minions be depressed which means they will surrender more often. Prisoners is when enemies surrender and are sent to a prison if you have one, they can be tortered or exucuted, tortering gives mana, and exucuting prisoners gives prisoner heads which makes invaders mad. Then their are the strong agressors which are cyclopes and dragons. They attack rarely but are very powerful. The good thing is that the strong agressors dont want to kill your keeper but they want to kill anyone including your keeper and invaders. Invaders drop gold and equipment for your minions. Equipment can be make in  the manufatories and they are oppurated by orges, goblins, or orcs, goblins. Goblins should be the ones working in the manufatories. There are many more things to discover in KeeperRl (KeeperRl maps are all randomly generated so no map is the same, also always dig around question marks or else you could be in trouble) Note that cyclopes and dragons only go for loot or kills or gold also that the lords are very strong unless you have very op units or something else that can kill them quickly.

So perfectly, in fact, that after  I heard the concept it made so much sense that I'm suprised it's not a more common practice.\n\nUnfortunately so far this game hasn't really made it very far beyond its great idea.  Even the title is just an abbreviation of the idea, which, as you may have guessed by now, is to have a dungeon keeper game combined with a roguelike in which you run people's retired dungeons.  Such a simple yet great idea!\n\nGraphically the game is extremely simple and at this time most of the assets are the same free assets we've seen in half a dozen games in the last year.  This is a lo-fi game and will stay that way, which is usually not a problem for roguelike fans (in fact for us it's a bit of a badge of honor).  If you are looking for a slick and modern keeper experience get Dungeons 2 or War for the Overlworld.  That being said the gameplay mechanics are already solid if in need of balance, and in true roguelike fashion with a little digging you can discover just what is happening under the hood (spoiler: it's math, lots of math).\n\nIn a market environment brimming over with indie roguelike titles it takes more than just a good idea to hook players- only games with truly memorable gameplay and unique aesthetics stay relevant for any significant period of time (think Binding of Isaac or Sunless Sea, for example).  KeeperRL has that spark in its original concept and the dev is active and open to input- with proper care and attention that spark could catch and we could have a roguelike/keeper hybrid we'll remember for a long time. At the moment the keeper gameplay, though diverting and enjoyable, doesn't clearly distinguish itself from a thousand other indie dwarf fortress clones; and I could the same of the roguelike portion.\n\nI found the keeper portions much more fun and engaging- the roguelike play lacks balance and largely consists of dying near the entrance to someone's dungeon.\n\nIt doesn't feel fair to give a number rating at this early stage of development so I'm giving KeeperRL an overall \"mediocre but with lots of room to grow.\"  And I'm giving it a definite recommend if you are a roguelike collector like me or if it's particularly  important to you to support the hard work of  a truly independent developer.  Otherwise it's a conditional recommend offered because of my hopes and feelings about this game's potential, not based on the current user experience.\n\nAlso, there's a special bonus fanservice for hardcore roguelike lovers: ascii graphics mode.

I personally like Sprites, i find them very charming.\n[*] The difficulty, though this does need a ton of balancing, and you can be totally screwed by the randomness.\n[*] A variety of monsters and Enemies (there's around 20+ monsters at the moment in the alpha, not sure about enemies, but theres 4.5 different factions, i say .5 because ones just a different tribe but with the same species, that being human)\n[*] Combat is pretty nice, let the AI handle it or take some control yourself.\n[*] it's turn based, however the turns run by themselves as long as you're not controlling a minion. you can also speed up the game or slow it down as well as pause it.\n[*] it's very replayable with random maps\n[/list]\n\n [h1][B] What i didnt like [/B] [/h1]\n\n[i] Most of my complaints are being addressed at some point during early access as far as i'm aware [/i]\n\n[list]\n[*] The map is really small, which makes the game more difficult than i feel it should be. It pretty much places all the threats at your door step, thankfully those threats dont usually attack unless provoked (random enemies will come and attack from time to time)\n[*] Some of the enemies that can come early game (random times enemies will raid your dungeon, and they seem to be randomly chosen) are pretty powerful, one such being dragons if you're unlucky enough, you'll most likely not survive early game if attacked unless you hide your keeper somewhere safe and pray to RNGesus the dragon cant open doors\n[*] there is a lack of tutorial right now, so the game has a larger than needed difficulty curve because of it, however experimenting can be pretty fun! also i can understand why it's not in yet because it's alpha, the game isnt too hard to learn however some mechanics need a tutorial/explaination ASAP.\n[b]There are in game hints, so you can get started and learning from the get go [/b]\n[*] resources are very limited, this is due to the map size most likely, gold is super limited yet you need gold to use some of the more combat fit minions, because of upkeep (use beasts in the beginning, costs nothing to use and they can hold their own against some enemies) you can get gold from raiding factions, however right now factions are super powerful so raiding early game is not a good idea.\n\n[/list]\n\nhmmm that's about it for now, i will update as i play more.

A lot. With each death though, you learn from the mistakes you've made on our previous Keeper and improve. \n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nA bit of a more personal moment just to tell you what can happen in this game.\nI became more adept to the game and managed a pretty good base, but was running thin. Only just getting new Orc trooper recruits and goblins that've made a scarce few amount of weapons, I thought my defences would be okay against some bandits so I decided to send my Imps on a big resource run - alas they ran into a dwarf camp and it got to the point where my keeper was on a last stand against 3 lightly wounded dwarf warriors and all he had with him was a level 3 goblin shaman. I was so happy that I equipped my Keeper with decent gear and made him study and train for ages, because he defeated those Dwarfs like a BOSS! Anyway... So I wasn't expecting to win that and realized I should beef up my troops. My army grew larger and toughter but wave after wave of lizardmen kept it waring thin. \nThe last invasion I had I lost my Ogre which I beeefd up hard and it was a big loss, but my Orc men were growing strong and I was also gaining Vampires that were wielding 2-H Warhammers (lol) and bows - all these soldiers I've had left were around level 10-12 and only amounting to around 9-10 soldiers. Then the Green Dragon decided it was a good idea to attack my base. Yes, the GREEN DRAGON. Level 35, pretty crazy stats. I thought my soldiers were done for... I grouped up my men with the level 12 orc as the leader, and slowly lead them to face off the dragon in the Resource Room (the largest room I had, thought it'd be the best area to fight the dragon so more of my men can fight him at once) and they waited in formation ..... BANG! the Dragon blew open the door and approached my men. The Orc Commander charged with his soldiers, slicing and dicing him with every oft hit ... while the Dragon constantly missed like a drunkard. I was surprised... Every turn I ordered my men to attack the dragon, they swifty dodged every attack and in no time, they chased him down to the corner fo the room where he was whimpering, critically wounded. I could feel it, I could feel the Orc Commander smiling as he raised his sword to take the final blow on this Green Dragon who decided to invade his home. The Dragon died.. and I shed a tear, as I thought I would not see a single one of my men alive and that the Keeper would have fallen. I never cry in games like this, it's a Rogue Like (who cries in Rogue Like games... seriously? XD), you get used to your characters dying - but this moment. It was something unique. I felt a new respect for my soldiers, my characters  - against all odds, they stood on top of their foe - ROARING with satisfaction of defeating an impossible foe. This is the most vivid and real experience I've ever had in a Rogue Like, if ANY, game ever. (yes.. I did actually shed a tear when my men killed the dragon.. I'm the feeler type okay :p)\n\n\nTL;DR - If you love Roguelikes and have been looking for something new and different in the genre, this is for you\n\nalso, I like bacon.", "timestamp_created": 1427897251, "timestamp_updated": 1429278204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15153710": {"recommendationid": "15153710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090518315", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475414159}, "language": "english", "review": "No difficulty settings, very hard\nRoguelike=permadeath\nNeed gold for minions so escentially its a hire mercenary game\nGold runs out\nMy minions always seem to be underleveled but that may just be me\nyour main character is the weakest character in game but he can level if he dosent get 1 hit\nmost everything gets one hit especially annoying when fighting ranged units\ntraps for defense are weak/ineffective\nItems have random stats iron sword could be +6, +8 attack its random to a degree\nsound stops sometimes\nmap isnt all that big\nWill be worth it when you can generate gold by selling crafted items or gold cost is removed on units, makes no sense why monsters would want gold anyways", "timestamp_created": 1427889683, "timestamp_updated": 1427901475, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.382614", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15152521": {"recommendationid": "15152521", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994156682", "num_games_owned": 598, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508740533}, "language": "english", "review": "KeeperRL: The not-quite-Dungeon-Keeper-and-not-quite-Dwarf-Fortress game\n\nIt's not either, but manages to blend both in a rather unique combination of the two, with a few of it's own surprises.\n\nThe world you're thrown into is pretty much alive -- people and other creatures wander the days, and sleep the nights, all the while ignorant to the virus that grows in their lands.\n\nYou're that virus.  A keeper whom seeks to conquer all, and raze the plains.\n\nPros:\nThe world is alive -- the countryside's only threat isn't just you.  Civilians have to maintain themselves, and avoid being eaten by other monsters that roam the lands.\nDungeon building that's a true heir to Dungeon Keeper -- traps, rooms, micromanagement of units\nStrategy game that kicks in where you can move your units according to their stats (slow units move slower) around in a turn-based combat environment.\nResource-management, and consequences of your dungeon becoming too 'lucrative' of a target\nRandomly generated maps\nAvatar who acts as the leader of the dungeon, whom must be protected at all costs.  Starts out as the weakest unit, but can quickly rise to strongest\n\nCons:\nResource management -- gold is sparse, but most-used, especially if you want to actually keep your minions around\nUI is slightly confusing to use\nLack of explanations on game mechanics (minion attraction, etc.)\n\"Black Glob\" wall that (I guess) represents the 'edge of the map,' (and you sometimes starting right by it)\nPacing of the game is a little on the fast side (Depending on if you like that or not) -- if you're good, it's over before you really get into it.

It is a finite resource yet you need it to keep your army. It kind of ruins the game. You aren't a dungeon keeper, you are just some guy who hires mercenaries. Plus, if you have long games, you are screwed because gold is a limited resource.\n\n2. my minions absolutely refuse to work on traps. I think you should be able to designate what your minions actually do at the work bench. I wanna play defensively but it is entirely impossible atm.\n\n3. It takes entirely too long to get minions. You can make extremely large rooms and still attract almost no minions at all. Pure rng\n\n4. Crashes\n\n5. Many aspects of the game are random, which is fine but they need balance. Workshops produce random weapons you may not ever use while you have traps planned out but they don't get made. You may also get a ton of useless minions while not getting any that are combat capable.\n\n6. Balance. Training doesn't help your grunt minions enough to even be semi reliable, they just waste space. The enemy units are much too strong for most units. There are only 3 that do anything right now, the vampire, the legendary beast, and the legendary humanoid. Anything else right now is entirely useless in an actual battle.\n\n7. I beat the game in 2 hours. It certainly has tons of replayability and is meant to be played several times, but 2 hours is pretty short for a whole playthrough. An endless mode would be an unbelievable addition to the game.\n\nThe idea of this game is great, however execution is poor at best. I hope there are some changes so this game can reach its full potential.\n\n4/10 atm, may change at some point. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy the game but it just has too many problems going on right now for me to be able to recommend it. Keep an eye on it though for sure.\n\nEdit: the dev replied after changing many things and asked me to revisit the game. Unfortunately it is now even worse. Since random recruitment is gone, you now get almost no creatures and the population cap is incredibly low for this type of game. 10 creatures to be exact. \n\nGold was already an issue due to its finite nature and now it is not only finite but incredibly uncommon so getting any demon monsters is near impossible.\n\nOn the topic of monsters, no matter what you construct your recruits will nearly always consist of orcs with the occasional bear from time to time so even if you have a tricked out dungeon you will still be seeing only orcs being available.\n\nMana is however, possibly the biggest issue. In any mode but free mode you can not generate it which makes it impossible to research most technologys, most notably traps which are 100% essential because without it none of your monsters will stay in your dungeon and fight. \n\nThe game was playable before if a little lackluster, now I have to say it simply isn't worth your time in its current state", "timestamp_created": 1427852281, "timestamp_updated": 1509074599, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467793", "comment_count": "29", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1488703932, "developer_response": "Hey, did you have a chance to try the game again?

Even in early access stage, the game is already very fun and replayable.\n\nMechanics:\nYou build a base somewhat like in dungeon keeper/dwarf fortress. You have mana and bunch of mineral resources. You can build different rooms to build equipment (automated), traps, etc... Minerals like iron, granite, gold are limited and non-replenishable  (gold is somewhat via enemy drops/chests). Monsters settle in your dungeon based on the sort of rooms that you have.\n\nYour goal is to survive raids and defeat all the enemy's villages in the map. Right now, there aren't enough mechanics for the game to be \"deep\", but it can kill a few hours of your time. The difficulty becomes pretty easy after a few attempts at the game. \n\nWhat I feel it's lacking now [Alpha 13]:\n\n- Multithreading issues make setting the game to \"single-core\" in task manager preferable to using multiple cores.\n\n- No system to generate gold. Once your base grows large enough, and you have mined the paltry amount of gold generated on the map, you can only rely on raiding villages and drops from raiders. This amount is very small to keep your base going. Your minions require quite a lot of gold.\n\n- Balancing: Both your own henchmen and enemies are very unbalanced. Usually, the enemies will be much stronger than your own minions.\n\n- Not enough raiders/attacks on the base. Sometimes you will get attacked by a powerful dragon, but it feel unbalanced and the dragon will fly away. I like a challenge. Sometimes groups of lizardmen, dwarfs, etc... will attack your base, but not frequently enough in my opinion.\n\n- Only way to attack is to command a team manually by taking control of a creature (And thereby his team) or by placing guard flags. Needs more command flags. \n\n- Villagers wont come out of their house. Attacking is mostly a slaughter via a 1 tile entrance where it turns into multiple 1 vs 1 battle for a couple minutes. (What I mean to say is this: There is a doorway into the house, and your monsters will cluster outside the doorway, and the villagers will cluster inside the house. There is no room for either to move in or out)\n\n- No option to build walls.\n\n- Some basic difficulty and world-gen settings would go a long way to increase/decrease difficulty.

In the game you take a role of mysterious keeper who embarks on new land. Your job will be establish colony and fight enemies. Game looks a bit like simplified dwarf fortress. You dig for resources expand your dungeon repel rides from your enemies and eventually go out there and get them. Learning curve is quite high but every attack on your dungeon is caused by the player himself either by too aggressive expansion building army buildings too early, killing peasants or even by chopping to many tree and bringing revenge of the spirits of the forest. \n\nOnce you learn the basic mechanics it is just a job of mastering it and improving with each and every new design of your base. Interesting twist is presence of the keeper. If he dies it's game over. He starts as a below average unit but with training, battle experience and researching spells you can train him to be able to singlehandedly take on the dragons. So it is fine balance between keeper safety and him gaining experience to become your ultimate weapon. \n\nSo far I have clocked about 9 hours into the game on steam and some more outside of it and I really enjoy the game and strongly recommend it. Actual map can be finished in about 5-6 hours at this stage of the game so it is nice one long afternoon game and then you can try again with new procedurally generated maps.\n\nI have started a let's play series where you can see how game looks like and learn few tips as I share what I learn with you guys.

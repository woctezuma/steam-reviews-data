Play as a cute girl swinging in a surreal fish-man landscape. The kind of game where you want to replay and get better.\n\nHG101 review of the series.\nhttp://hg101.kontek.net/umihara/umihara.htm\nCreator interview:\nhttp://www.usgamer.net/articles/indie-before-it-was-cool-the-umihara-kawase-story\nhttp://gosokkyu.com/post/79416970057/odd-odyssey-the-story-of-umihara-kawase-in-this\n\nGraphics:\nBasically an emulation. Fullscreen support that you can stretch horizontal or vertical. Default at the normal aspect ratio will have black bars on the side obviously since it's 4:3. There are a couple filters (hard and soft), but I just play on default. The game's pixel art still looks nice and charming, but the backgrounds are just really ugly pixelated photos. You probably won't notice the background that much anyway, the pixel art itself is vibrant enough to keep your attention. Sometimes the water will have a flickering glitch, but it only happened for a couple seconds to me.\n\nTechnical:\nController support works fine, but you have to use the toolbar options rather than the in-game options. The original SNES game suffered from lag due to the heavy physics engine, but this runs smoothly without any problem. I seem to have a problem where Explorer.exe will crash every time I alt-tab the game, though. Also the settings don't seem to save, so I have to fullscreen it again every time I play.\n\nMusic:\nSoundtrack is decent but not really noteworthy, which is good because you're going to be hearing it a lot as you make your way through 50+ levels.\n\nGameplay:\nFun, but it takes getting used to. You can toss your grapple hook fishing line in all directions. Up and Down reel you in or out. There's a short tutorial demonstration of skills that you should develop and enemies that you'll encounter before each level. You're given 10 lives, and you have to reach the end (stage 51 or so). Difficulty slowly ramps up, so you're expected to get good early on. You can walk like a normal 2D platforming game for the early levels, but you will have to know how to fling yourself over and through the level by slinging yourself via the fishing line. There are multiple paths you can take, and two endings. Some of the hidden paths will skip entire chunks of the game (or bosses), but they're also usually hard to access (and/or completely offscreen - there's a feature where you can move your camera to the side a bit to try and see what might be hiding). You will need to master techniques that involve exploiting your rubber fishing line + your momentum + the fishing line tension, such as \"rocket jumps.\" This is how you access some of the more hidden paths. You'll also need to master those techniques if you want to see all the levels, because there's a 30-minute timer in this game. If you're too slow and go over it, you're automatically sent to the last stage.\n\nEnemies spawn randomly on the map. You can catch them and put them in your sack for points. There are also some cut enemies that should still be in the game's code, so it might be possible to reimplement them if you want.\n\nhttps://tcrf.net/Umihara_Kawase_(SNES)\n\nIf you enjoy replaying the game to get faster and swinging like a madman, then this won't be a problem. You can also save and share replays to make yourself and others feel inferior (if you really want to feel inferior, look up the AGDQ run of this game).", "timestamp_created": 1511751243, "timestamp_updated": 1512184037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37643789": {"recommendationid": "37643789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201993536", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1514099956}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un gran juego que lamentablemente parece que no ha tenido tantas ventas pese a ser todo un clasico (probablemente porque la mayor\u00eda prefiere jugarlo en un emulador de supernintendo)", "timestamp_created": 1511689693, "timestamp_updated": 1511689693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36897401": {"recommendationid": "36897401", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998370867", "num_games_owned": 636, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512867845}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Entretenido juego de culto aparecido originalmente en Super Famicom. El objetivo es alcanzar las puertas de salida de cada nivel, haciendo uso de una ca\u00f1a de pescar que permite a la protagonista capturar enemigos y balancearse por los techos y paredes.\n\nLas mec\u00e1nicas del juego son sencillas pero no f\u00e1ciles de dominar. Con un comienzo facil, pronto aparecen las dificultades:  lugares aparentemente imposibles de alcanzar, enemigos que aparecen de improvisto e incluso imposibles de atrapar. Sin embargo con practica, paciencia y a veces un poco de suerte se va avanzando en el juego.  \n\nAprender las f\u00edsicas del juego es parte de la entretenci\u00f3n. Al aprender a balancearse se abren m\u00faltiples posibilidades para llegar a una de las salidas del nivel y con ello ir desbloqueando las m\u00faltiples rutas que tiene el juego. Partir con 10 vidas parece suficiente, pero aprender a pasar cada nivel requerir\u00e1 perder muchas de esas vidas. De todos modos, existe un modo de pr\u00e1ctica que permite jugar las veces que se quiera una etapa jugada anteriormente.\n\nEl apartado gr\u00e1fico es curioso, mezclando fotograf\u00edas monocromaticas con coloridas plataformas, enemigos y elementos decorativos por los cuales uno se pregunta \u00bfqu\u00e9 se fumaron sus creadores?. En este aspecto no sobresale con respecto a otros juegos de su \u00e9poca, pero tiene su encanto. En cuanto a la m\u00fasica, posee pocos pero pegajosos temas. Si lo juegas por mucho tiempo se quedaran dando vueltas en tu cabeza.\n\nEn resumen, un juego cl\u00e1sico que premia la persistencia volviendose muy disfrutable.

Since this was a japanese exclusive game for the SNES (and a somewhat rare one at that), I never had the opportunity to play it until now.

The controls take some time to get used to but once you have them down it's a really fun game.\n\nFor the price it's well worth it. I highly recommend it.\n\nEDIT: After playing the game for a while I do have one major criticism and that's the enemy spawns. When you defeat an enemy it will respawn about 3 seconds later. It's really frustrating when you're tring to make a tricky jump because you barely have any time to react. Sometimes when you land on a platfrom an enemy will randomly spawn right when you start to get on the platform and intsntly kill you. If it weren't for this glaring issue this game would have been perfect, but thanks to the extremely unfair enemy spawns and respawns it starts to get frustrating the longer you play and the further you progress through the game, since you have no continues (at least none that I know of).", "timestamp_created": 1510103230, "timestamp_updated": 1511399765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36122145": {"recommendationid": "36122145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089105290", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511789874}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No mames q dificil  xd\n", "timestamp_created": 1509306451, "timestamp_updated": 1509306451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35563565": {"recommendationid": "35563565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007242512", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491798159}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent port of a delightful game.

Levels are short, and many of them have multiple exits that lead to different levels, forming branching paths through the game. The fishing line is at first difficult to control, but with time and practice you will discover all kinds of maneuvers you can use it for. The game is built to accommodate your growing skill and comfort; over time, long and difficult levels become short and easy, and seemingly impossible alternative paths become easy and obvious.

Every time you reach a new area that area is unlocked in practice mode so if you are having trouble on a particular part you can give it some practice before trying to make progress. The result of this system is that you get through the game by actually improving- not by getting lucky or grinding up stats. It feels increadibly satifying to sail through levels that seemed impossible before. \n\nSomething that I really love about this game is its focus.

Umihara Kawase is a platformer where most of the gameplay revolves around using an elastic fishing line to get around the level and attack enemies. Think the grappling hook from worms - except the elasticity adds a huge amount of complexity. Combined with the rock-solid physics, this leads to a very fun game that ramps up the difficulty to insane levels, requiring serious speedrunner rubberband tactics to just pass later levels. \nThe fishing line has a seemingly infinite learning curve, 40 hours in and I'm still learning new techniques. Initially you'll be using it to swing across pits and climb upwards, but soon you'll find yourself using the tension to slingshot yourself across levels, or 'rocket jump' over hazards. The layout of the levels make this as much puzzle as platforming: particular levels can take forever to figure out, though if you are having difficulty you can consult the library of replays that the community shares through the steam workshop integration.\nGameplay progression is handled like Super Mario Bros: you get 10 lives, and if you run out of lives it's game over and you must start again from the beginning. However, reaching a level once will unlock it in practice mode, where you get unlimited tries at it. So you'll soon fall into a cycle of Progressing through levels -> getting stuck and dying -> replaying the hard level in practice mode until confident -> and repeat. The great thing about this system is that come the end game, you have traversed the first ~10 levels several hundred times, and so you'll have an optimum route mapped out, shaving milliseconds off every time.\nThe levels don't follow a linear structure either - some levels have multiple exits, and you must choose which path to pursue. I ended up making a game map on paper to keep track of which levels I had completed. Some of the toughest levels are the Boss Fields. These usually feature a large enemy that must be avoided for a certain time or destroyed before the exit will open.\nAll in all, I've never quite played a platformer that utilises it's main mechanic this well. Definitely the best \"grappling hook\" physics of any game I've played, which is amazing considering this is almost a direct port of the super famicom version. \nIf you enjoyed Cave Story, La Mulana, or Spelunky, you'll feel at home with the platforming. If you enjoyed FEZ or Braid, you'll feel at home with the puzzle aspects. I don't think enough people know about this gem of a game, so give it a try.

The game starts you with 10 lives, which makes you think \"what could possibly go wrong?\". Well, you'll need those 10 lives, boy. Maybe more.\n\nThis game has surprisingly deep physics, even more so if you consider it came out in 1994. You jump, hook and swing your way across many many stages, some of which have 2 possible exits (one of them even has 3, but good luck with those).\n\nThe game is simple enough to learn (there are some neat lil cutscenes that give you tips here and there), but it takes a while to get used to what you can and can't do with the rubber band.\n\nAs both an upside and a downside, the game takes you to a specific ending if you have gone 30 minutes without getting a game over and without reaching any other particular ending. It's nice if you wanted to get to an ending and were having trouble, but if you were trying to get to a particular stage and took too long... well, though luck.\n\nThe controls are responsive and rarely do I feel like I failed due to bad controls.\n\nOnly problem I have is the game has respawning enemies, some of which like to appear right where you're about to land. The protagonist only has one hit point. You do the math.\n\nAside from that, it's a very enjoyable experience with high replay value. After you get used to the physics and learn a couple of tricks, early levels become your own little playground to try more zany antics.\n\nI also recommend watching the Game Center CX episode about this game.

UK is a purely arcade experience, with no story or any other unnecessary trappings.  The game is presented in stages, where you start at point a and try to get to point b, mainly by experimenting with the physics of your fishing hook.  \n\nThe big draw is that a lot of the stages have multiple exits and/or can be beaten in a different manner depending on the level of your skill with the fishing hook.  The hook has some cool physics, especially considering how the old game is.  The original UK has the best gameplay \"feel\" to me; it feels faster and the hook physics just seem more springy in a good way than the sequels.  Learning how to use the hook to throw Umi all over the place in very rewarding.\n\nUK is probably the best looking game in the series, though that's some faint praise.  The artstyle is unique at least and quite surreal.  There's not a lot to compare it to visually, it's an ugly game but ugly in it's own way.  Even the in-game UI has a weird, very centered placement.\n\nThe downside to UK is that it's an arcade experience.  There are no continues and you have a limited amount of lives with not too many ways to get more.  This means you'll be replaying early levels [i]a lot[/i].  The levels get more difficult as the game goes on and unless you're okay with the repetition of practicing levels and building up enough skill with the hook, you'll probably never beat the game.  Some levels also have really tight windows for clearing them, the giant seahorse level for one example.  UK also has the occasional boss level which might be interesting the first time but fall flat on repeated playthroughs.\n\nI'll probably never beat UK but it's a fun and frustrating arcade experience.  I tend to boot it up, play until I get a couple of game overs and then put on the digital shelf for a few months and then rinse and repeat.  It does seem like a cool game with a lot of speed-running potential, too, if you're into that.

level. You are armed with a fishing hook and use this to swing around and about and defeat enemies or evade them. This game makes great use of it's complex physics and creates challenging puzzles based on your abilities. There is much content hidden behind movement mechanics, and there are many difficult bosses. That said there is a lot to do, I have played over 50 hours at least and still have not found everything, and still finding things and figuring things out. The Steam version has workshop support, leaderboards, and a level select option once you have found a level. The game has always featured a demo playback function, but for this release you can save your replay and upload it to the workshop for other people to see.\n\nI dislike many of the bosses. Some are just boring and long, for example the first tadpole boss. And others are just unfair and frustrating, like the second tadpole boss and the crab. From what I have played, I think the sequel Umihara Kawase Shun handled bosses better, making them shorter, though not necessarily easier as that TWIN TADPOLE BOSS EXISTS. Needless to say, I don't play this game for the boss battles, though I do really like the two school of fish bosses and the seahorse boss is creative and adds even more variety as it's solution is neither combat nor evasion. I also dislike enemies randomly spawning, though if you play long enough you figure out how it works and it is pretty fair, they spawn in specific zones and it isn't like they will spawn under you or anything but will spawn ahead of you. If this is a dealbreaker for you, they have changed this behavior for the third game, Sayonara Umihara Kawase, which is also a great game which would function well as an entrypoint in the series.\n\nI love this game, it is easily my favorite platforming series, you cannot go wrong with it but make sure you use a controller with a good dpad like the Buffalo Classic USB pad", "timestamp_created": 1480682251, "timestamp_updated": 1480682251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27766509": {"recommendationid": "27766509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198233348248", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1514816574}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Excelente jogo!", "timestamp_created": 1480216464, "timestamp_updated": 1480216464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27579666": {"recommendationid": "27579666", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972431417", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451669771}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u6163\u308c\u3066\u304f\u308b\u3068\u30ad\u30de\u308b\u79fb\u52d5\u304c\u6307\u5148\u3068\u8133\u3092\u76f4\u7d50\u3057\u3066\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u5feb\u611f\u306b\u75fa\u308c\u308b\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1480124083, "timestamp_updated": 1480124083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27541535": {"recommendationid": "27541535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116789424", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501600787}, "language": "japanese", "review": "Oppai.", "timestamp_created": 1480106186, "timestamp_updated": 1480106186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495192", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27253543": {"recommendationid": "27253543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080883775", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501701352}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that we did not get to experience in the West until very recently (or... well you've played it a long time ago if you're into emulation).

This first game when it came out on Super Famicom certainly had a lot of competition, with the many platformers such as Big N's having the spotlight, but it managed to shine through and gain a cult following with its unique grappling gameplay and high difficulty.\n\nThe main gimmick of the game, and the series, is Umihara's fishing hook, which can latches on just about any surfaces, pressing down and up readjusts the length, and unlike the swinging mechanics in most games, it's far more sophisticated as the line is very rubbery and the game has a more complex physics/inertia system.  As you're latching on surfaces, you'll have to be swinging all around, putting a lot of weight on the fishing line, and then release the hook from said surface at the right time, to be able to launch yourself in many angles to cross gaps, go under levels, rocketing up walls, and avoiding spikes and many other traps, as well as the ill-mannered fish.  The game uses this one mechanic to its fullest, just as I like my platformers, and mastering it was one of my most rewarding experiences in my gaming life.\n\nThe world of Umihara Kawase isn't some linear trip, but instead is structured like some sort of maze, each Fields (levels) has a door that you have to find to proceed, some of which forks with two doors; it's impossible to see every Fields and access every doors in one playthrough, so coupled with the never-ending learning curve of the physics, there's tremendous replay value.\n\nDespite their size, the levels themselves are pretty open-ended, as you can tackle them however you want; the game may have you take some specific path, but you can skip a lot of it by just scaling up walls, so the gameplay can perfectly reflect your playstyle, and this lack of restrictiveness promotes further the fishing hook's abilities.  The levels can have interesting gimmicks, one of which is fully made of conveyor belts, the other has you propelling yourself using only seahorses, and another has enemies respawing at a faster rate.\n\nCompared to the next 2 entries, the oversized enemy fish have a slight more importance in the level design, as they are more in numbers, and while you can dispatch most of them by stunning them with your fishing hook and pulling them in your backpack, you still have to approach them strategically.  They all have some simple patterns that you have to react accordingly; eels throw some sort of acorn that stuns you, snails circle around platforms, and octopi spit ink that also stuns you and can only be disposed of by yanking them off walls with your weight.  There are also bosses, such as the ever persistent tadpole and flying fish, also requiring strategy, and keeping you on your toes.\n\nAs I've said before, this game is very hard, but it's good difficulty.  Already, mastering the controls would be quite the feat in itself, but level gimmicks certainly give you a run for your money, and enemies may have simple patterns, but they are usually placed in the most troublesome of places.  It certainly doesn't run out of juice for creativity though, as the fshing hook is again used to its fullest, and the game uses the most of its assets.\n\nThere may be a few nitpicks I have, the most notable problem being the tadpole boss in Field 8, which is really not hard and takes about 3 minutes (it's a fixed \"battle\", so you can't do it any faster), you'll have to be fighting him many times if you wish to do 100%, it gets rather tedious.  Speaking of completion, in the SFC version, there wasn't really an incentive to do all of the levels, and unless you were making a map, it was hard anyway keeping track of what you've done.  That also didn't helped with trying to get the best times for replays, as it meant having to do the whole game each time to practice on that one late level.  Thankfully, the map and progression system for this Steam version got a major improvement, the game actually has a Practice Mode, which shows each doors and backpacks you've found, and allowed you to just keep trying for best times.  You still have to go through the classic mode to unlock stages, but that's completely fine.  There may be the occasionnal times when enemies respawn pretty much in you face, but that mostly happens through some very bad luck.  Overall, these issues doesn't make such a negative impact on the whole experience.\n\nAs briefly glossed over, it has a replay feature which, back in 1994, was very impressive, despite of the limited memory size, and the drafts using limited RAM.  In the Steam Version, there's a more friendly interface, more replays can now be saved, and you're no longer likely to lose some precious drafts due to RAM shortage (unless you close the game).  There are also leaderboards for the best times in levels, and the Steam Workshop to share replays.\n\nThe theme of the game is mostly about water locales, oversized aquatic animals, and a strange mixture of assets such as checkerboard tilings on platforms, school supplies and giant veggies in the backgrounds, and photorealistic backgrounds, giving the series a very unique, quirky flair.  The soundtrack is cheerful and enjoyable.\n\nI really want Umihara Kawase to get the acclaim it so deserves, this type of gameplay is rarely ever explored, let alone executed so well.  Mastering the controls is a commitment that I can assure you is well worth it.  Please, spread the word, this game deserves all the love it can get.", "timestamp_created": 1474691274, "timestamp_updated": 1511387270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540070", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23961962": {"recommendationid": "23961962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149146392", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501892429}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing it, you'll understand why it didn't leave Japan for twenty years.

Now the first game in the Umihara Kawase series is finally on steam and Umihara Kawase Shun (2nd game) is on it's way before the end of 2015. What a time to be alive.\n\nUmihara Kawase originally came out on the Super Famicom in December 1994 but never got a proper English release until 2015 when it was included as a bonus game with the PS Vita version of Sayonara (and now the PC version as a stand alone release). \n\nThe objective of this game is to go from the beginning of a stage and get to a door (sometimes there's 2 doors that you can choose from, the harder to reach one being a shortcut to later fields) via your trusty fishing rod and by that I mean you gotta grapple, swing and fling yourself across wacky platfoming levels all the while avoiding enemies (fish with legs and a boss or two) and using your crazy rubberband physics skills to get to the exit fast (if you want to speedrun or impress your friends). The game ends either when you run out of lives or you reach one of the final exit doors.\n\nBefore some levels, the game shows you a thing you can do to get through that level, either how to get across some gap or dealing with an enemy or just stuff to help you win at the game.\n\nI don't recommend playing this on keyboard as it has controller support and it feels much better imo playing any of the games in the series with a controller/handheld system. But if you can master keyboard controls then you're a pretty cool person.\n\nMusic is nice, pretty simple but catchy I guess.\n\nOne thing this game had going for it back when it first came out was the ability to save replays. That feature is still around but you also have leaderboards too so if you like leaderboard stuff then you're good to go.\n\nIt's easy to learn for most, a lifetime to master for some.

If you are looking for a game that doesn't try to wow you with fancy new paint job on a well known trite formula that you've seen two dozen times, then this is a game for you.\n* Have a strong dislike to fish and aquatic life forms?\n* Like sending a small child to cling off a cliff with a rubbery fish line and possibly let her descent to her death (repeatedly)?\n* Always felt tadpoles give birth to frogs and not the other way around?\nIf you answered yes to any of this questions go see a doctor but either way buy this game and play it, it's good.", "timestamp_created": 1446488578, "timestamp_updated": 1446488578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18837584": {"recommendationid": "18837584", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996299194", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446605847}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought it because because of the cute fishies.", "timestamp_created": 1446472467, "timestamp_updated": 1446472467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.334822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18834761": {"recommendationid": "18834761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014925671", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447248393}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]if your only experience with grappling rope based platformers is bionic commando, beware: you don't know nothin about swingin[/h1]\n\nthe original umihara kawase is one of the most deceptively cryptic and brutally punishing platformers ive ever played and under its cutsey aesthetic lies only deception, horror, and the judging eyes of strange aquatic life who will trot back and forth over your charred decimated remains after this rubbering action game is done with you\n\nits got everyones favorite waifu though so its super cool", "timestamp_created": 1446459999, "timestamp_updated": 1446460650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745468", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39112526": {"recommendationid": "39112526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034306697", "num_games_owned": 1089, "num_reviews": 477, "playtime_forever": 1738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1179, "last_played": 1515233688}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]A very difficult physics-based puzzle-platformer originally released exclusively in Japan on the Super Famicom and was included as an extra game in some of its sequels.[/b] The gameplay overall is still exactly the same as the SuFami version with many performance improvements. This Steam version in particular is supposedly closer to the Vita version. \n\nPlaying with a controller is strongly recommended if just for the facts that the keyboard controls take a bit to get used to in the menus & even in-game, and that I've never figured out how to rebind the keys if it's even possible.\nGraphics and sounds are exactly the same as the SuFami version if not extremely similar. The title of the game in the main menu and the entirety of the end-credits are in Japanese, but the rest of the game\u2014the important aspects\u2014are in English.\nThe music & theme of the game are pretty cheery, however they only lighten the mood a bit for the incredible difficulty in the gameplay.\nIt's not actually a hindrance, but for whatever reason, they decided to keep the interface such as the score & timer close to the middle of the screen just like in the SuFami version.\n\nThe game is simply about going through a level as a backpack-wearing girl in a very surreal, sea-themed environment to reach an exit door using a unique style of platforming where you swing around with a hook and rubber fishing line. The hook & line is also your only method of attacking. All the enemies are sea creatures of some kind and they can be hooked, often stunning them, and then \"captured\" if you touch them with the hook still on.\nIt isn't at all like other games with \"swinging\" mechanics; the elasticity of the fishing line can look simple on the outside, but actually using it takes skill. Its physics can be downright irritating to get the hang of because of how bouncy and confusing the rubber fishing line seems at first, but it can be manipulated and used to get through the game in unique ways. The only trouble is that it may take a while to even get a familiar grasp on how the mechanics work. There are only a few tutorials in the game that show you how you can use the fishing line, though they're all just basic techniques for getting through the first few levels. Everything else will have to be self-taught one way or another. Even watching walkthrough videos may likely not be helpful enough; it's one thing to see what someone does and how they pass an obstacle, it's another to actually execute what they do as simple as they may make it look.\nThe better you get with the the mechanics, the faster and more inventive you can be in getting through a level, and progression throughout the game absolutely requires you to improve.\nThere's a Practice Mode available for levels you've unlocked where you can practice a particular level as many times as you want. The only way to unlock more levels for Practice Mode is to reach them when doing a new playthrough.\n\nThe main goal of the game is to reach one of the \"Ending\" stages where the game's done when you beat said stages. There are 49 total levels\u2014or \"Fields\"\u2014in the entire game. They're numbered \"Field 0\" to \"Field 57\" but 9 of the numbers don't exist for some reason. It's actually impossible to go through all of them in one single playthrough. Field 2 can take you to Field 10, Field 11 can take you to Field 8, Field 15 to Field 40, 40 to 26, and so on, meaning that higher numbers don't necessarily mean you're closer to the end of the game.\nThe levels start off linear for the first few levels, but very shortly multiple exits will start to appear, which grants one of the game's non-linear styles of level progression. The basic gist of these multiple exits is that the harder it is to reach them, the harder the levels behind the doors usually are, and some of these exits are behind some serious skill-walls. This can lead to immense frustration without the right knowledge of how the physics work.\nWithout memorization or a map of some kind, there's no way to know what level is behind the next door.\n\nEach new playthrough starts you off with 10 lives, which can easily vanish due to the game's difficulty. Extra lives, in the form of backpacks, can only be acquired in specific Fields in specific locations, often behind skill-walls themselves. Acquiring them and then dying doesn't respawn them. \nThere's a timer for each stage, usually around 5 minutes. If you've spent over 30 minutes in a playthrough and haven't reach an Ending Field by that point, then the next exit you take will take you to one of the 4 Ending Fields. One of the Ending Fields can only be accessed this way; depending on the player's skill and choice in doors, they'll probably come across the secret Field naturally anyway.\nThere's no real ending to the game. All the \"Ending\" doors just brings up the untranslated credits and then the game's over.\n\nThere are a few bosses in the game and only 2 that you have to \"fight\", but the rest are pretty much just about surviving until they leave or they make the exit door accessible; one of those bosses isn't even a real boss anyway as all it does is attack and gets in your way, like a giant, barely mobile attack-sentry.\n\nOverall, the game's just a test of one's skill. There's no real story as far as I know since reaching an Ending just brings up the credits. Successful playthroughs don't often take more than an hour.\nThere's not actually a whole lot to do aside from unlocking all of the levels and doing the achievements. It's great for those who want a serious challenge and a unique style of platforming.", "timestamp_created": 1515232436, "timestamp_updated": 1515233776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

Games like this start out with a gameplay loop that, on its own, should be no more captivating than tiddlywinks but build up something far more worthwhile around it. And it's not a long and engrossing experience that I've just surfaced from, but working through the simple, unique puzzles for the mysterious payoff made simian.interface++ a better gaming experience than many longer or larger titles out there.\n\nThe name is actually spot-on this time, as the game is posed as a graphic user interface for monkeys. You play a test subject working through trials of the system, simply following the implied instructions for a curved and yellow reward you know too well. Puzzles come in batches of 10 or so, bookended by login screens and performance readouts. I doubt I need to worry about spoilers here but things start to happen as you work through the game that hint at a larger plot afoot.\n\nDon't come for what little story there is, but rather the experience of seeing it told. While not much happens plot-wise the feel of how it unfolds has a definite charm, situated right between sinister cyberpunk and silly cat pictures. I found myself speeding through the puzzles just to see how ridiculous the next glitchy reveal would be, and I was not disappointed. The presentation helps sell the technicolor madness, particularly the soundtrack which is some incredibly catchy techno that takes loads of inspiration from old NES chiptunes.\n\nI'm four paragraphs in and haven't even touched on the puzzles, which are clever permutations of an old gimmick. Each puzzle places a number of squares or lines or boxes on your screen, which you can move and/or rotate simply by moving your mouse. The goal is to snap them back into place, anything from getting a white square into a square outline to realigning a screenful of plaid. They're simple challenges made surprisingly engrossing by how much fine control you have over the figures. You'll also encounter a wide variety of shapes and patterns to make across the six tiny chapters of the game, and more still in the infinite, timed, and secret modes.\n\nThis is the total package in terms of kitschy puzzlers, but a small one at that. I saw everything the game had to offer, secret level included, in just over 30 minutes. The infinite and time attack modes could suck up some more of your time, of course, and I wouldn't be opposed to playing through it again once my memories of the two runs I just did (to unlock the secret mode) fade a bit more. With that caveat in mind, I can happily recommend simian.interface++ to anyone looking for a fresh new take on puzzlers. It's got charm, it's got challenge, and it's got the best kind of weirdness to puzzle through.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

For me, there\u2019s something soothing about them. A puzzle which while light, you can really sink your teeth into. Once you have finished the puzzle, there is a reward, you\u2019ve made a little picture of a boat, or a church. I enjoy light, fun puzzles that you can do in quick succession.\n\nThat is probably why I like this game so much.\n\n[i]simian.interface++[/i] is a puzzle game where you have to align the shapes on the screen just so. As you move the mouse, the view and alignment of the pieces change until you find \u201cthe spot\u201d and complete the level. To quote the steam page,  \u201c[i]simian.interface++[/i] presents challenges that must be solved using pattern recognition, intuition, and experimentation. \u201c Because I cannot say it any better myself. \n\nThe concept itself is fluid and intuitive enough that you pick it up straight away. Even the mind chipped monkey you play as can do it. Some of the puzzles can come off as slightly finicky, but never truly frustrating. The only annoyance I saw was the large and distracting \u201cFOCUS LOST\u201d text flashes that up on the screen if you dare to move the cursor too far towards the sidelines. I am not sure why this is needed, if the focus is still on the game window it is probably fair to say we are still playing the game. We can abstract that we have gone wrong by the fact that the pieces are no longer moving on screen.\n\nWhile the story mode is interesting enough in itself, it is over and done with in roughly 20 minutes. The real replay value is found in the infinite_loop mode where new levels are procedurally generated* for your pleasure. You can casually play through levels to your hearts content. If you long for the immortal glory of leaderboards and a sense of progress, timed_evaluation challenges you to beat as many random levels as you can in a minute. Any chill this game may have is thrown out the window here as you frantically panic about the screen, finding the desired pattern before the time runs out.\n\nThe presentation of the whole product is very appealing; [i]simian.interface++[/i] is very minimalistic in its aesthetic. The simplification down to bold block colours and sharp shapes regularly lead to some very interesting patterns. Note! Put together a excellent chiptune soundtrack for simian.interface++ that is very enjoyable to listen to in its own right and really adds to the experience.\n\n[i]simian.interface++[/i] is a unique puzzle game that is both at home being something you can play absentmindedly on infinite_loop mode or trying to beat your personal best on timed_evaluation mode. The story mode is somewhat lacking, but I would argue it is not the main attraction here. If you played the original [i]simian.interface[/i] years ago and feel you\u2019ve seen it all already then it\u2019s more of the same, make of that what you will. The only additions from the original are the infinite_loop and timed_evaluation modes, which are still very welcome insertions. For the people seeing it for the first time, however, you are in for a treat.\n\nIt also makes cracking wallpapers if you are quick enough with the screenshot key.\n\n*Procedurally generated is probably in some drinking game somewhere.

I thought I'd be ok with the change in protagonist but ultimately this comes off as a shallow reunion tour that I just can't stay motivated to play. In retrospect I didn't play the first two for the plot or the game mechanics. Honestly it wasn't that original for someone that's consumed way too much Japanese fiction. What engaged me was the characters. Now this game seems to gate the reintroduction of these characters with a pretty linear dungeon crawl of sorts. What?

Honestly, this doesnt compare to any of the other two games in any way.\n\nMechanics are exactly the same except for a new chain art which is completely unecessary and more novelty than anything. The main story is very sparce and you literally get miniscule crumbs until about 3/4 of the way through where the MCs actually start talking about their past. The logic of the \"new world\" that is the whole game makes absolutely no sense and is completely different to the logic in their \"real world\". The main path is completely linear, with the side stuff just simply flashbacks regarding certain characters. That concept is nice and all, but it's unecessary, all novelty, add tiny pinches of extra character, and literally doubles the play time. \n\nThe stakes of the final boss and ultimate quest seem very small compared to the other two games, mostly because you never really see the effects of what will happen to the real world should your party fail.\n\nThe maps and locations are mostly taken from the other two games with minor tweaks to their layout, mostly with no change whatsoever. Music is also mostly the same, with i think only 2 new tracks (which are still really good like the rest of the soundtrack). The main path is actually so straightforward that you know, and the characters in the game know, exactly of what's gonna happen at which specific point, even up until the very end. \n\nIn the end, this game does what it's originally intended to do, to provide slight closure to the characters in the other two games while expanding the story of Kevin Graham.

Although I have seen this game described as a seperate entity from the others in the series and that it can be enjoyed by itself, I strongly disagree. With that said, you're probably here because you finished the 2nd game and want more. \n\nThis game takes a different direction than the others. There's no more open world; the entire game is a dungeon crawler. The story now focuses on Kevin Graham and his friend Ries. The playable character roster is now much larger and characters can be swapped out at will, with the exception of mandatory characters for that chapter or scene. The main story focuses on Kevin and his past but I believe the real meat of the game is in the Sun, Moon, and Star doors. \n\nThese are shining doors found throughout the game which can be opened when the proper criteria is met, as in bringing along the correct character or having a certain item in your inventory. Once opened, you may have to fight or play a mini game, but all doors contain what's known as memory fragments which allow you to view scenes from a character's past. It is through these doors that many lingering questions from the 2nd game are answered.\n\nThere is some surprisingly dark subject matter which is dealt with tactfully. I was impressed with the bravery of the creators to include such topics and their respectful way of dealing with them.\n\nI agree with some others that this is the weakest game in the series. It feels shorter than the other games. I was disappointed that they took away the open world. Also, since the game's big selling point is the cutscenes and memory fragments, I was sad that Kevin's cutscenes were drawn so poorly. Especially considering the fact that they were redrawn for the Vita and not the PC version. Ries seems rushed as a character and I know they could have done better. She's meant to be the deuteragonist but she's just so boring and lacks depth. I also experienced some very noticable stuttering which I didn't have in the first 2 games. I fixed it by going to the configuration setup of the game and changing the frame limiter from automatic to 60 fps. This made it playable for me but there were times that it still felt off.\n\nWith all that said, I'm glad I played this and none of the negatives made me disappointed in the game overall. I'm glad I was able to complete my Trails in the Sky experience this way.

I DO care about story and characters but gameplay and replay values are video game cores. If you're hardcore to story then you should read novels and if you're hardcore to voice actors then watch animes or dramas..\n\nI can say that 3rd is the best gameplay design in whole Trails/Kiseki series, at least the one that released in English (one can argue Zero/Ao are better). Many people dislike the dungeon crawler design for this game structure that unique to other games in whole series but there are things to consider from Falcom to design future games for this series:\n\n- Memory doors are actually one of good sidequests that It's not MISSABLE until final dungeon. \n- The dungeons do not contain trash puzzles or tedious things to do.. Oh and it's not random generated in case people don't realize..\n- Mini games are not trash despite some of them can troll you...\n\nNow the challenge is how to apply that on OPEN WORLD system? As much as people like the structures of FC for other games you can't deny the flaws of this series: Missables, Tedious Tasks,and Mini games. The 3rd for some reason can minimize those flaws under dungeon crawler structure, even compared to say SMT/Persona games....\n\nThe real secret of gameplay is how battle system turned fun with 16 playable characters to test your creativity. Returning characters get upgraded and new playable characters are *broken*. Even Josette can be viable (people just hate her and don't know how to build her). Nightmare Mode is not easy but also can be piece of cake once you figure out what to do or manipulating what enemies do. Still it's best Nightmare Mode to play compared to FC, SC, and Cold Steel to date, although in most time thanks to Kevin being MC you can have emergency Grail Spheres saving your live hundred times.. \n\nLastly, with Sara added turbo mode it adds replayability in fast way and I like it..\n\nOverall, I won't deny it if you're not get satisfied with the story even though it will help you to play Crossbell arc and getting reference on Cold Steel arc.

If you are caught by this unaware and enter the final dungeon with party members you haven't touched all game, many enemies will be capable of one-shotting your earliest party members. Keep in mind, even if you survive that, you have a big boss fight for them to defeat at the end.[/spoiler]\n\nAll in all, despite dungeon flaws and some issues with the large playable cast execution, Trails in the Sky the 3rd is a worthy send off to an excellent RPG series.

Adding guard, deathblow and vanish to the battle bonus effects makes you actually have to pay attention to them, but combat is otherwise a rehash of SC with higher numbers.  There are some new party members, but they don't bring anything new tactically.  Status effects are useless against most bosses, again, because they all resist everything.  Earth wall is still OP, and very few opponents will use it or Genesic Barrier.  Loewe's bark is still worse than his bite.  You get to fight some characters hyped up in previous games, but they're kind of pushovers.  I played on Normal mode and didn't have to grind at all so don't worry about your character levels.\n\nDungeons are a pastiche of previously visited locations and lack the open world feel of the previous games; there are almost no NPCs except the party members not in your team, chillaxing at the End of Time, and very little in the way of character interaction outside of the scripted sequences which you view in the doors. \n\nI want to protect Renne's smile though.

This game is not for you.\n\nIf you have played the Trails in the Sky duology, you're almost certainly going to buy this game no-questions asked. Which is fine. Clearly you are a person of impeccable taste and judgment. There are, however, a few things you should probably be aware of before you dive it.\n\nThe 3rd is not really an indpendent game in its own right--it's more of a Gaiden game. It functions mostly as an extended epilogue to the classic Trails in the Sky duology, while also laying down the foundations for future story arcs (upon which much has been built in the Crossbell and Erebonia sequences).\n\nThe game is effectively divided into three kinds of content: lots of dungeon crawling; mostly indpendent character scenes (taking the form of flashbacks) featuring familiar characters from the prior two Sky games; and mini-games! The dungeon-crawling is fairly generic, as the combat system here is more or less the same as in the prior games, and many of the environments you'll be exploring are the exact *same* environments you explored back in FC and SC. There are some new areas to explore, but not many, and personally I found them too abstract to be very interesting. The mini-games are extremely varied and range from incredibly tedious (playin' poker with Gambler Jack) to the amazing (airship shmup!), and can be a lot of fun. The real meat of the game are the character vignettes, all of which are--at the very least--amusing. If you're here, you've likely already fallen in love with these characters, and you'll be glad to know that everyone gets their time in the spotlight here, and the character writing is as strong as ever.\n\nThat said, not everything is sunshine and roses.There is a \"present\" story arc tying all of those flashbacks, dungeons and mini-games together. and... there's no getting around it: it's not very good. The story is short and relatively predicable, with little dialog and less exposition. Our new protagonist, Kevin Graham, performs solidly here--but fails to be quite as interesting as he was in SC--and his lovely lady heroine, Ries Argent, is among the least compelling characters in the entire Trails pantheon, owing mostly to her lack of screenstime. She is absent from entire swaths of the game, and despite her enormous potential, simply does not get sufficient dialog to properly develop. She really only interacts with Kevin, infrequently, and is isolated from the rest of the cast.\n\nUtlimately Trails in the Sky: The 3rd is a bit underwhelming. It's a fun romp, but it could have been so much better with a little more focus on the narrative. The absence of NPCs to talk to, the simplistic structure of the plot, and the underdeveloped heroine are all flaws that are difficult to dismiss.", "timestamp_created": 1502400025, "timestamp_updated": 1502400025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688840", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34144875": {"recommendationid": "34144875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198234246084", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511932556}, "language": "english", "review": "Another amazing game from Falcom, and even better localization by XSEED.

That could be a downside of the game, but Falcom was very clever to add the \"doors\" mechanic, that you can use to see what happened to many different characters after the events of SC (this works by showing the memories of each character).

Difficulty feels just right. \n+ Writing continues to amaze. \n+ Character development has always been a strong point for Trails. This has not changed. \n+ A large amount of playable characters to choose from. \n+ Music! New and Old! \n+ The Moon/Star doors. I'm reluctant to even call them Side quests. DO NOT MISS THESE! Some of them are incredibly important to the overall plot, while others do a great job of fleshing out events from the first two games. \n\n\n[b]Cons -[/b]\n- Majority of the game is made up of reused areas from the first two games. Several of them end up feeling lifeless due to the lack of NPC's.  \n- Being forced to only use 4 characters at once. It's torture! \n- I could have done without the mini games (The Sun Doors). Would have preferred more Plot in the form of Moon/Star Doors. The arena mini game was nice though. \n\n\nTrails TC is an epilogue to the first two games, wraps everything up very nicely, and sets up for the \"Crossbell Arc\".

The game started out pretty awesome.  It was obvious fairly fast that this would be a crawl through one dungeon, but the first floor was really fun and I was enjoying the combat and the pacing.  The game stopped proceeding at an enjoyable clip, however, as I accumulated more characters and unlocked more side stories, many of which suffered from dragging on, forcing me to explore areas and dungeons that I had already done in both the first and second games, or had me build up characters who were only in that particular side story.  Also, unlike the first floor, many areas of the overarching dungeon were just areas from the first 2 games, which I had already explored twice.\n\nThere were many times when I couldn't wait to just be done with this game, but when it's good, it's really good, like the other games from the series.  Building up parties from the huge cast of characters, with plenty of high-level gems available and plenty of skills already unlocked, is really fun when exploring new areas with new content.  If the whole game had been like that, this game would be easy to recommend.  Also, this game had a considerable amount of buildup that I'm sure is relevant to the next 2 games in series, which are currently not available in English or even licensed at all.  I would have felt more excited for all the foreshadowing and buildup that occurs in this game if I had a reason to believe I would ever be able to play the next 2 games.\n\nOne last thing that really helped me decide to recommend this game is the music.

Aside from having the best gameplay/battles out of all 3 games, the memory doors scattered throughout provide amazing backstories; some heartwarming, some with expanded lore of Zemuria, and some heartwrenching.

Everything involving Estelle, Joshua, and everyone else is resolved, mostly. The bulk of this game's main story is Father Kevin and Ries Argent's past.\n\nThis game's main purpose is basically to send off the characters for their final endings not to mention put closure to events taking place with other npcs. These bits of memories and sidestory are locked behind Moon, Star, and Sun doors. Opening these doors have some prerequisites involved but it's nothing too cryptic. You'll learn mostly what the characters you know have been doing in the past half of a year following the events of sky 2, as well as some other sidestory or past experiences that some of the characters had for character development. \n\nPrepare yourself bracer! This is the end! You will also know EVERYTHING about EVERYONE.\n\nYou also know a RPG knows how to put closure when the treasure chests start encouranging you to reach the end, wishing you luck, and all that stuff.\n\nGameplay? Still the same, with an extra twist, there's new AT window bonuses. Rush, Guard, and Death. Rush is your spell is cast instantly, or you can attack twice in the same turn. Guard is your attack on that turn does no damage. Death is your next physical attack has 100% deathblow but don't get carried away, it's not going to be a free kill if the monster has insta-death immunity.\n\nBefore I say my last two cents combined with some memorable final words I need to give some warnings out.\n\nIn the wise but oft-abused memes of World of Warcraft...\n\nYOU [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=963774555]ARE[/url] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=963774576]NOT[/url] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=963774598]PREPARED[/url]...\n\nFOR WHAT AWAITS AT CHAPTER 7!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNO ONE IS PREPARED!!!\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=963807586]I didn't want to get out of bed for a week[/url] after I finished that chapter!!!! 0_________________0;\n\nYou need no other reasons or other info.\n\nBUY.\nFINISH.\nand put closure to this marvelous introduction to Nihon Falcom's \"The Legend of Heroes\" franchise.\n\n[spoiler]Introduction? \n\nYes, introduction. \n\nFor liberl, it's over and done with but if you saw Star Door 14 and the 7-8 references to another nation called \"Crossbell\" you will realize...\n\nthat this...is truly and only the beginning...[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1499384110, "timestamp_updated": 1499399543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33251435": {"recommendationid": "33251435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095925279", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499166719}, "language": "english", "review": "I am writing this review as someone who has gone through the stories of all three Trails in the Sky games, as well as 90% through the two currently released Trails of Cold Steel games.  This is an important point, as it is part of why this game had such a signifigant impact for me.\n\nTrials in the Sky 3rd, while not as strong by itself as SC (Which is now my favorite game, hands down, no exceptions), is a great connecting piece for what is to come in the series, and a fantastic look into the inner workings of some of the old AND new characters that show up within the game.  Kevin Graham and his squire Ries Argent are the biggest examples of this, as these two go from relatively unknown characters to VERY fleshed out people throughout the course of the game as their past is laid bare for all to see.  The world of 3rd is a large dungeon-like area, which threw me off for a good while, but did not necessarily take away from the bigger picture.  It made the stakes feel a bit higher in fact, as you explore the illusionary world of Phantasma to find out what is going on.\n\nThe big draw for me though was the Memory Doors.  For those who haven't played, the Memory Doors are doors scattered throughout the game (25 total, though a few have multiple events) that contain mini stories about that certain characters' lives.  For an example, there is one particular door showing how Scherazard became a senior bracer, and her final job before this happens - while also showing a bit of Aina's - the guild receptionist from Rolent - past.\nOthers, like Prince Olivert's final moments in Liberl, show events that took place between SC and 3rd.  This one I just mentioned in particular, as well as several other plot points and doors, set up for what is going to happen in Trails of Cold Steel, and some of the plot points are first revealed within this game.  This fact REALLY helped me appreciate 3rd and its story, even if I feel that it is overshadowed by SC in almost every other aspect.\n\nSo, with that, I recommend this game to any who have played the first two, or the Trails of Cold Steel.  Many of the things that happen in that subseries are introduced here, and this helps shed some light on what brought them about.  I would highly recommend though, if you haven't already, play through the first two of the Trails in the Sky games first, as they are fantastic games!", "timestamp_created": 1499207739,

for some RPG to spend some time on. A game by the name of Trails in the Sky caught my eye, so I decided to try it out. I wasn\u2019t prepared for this series to completely blow me out of the water and change my outlook and give me so many new possibilities of the awesome world of Falcom. After the ending of FC, I scoured the internet to figure out when the sequel of this great game I just played would come. Sadly, it seemed that it would never come, through a series of events that could only be described as Murphy\u2019s Law. About a year later, Trails in the Sky Second Chapter came out in English. This game again blew me out of the waters due to its amazing characterization and world building. I played Trails of Cold Steel I+II on the PS3 in the meantime. Then finally, around a year and a half after SC was launched, Trails in the Sky the Third, the final game in the \u2018Sky\u2019 arc of the Trails series, and I have to say, it is definitely the best.\n \nFirstly, this is the Third game of the Sky series, and not much will make sense if you start here. [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/251150/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_in_the_Sky/] Trails in the Sky First Chapter [/url] is the place to start. The Third is pretty different from the average JRPG, and certainly different to the normal Trails game. It could best be described as \u201cdungeon crawler\u201d but that doesn\u2019t do it justice. The Third mostly takes place in one giant area called Phantasma, and it includes doors that when opened with the right character or situation, will grant a memory fragment. These memory fragments are essentially huge amounts of development for characters and the world around them, and it wraps up well on how everyone is doing after the events of SC. There is so much more that gets explored in Phantasma, but it\u2019s hard to include what they are without spoilers. The only negative here is that there are much fewer chances to talk to NPCs, but inter party interactions rise up. Battles are in the same grid system as the first two, and plays similarly to SC, but with a few new arts added in. It\u2019s nice, fun, and difficult at the higher difficulties. The Third's difficulty is [i]juuuust right[/i]. SC had some pretty bad difficulty spikes, especially in the beginning of the game, but the Third hits the spot of being difficult, but not too difficult in certain areas, and is generally a much more internally balanced game than FC or SC between characters.\n \nWith the end of SC, it is also the end of Estelle and Joshua\u2019s main story, but they do appear as side characters in the Third as well. Instead we have Kevin Graham, the somewhat mysterious Gralsritter Dominion of the Septian Church. It\u2019s hard to go into explaining him without spoiling anything, but he has quite a few secrets up his sleeve. Also with him is the newly appointed Knight, Ries Argent, a childhood friend of Kevin\u2019s. She\u2019s probably one of the few characters I could complain about, but that was mainly due to her being one of the few new characters and without the development of previous games. Luckily, by the end she is definitely a very dear character. Kevin and Reis gain much of their development through the main story, where the rest of the original cast is farther looked upon in the doors. \n \nSpeaking of the doors, they also offer insight on the continent of Zemuria as a whole, and bring up some plot points that come up in later Trails games. \n \nThe Third has much darker tones than the other Trails games. Chapter 7 as a whole and star door 15 were absolutely beautiful, in a horrifying and depressing way.\n \nThe music is up to Falcom\u2019s high standards, and I\u2019d argue it has the best soundtrack out of all the Sky games. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to overdose on that heavenly bliss?\n \nXSEED\u2019s translations are amazing as always, and they didn\u2019t even censor a scene that could've been. Thumbs up here.\n \nAll the things I love about the Trails series is here; lovable characters, excellent and detailed storytelling/worldbuilding/writing, awesome soundtrack. I could gush on about how some random NPC mentions a jewelry store in a city in Erebonia, in which game was made 6 years in the future, or that the literature of the game has some surprising backstory to them, or the cynical, sarcastic, 4th wall breaking, or reference creating empty chest quotes. Thank you Falcom and XSEED for this fun ride of a series.\n \nI hope Trails to Zero and Azure can be localized, but that will require these games to get good sales. Please at least try out Trails in the Sky First Chapter, or Trails of Cold Steel, coming soon to Steam. I\u2019d appreciate it.", "timestamp_created": 1498805699, "timestamp_updated": 1511398071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33020033": {"recommendationid": "33020033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115524144", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 17834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499214631}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great game to the series.

This is the short attention span summary of my review: Bringing back the same battle system, assets, and locales for a third outing could be seen as squeezing as much blood from the stone as Falcom possibly can. And JRPG fans especially are frequently subjected to filler for the purposes of extending an experience. However, The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd manages to retread familiar ground without making players feel like they are wasting their time. The new dungeon crawler-like format helps to keep the experience fresh, while the many optional story scenes are worth seeking out if only to see what your favorite characters have been up to lately. Kevin Graham manages to be interesting enough to carry the bulk of the narrative and the stellar localization helps drive this home further. If you\u2019ve done everything there is to do in the first two Trails in the Sky games, then you probably have this game in your library already. Anyone still on the fence about the new format or question whether they\u2019d indulge in yet another game with this characters, I will say this much: I hate games, especially RPG\u2019s, that I feel like are wasting my time with inconsequential quests and exposition.

Sound kinda lame? It's actually great. The events of this game may not directly connect to the overall story of zemuria but the smaller character focused stories do a phenominal job of connecting to larger conflicts, providing more character development, and leading into future games. The dungeon crawling set up also manages to change up the pacing in a way that is a welcome change after much of the pacing of SC felt similar to FC.

There is something more behind the Name Kevin Graham. In 3rd Chapter you're trying to find out, what's the Story Sequel after Finishing SC.\n\nThird Chapter is more like a \"big Expansion pack\", which is NOT bad at all! Through your journey there are:\n\n5(6) - Moon Doors\n15 - Star Doors\n5 - Sun Doors\n\nEvery Single one of them included a Special Detail of a Story Part you discovered through First Chapter and Second Chapter.\nFor Example:\n\nAfter finishing SC, Tita tells Agate, that he has to visit her at the end of each month and Agate accept her invitation.\nOne of those doors is exactly about that. So no matter what you're doing you'll find yourself in MUCH Flashbacks and I LOVE that so damn much.\nI, for myself, discovered every single one of them, becuase I want to know what's happening.\nSome Doors on the other Hands, are completely new and offer a Mini-Game for example.\n\nThe Main aspect of the Third Chapter is the main story tho, but I would suggest to open every Single one of them and fulfill their requirements.\n\nWhile the story is the star of the show, the game shines in other areas, too. The combat system is a turn-based system that borrows a lot from JRPGs that were typical of the era, but it adds in a tactical, grid-based positioning system, and each character's abilities are fairly customizeable. The game also has multiple difficulty settings, and if a particular fight is too hard for you, there's a handy option to retry fights that also temporarily lowers the difficulty level. The game's soundtrack is also great; it's exactly what you'd expect from the same developer who created the critically acclaimed Ys series or FC / SC.\n\nReally the only complaint I could make is that the graphics are a bit dated by modern standards, but hey, it's a ten-year-old Japanese PC game. They still do their job as intended, and you're going to enjoy the game enough that you won't care.\n\nAt last, some players may wonder about the game hour of this game. Well, it varies according to player style. On average, it should be around 40 hours. However, if you attempts to find out all secrets, exploring the hidden area and trigger hidden events, and read all NPC dialogues whenever the game world changes, then expect the game will be as long as 70 hours or even more. Why not clock in more hours with it? It is a game with lots of attention to details, which is one of the standard of high quality RPG.\n\nHope this help some users wondering why this game has so much praise.", "timestamp_created": 1497528940, "timestamp_updated": 1497529029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 223, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.922884", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32407728": {"recommendationid": "32407728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118728256", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495012007}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice conclusion of the sky trilogy!

Because of this, it lacks a couple of the things that caused fans to love the first two Sky games. That would be because this game has no board side quests or open world exploration; it has been described as a \"dungeon crawler\" of sorts. The game is set in an alternate dimension called Phantasma, which is influenced by the thoughts and emotions of those inside it, and therefore recreates replicas of many iconic areas from the original games as devil-filled dungeons, treasure and all (which seems to me like a very convenient excuse to lazily reuse maps from the earlier games...). That's not necessarily a bad thing, though - it still maintains the two aspects that cause the Trails series to shine so bright among almost all other JRPGs - its soundtrack and storytelling.\n\nAn interesting mechanic introduced in this series is the concept of \"memory doors\". The party will periodically find magical doors hidden throughout the dungeons, which tell a riddle or offer a challenge in order to open. Upon solving the riddle/defeating the challenge, it will play a \"memory fragment\", which is essentially a long cutscene based around one particular character or story aspect, adding additional depth to the existing characters' development as well as introducing new plot points to be expanded on later.\n\nThe 3rd is also a bit odd as it shifts focus from the main characters Estelle and Joshua Bright to a party member introduced in SC, the wandering priest Kevin Graham. The game focuses on him as he and his companions descend deeper into the heart of Phantasma, uncovering the mysteries of the dimension and bringing his tragic past to light in the process. The 3rd's storyline is also noticeably darker than the original games, which were relatively lighthearted in comparison. One particular memory door stands out to me as a testament to the game's change in tone, that being Star Door 15 (the implications of that memory combined with the music choice is extremely creepy and depressing at the same time, and the fact that it centered around my favorite character was a little heartbreaking).\n\nThere were also some minor edits to the combat system. The EP costs of some arts were changed, cooldown timers were adjusted for certain arts and crafts, and a few new turn bonuses were added. The elements of time, space, and mirage also are now relevant in battle, as enemies will have resistances and weaknesses to these elements, as opposed to the standard earth/fire/water/wind (which means you can't spam Dark Matter on shining poms to kill them anymore as they resist it now...)\n\nTrails in the Sky the 3rd is a very linear game, going from dungeon to dungeon with next to no sidequests at all - all side missions and activities are achieved through the memory doors. One of the things that I liked about this particular game is that it allows you an extremely high amount of party variety - at the end of the game, you will be able to mix and match your party from 16 possible party members. However, getting the mira and sepith required to gear up all these characters is rather taxing on your budget, so you are forced to choose wisely what you buy and who you give it to. Finally, it is noticeable more difficult than the previous games, so you actually have to have an idea of what you are doing to make reasonable progress.\n\nWhile some Trails fans have stated that the 3rd is significantly worse than the first two games and is an unnecessary addition that does not need to be played, I beg to differ, as it has proven itself to actually be my personal favorite amongst the three. It wraps up the plot of the Sky games very well, and has left me very anxious for the following Crossbell arc to be translated. Sure, you don't get to go exploring or do entertaining side quests often, but the slight difficulty spike, additions to the OST, and myriad of interesting dungeons and bosses make this one a must-buy for any Trails fans. If you've played and enjoyed the first two games, there is absolutely no reason not to pick up this one as well, for while it may not have all of the charm that FC and SC had, it still maintains the excellent storytelling that defines Trails and manages to cement itself as one of the best JRPGs on the market. I cannot praise the Trails in the Sky series enough, and wholeheartedly recommend it to any fan of JRPGs or story-based games.\n\nCuteness is justice!", "timestamp_created": 1497163238, "timestamp_updated": 1497163625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32304745": {"recommendationid": "32304745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045946288", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512776366}, "language": "english", "review": "Bittersweet conclusion to this wonderful trilogy. Nice to see the old cast together as well as the addition of new ones. Music is amazing as usual.

It was interesting to see what the cast and the NPCs were up to and tying up the story of the Liberl Arc overall. These doors also shared interesting facts, information connecting to the other countries and their arcs.

As a fan who pretty much memorized a certain portion of the dialogue of the first 2 games I can safely say this is the perfect way to finish this sub series. I was worried this game would have no built up to it because of its way of telling its story and the change to a more dungeon crawling style. I am happy to say that wasn't the case. While playing this game I saw just how much built up was to this game. If you have basic knowledge of the first 2 you will enjoy your time but if you are like me and certain dialogues sticked to your head then this will be a fantastic experience. From Renne to Kevins backstory , from Kloe to Oliviers awesomness , this game has TONS of moments where you will laugh , feel good , feel sad and depressed. Its not just the stories themselves but the way they are told (ESPECIALLY Renne's story , that was a genius way of telling it). It also brilliantly set ups for the future games  (try to read between the lines).\n\nIn terms of gameplay like I just mentioned its more dungeon crawly but this is Falcom we are talking about here. If you have ever played the Y's games (specifacly Origin) you will know that Falcom is really convinnient when it comes to the stuff working in the game. You can literally teleport to any area you want whether using the statues or the doors as a target (just select and boom you are there , you can also take the long route if you want :D).\nThe battle system has been upgraded just like how it happened with the second game. You have more turn bonusses (which makes stealing turns even more satisfying), more arts (which are balanced slightly) and more quartz (I swear there is like a quartz for everything in this game , just with their side effects you can create a superhuman). \nSo yeah overall when it comes to the gameplay its really solid and convinnent. Also don't worry you still have your optional dialogue not just with the doors but with your companions in the main resting area too (I would literally spend 10 mins getting all the possible dialogues in the garden because depending on your combination you will get different dialogue).\n\nThe music....I mean COME ON! This is falcom we are talking about here. It is FANTASTIC!! I can see why a lot of people considers to be the best in the series (I need a few more listens though just to compare). \n\nSoooo yeah that just the gist of it. Trust me I can talk about this game for HOURS but you might as well have your own experience. I highly recomment this game if you are a fan of the franchise. Honestly its only fault is its greatest strenght which is the fact that it belongs to a great and detailed series with LOTS OF character developement and dialogue. I can't really recomment this if you are not a fan of the franchise. You can still enjoy it cause the gameplay is solid and the experience while wouldn't be as powerfull , can be still great imo.\n\nEasily my favorite game of the year.

That doesn't mean, however, that the story is not a large point in this installment. However, much of it is setup for the next arc of games (Zero no Kiseki and Ao no Kiseki which are currently not localized). The other big part is focusing on everybody's favorite party member (in personaility and in usefullness of his S-craft for Nightmare difficulty), Kevin. Estelle and Joshua are in this game, but they aren't the MCs like in the other games.

I give credit for The Third for swapping the of main characters to tell a more unique story from the other 2 games. As with all the games the characters are good and memorable but the story in my opinion is the weakest in the trilogy.\n\nThat's not to say there isn't lore and a good background for it all, because there is, but the fact that most the core game is just this bizzare sceneario involving a what is essentially a dungeon [spoiler]that mimics the real world and has some rules about the characters dreams/expectations[/spoiler] just leaves me wishing for something a bit more grounded in [spoiler]Zemuria[/spoiler]. \n\nThat aside: gameplay is at some of it's best here for the most part. You can fast travel to all parts of the game for most of it. There's a great selection of characters to make use of. Extensive party management, fair amount of areas to explore with numerous side objectives containing backstories, lore, and mini-games. The game also ups the challenge more than before with a lot of the challenge from with character management and use. \n\nAll considered I'd recommend The Third to most players of Trails in the Sky.

The first thing I'll say is I don't think I've felt quite as great while playing this one, even if I did come rather close - this one is also solid and enjoyable. But let's get to the details, shall we.\n\nUnlike the first two games, this one doesn't deal with a large and wide-spreading plot, but is rather a personal journey of one Kevin Graham, Fifth Dominion of the Gralsritter of the Septian Church. You might remember this fellow from the second game where he spent most of his time being an easy-going shameless flirt, until the very end, and that's when a glimpse into his true nature could be had. Well, Trails the 3rd builds up on that, and you'll see a very changed Kevin Graham at the end.\n\nNow partnered with an old friend and sister figure, Sister Ries Argent, the two need to figure out just why the hell things turned out the way they did, and along the way, you'll be joined by many characters you know and love, and maybe some you don't. You'll also end up fighting against some of them. And some of those you learned to hate, of course. After all, the main characters of this tale are tightly linked with each other, and it's only inevitable for them to eventually run into each other again...while meeting a bunch of new ones.\n\nThe gameplay is largely the same as in Second Chapter, with an addition of a \"support\" party member - a fifth person that won't tag along with you, but will give you a combination of bonuses (and sometimes a malus) as long as you have them in support role. The bonus can be anything from extra attack power to extra sepith drops from enemies. Other than that, the gameplay is largely the same, except that thanks to all the gear you will no doubt abscond with on your jouney, spamming S-crafts and S-breaks is even easier than ever. Not that it's going to help you on a couple of those seriously messed up fights you're running into, mind.\n\nThe main plot of this game is a rather straight-forward dungeon crawl in order to get out of the sticky situation you find yourself in, but it's the optional content (located in \"doors\" scattered throughout the place) where the storytelling and worldbuilding really shines. Ever wondered how Scherazard became a full-fledged bracer? Ever wondered if there's more to Olivier than the fun-loving, irresponsible rascal that he is? Ever wondered just what Renne's deal is? Now you can find out, and plenty of those side-stories open up new horizons, and foreshadow the games to come, and clear up some of the past happenings that have only been mentioned in passing in the first two games.\n\nTrails in the Sky the 3rd also hits us with several new awesome music tracks, but at this point, I simply consider \"Nihon Falcom has awesome music in their games\" a fact as mundane as \"seawater is salty\". No but seriously, you can't not love The Crimson Stigma track. \n\nObviously this one has minigames too. Fishing, gambling, and arena fights are known to you from the first two games, likely, but this one adds another two into the mix. They can get rather frustrating at times, but they're a welcome break now and then.\n\nAll in all, while different, the game is a satisfying piece, and even if the Liber Ark plot has been resolved by the end of the Second Chapter, and this one takes things into an entirely new direction, the connections to the first two are rather clear, and rather strong. At first I had my doubts about whether or not Kevin can pull off a proper protagonist act, but he managed. \n\nIf you played and enjoyed the first two, give this one a whirl, just keep in mind that you're not playing a direct sequel to them. If you haven't enjoyed the first two, then you likely might not enjoy this one either (but why are you reading this then?). If you haven't played the first two, you could technically play this one as a stand-alone game. But you really shouldn't. \n\nAnyway, onwards to Erebonia and seeing what the cold steel has in store for us.\n\nPS: Sieg is still a seriously overpowered bird.", "timestamp_created": 1496701582, "timestamp_updated": 1496701984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547435", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32185873": {"recommendationid": "32185873", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993201815", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 5657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496611737}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game", "timestamp_created": 1496612924, "timestamp_updated": 1496612924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32184096": {"recommendationid": "32184096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257696182", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495322366}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend this game because the Trails series is one of the best I've played in a while.

The combat system we know well is back with a few additions. However, this one is easily the worst of the three.  The first two installments built off of the foundation of Liberl and its surroundings; an immersive and interesting place, which paved the way for amazing plots and character interaction.  The third game is one large dungeon that feels completely disconnected from Liberl.  The attempted connections made feel forced to me, which are the following: the dungeon taking on the appearance of previous places and magical doors that reveal bits and pieces of what happened to the characters post SC.  \n\nQuite honestly, I believe this installment could have been so much more.  The one large dungeon approach is lacking in creativity.  The magical door thing is truly a half-assed way of throwing the fan base a bone.  I paid nearly full price for this game based solely on the standard set by 1 & 2, and really, I give the finger to the creators for a merely \"good\" finish to what could have been the most epic RPG series ever.", "timestamp_created": 1496606733, "timestamp_updated": 1496606733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454128", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32178940": {"recommendationid": "32178940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012980068", "num_games_owned": 608, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496609342}, "language": "english", "review": "If you played and enjoyed the first two chapters, it's a no brainer you'll love this one too.", "timestamp_created": 1496590491, "timestamp_updated": 1496590491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32173186": {"recommendationid": "32173186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048051084", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 5124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503753425}, "language": "german", "review": "The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky: The 3rd ist weniger ein drittes Kapitel einer Trilogie als vielmehr ein Bonuskapitel zu einer bereits fertigen Reihe. Demnach ist das Spiel f\u00fcr diejenigen gedacht die bereits mit den beiden vorherigen Spielen Ihre Freude hatten und noch mehr Trails in the Sky wollen. \nZun\u00e4chst sollte man aber wohl feststellen, dass dieses Spiel einiges anders macht als die vorherigen Teile. Statt erneut durch ganz Liberl zu reisen, dreht sich diese Spiel in erster Linie um Kevin Graham und einen neuen Character, welche ungl\u00fccklicherweise in der Welt von Phantasma gelandet sind. Ingesamt ist das Spiel eher kampflastiger als die vorherigen Teile, aber es bietet neben Kevins und Ries Story auch diverse Geschichten zu den bekannten Characteren. Diese Geschichten warten sich in den optionalen Mond-, Stern, und Sonnent\u00fcren.\n\nWas mir gef\u00e4lllt:\n- Kevin und die Rolle der Kirche wird n\u00e4her beleuchet.\n- Man wird alle spielbaren Charactere aus den vorherigen Teilen spielen k\u00f6nnen. Und es warten noch weitere auf einen.\n- Abermals ein gelungener Soundtrack\n- Auch dieses Spiel ist eine gelungene PC-Umsetzung\n- K\u00e4mpfe meist \u00e4hnlich gut wie in Second Chapter\n- Neue Schnellreisefunktion (ist hier auch bitter n\u00f6tig)\n- Nochmals mehr Vielvalt bei Ausr\u00fcstung(Accessoires) und Quartz\n\nNegativ:\n- Die Haupthandlung spielt sich nicht der echten Welt ab.\n- In Sachen Spannung kann das Spiel nicht ganz mit Second Chapter mithalten. \n\n\nNeutral:\n- Spielzeit je nachdem wie viel von den optionalen Inhalten man sich anschaut und welchen Schwierigkeitsgrad man w\u00e4hlt etwa 35-70 Stunden.\n- Schwierigkeitsgrad: Der Schwierigkeitsgrad schwankt zwischen First Chapter und Second Chapter. Ich fand den Schwierigkeitsgrad Schwer erneut passend.\n\nFazit:\nWenn man die beiden vorherigen Spiele durch hat und noch mehr will, sollte man sich das Spiel zulegen. Man sollte sich nat\u00fcrlich bewusst sein, dass man hier der Story-Fokus nicht mehr auf Estelle liegt. F\u00fcr mich war es ein gelungener Abschluss und ich hoffe das wir bald in das Reich von Erebonia oder Crosswell eintauchen k\u00f6nnen.\n", "timestamp_created": 1496572926, "timestamp_updated": 1496572926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32168943": {"recommendationid": "32168943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022113415", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495666714}, "language": "english", "review": "Another fantastic installment in The Legend of Heroes series.  \n\nThe third chapter in the Trails of the Sky arc.

Play the first and second chapter first, since the characters and the world are introduced in those two games.  The third chapter is just an extension of the previous two, it can't stand by itself.\n\nIf you've made it through the previous two games, then you're probably going to pick this up regardless of any review.  But, if you know what you're in for, you might not be so disappointed with your purchase.\n\nBy itself, the third chapter isn't a terrible game, but after playing the first two games, it'll sure feel like it.  The first and second chapters had tons of story, an entire country to explore and countless people to meet.  Unfortunately, you'll find none of that here.  The third chapter has two parts to it:  A generic dungeon crawler, which forms the game play and a series of side stories about some of the characters we've previously met.\n\nThe dungeon crawler part is pretty generic.  No town, just a menu to buy, sell and heal at.  No NPCs to meet and talk to.  It's a one way maze from the very beginning to the very last boss.  The only \"feature\" that it offers over games from the '90s is that you can warp to points scattered throughout the dungeon.  So, fortunately, you won't have to traverse the entire dungeon every time.  The battle system is pretty much the same as the previous two games.  You'll have access to a few new quartz and spells, and there's a couple new turn-based bonuses--all of which annoyed me more than helped.  The world is now centered around a handful of dungeons.  Some of these are places we've seen before, such as Le Locke.  All of the new dungeons look like they belong in a Neptunia/Fairy Fencer game.  They consist of nothing more than a path and an unrelated background--no walls, no ground clutter.  You still get into fights by running into monsters, but they've been drastically spread out now.  This makes even trying to grind levels annoying, since there will only be a handful of monsters in an area, and they're usually nowhere near the zone edges.  The one bright spot to the gameplay is that you'll get access to the majority of characters that we've used in the previous games. It's an ok dungeon crawler, but nothing great.\n\nThe big draw here will be the side stories.  Most of the characters that we know and love get at least a cameo.  The more popular characters got long detailed stories.  Some of them detail the character's backstory, while others show what happened after the second chapter.  These are generally accessed by bringing the relevant character to a door in the dungeon.  However, Kevin's story is broken up and told in between the \"chapters\" of the dungeon.  Many of these are interesting; they're of varying lengths, the first one you get is extremely long (at least 30 mins), but many of them are around 5 mins.\n\nOne last point is that the third chapter made it clear just how much the first two games revolved around Estelle.  It felt like all of the characters, however minor, had some backstory and personality.  However, once Estelle and her desire to badger anyone and everyone was gone, the characters just felt flat.  They seemed to lack any real personality, even during some of the side stories, but completely so for the dungeon crawling part.  It felt as though many of the characters were only three-dimensional from Estelle's perspective, but once you see them from someone else's angle, they're just a facade.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the side stories that you get with this game, and if it had been sold as just the set of side stories, for half the price, I would have loved it.  But everything is gated by the dungeon crawler, and it's just not that fun or interesting.  So, if you've already played the first two chapters and still want to know more about the characters, then pick this up on a sale.  Just know that you'll have to wade through a dungeon crawler to see the stories.", "timestamp_created": 1496542651, "timestamp_updated": 1496542651, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32165696": {"recommendationid": "32165696", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960416683", "num_games_owned": 616, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 3034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496540831}, "language": "english", "review": "Have you played Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC?

D\u00e9j\u00e0, le pr\u00e9ambule est quasiment sans lien avec la chapitre 1. Le d\u00e9marrage est poussif avec deux personnages qui sont les moins interessants (trop de blabla inutile). Par la suite, les voil\u00e0 enferm\u00e9s dans un univers dont ils doivent sortir. Peu \u00e0 peu, ils retrouvent les compagnons un par un (le premier \u00e9tant Tita, cela ne rel\u00e8ve pas l'interet du jeu). De A \u00e0 Z, ca n'\u00e9volue pas malgr\u00e9 quelques perip\u00e9ties: il faut sortir de cet univers pi\u00e9g\u00e9. Et comme il n'y a aucune libert\u00e9 d'action, que tous les donjons sont ultra lin\u00e9aires, tout est impos\u00e9 au joueur ce qui est frustrant. \nHeureusement, il existe deux points positifs. le premier est que le jeu n'est pas trop cher malgr\u00e9 sa sortie r\u00e9cente. Fort heureusement, le mettre autour de 60 \u20ac aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 scandaleux. Le deuxi\u00e8me est l'unique raison qui nous pousse \u00e0 avancer: les portes. Pour les traverser, il suffit d'y amener des personnages pr\u00e9cis et on peut visulaliser une partie de leur histoire.\nPour terminer, m\u00eame si le niveau requis en anglais est abordable, piti\u00e9, on veut une traduction. Est-ce trop demand\u00e9?\n\nAu final, les deux points positifs sauvent le jeu du naufrage absolu. Mais en comparaison des deux autres volets \u00e9poustouflants, on n'a affaire qu'\u00e0 un remake insipide sans saveur.

Others have written great long reviews about the game, and I fully agree. The only modern jrpg franchise that competes with trails on steam right now is probably Neptune/Neptunia. Consider this review a criticism of the port, and not the game itself. I would say \"buy it so we can get better ports in the future\" but I already bought FC and SC...and I got this now. It doesn't seem to work that way.\n\nThe port is unfortunately where things stop being so great. At the time of writing this review we are like 3 weeks from the launch and there are still major bugs and errors in the game, some of them are being reported for weeks and they still aren't fixed.\n\nProbably the worst thing is the broken NG+ option. The problem is that a cutscene that destroys all your quartz (power gems used to boost character's stats and give them magic) also destroys all of them in the NG+, which is not what should happen. And yes, they should carry over as this is what happens in the original version of the game.\n\nAnd this is a big problem. There are rare quartz in the game that you only get 1 per playthrough, NG+ might be used to gather more of these in order to attempt harder difficulties later on. At this moment, the only way to fix this is to tamper with the save file on your own (for example by using cheating software) which is definitely not something acceptable in a product you paid for.\n\nAnother issue, which will be less important to some and more important to others are the achievements. Some of them, namely the ones for beating the game, are broken for NG+ too. So unfortunately, you will have to settle for feeling good about yourself because you're not gonna get this hard/nightmare achievement for beating the game on NG+.\n\nThe game also experiences some visual/resolution glitches as well as localization (translation) problems. Resolution/display options keep reverting to defaults or changing to different resolutions for uknown reasons. The interface in the game keeps glitching out visually too.\n\nI love this game but really.... if you're gonna sell it for 30 Euro, make sure it works before releasing it.\n\nI would recommend waiting with purchase until you can at least play NG+ without using save editing software", "timestamp_created": 1496318813, "timestamp_updated": 1496325933, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470280", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32090173": {"recommendationid": "32090173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105510856", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496180487}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great Legend of Heroes instalment and now waiting for Zero and Ao no Kiseki!", "timestamp_created": 1496250863, "timestamp_updated": 1496250863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32071091": {"recommendationid": "32071091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061243714", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 4241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510545543}, "language": "english", "review": "play it", "timestamp_created": 1496176722, "timestamp_updated": 1496176722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32064040": {"recommendationid": "32064040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349982373", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495926096}, "language": "english", "review": "Even with asset re-using that is starting to annoy me by this point this game series is still one of the best JRPG i have ever played (and you can trust me I have played a lot of them)  9/10 for all 3 games in the Trails in the sky series.  \n[b]*Insert mandatory question about Clossbell here*[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1496155532, "timestamp_updated": 1496155611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32050674": {"recommendationid": "32050674", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989462404", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496084623}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best JRPG i ever played.

At the surface, you will get basic JRPG adventures with some humors, but the underlying background and some of the side stories are really dark, which bring out different sides of the game . These things really excite me because it creates depth and complexity to the story and the series in a very compelling way. Often JRPG story can be rather one dimensional with focus either only on saving the world, or for some a dark more mature background, but everything in the game world is dark with not much variation. Falcom successfully writes mature theme without them feeling forced or making it seems like the game is preaching at you.\n\nThe music in this game are quite ok. Some of the tracks are really good (Cradle Where Feelings Rest, Overdosing Heavenly Bliss), but for the most part they are kinda usual JRPG standard. I will say the music really fits the scenes and enhance the mood very well.\n\nI guess the battle is quite good. Battle system is simple as per previous two entries in the series, but in this game you have more characters and some new crafts, arts and battle reel bonus to take advantage of.

It also acts as an epilogue to the events in Trails in the Sky FC and SC as it brings back all your favorite characters, as well as a couple surprise guests. If you're a fan of old-school story-driven JRPGs in the vein of Lunar, SMT and Star Ocean then definitely check out this series. Don't start here because this game acts as a direct sequel to Trails in the Sky SC, you will want that context going into this game. But if you have played those games and want one final romp with your favorites like Estelle, Joshua, Olivier, Sherazard and others then this is for you. \n\nThe story's primary focus is on a character introduced in Trails in the Sky SC, Kevin Graham, who is a leader of the Gralsritter. The Gralsritter is kind of the military arm of the Septium Church, it's very mysterious and playing as Kevin gives you some insight to the church and what all they're involved in. Along with Kevin you have a new character acting as a secondary protagonist, which is pretty standard for the series. Her name is Ries, Kevin's new squire in the Gralsritter, but also someone Kevin, of course, has some connection to. Kevin is investigating an ancient artifact and is transported to another realm. This is where the primary bits of the game takes place. It's a bit of a departure from Trails in the Sky FC and SC, since you're not gallivanting across the country. That said you are still able to visit familiar territory through the 'magic' of the realm you and your companions are trapped in, and you still have a lot of story and lore to keep you hooked. Anyone who is familiar with developer Falcom knows that the soundtracks in their games are top-notch, and Sky the 3rd is no exception. Of the Sky games it probably is my favorite soundtrack.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same as the previous Sky games, and you're quickly able to expand your repertoire of magic and apply different sorts of strategies. To my knowledge it has the largest roster of playable characters in the series to date. If you can think of any character that was even briefly playable in past games they're here to be used throughout the experience. \n\nAnyhow, if you are a fan of this universe like I am, or want to get into a JRPG series dripping with intrigue, world building, fully fleshed characters and interesting story then look no further than the Trails in the Sky trilogy, and be excited for when Trails of Cold Steel I & II make their way to PC later this year.", "timestamp_created": 1495680206, "timestamp_updated": 1495680206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31942276": {"recommendationid": "31942276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123170908", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496255794}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f53\u5e74\u7684\u60c5\u6000\uff0c\u751f\u751f\u5543\u4e0b\u4e09\u90e8\u66f2\u5168\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u5c31\u5f53\u662f\u953b\u70bc\u82f1\u8bed\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u4e86\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4eca\u5e74\u5e74\u672b\u7684\u516d\u7ea7\u80fd\u62ff\u9ad8\u5206\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1495665050, "timestamp_updated": 1495665050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734538", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31936403": {"recommendationid": "31936403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132371513", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496037586}, "language": "english", "review": "The best entry in the Sora no Kiseki series.

But first, let's get a few things out of the way; if you already enjoyed the first two chapters, you are going to love this one and you MUST get this game, due to it being absolutely important to the overall story, HOWEVER, be prepared to have some changes thrown at you: Estelle and Joshua Bright are not the main protagonists in this one, and you are not able to explore the entirety of Liberl, instead the world is one long colorful dungeon with a hub area you reside at. If you are a true fan of this series, then none of these changes should be a problem. Moving on.\n\nIn general, this game is absolutely incredible. It offers the darkest story of the three games with Kevin Graham as its protagonist, whom you only got to know a bit in SC, however, what you got to see was only on the surface of who he truly is. I am not going to spoil anything of course, but expect to reeeeeeeeally feel for the guy after progressing through the story. A lot of the awesome characters we know and love return, as well as a few new faces that do not fail to shine too, with expanded character development and fantastic dialogue when you talk to them or while progressing through the world.\n\nThis game functions as both an Epilogue to the Sora no Kiseki (Trails in the Sky) series, and an incredibly important Prologue for both Zero no Kiseki (Trails of Zero, which I highly doubt its going to be called) and Ao no Kiseki (Trails of Azure, again probably not what its going to be officially called), and Sen no Kiseki (Trails of Cold Steel). The main story, while incredibly important, has little to do with the next series of games, but a few of the side stories experienced through the Doors are what connect this game to them. Be prepared to have your mind blown, because these side stories are going to answer a lot of questions and provide some deep mysteries to chew over while we wait for the next series release.\n\nThe game play is exactly the same as it has always been, with a few new tweaks here and there, mostly in the way how you go about the world and the supports mechanic. In general this game is a easier than SC, especially if you used your previous save file from SC, which I highly recommend you do. Don't worry, the Prologue is not as ridiculuosly difficult as SCs (thank Aidios). There are only a couple of tough fights, with the majority being fairly easy to get through if you know what you are doing, which should be obvious if you played the first two chapters. By now, you should have a very good idea of how the core battle system  works. As long as you pay attention to your opponents stats, as well as your parties, you should be fine.\n\nOf couse, this being a Falcom game, the soundtrack for this game has to be good right? YESI It is so good! I really enjoyed the music in this game at just about every location. The exploration themes are beautiful and mysterious, boss fight themes are amazingly epic orchestral with rock thrown in, and the emotional story moments are perfectly express through quiet, somber piano, violins, and more. I recommend you buy the soundtrack for all the Legend of Heroes games, they are totally worth it.\n\nLike I have done with the two previous games, I am going play this one through Nightmare and full completionist, although it is definitely easier to find all of the items in this game on your first playthrough, especially if you are taking the time to explore, which is not that hard to do when the world is linear. After finishing this game once, you will have a good idea of who and what is going to be difficult on Nightmare, especially if you first played this one on Hard like I did.\n\nSorry for the long essay, but it has be said that this game is fantastic and we are all blessed that XSEED games took the time to localize this for us all and that Falcom made such as fabulous product. Thank you XSEED and Falcom for bringing us another amazing game that I truly cherish. I am sure that I am not alone in that we are absolutely excited to play Sen no Kiseki (Trails of Cold Steel) on PC, AND that we hope you guys are able to localize both the Crossbell games. \n\nI personally want the Crossbell games more since they technically take place right after Trails 3rd and I don't like to skip over essential story, but I will suck it up and play Cold Steel when it comes out, despite the loss for now.\n\nLIke everyone has said before, if you are interested in this game, you MUST purchase and play through the first two chapters, or you will be missing out on a lot of juicy references and the characters wont mean as much to you otherwise.

Kevin was a mysterious character in SC, and truth to be told, I was a bit apprehensive with him being a main character. However, all the concerns were unfounded as Falcom once again exhibits their talent in character development - Spoiler: Kevin is a great, complex character.\n\nCombat in 3rd is a direct continuation from 2nd. The game sort of expects you to have already played through 2 games and takes little time in throwing you into the complexities of orbal equiping and party building. In a few hours played, you will have a playable cast of more than a dozen of characters to choose from. All except one character have their niche and is pretty even. I admit that up till the very end I cannot decide who and how to form my perfect party. Everyone just seems to have their strengths and weaknesses. Other than party, combat is slightly different from FC and SC. You will have to be even more attentive to the turn order as there are some turns that will be insta-kill and some turns that characters cannot damage others. Some smart finesse will be helpful in ensuring getting the beneficial buffs and forcing enemies to the lame buffs. \n\nThe structure of the game is very different from usual JRPGs. There are no more guild work orders to sidetrack and an overarching narrative. But don't be mistaken, there are still a lot of  NPCs to talk to, and a lot of side quests to be sidetracked via the new and unique door mechanism. The minigames like fishing and poker are still in the 3rd! \n\nOverall, I feel that the 3rd is more like a spin off than a mainline trails game. Players familiar with the series will no doubt welcome all the side stories as they tie up loose plot ends really well and even tease us to the bigger Zemurian continent which the future games are based on. Also, the game throw you right into the thick of the action and plot there is no filler at all unlike the slower pacing of FC and the lots of backtracking travel in SC. The 3rd however, do reuse a lot of the assets in game and sometimes it seem like the story is written in such a way for them to reuse assets. This did not detract from my enjoyment though. It is that fun fighting old foes and old allies alike. Especially that particular boss in chp 6.  Having said all these, this game is actually a really bad starting point for any newcomer to the series.

As such, this time around it's a far more personal story, and doesn't have the grand escalation of FC and SC, or the large world to explore and all the NPCs to talk to and see how they develop.

Entering with Cold Steel I is one thing but at least you're starting with the beginning of an arc-starting here you'll be spoiling every major plot point in the previous two games, that you should play, so if you haven't completed them already then drop this and go FC-> SC-> The Third.\n\nSecond: The actual story content *here*. People who complain that this has nothing to do with the rest of the Trails universe haven't been paying attention. If you've gone through all the Moon Doors, seen all the stories, you'll understand that this game lays out a smorgasbord of plot points for the next five games in this universe, and probably the next full arc in Calvard as well so another two or three there.\n\nIn a more self-contained aspect this story wraps up Kevin's story arc, but it's real value lies in just the sheer amount of background information we're given. Ouroboros, the whole Erebonia situation, along with closing a bunch of dangling loose ends from Liberl.\n\nYou really do need to play FC and SC to fully appreciate all the plot and story, Without them a shitton of the material is probably going to go over your head and not make much sense due to lack of context.\n\nAddendum: While I did say I wouldn't be going into the gameplay, can't help but raise one point: This game isn't particularly grindy at all. Due to the way experience works you'll always be more or less properly levelled for whatever area you're in-trying to overlevel is a waste of time as the law of diminishing returns kicks in. Conversely, raising a dude from level 100 to 110 when the area you're in is rated for the latter is just two or three miniboss fights away. Simple and easy.\n\nI will admit that the constant reusing of assets along with the rather dull sections of places like the Jade Corridor (space background, platforms plus walkways) did get old. The backgrounds only really pick up in the endgame imo-the last two story dungeons ramp things up big time.\n\nI will also admit that there is a grind lategame for oodles and oodles of sepith so you can outfit your entire, stupidly massive 16-member party with the best gear-but in all honesty it's kind of unnecessary. You can easily make do with Lv. 4's plus the free quartz you get from chests, and on the last boss I went into it with several empty slots on some of my characters without any real trouble.\n\nNightmare difficulty is another story, but there's a trick there as well and if you're expecting the hardest game setting to be a cakewalk you need to reexamine your head.", "timestamp_created": 1494904705, "timestamp_updated": 1494904705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31779130": {"recommendationid": "31779130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330035450", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506499664}, "language": "schinese", "review": "= =\u80fd\u641e\u4e0b\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u4e48\uff0c\u6709\u751f\u4e4b\u5e74\u6211\u60f3\u770b\u5230\u6b63\u7248\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u7684\u590d\u6d3b\u554a\u2026\u2026\n\u795d\u65e9\u65e5\u641e\u5230\u65e5\u8bed\u914d\u97f3\u54e6", "timestamp_created": 1494896911, "timestamp_updated": 1494896911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626787", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31777114": {"recommendationid": "31777114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137834565", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499009663}, "language": "english", "review": "Firstly, and most obviously, if you're looking to get into the Trails in the Sky series, this isn't the game to start with. Actually, it's a little bit of an odd duck - the almost dungeon crawler nature of this game might mean that fans of the previous two games could be a little put off, and the way it just jumps into the story fully expecting the player to know what happened in FC/SC and who the characters are makes it very inaccessible to people who are new to the series as a whole. If you're wanting to experience this series fully... start with FC and go from there. It's worth it, seriously. \n\nThat being said, I thoroughly recommend this game and if you are a fan of the Sky series it's very worth your time. It acts something like a \"fandisc\" game, and an epilogue/bridge to Trails in the Sky FC/SC into the next games in the series - the Zero/Ao duology. It wraps up a few loose plot threads left over from the previous games, and introduces characters and new story threads that will play parts and continue on as far as the Cold Steel series. \n\nTaking place in a \"hub\" style mission based format, the story is woven between chapters, which see the player gathering party members and fighting battles while trying to uncover the mysteries of the strange world they've been drawn in to, and how it all connects to Kevin Graham; a character introduced in SC with little information given to his background or motivations. Given the whiplash plot twist at the end of the second game, time devoted to Kevin himself and the organisation he works for is time well spent fleshing out the world in the games. For people who loved the exploration of the first two games, and the feeling of a full and revolving world around them with interesting NPCs, side quests and side stories, this game is a sharply different style. In a way it's a credit to Nihon Falcom's writing and world building that taking away the NPCs and the bustle of the cities in the game leaves you feeling isolated and like something is missing, but that same feeling could put people off the game.\n\nThere's no tutorial - the battle system is the same as in SC, and the game expects you to come into this knowing what to do. Essentially, it's a love letter to the duology - if you love the characters from the first two and want to spend some more time with them, and even get to know some of the well-developed side characers, then you'll enjoy this. The story is engaging, and the few new characters there are fit in well. The soundtrack is as beautiful as ever, mixing some old favourites and remixes with new songs that stand up to the quality from the first games. Six months after completing FC and SC, I found it nice to return to Liberl and go on some new adventures with familiar faces. However, if you're looking for something brand new and innovative... then you won't find it here, and may not enjoy this quite as much as I did. \n\nBut don't worry - XSeed is bringing the Cold Steel series to Steam soon, and that's whole new series to sink your teeth into.", "timestamp_created": 1494885056, "timestamp_updated": 1494885056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31769295": {"recommendationid": "31769295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093040150", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503542897}, "language": "english", "review": "+++++", "timestamp_created": 1494857451, "timestamp_updated": 1494857451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31769037": {"recommendationid": "31769037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115298245", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495003914}, "language": "english", "review": "A very solid game and truly a remarkable epilogue for the Trails in the Sky series.

Compared to how the previous game (Trails SC) handled Nightmare it's safe to say that I prefer the 3rd a whole lot! It's definitely closer to FC's Nightmare (hard but fair) than SC.\n\nIf you're coming from FC and SC (which you should, and you should stop listening to random people telling you that it's fine to start playing the games starting with the 3rd - shame on you!) you should already know what you're getting: Generic yet polished story, fleshed out characters, and a few plot twists here and there. Combat system is \"same but better\" with the addition of few elements and characters being rebalanced for the better (Tita went from the previous games' \"Tita-nic\" to \"attack on Tita-n\").\n\nSoundtrack is the usual Falcom sound team that hits you with songs that range from atmospheric/eerie tune to eargasmic neoclassic metal.

Some fights are the exception to that rule but the game itself lets you downgrade the difficulty specifically for those fights.

Everything is absolutely of high-caliber: the story ties up all loose ends in the Liberl arc extremely well, the music is a meticulous masterpiece, and the tweaked gameplay from the two prior games make this game\u2019s combat the very best rendition of them. \n\nThe usage of the Moon, Star, and Sun doors and the dungeon running theme of the game were an excellent way of tying the whole story together. Each of the doors had a certain memory that explored the other important characters from the past two games, giving you insight to what exactly happened to those characters, all while not getting in the way of the story for the main protagonist, Kevin Graham, which made sense within the dungeon-based world. \n\nThere is no way a type of game stylized around the first two games in the arc could\u2019ve done this idea justice; there are just too many mysteries surrounding too many characters. It would require too much jumping round between characters to uncover the unresolved tidbits from the first two games. Another approach would\u2019ve been an episodic-styled type of game where each episode concentrated on a certain set of characters and their story was told. The first game that comes to mind that did this was Final Fantasy IV: The After Years. While I absolutely loved its predecessor, Final Fantasy IV, the episodic approach just did not work out at all as it had the same problem as if this game took the \u201cnormal\u201d approach: to reiterate, there was going to be too much jumping around between characters, and any attempt at all of the characters getting together would be completely unrealistic due to the events that occurred at (and after) the events of Trails in the Sky SC.\n\nFor me, Trails in the Sky the 3rd has surpassed Trails in the Sky SC as my favorite game in the entire series (For reference, I have finished every other English-localized Trails game to date).

At least 90% of this game, if not more, consists of the exact same environments, locales, assets, art, effects, voices, sprites, menus, you name it. It's all the exact same as FC and SC. No work to improve or change anything at all, which when you're working with such a small place like Liberl, a 3rd romp through it is too much.\n\nTo make matters worse, this 3rd game is essentially just a dungeon-crawler. The entire game is 1 giant EX dungeon from start to finish with no way out and no \"world\" to speak of. You'll spend almost your entire time progressing through this dungeon and grinding, given that you are trapped in it for reasons I won't go into detail here. There are none of the refreshing, world-building interactions and exploration that make other Falcom games so attractive and worthwhile, because there is no world, only the dungeon. It's a very poorly thought out decision from Falcom to make a 3rd game in this series and then construct it in this way that is in stark opposition to the well-detailed and written RPG's they are known for.\n\nIf you think this game serves much plot purpose for the Trails series as a whole, like all the other entries in the series do, you won't find much here. This game's plot is just for the protagonist's, Kevin's, sake. It only has meaning to him, for him, and not much else. Instead the developers opted to pad this game with fluff through optional side-stories for each of the Sky characters, to tell you a little more about each of them at some point or another. This is really the only thing I can say you should expect to gain out of this game, and come for if you're that into the entire cast: A little more \"epilogue\" side-story for each character after SC. You may find a little bit of lore explanation here for certain organizations or terms sprinkled throughout the side stories, but the execution and delivery of these within the context of this game's overall design leaves much to be desired, and begs the question if this is worth slogging through for the small tidbits of additional lore that can be found elsewhere.\n\nThere's nothing to really say about the grindy combat. Most of the game is spent in combat, it's the same combat as FC and SC, you have to start all over again with gear and quartz and slots and sepith like usual. The only thing I'll add to this, is that very quickly you'll be overwhelmed with the available cast of characters availble to you to use, some 20+ characters or so, and at various points in the game you'll have to make multiple parties with them and progress through areas simultaneously with these groups. \n\nThere's a lot of juggling of party compositions, and the one complaint I will make here is that they do not give you a proper solution to build and level the myriad cast they throw your way. Only the 4 members in your current party gain experience, and when you have such an enormous cast to choose from, and the game throws several sections where you need to make use of 8, 12, even 16 members at once, the grind rears its ugly head again and you spend hours wastefully grinding all these characters up for whatever the next chapter's challenge is.\n\nWith that all said, I reitterate that I cannot recommend this game to anyone short of an extremely hardcore Trails player who just wants to play more of the exact same, recycled content from FC and SC.", "timestamp_created": 1494719082, "timestamp_updated": 1495081687, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.352015", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31734301": {"recommendationid": "31734301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004584439", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506929324}, "language": "english", "review": "Crossbell when?", "timestamp_created": 1494712596, "timestamp_updated": 1494712596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31717101": {"recommendationid": "31717101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089416127", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508398192}, "language": "english", "review": "If Jesus was to send a video game before his return it would be this...what more is there to say?!?!?!?!?", "timestamp_created": 1494657235, "timestamp_updated": 1494817567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31715261": {"recommendationid": "31715261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028723758", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 7273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501103752}, "language": "english", "review": "Trails In the Sky The 3rd, is fairly different from the previous two games, this time starring Kevin Graham, as he and a former childhood friend Ries get sucked into a strange world, dark secrets are revealed.

Regardless, if you are a fan of the series, you should play this.\nXseed did an excellent job at localizing (even if I feel weird seeing \"Zin\" instead of \"Zane\"), and the game itself is well constructed. Only problem I had was with the endgame, which requires you to use EVERY character, and almost requires heavy grinding for you before attempting. The final dungeon could be a pain if you are not prepared for it. Some of the side-stories weren't that interesting and felt like they were just there to be some kind of filler, and/or explain things that weren't properly explained.

However, much as I love it, I cannot overlook the glaring difference between Trails in the Sky the 3rd and its previous companions in this wonderful franchise.\n\nRight off the bat, let me say that Trails in the Sky the 3rd is VERY different from the first two games in terms of setting. None of the game takes place in Liberl or any location we've grown familiar with throughout the series, at least not actually. Instead, the entire game takes place in a fantasy reality called Phatasma. I don't consider this a spoiler, since players really should learn what they're getting into before diving in.\n\nBasically in Phantasma, anything goes as far as Planes you visit, and places from the previous games do make appearances, albeit in slightly altered versions. Since Phantasma is a kind of alternate dimension, this allows you to finally have a warp feature to get from place to place instantly, a useful tool indeed. \n\nHOWEVER, this also means that none of the richness and depth of the previous games is here, since Phantasma has no NPC's that aren't there strictly to be fought or to serve as brief exposition, and there are no zone that aren't strictly monster filled dungeons.\n\nThere are doors - Star, Moon, and Sun Doors - which give you access to little vignettes that explore different aspects of the world, as well as plot threads related to the various characters who join your party (and it's the biggest roster yet, following the pattern of the previous game). Yet these doors offer little compared to the depth of narrative of the previous games, and have no real effect upon the action going on in Phatasma. They are literally one off mini-sodes within the game that change nothing about the larger story, which is sad since they're the only thing to do besides follow the main course along to the end. I was really missing Bracer requests by the end.\n\n*MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*\n\nSince Phantasma is also a fictional world, that means there are no limits to who can show up. And boy do they show up. As I mentioned, this game has the largest cast of party members yet, all of whom you will recognize from previous games. Some of this is really cool, but it doesn't stop there. Other characters continue to show up, particularly near the end of the game, creating special boss battles that would be impossible in any normal setting. Part of me thought this was cool, but it also felt a little childish. It's almost like Trails 3 is \"Trails in the Sky Fan Fiction the Game\". Just don't be surprised when another familiar faces comes along to challenge you. They're all there. ALL OF THEM.\n\nTL;DR The game's basic mechanics are as solid as ever, without adding anything major to the formula. The music is as epic and stirring as always, and the game is still quite fun. It's just not as detailed or interesting as the previous two games, and I found the new protagonists, Kevin and Reis, a lackluster substitute for Estelle and Joshua. For fans who have come this far, there's probably no reason not to get it. Just don't expect another one like the first two games.\n", "timestamp_created": 1494539073, "timestamp_updated": 1494539073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31688269": {"recommendationid": "31688269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089239269", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501992228}, "language": "english", "review": "Who knew an engineer and a nun could be so cute?", "timestamp_created": 1494528402, "timestamp_updated": 1494528402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506274", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31684340": {"recommendationid": "31684340", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999204518", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498743452}, "language": "english", "review": "This game both provides catharsis and resolution for its two prequels and also ties in to (and provides intrigue for) the rest of the series in all the best ways.

It was absolutely wonderful to come back to this big family for one last romp together. \n\nWhile this game requires knowledge of the previous two games to make the most of it, the main story in this title is self-contained from the overarching main story of the first two Sky games. It's a game that gives you much more insight into those characters you've come to love over the past ~120 hours or so, and gives some awesome views into their lives after the events of the first two games, and awesome views as to where their lives are going to go even after that. The end of the game was so good that I even found myself emotional and in tears from the events that take place. The music is absolutely phenomenal, too.\n\nThis game is essentially a super condensed version of the formula from the first two games, with basically all meat, no potatoes. It expects you to have played the first two games regarding the gameplay elements, and has no problem just throwing you into the action assuming you know as much.\n\nThe gameplay setup really plays around with multiple party layouts, and encourages experiementation in a postive way. It was fun switching between characters that were my favorites, or ones I never got to play with in the previous titles. Couple that with ocassional unique dialogue for different characters and cutscenes depending on who you bring with, and you have a game that everyone has a little bit of a different experience with. It's a solid game built on some strong fundamentals, and by the end they really challenge you to make the most of everyone, which was very cool.\n\nI hope everyone can give all the titles in this series a shot (as well as the soon-to-come to PC Cold Steel games), as it's very dear series to me, and will give you back as much as you put into it, with satisfying payoffs everywhere that take the time to properly develop into something special.

Most of its payoff hinges on your intimate familiarity with characters and events from the first two games, so I can\u2019t recommend this as a starting point. The entire trilogy is on Steam, so if you\u2019re interested in getting into a JRPG series with great writing and consistent world building, start with the first [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/251150/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_in_the_Sky/]Trails in the Sky[/url]. Trails of Cold Steel, which comes to Steam this summer, is also a good starting point if you want something more modern.\n\nNow about this game's format. The potential concern for fans of the first two Sky games is that the 3rd is a dungeon crawler. You're not getting a big bracer adventure in the 3rd, but rather than dwell on that, let\u2019s break down what you will get and why it's still worth your time. \n\nThe dungeon crawling aspect is surprisingly good. Difficulty modes are nicely balanced this time and fast travel is a real time saver. As you crawl around Phantasma, you'll find new monsters, more party members, doors (more on this later), a few new quartz, and the return of talking treasure chests. The treasure chest phrases in particular add flair to what would otherwise be fairly ordinary dungeon crawling, and I often found myself playing longer than I expected just to read a few more of them. The 3rd has a lot of options when it comes to party members, as well as a new feature where you get boosts from characters you\u2019re not using. Falcom also made some very interesting choices for bosses this time, and some are sure to surprise and please existing fans. All this is done to the tune of what I think is the best soundtrack in the trilogy and some of Falcom\u2019s finest music overall.\n\nThe 3rd has a fantastic main story but it\u2019s very back loaded, which means that the first half is more about dungeon crawling and finding things than it is about Kevin and Ries. Kevin being the oldest Trails protagonist to date is refreshing, providing players with an appropriately darker and more mature tone compared FC/SC\u2019s coming of age story. Doors scattered throughout Phantasma contain side stories and info. With the doors being mostly separate from one another, the writing in this game is definitely more disjointed, but that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. The main advantage of this delivery is it lets players see and learn things that normally wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t be presented in an FC or SC style game. While the first door you open may give the impression that all you\u2019ll do is watch and read what\u2019s going on like a visual novel, some of the later side story doors are more involving. Much like the first two games, the 3rd's script has a lot of character and is a pleasure to read. In terms of content, you get a lot more insight on the characters and the politics of Zemuria, presented in a more personal and concise way.\n\nThere\u2019s not much about the 3rd that I dislike, but I\u2019ll include some nitpicks here. Moon door 1 is one of the first side story doors you\u2019ll encounter and it\u2019s a long one with no breaks. It\u2019s not representative of most doors, and can be a nasty surprise for those expecting something short and sweet. There is a lot of recycling when it comes to areas and even bosses, but I generally didn\u2019t mind it since there\u2019s often some kind of compensation that makes it a bit better, such as being able to explore a place that wasn\u2019t previously accessible. S-crafts can be skipped with a right click, but the battle system is still sluggish. As usual though, a few clicks is all it takes to set up a speed hack and turn that into a non-issue. One of the playable characters in this game is just flat out bad and would be dead weight in any party in a higher difficulty run. With so many playable characters though, it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nWhile FC and SC were focused on fleshing out the Liberl Kingdom, the 3rd further develops the characters you\u2019ve come to love while laying down an important lore foundation for future arcs.

However, dont fear too much about this, after the first bit of story you'll be given some of the rules that explain all the stuff this game has to offer, if you havent figured it out already (Honestly i had a good grasp at almost all battle mechanics when they gave me those rules).\n\nNow, as far as game-play goes, I'd suggest at least a few things before concidering to buy the game.\n\nLike most of the comments say, this game is EXTREMELY story heavy. But, fortunately, even if you are not familiar with the games prior to this one, the story is still highly interesting. As far as character development goes, youll honestly have trouble findng JRPGs with this amount of content. \n\nAs for combat, its all about your ability to plan out moves ahead.\n\nSo far, medium seemed too easy for me, however while i may act like its nothing, there are still times when i almost died to bosses within that game mode, so dont take it as your average walk in the park, If you wanna try a higher difficulty, then try hard, i'd say at least play easy mode up until the first boss to get a good feel as to where you stand in terms of combat. On another note, if you prefer combat intensive gameplay over story, it is also highly reccomended that you play on hard or (if you have the balls to... no seriously, i cannot descirbe to you how hard this mode is) Nightmare mode.... like the game says though, it's your funeral.\n\nNow usually, this is the part where i would go into Cons of this game... but i cannot find any honestly.\n\nthe combat is justified, as cruel and unforgiving as it can be sometimes, it does in fact give you ample tme to prepare yourself for each attack the enemy will lash out on you. It honestly depends on how well you prepare for a duel ahead of time. If you see minions, attack them first to lessen dps, keep party well maintained enough to withstand an attack, use magic and status effects on enemies to their fullest and exploit any and all weaknesses whenever possible. All of the gameplay is fluid, and the story elements are top notch even if you dont know what the fuck is even happening, its all highly interesting.\n\nI strongly reccomend this game for anyone who loves the classical JRPGs as well as those who are a fan of Final Fantasy Tactics (Yes that game is as old as moldy cheese, but it ages well dammit). This game is not to be missed if you love a good story and some strategic gameplay.\n\nHope this helps in your decision!", "timestamp_created": 1494313596, "timestamp_updated": 1494313745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566584", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31639978": {"recommendationid": "31639978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076829806", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498385768}, "language": "english", "review": "Well What can I say.

It is unmistakenbly very different in setup compared to Trails in the Sky FC and SC, where the player moves through a living, breathing world, while this game can be characterised more as a dungeoncrawler. While this can be disappointing, the overall world leaves no room for the playable characters of FC and SC to gang up for another great adventure in the continuity established there. Only by stepping outside of this frame of reference can we see them once more as a group, which is exactly what this game delivers- and with copious amount of flashbacks, too, to deliver extended glimpses into the world we've come to known in the first two games.\n\nThis all makes the 3rd a very different beast compared to FC and SC- but with all mechanics remaining in place, a familiar one nonetheless.

There are a few caveats that must be considered when discussing Trails The Third. The first is that the game is very different from the first two in the series. The game is a much more linear and story focused experience compared to the first two entries. In fact, one might say the rewards in this game are purely story based. Given this fact, it is very difficult for players who have not, at minimum, played Second Chapter (SC) to fully appreciate and understand the context of what is ultimately rewarded to the player and the heart of this game, THE STORIES. Third takes place six months after SC and the majority of \"exploring\" in the game nets rewards that fill in gaps of what happens between SC and Third in addition to other lore-based aspects of the Trails universe and also establishes a solid lore foundation for fans who will invest (or have invested) in Trails of Cold Steel. Thus, if you are not already a fan of the Trails series, do not play RPGs for stories, or do not intend to play other Trails games, The Legend of Heroes The Third becomes a game I can not recommend. This game is clearly for the fans and for those who are, you're in for one hellava ride because the stories are oh so good! \n     The previous point leads into the second caveat, the gameplay. The fighting and orbment mechanics are heavily derived from SC. An orbment that plays into the door mechanic (a story-and-lore-driven mechanic), a few new battle boons, some mini-games, and three new playable characters with some new skills are what are new, nothing else in terms of gameplay. In fact, if you've played SC, Third backtracks progress as saved data does not retain orbment slot upgrades on recurring characters. There are a slew of new monsters that appear in the game, but none do things that are drastically different from those seen in the first two Trails games. If you're looking for fresh ways to play this game coming from the first two, you're out of luck.\n     Finally, I want to discuss the soundtrack, it's phenomenal. Falcom's music team does it again with tracks that cover the full range of emotions and fit the themes of the stories presented in game. It is simply one of the highlights of all Trails games and enhances the experience during the journey.\n     With all these points, let's return to my recommendation. With Third being so linear and story driven with its mechanics being completely derived, the game becomes very difficult to recommend to newcomers to the Trails series, especially when First Chapter (FC) and SC are available on Steam. For the newcomers, I would strongly recommend playing through, AT MINIMUM, SC and gauging whether you take interest in the Trails universe enough to invest many hours watching stories that build upon it. For the fans, my recommendation is still lukewarm as the game strips away so much of what made the first two games great, but attempts to reconcile this by filling in lore (and not all of it interesting). Ultimately, The Third acts as a story and lore medium for fans of the Trails series and a stopgap for those who have not yet experienced the Trails of Cold Steel games. If this is good enough reason to buy the game, then go for it. 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1494131086, "timestamp_updated": 1494377035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31595738": {"recommendationid": "31595738", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984512206", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500255803}, "language": "english", "review": "Trails the series that cares more about its minor side characters than recent Final Fantasys care about their main cast....\nTo be less salty this game has been a true blast.

The 3rd focuses more on vignettes that happened after the end of SC and gives us backstory and explanations.  The 3rd is more like a slightly different flavor of the same games we know and love.

(Jin/Zin/Zane gets a really ugly hair recolor for some reason in Evolution lol). \n\nWhile SC ended fine the way it was, Third gives me some real closure on a lot of other stories in the series. This was really important for me, and I'm sure many fans will really have a lot of emotions during many of the stories as they unfold or resolve. It's nice to see what everyone had been up to, how their relationships progressed and also some past stories of others. Kevin also gets much more fleshed out, and he's become a character that I got really attached to. He has a really good heart, and the story around him and the church is very interesting and probably going to be relevant to the other games in a  way too.  (Kevin's so cute with his Kansai accent lol).\nI really recommend doing the extra dungeon for the extra door of darkness.\n\nThe story has you mostly finding star, sun, and moon doors; most doors are character specific, Some doors are long stories, some are past snippets, relavent information that you'll want as you play Ao, Zero, and Cold Steel, , and some are little minigames so there's a lot to look forward to when opening doors.\n\nThe music is really good, as all Trails songs are, but Cry For Me has a special place right after Gin no Ishi for me~ The soundtrack has really good placements of songs, and you'll see some familiar songs pop up. Some of the song placement was so so well-done that it literally had me in tears for certain events.\n\nThe game play is basically however you want; even though people say it's an arts game, I still literally went with a glass canon melee team (literally Kevin/Rise [only for Zodiac...], Agate, Alan, and Mueller lol). However you get to use some unplayable characters from the series that are really cool, and some get huge upgrades!\n\nIt'll be really nice if someday XSeed could use the evolution version because it is fully voiced, and the battle system is much improved. Regardless, I love this series so much and I'm so thankful for all the amazing staff members from XSeed who spend so much time trying to keep the spirit of the game (even going back and patching small things constantly)! Even though I played Third, I'm going to buy all of XSeed's releases for the trails series to support them. After I finish Zero and Ao, I'm going to buy the Cold Steel series, and then start on the YS series (and whatever other Falcom games that XSeed releases).

This game is quite different from the other ones, both in structure and in tone. This time around you play as Kevin Graham, a \"priest\" of the Septian Church, along with his newly arrvived partner, Ries Argent. While the game may be much ligher on main story and instead more gameplay-oriented (the game is largely a dungeon-crawler, after all), the story that's there is - as always - nothing short of brilliant. The lore of the series is also greatly expanded upon, much of which will come into play in games released almost a decade later. At times, the game takes on a darker tone than most JRPGs (especially one part, although that one is part of a side story), and the protagonists are quite different from your typical JRPG heroes (or even most protagonists in general) - which is always a plus in my book. \n\nThe gameplay is pretty good for a turn-based game; I know I've certainly enjoyed it quite a bit so far. The battle system is mostly just an expanded version of the one from the previous two entries. I would also like to point out that the OST is nothing short of amazing, certainly a major upgrade from FC & SC.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you play the previous two entries (Trails in the Sky FC & SC) before jumping into this one in order to truly appreciate all of the side stories, as well as content pertaining to the main story. These side stories flesh out many already well-developed characters even more, while also giving quite a bit of information relating to the lore and the world of the series. Playing the previous games is definitely not required though, but don't be surprised if you get confused sometimes -  it IS an epilogue after all (though loosely-related to the prequels).\n\nI can scarcely think of any largely detrimental flaws. The only minor flaw I can think of is how loosely connected the main story and the side stories are, but that's quite understandable in this particular case, considering how the game is structured (though it still holds the game back slightly).  \n\nTo conclude: Great story, great characters, great music, good gameplay, and it's a real marvel for people heavily invested in the lore and world of the series. 9.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1494024143, "timestamp_updated": 1494024143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31567970": {"recommendationid": "31567970", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967108792", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509470007}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

It takes the trusted combat of Trails in the Sky FC & SC and turns it up a notch, to create the definite battle system for the Trails in the Sky Series. Which is of course needed, since this game revolves way more about combat and running through dungeons / labyrinths this time around. Only thing i would love to have since FC, is a way to speed up the casting animations.\n\nBeing kind of an epilogue to the Trails in the Sky Series, this game is best enjoyed after having played through Trails in the Sky FC & SC. Of course there is nothing stopping you from starting with this game, but the memory scenes will just not have the same impact if you are not familiar with the characters.\n\nAs usual for this series, the characters and their interactions are the real stars here. Kevin, who takes the mantle of main character this time around and Ries, his subordinate, make for a great and entertaining pair. Especially Ries was surprising to me, since she acts way more different than you would expect (in a good way). Both have a very loose tongue and bounce off each other really well.\n\nOver the course of the game you will unlock many known characters from FC & SC and yes, Joshua and Estelle are also part of this game though the main focus lies squarely on Kevin.\n\nRecommending this game is quite easy: If you played FC & SC this game is a no brainer. While it is a bit different in structure (more focused on dungeons), you just have to experience the memory fragments to get to know more about the characters you learned to love over the games.\n\nIf you have not played the other games I'd recommend checking them out first. They feature some of the best world building and character interactions in gaming and offer lenghty game time for the price.\n\n\nOn the technical side I didn't really run into any issues, the game runs as expected for me tho there are mentions of problems with integrated graphics cars on the forums. So if you have any problems you should check them out.\n\n\nFC = First Chapter\nSC = Second Chapter", "timestamp_created": 1493960602, "timestamp_updated": 1493961868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31551353": {"recommendationid": "31551353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025686484", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494975559}, "language": "english", "review": "Decided to update my earlier review since I have now finished the game. To those who have followed this series through the first two \"Trails\" games, this is a worthy send off to the characters you've come to know and love. Since Estelle and Joshua's story concluded in the second chapter, the focus is now on Kevin Graham, the mysterious priest of the Septium Church introduced in the second game. Pretty much every major character makes an appearance, and each gets a moment to shine in side stories spread throughout the game. Make no mistake, this is a game for those who have followed the series from the first Trails in the Sky, everyone else will be absolutely left in the dark. If you haven't played the first two get them now, they are among the best JRPG's you can get on Steam. \nBeing the third in the series, I was afraid it would be really boring traversing Liberl for a third time. Falcom wisely decided to change up the formula of the game to make it even more narrative driven than normal, and shifting the gameplay into a more focused dungeon crawler. While there are plenty of battles, chracter customization and treasures to find, the fundamental gameplay remains nearly unchanged from the previous games. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for me the strength in the series lies in its characters and story telling, and this game absolutely delivers. A grand total of 16 characters are available, which is a tad bit excessive in my opinion. \nHowever I would be remiss if I didn't warn you that this game RAMPANTLY reuses assests from the previous two games including entire towns, dungeons, boss fights, even animated cutscenes are reused. I imagine this was done to reduce the development time as there's usually quite a bit of time between \"Trails\" games. It's normal for developers to reuse assets to reduce development time and save on the budget, but this game is agregious in how it just feels like a \"greatest hits\" of maps and fights we've already experienced in the other games. That being said, the writing and character development are just as strong as ever, and there were even times I was tearing up at what was going on. I came for more Trails narrative goodness and I got exactly that. I just wish the game was as mechanically strong as other games in the series. \nSo the TL;DR version: Fans who have played all the english language releases of the Trails games should not miss this game, despite manic reuse of old assets from the older games. A lot of plot elements are seeded here for future games in the series, including Trails of Cold Steel, which will be coming to Steam in the future for those of you who missed it on Playstation 3 and PS Vita. \nIt's a miracle this game exists at all in English, given the size of the scripts in these games. While I'm not actively looking for errors while playing, I noticed a grand total of one throughout my nearly 50 hours of play. Trails fans simply MUST buy this game and show XSeed the last two untranslated Trails games (Ao no Kiseki and Zero no Kiseki) have an audience here on steam. I'm used to spending 90-100 hours on these games typically, so this is on the shorter side of the series in general.

The strength of the series has always been within the boundaries of storytelling, characterization, and world-building. I wasn't sure how well that would translate to sectioned off zones through enumerable doors divorced from the rest of the game. While the combat and primary gameplay mechanics in the trilogy have been functional, I wasn't sure they could carry the game on their own.\n\nGetting right to the meat of the game,The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd( \u82f1\u96c4\u4f1d\u8aac \u7a7a\u306e\u8ecc\u8de1) is a remaster of the original PSP and Windows game. Of the things remastered, the primary thing is texture resolution, and lighting.\n\nThe textures look amazing, along with the new lighting style. This is something I think everyone can get behind, but I'm sure it will put some people off. Colors are more distinct and crisp. Playing the steam ver and PSP version side-by-side, one of the biggest differences is the lighting. Almost all of the textures are upgraded, but the lighting will really catch your eye. The game is a lot brighter than the original. I don't know if this is because of the PSP screen or not, but I tend to think it's a much better looking game because of it.\n\nWhen a lot of the primary progression of the game involves trekking through dungeons that are, for the most part, fairly straightforward, having a high level of input over your team composition and strategy is fairly engaging. I often found myself swapping characters in and out of party not out of obligation, but out of interest.\n\nEven on the normal difficulty mode, some of the battles presented in the main game involved a level of strategy that I didn't really encounter in the earlier entries; it often didn't stretch beyond utilizing elemental weaknesses and abusing S-crafts. While the 3rd could be similarly trivialized on a lower difficulty level or through copious level-grinding, I feel that it did not succumb to this weakness to the same extent.\n\nBattles play out very similar to what players would have seen in FC and SC, except now you get to create your own dream party and use some of their awesome Crafts: if you enjoyed the battle system in the previous two games, then you\u2019ll enjoy this one. Even though it\u2019s just more of the same, playing the game with new characters gives a pretty fresh feeling and I never felt bored.\n\n-The Pros-\n+Additional depth/detail to every main character in the Sky Trilogy. \n+Additional depth/detail to the world of West Zemuria.\n+A lot of foreshadowing to future installments (Zero, Azure, Cold Steel) \n\n+The Cons+\n-Not Voice or Dub\n(the difference between this and the PS VITA remaster versions, is that this one is now fully voiced on major scenarios, new visual arts, musics were fully arranged, and changes on the game balance)\n-Game still have Glitch and some bugs\n-Did Not Auto detect controller while starting the game(have to turn on from game settings)\n\nNeutral\n=Not The PS Vita Remaster Version\n\nPS VITA VERSION (THE THING I WANT IT BADLY ON STEAM VERSION)\nThey've added more combat turn bonuses. Zero Arts and Zero Crafts allows you to use a craft or art at a cost of 0 EP or CP respectively. They also added a Rush bonus that makes your first attack give a delay of 0, which means you can get a free turn right after.\n\nAnother addition to combat they've added is the ability to hit enemies before engaging them. Like a lot of games where you have to actually run into enemies to start a random battle, you can now press O to attack them. Hitting from the front immobilizes them, and hitting them from the back stuns them, granting bonus XP at the end of the fight.\n\nSomething more hardcore players might dislike is the changes to combat, which I think will make the game overall a lot easier. I'm not far into it, but leveling will be faster cause of the 2x XP Bonus from stunned back attacks (which you can choose not to use), fights will be easier due to Zero Arts and Zero Crafts (free arts and free crafts are crazy), and Rush giving you free basic attacks.\n\n\n\n-Conclusion-\nIf you haven't played the original, Trails in the Sky is a sub-series in the Legend of Heroes series, featuring its own unique world and characters. It is a classic JRPG with a large focus on story and characters and turn-based combat. The combat is more of a mix of classic JRPG random encounters with some isometric strategy game elements.\n\nThe combat is enjoyable, it allows for decent customization for all of your characters, and it offers some pretty decent challenge. Characters have their own special abilities, and they have a orbments which allow you to equip various amounts of special orbs that give special abilities based on the elements of those orbs. Lots of mix and match opportunities.\n\nMy Verdict 4/5\nIf you liked the first Legend Of Heroes game then this evolution is a must have addition to your collection. sadly we are not getting PS VITA remaster version which is partially voice and improve in game battle animation.\n\nNOTE:MY 3RD TIME BUYING THIS GAME, I HAVE THE PSP VERSION, PS VITA REMASTER VERSION ( R4 asia version) and now this PC STEAM\nxxxx Do Not Compare This To Vita Version xxxx", "timestamp_created": 1493919431, "timestamp_updated": 1493920538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765170", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31543455": {"recommendationid": "31543455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150532634", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495635095}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b\u043c!", "timestamp_created": 1493914149, "timestamp_updated": 1493914149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611658", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31542913": {"recommendationid": "31542913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358204014", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502029007}, "language": "english", "review": "Onion\u00b7Graham\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1493912114, "timestamp_updated": 1497434071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31542424": {"recommendationid": "31542424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143390685", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 5508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506482255}, "language": "english", "review": "Having played LOH 1 and 2 and beat them both, I was excited to see the 3rd chapter finally come to PC.\nI like the use of lighting and shadows especially when Kevin is on the airliner in the first part of the game. \nWill have to get used to Kevin being the lead character and see where the story goes.\nTo me, the game series has a Xenogears \"feel\" to it (without the mechs) with field rotation and sprite characters.\nThe music is as great as always.

As\u00ed que pueden votar negativo si quieren xD\n\nPara empezar, he de decir que soy un fan incondicional de la saga Legend of Heroes.\n\nEste tercer juego me encant\u00f3!! La historia es una consecuencia directa de The Second Chapter aunque no sigue la misma estructura. Lo que ocurri\u00f3 al final de SC sirvi\u00f3 perfectamente como punto de entrada para esta tercera parte. Para los que jugaron los dos primeros, se encontrar\u00e1n que la estructura de la trama cambia bastante: ya no estaremos en Liberl propiamente tal (en realidad si, pero no es donde se desarrolla la trama) si no que en otro lugar por lo que nos moveremos siempre dentro de esa realidad. \n\nEn cuanto al contenido como JRPG tenemos la historia principal, que para mi es buen\u00edsima, la cual a mi en lo personal con la historia principal, m\u00e1s las secundarias, recorriendo cada dungeon para buscar cada objeto, leveando apropiadamente a los personajes, algunos jefes que tuve que desafiarlos m\u00e1s de una vez, etc, me tom\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 100 horas. Desconozco cu\u00e1nto tiempo tomar\u00eda si alguien intentase hacer un speed run o si solo terminase la historia principal con lo m\u00ednimo requerido. \n\nEn cuanto al contenido adicional, ah\u00ed es donde tenemos la otra gran diferencia: ya no existen las side quest. En su lugar tendremos \"side stories\", las cuales para obtenerlas primero tenemos que encontrar unas puertas (hay 3 tipos de ellas) y para abrirlas tenemos que cumplir ciertas condiciones. Algunas de esas condiciones son sencillas y otras es un poco m\u00e1s complicado. Estas side stories algunas son jugables, otras son solo visualizar la historia, pero lo que si tienen todas en comun, es que extienden y explican much\u00edsimo la historia y los pormenores de varias situaciones que quedaron abiertas en juegos anteriores. Por ejemplo, por qu\u00e9 Renne est\u00e1 en la situaci\u00f3n que est\u00e1, por qu\u00e9 ha sufrido tanto, por qu\u00e9 Estelle se compadece de ella. Otro ejemplo ser\u00eda, que se explican algunos aspectos de Trails of Cold Steel y por qu\u00e9 suceden de cierta forma y c\u00f3mo es que Olivier se decide a tomar cierta desici\u00f3n. En fin, estas side stories dan detalles important\u00edsimos dentro del universo Legend of Heroes incluso de otros juegos de la saga y lo que suceder\u00e1 en ellos. Como incentivo para completar estas side stories, las recompensas son bastante valiosas, desde Items, Orbments o gemas bastante raros algunos, dinero, etc. En mi party al final termin\u00e9 utilizando los objetos y gemas que estas me dieron.\n\nLa jugabilidad se mantiene: Recorrido de dungeons bastante extensas divididos en secciones, en los cuales se premia la exploraci\u00f3n, te puedes encontrar con cofres, cofres especiales, enemigos poderosos, puertas, etc. El dise\u00f1o de niveles como siempre es sobresaliente, con mucho detalle aunque no sea una gran cosa para algunos, pero para quienes nos fijamos en esas cosas lo disfrutamos mucho.\n\nEl sistema de combate es el de toda la vida: Batallas por turnos, los personajes pueden usar Arts o Crafts, tambi\u00e9n pueden invocar S-crafts en cualquier momento, puedes encadenar ataques, etc. Hay que estar bien preparado, leveado y equipado para las batallas con los jefes finales, por que de lo contrario te har\u00e1n morder el polvo. Lo mejor es tener una buena estrategia, imprescindible para este tipo de batallas. Esto es una recomendaci\u00f3n para casi cualquier RPG en general y este juego no es la excepci\u00f3n.\n\nPor cierto, el desarrollo de personajes tambi\u00e9n se ve muy potenciado por las side stories, de modo que este aspecto sigue siendo de los m\u00e1s destacables dentro de la historia. Por supuesto, los personajes principales tienen el desarrollo m\u00e1s notable en lo que es la historia principal. Tambi\u00e9n hay desarrollo para los personajes no jugables, incluso enemigos, de modo que esto me gust\u00f3 muchisimo. Qui\u00e9n sabe.... como fan de la saga me emociona imaginarme que quiz\u00e1s haya un nuevo juego Legend of Heroes a juzgar por lo que se ve en una de esas side stories de uno de los personajes, so\u00f1ar no cuesta nada.\n\nFinalmente, la conclusi\u00f3n de este juego da por finalizada la trilog\u00eda. El ep\u00edlogo me hizo darme cuenta que ya no hay m\u00e1s juegos por el lado de Trails in the Sky... me encari\u00f1\u00e9 con todos ellos, con sus personajes principales, secundarios, incluso con los enemigos que a varios los encontr\u00e9 geniales, llegu\u00e9 a empatizar con cada personaje y sus virtudes, sus defectos, sus miedos, sus anhelos. Me quedo con una sensaci\u00f3n un poco de tristeza porque con esto ya se cierra la trilog\u00eda y no los volveremos a ver, pero tambi\u00e9n con una sensaci\u00f3n de satisfacci\u00f3n y felicidad por la conclusi\u00f3n del juego y por haber disfrutado de tan maravillosas historias. \n\nLa verdad es que los extra\u00f1ar\u00e9 mucho.\n\nCompra totalmente recomendada, sobretodo si ya jugaste los dos juegos anteriores.\n\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1493872094, "timestamp_updated": 1500829144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31534995": {"recommendationid": "31534995", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978315666", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495093326}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a pleasant surprise!\nEven if it's only half as good as 1 and 2 it's money well spent!\nAnd I want to support these traslators, keep them coming!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1493868021, "timestamp_updated": 1493868021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31534473": {"recommendationid": "31534473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062227881", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 163, "playtime_forever": 2408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505505902}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recomend this series.

I have no idea how Falcom manages to create one 10/10 game after another. Especially the ending hit me hard. Seeing all this characters for the last time after 3 games was just incredibly sad.\nWhat started with First Chapter is completed here satisfactorily. This is also (in my opinion) the shortest game in the triology and also the most obscure one. The Tone of \"The Third\" is surprisingly dark and mature, compared to the previous two entries.\n\nThe graphics have nice effects. Of Course, the game is over a decade old and was co-developed for the PSP, and it shows, also the PC-Version has DirectX 8 and is limited to 125 FPS. However, it has nice effects like Glow or Reflections, where i'm not sure if they're unique to the English PC Release or if the original Japanese Version already had them. It sure looks nice, when your characters are reflected in water or in the ground. Airships now have a distortion effect for heat.\nGenerally speaking, everything looks like how it's supposed to be. 2D-Sprites add some nostalgic feeling. I like them better than fully 3D rendered Models. \n\nThe soundtrack is, as expected from Falcom Sound Team jdk, absolutely godlike. Although there are not as many tracks as Second Chapter had, that you could listen to independantly from the game, the present tracks are all well done and add perfectly to everything that happens. This is how videogame music has to sound. Not with large orchestras like so many games do it today. Memorable Melodies and the few tracks with Vocals are great too.\n\nFinally, i have to say, of all three games, Second Chapter remains my favorite.

This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC.\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are sidequests which serve to further flesh out the characters and the setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a good reason why the console version of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15, Renne's story[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Though this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers inbound for those familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler].

However this game is pretty much explicitly made for those that have played both FC and SC as it is much more character-driven, and expects you to already know the characters, plot and the setting to be truly invested in 3rd. For example, one of the characters from SC, Kevin, is actually the main character this time instead of Estelle and Joshua. Not many games do this so I was pleasantly surprised. I very much enjoy the cast of this game, probably one of the strongest casts I've seen in an RPG in a long time, so seeing each one get their little moment in the spotlight was really nice. And that's the main bulk of the game to me, getting to know the characters you got to know so well even more. The actual plot is rather light and subdued in comparison the other two games. It mainly focuses on Kevin's backstory and relationship with Ries, but that's about it. But that's okay, because at it's surface it's meant as a sendoff to a story that was wrapped up mostly in SC. \n\nOne thing I really enjoyed was the Door mechanic, which is made up of several doors found throughout Phantasma (yeah, instead of traveling across Liberl, you go through what is essentially one huge dungeon, a different pace than usual). These doors aren't hard to find at all, and contain the big amount of side content, from long extended flashbacks, small little episodes focusing on a character or two, or even minigames (as frustrating as some of them may be, LOOKING AT YOU FISHING MINIGAME, YOU WITH YOUR CHEAP ASS).\n\nCombat wise...is pretty much the same as FC and SC. So if you're familiar with those systems than there's not much to be said. The big thing though, is that you have access to every single playable character across the trilogy including a couple of new ones. It was really fun coming up with team comps in this one considering the huge amount of options in this one. (btw, Richard is OP as hell. dude got like four turns in a row wtf)\n\nSo yeah, this game is excellent in it's own right, however make sure to play both FC and SC first!

Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC constitue two halves of the same story (as they were originally supposed to be one single, albeit huge game) and the latter delivered a great ending to the tale that began in the first game. \n\nSo what exactly is Trails in the Sky the 3rd? \n\n[h1]Story & Characters[/h1]\nTrails in the Sky the 3rd isn't quite the third chapter in the story (as the main plot threads were resolved in the previous game), rather it's more of a side-story/sequel/epilogue. It stars Kevin Graham , a character introduced in SC, as the main protagonist and features the return of the cast from the previous two games, alongside some other surprising characters. The story is largely centered around Kevin's character and if you happened to dislike him in SC then this game might end up changing your opinion of him. \n\nThe story also goes on to explore interesting plot points that the previous game alluded to and provides some great worldbulding to the already interesting world the games take place in. Throughout the game you'll come across mysterious doors, many of which showcase the characters' memories, providing some new insights into each one of them as well as some nice character development. Some doors also delve deeper into the series' lore and foreshadow future plot developments in the saga. Story-wise Trails in the Sky the 3rd is an important \"bridge\" that links the Trails in the Sky games to the later Trails games.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nTrails in the Sky the 3rd is something of a dungeon crawler in that most of the game is spent exploring dungeons, whilst visiting towns and interacting with NPCs is something you can only do in a very limited capacity, and unlike the first two games you can't do any quests. Without spoiling much Kevin and his partner Ries are stuck in another plane of existence called Phantasma and during the course of the game you'll explore its different sub-planes, some of them being brand new dungeons whilst others are alternate versions of past locales from the previous games. \n\nAlong the way you'll come across Seal Stones which contain different characters, meaning each stone you find grants you a new party member. The game features the largest amount of playable characters in the Trails in the Sky games and you can now select a character to act as a support character, each one providing you with different bonuses for the active party members.\n\nFast-travel is now an option, letting you travel between a hub zone to different stone monuments and doors scattered throughout Phantasma. The aforementioned doors are hidden throughout the sub-planes of Phantasma and you'll come across three different types: Star, Moon and Sun doors. Star and Moon doors are largely the same as both showcase memories and other plot-relevant scenarios, the only difference being that those acessed from Moon doors are longer. Sun doors on the other hand grant you access to mini-games, some of which are quite fun whilst others can be a bit of a chore.\n\nCombat now features new turn bonuses, some of which are quite deadly (for instance an attack dealing instant death in a turn), as well as new elemental weaknesses. These might not seems like massive new features but they do result in combat being more strategic than ever as the tide of battle can change in an instant.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nTrails in the Sky the 3rd features many returning tracks from the past two games alongside plenty of new music. The previous entries in the series had some pretty good music with a few standout tracks, particularly battle and boss themes. This game however might just have my favourite soundtrack in the series so far. The music does an excellent job at setting the tone and atmosphere of the locales you explore throughout the game, as well as being quite powerful during the story's most emotional parts. The soundtrack also features both my favourite battle theme (\"Determination of Fight\") and boss theme (\"Overdosing on Heavenly Bliss\") in the series. Overall a great soundtrack that really lends itself to the game's atmosphere!\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nI played both of the previous games on Hard difficulty and whilst that difficulty setting made the first game very enjoyable, the difficulty in the second was a lot less balanced with bosses having ridiculous stats, forcing me to retry (as well as use the retry offset to lower the difficulty) several times. In this game however, Hard difficulty is indeed balanced, even more so than in the first game. Normal encounters and boss battles offered just the right amount of challenge, forcing me to think and strategize. There were only two boss battles in the game in which I felt the need to use retry offset, and one of them in fact offered the chance to retry in a lower difficulty due to how hard it was (probably one of the hardest bosses in all of Trails). So yeah, no cheap bosses in this one (at least not as much as in the previous game).\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nTrails in the Sky the 3rd may not exactly be the third chapter in the Trails in the Sky story but is nonetheless and important game in the overall Trails saga. It focuses more on dungeon exploration than its predecessors but its gameplay improvements make it the funnest to play out of the three. It may also actually be the darkest of the Trails games, and foreshadows and sets up some very intriguing plot developments for future games in the series. In the end it also serves as an excellent epilogue for the cast of characters players have grown to love in the past two games.

On trouve des objets que l\u2019on peut combiner avec d\u2019autres objets pour ensuite r\u00e9soudre une \u00e9nigme. Petite touche de modernit\u00e9. Il est possible de voir tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments interactifs du d\u00e9cor en appuyant sur la touche espace.

It takes a while to get going before it slowly becomes surprisingly...eerie. Without giving too much away, all I'll say is that it's not exactly eerie in the Gabriel Knight way (even though Kathy Rain kinda resembles the famous New Orleans point 'n click protagonist with her hot bike and witty lines) but rather in the...Silent Hill/Lovecraft kinda way?! I've seen a lot of people throwing Twin Peaks around as a comparison, and even though I've never seen that show, it seems like an appropriate point of reference. In any case, be warned - there is a lot more here than the marketing is letting on. \n\nAlso be warned: the plot ends without answering half of the (VERY) weird questions that it provokes. It gets wrapped up in its own metaphors in the last hour and becomes one of those \"MAKE YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS!!!\" kind of things, which I usually hate, but in this instance... I still felt oddly satisfied at the end of my 10 hours? I think it's because the writing is solid, the puzzles are mostly enjoyable (especially some clever ones involving a computer) and Kathy herself turns out to be a very endearing protagonist that I would like to see more of. \n\nSo, a tad rough around the edges, but if you're in the mood for a suspenseful adventure game and don't mind some ambiguity this is pretty good.

However, I have to disagree with the Captain Kangaroo comment, 'relevant'. This is more of how teenagers of this decade speak, not in the '90s. \n\nI appreciate how you can click and they'll just continue on with their next line, animation is great story is great so far. Atmosphere is good, a lot really captures that '90s feel. I however have a few (perhaps unconventional) quirks:\n\n1.) Controller support.\n   - Now I know, it's a point-and-click, but simply mapping ESC to start, cursor to a thumbstick, left-click to 'A', right-click to 'X' goes a long way.\n\n2.) Fixed aspect ratio\n   - I know a lot of people don't agree with this, but to have the option would be great to me. I use an HTPC on a 60 inch so cropped screens just don't work for me. I think games look just as great stretched to the edge of the screen. Hell, I used to record television to VHS tapes, a little quality downgrade wouldn't be all that bad. 'As long as it works', as they say.\n\n3.) Launching game in Direct Draw mode does not allow for achievements pop up window. They register sometimes but you have no idea they happened. \n   - Edit: They're still not registering in Direct3D mode. I don't know what's going on here.\n\n4.) Better walking animations\n   - Kathy looks too much like a cardbord cutout while walking.\n\n5.) A recap option. I have started the game up and quit quickly because I don't know where I'm at.\n\n6.)

Bueno, sigue leyendo y saldr\u00e1s de dudas en un momento:\n\nPodr\u00edamos decir que Kathy Rain es una aventura gr\u00e1fica notable, con grandes particularidades que en cierto modo la hacen \u00fanica en ciertos aspectos. No hablo por hablar, he encontrado puzles bastantes originales que no hab\u00eda encontrado en otras aventuras graficas, y he jugado a cientos de ellas.\n\nLo primero que debes saber es que este juego tiene toda la esencia de los cl\u00e1sicos de los a\u00f1os 90, y muy particularmente a mi me record\u00f3 a dos t\u00edtulos imprescindibles: Laura Bow y la Daga de Amon Ra, y Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father. No es debido a que el argumento sea similar a estos juegos, sino por la esencia de los mismos. \n\nPor un lado me record\u00f3 a Laura Bow por el papel de investigadora de la protagonista, recabando pruebas e investigando su entorno mientras todo se volv\u00eda m\u00e1s enrevesado a cada paso que daba. La fuerte personalidad de la protagonista y su modo de afrontar los acontecimientos es algo a destacar como muy positivo.\n\nPor otro lado, me record\u00f3 a Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father por ese halo de misterio que embarga la aventura desde el primer momento. Misterio que te llevar\u00e1 de la mano y no te soltar\u00e1 hasta que no veas los cr\u00e9ditos finales. Sin duda, eso no es f\u00e1cil de lograr, y Kathy Rain lo consigue con una aparente facilidad y naturalidad encantadora.\n\nSi eres fan de este tipo de aventuras, Kathy Rain te encantar\u00e1. Eso seguro. Tanto los personajes, como las situaciones que va viviendo la protagonista, el argumento que va deshilach\u00e1ndose de su madeja de misterio, o los maravillosos gr\u00e1ficos estilo pixel art, son un aut\u00e9ntico canto y tributo a la \u00e9poca dorada de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas.\n\nPorque lo mejor de todo es que no tienes la sensaci\u00f3n de estar jugando a una aventura de 2016 que tiene aspecto gr\u00e1fico de los 90. La sensaci\u00f3n que tienes es que est\u00e1s jugando a una gran aventura gr\u00e1fica de los 90. Punto.\n\nNo quiero contarte demasiado sobre el argumento para que lo disfrutes como se merece. Tan solo mencionar que la aventura se sit\u00faa en los a\u00f1os 90 y que tomar\u00e1s el papel de Kathy Rain, una estudiante universitaria de periodismo de 2\u00ba curso, que marcha a un pueblo perdido de EEUU para asistir al funeral de su abuelo, el cual a partir de un momento determinado sufri\u00f3 un ataque que lo dej\u00f3 en estado casi vegetativo al volver de un paseo por los bosques que rodeaban la zona. A partir de ah\u00ed, nuestra protagonista comenzar\u00e1 a investigar qu\u00e9 sucedi\u00f3, y para ello deber\u00e1 remover el pasado de su abuelo, y el suyo propio.\n\nEl juego solo cuenta con un peque\u00f1o inconveniente, y es que no est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol a d\u00eda de realizar este an\u00e1lisis, pero seg\u00fan parece saldr\u00e1 una traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol antes de acabar el a\u00f1o. As\u00ed que si no eres una persona con demasiado nivel de ingl\u00e9s, pronto podr\u00e1s disfrutar de esta gran aventura en nuestro idioma y ya no habr\u00e1 ning\u00fan impedimento.\n\nComo tal el nivel de ingl\u00e9s no es para nada complejo, pero s\u00ed hay ciertos puzles directamente relacionados con el idioma. As\u00ed que si no controlas esta lengua, s\u00ed que podr\u00e1s encontrar algunas dificultades a la hora de resolverlos.\n\nY hablando de puzles, decir que el juego no es para nada dif\u00edcil, no presenta de manera general puzles enrevesados o il\u00f3gicos, y si habitualmente juegas aventuras gr\u00e1ficas, pr\u00e1cticamente ir\u00e1s avanzando por la historia sin mayores dificultades. Aunque si es cierto que en determinados momentos hay puzles de encontrar c\u00f3digos o similares que pueden presentar un reto bastante significativo. Lo cual es muy bueno, y adem\u00e1s son bastante imaginativos.\n\nOtra de las cosas que me ha impresionado, ha sido su doblaje. Es realmente bueno. Las voces son de una gran calidad y encajan perfectamente con todos y cada uno de los personajes. En este aspecto, el juego es de diez.\n\nLa m\u00fasica por otra parte, es bastante agradable, y se ajusta perfectamente a cada situaci\u00f3n. Aunque no es algo que recordar\u00e1s en el tiempo, cumple con gran soltura su papel.\n\nParticularmente me ha parecido una gran experiencia, y no solo dir\u00eda que \"ha nacido una nueva detective\" como reza el t\u00edtulo, sino que ha nacido una empresa desarrolladora que sabe hacer su trabajo y ha captado a la perfecci\u00f3n c\u00f3mo deben ser las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas y el camino que debe seguirse para ofrecer t\u00edtulos con gran calidad. Un diez para ellos por el trabajo realizado.\n\nPues con esto finaliza este analisis, espero que despu\u00e9s de haberte le\u00eddo est\u00e1s l\u00edneas tengas claro si este t\u00edtulo es o no es lo que estabas buscando. :)", "timestamp_created": 1512734088, "timestamp_updated": 1512734209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683074", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38112169": {"recommendationid": "38112169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040467880", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512482875}, "language": "english", "review": "Picked it up as part of a bundle.

The game is very well produced: the voice acting and dialogue stand out in particular, which really helps the player connect with the main character. It really has the look and feel of a mid-nineties product, which I imagine is what the developers intend.\n\nThe puzzles are fun - they never feel arbitrary and all the solutions obey the game's internal logic so there's always a good sense of reward on completion. However, for a seasoned veteran of old-school adventure games, they never really get too far into headscratcher territory, and some of them seem a little too easy. Sometimes this is because the character will drop hints during her narration. This does stop the puzzles from being unduly frustrating, but it does also mean you will solve them a lot quicker than you otherwise might. Part of the fun of the old classics were the gordion knots you had to unpick over a few days (or weeks). There aren't really any complex puzzle chains of the sort you'd find in Lucasarts classics either.\n\nThis does keep the story moving though, and here the game is fairly strong too. Without giving away any spoilers, Kathy Rain keeps just on the right side of cliche and touches some very adult themes. The atmosphere is more often one of unease and tension, rather than horror, and it does this well. That said, I did feel there were a few elements of the story that could have benefited from a deeper telling - and a longer game.\n\nKathy Rain should appeal to fans of adventure games and is a worthy addition to a point-and-click collection.

The characters, too, are tropes (an alcoholic tough-girl protoganist, her bland and always kind grandmother, a religious zealot villain) but at least the main concept of the story is original. \n\nKathy Rain would have benefited from having an editor. Most of the dialogue text is gratingly unnatural and it comes off as amateur, despite relatively strong voice acting. For instance, grandmothers don't always need to say things like \"Oh, child\" to convey that they are indeed grandmothers, and the characters' reactions as the plot unfolds are often one-dimensional.

Do you remember how, after Lost became the new hot thing on TV, a lot of shows sorta tried copying its thing of seven-layered mysteries the audience was supposed to try to figure out, but it was all smoke and mirrors to hide the fact that the writers and producers themselves were lost (pun not intended) on what their show was about? Hell, do you remember watching Lost's finale and figuring out its producers and writers didn't figure out what their show should be about? That's how I feel about Kathy Rain's ending, with the caveat/relief that I spent five hours of my life instead of six years. To use an in-game image, it's a 2-d image of a sinkhole trying very hard to trick you into thinking it has a lot of depth when it's in fact paper-thin.

Das Spiel sieht aus wie ein Point\u2019N\u2019Click Adventure aus den 90ern (Beispiel: \u201eMonkey Islande\u201c, \u201eSam\u2019n\u2019Max: Hit the Road\u201c oder \u201eDay of the Tentacle\u201c) und spielt sie wie ein Mystery-Krimi/Thriller. Es \u00fcbernimmt den Grafikstyle und so sieht man, zum Beispiel, wie ein Charakter aus dem Hintergrund der Kamera entgegenl\u00e4uft. Die Figur f\u00e4ngt mit l\u00e4cherlichen (circa) 2x6 Pixelgr\u00f6\u00dfe an bis sie auf ihre normale Spritgr\u00f6\u00dfe kommt. Der Charakter bleibt aber durchweg minimal. Am Detailliertesten bekommt man ihn erst im Portr\u00e4t zu sehen, wenn er spricht.\n\nZugegeben, der 90er Jahre Charme kommt mehr vom Aussehen des Spiels als vom Inhalt, aber an einigen Stellen merkt man es, dass das nicht unsere Zeit stammt. Handy gibt es nicht und jeder Haushalt hat noch Telefonbuch neben seinem Telefon bei dem man im \u00dcbrigen erst den H\u00f6rer abheben muss bevor man eine Nummer eingeben kann. Verr\u00fcckt! Die Geschichte selbst dreht sich um Kathy Rain, die von ihrer Mitbewohnerin an der Uni erfahren hat, dass ihr Gro\u00dfvater gestorben ist. Kathy hat ihn seit ihrer Kindheit nicht mehr gesehen und weil ihre Familienverh\u00e4ltnisse kompliziert sind, f\u00fchlt sie sich mit ihm noch am meisten Verbunden. Sie findet heraus, dass etwas ungew\u00f6hnlicher vor seinem Tod vorgefallen ist und ehe sie sich versieht, ist sie dabei aufzukl\u00e4ren was es damit auf sich hat und erledigt den Fall, den die Polizei vor einigen Jahren fallen gelassen hat. Die Kirschengemeinde in der Kleinstadt hat was damit zu tun und ist anderes als sie vorgibt zu sein.\n\nDie Geschichte nimmt gut Fahrt auf und bleibt durchweg spannenden, auch am Ende die Story leicht schwammig wird. Das Ende ist aber auf jeden Fall nach vollziehbar und ist wegen des genialen Rests verziehen. Zum genialen Rest z\u00e4hlen auch die Charaktere. Sie sind sch\u00f6n geschrieben. Das Spiel f\u00e4llt aber auch mit den Figuren. Wenn man keine Rebellin aus den 90ern spielen m\u00f6chte, die direkt ist, Motorrad f\u00e4hrt, raucht und keine Hand vorm Mund nimmt, wird gegeben Falls weniger Spa\u00df am Spiel haben.

I appreciate the nostalgia, as I was a teenager in 1995 (when the game is set) and I played a lot of games back then that employed the same pixelated style Kathy Rain does. I love a good point and click as well, and this game did entertain me. However, I felt that much like Oxenfree, Kathy Rain leads up to a conclusion that's just not much of a conclusion. \n\nFor example, I spent the entire game very suspicious of Kathy's grandparents. Her grandmother just seemed too sweet, and at one point you hear a phone message from Kathy's mom about how they're sick people and they need to stay away. Maybe, I thought, that indicated a second story taking place underneath the more obvious narrative, Maybe we would glean something from Kathy's mother, or find a clue that would alert us to the fact that something shady was going on. Indeed in the last act when she meets her grandfather in her hallucination, the picture of him on the wall keeps turning to a corpse's grinning face. \n\nBut no. Everything is exactly as it seems, and things like Kathy being pissed at her dad and forced to commit her mom are just there to appear for like half a second in the final act. Also the pixelated nature of the game, while charming, does make certain scenes that are meant to be poignant or horrifying seem comical. I mean, can you really take a hanging seriously when it's in pixels? How about an aborted child holding DNC equipment to his neck? Some characters you've come to care for never appear again after a certain point, either. Where the hell is Sue, in the last couple of chapters? I had come to care about her, and yet I never saw her again for no discernable reason. \n\nAlso, the puzzles are at once too restrictive, and too difficult. There is a point in one of the chapters where you have to get a washed up bum to act out a scene for the nurse on duty at the local clinic. You're then supposed to come up behind him and shock him with the taser, so you can pass it off as a seizure and get the nurse to leave her post. Who the hell thinks of doing something like that? Not me, apparently, since I had to go for a guide over that one. The easier puzzles sometimes have a lot of hand holding (Kathy can't ask about or show certain things at many points in the story) and yet the difficult ones have almost none. \n\nThat said I think the voice acting was generally good, though the grandmother does approach chewing scenery once or twice. It's fun and it did draw me in for the duration.

It's not necessarily about the characters' different personalities, but more about the way in which the player can choose their dialogue. If I want Rosa to be sassy, I can make her say sassy things. If I want her to be mean, I can make her say mean things. If I want her to be kind, I can do that too: Rosa is a more more well-rounded character. Kathy felt more flat in comparison. \nKathy can be unnecessary brutal towards people. Sometimes you can choose between being nice and being savage, however, there are many times that you'll get a dialogue \"choice\", but all the choices are the same. (For example: when [spoiler]Lenny asks Kathy out[/spoiler], not only does the player not have the option to accept, but all of Kathy's rejections are mean as well.) Why do I have to be mean all the time? I wanna be able to choose which characters to be mean to according to my likes and dislikes. Having the ability to choose makes me feel more connected to the player character.\n\nI'm not saying I wanted more choice-and-consequence or a branching narrative in conjunction with my choices. Going back to the Blackwell series: none of Rosa's answers in those situations will change the way NPCs behave towards the player character. But they did change how I felt towards Rosa, made me feel closer to her. These choices are not about furthering the narrative, but about conveying different emotions.\n\nLook, I don't know how to end this rant. I literally just finished the game half an hour ago. I'll have to think about it a bit more and come back to this.\nSuffice it to say: I liked the game, but I wish it were a bit... more. Maybe in the next installment. eh?\n\n\nOther thoughts: \n- The visuals are stunning. Clearly the best part about this game.\n- The voice acting is pretty good; however, some VAs clearly have not had a lot of training/experience when it comes to unnecessary mouth noises (lip smacking and such), which I found pretty distracting. Especially when it comes to the priest, cause he talks a lot, and I don't need to hear his saliva, thank you very much.\n- Sometimes has a case of the Adventure Game Logic when it comes to puzzles. Like, how come the guy I tazered talked to me cordially when I bumped into him again later? Why is he not scared of me now?

The comparisons to Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father are unavoidable, and both excel at different aspects. \n\nOverall, the characters are better and the story is much more \u201chuman\u201d. The \u201cmystery\u201d and supernatural elements aren\u2019t quite as good, though; GK was about Voodoo and had lots of freaky, unnerving experiences (the nightmares, the symbolism, the professor incident, the man outside the window, the burial wheel, etc.). KR\u2019s supernatural elements are a peculiar blend of Christianity and Paganism, and the antagonists are comparatively drab. The more human dramatics are much more compelling, though, and that's where KR excels. \n\nExcluding the antagonists (Malia and Tetelo are more interesting antagonists than their KR counterparts), every other character is on par or more interesting. Gabriel Knight is a standard hero plus witty and lascivious plus Southern accent, but not much else, while Kathy Rain is similarly witty and fun, but also deeply wounded in real ways. E is comparable to Grace in being the research assistant, but Grace is too much of a Mary Sue. KR\u2019s grandmother is more emotionally complex as well, where as GK\u2019s grandmother was solely generic sweetness tinged with sadness.  \n\nStrangely, there don\u2019t appear to be any failures. Far as I can tell, it\u2019s impossible to die or progress in a way that makes the game unwinnable (for better or worse). The worst that can happen is that you might be temporarily stalled before figuring something out, which only seems possible if completely not paying attention. This isn't overtly obvious until the end, but it does take some tension out of the game. A few times I tried to induce a failure condition only to find Kathy wouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nLike any similar games, there\u2019s going to be a few puzzles that are absolute fuckery. This game has two; the audio editing portion and the safe/mausoleum. Both are doable, but tedious enough to ruin the flow of the story; might as well look up the walkthrough for just those two incidents and you won\u2019t lose anything. The rest of the time, Kathy is dropping almost too many hints; makes for a shorter game experience, and the occasional feeling of the game just telling you what to do. \n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1506309691, "timestamp_updated": 1506309691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35187685": {"recommendationid": "35187685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055741496", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506264074}, "language": "french", "review": "Un petit bien sympa quoiqu'un peu court et un peu trop facile par endroit.\nL'ambiance 90 est tr\u00e8s bien rendu et tous les nostalgiques des P&C de cet \u00e9poque (genre Indiana Johns et la derni\u00e8re croisade) y trouveront leur compte.\n\nMention particuli\u00e8re aux r\u00e9f\u00e9rences Lynchienne et \u00e0 l'ambiance Twin Peaks qui s'en d\u00e9gage, on sent qu'il y a de vrais fans!\n\"Les hiboux ne sont pas ce qu'ils semblent...\"", "timestamp_created": 1506277345, "timestamp_updated": 1506277345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35176716": {"recommendationid": "35176716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049244519", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503874176}, "language": "german", "review": "+", "timestamp_created": 1506248351, "timestamp_updated": 1506248351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35175632": {"recommendationid": "35175632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161107554", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506244992}, "language": "english", "review": "The game play was so simplistic but the story line and the puzzles made it a challenge.

What follows is the typical point & click process of investigating locations, talking to everyone, picking up items, and solving puzzles. What sets Kathy Rain apart is the pretty pixel art, interesting story, solid writing, good voice acting, and intelligent puzzles that naturally lead into the next.\n\nThe pixel art is very well done, particularly given the AGS engine's 320x240 resolution. My favorite part, and a very pleasant surprise, is that the far more detailed character portraits change to reflect the people's emotions. Characters will smile, or smirk, or frown, or roll their eyes during conversations, and it really serves to bring already detailed characters to life. The good voice acting helps a lot with that as well.\n\nThe story was slow to get started, but interesting, and had me guessing as to where it was going and what was going to happen next. The characters were likewise interesting. The protagonist, Kathy Rain, was particularly enjoyable to play as, with tons of personality - I loved her comments, observations, and dialog choices. The writing was good, and ranged competantly from funny to sad. This is one of the few games that made me laugh, and I laughed often due to the sharp and witty writing.\n\nThe puzzles are logical, and well connected, such that the solution to one puzzle intelligently leads you to the next. The game helps keep you on track with notes / conversation topics in your notebook, and by keeping the inventory largely limited to useful items and greying out locations that you are finished with. There's no pixel hunting due to being able to highlight objects of interest, and there's a clever \"Think about\" function that serves to both provide backstory and hints as to what the item might be used for. The puzzles are pleasantly on the easy side, though there is a noticeble difficulty spike about 75% of the way through.\n\nI did get stuck three times, about 75-80% of the way through where the difficulty spiked. One code puzzle I just needed a hint for, one I missed that an object had a gained new interaction ability that it didn't previously have, and the third was a poem / riddle that were so vague as to leave me completely stumped and reaching for a walkthrough.\n\nI also encountered some initial technical issues due to the AGS engine. It failed to start when set to automatic resolution as it tried a resolution that was way too big. When manually setting the resolution, fullscreen would stretch the game out even though I had black bars enabled in the launcher. I had to set the game to run in a window to finally make it work.\n\nOverall, Kathy Rain is a great point and click adventure game, one of the best I played.

In dieser kleinen Nische f\u00fcr Ewig-Junggebliebene versteckt sich auch \u201eKathy Rain\u201c (= KR), und was soll man noch gro\u00dfartig dazu sagen, au\u00dfer, dass es ein durch und durch klassisches Abenteuer (inklusive altbackenem Komfort) ist, so wie man es sich als Alt-Fan besagten Genres nur w\u00fcnschen kann.\n\nIhren m\u00e4chtigen Kater ausschlafen, mehr m\u00f6chte Protagonistin und Journalismus-Studentin Kathy Rain an diesem Tage gar nicht. Doch dazu kommt sie nicht als sie vom Tod ihres Gro\u00dfvaters erf\u00e4hrt. Dieser unsch\u00f6ne Anlass bringt sie nach vielen Jahren wieder an ihren Geburtsort Conwell Springs zur\u00fcck, an welchem sie eigentlichen nix h\u00e4lt. Doch abgesehen von der Trauer sind der viele Jahre zur\u00fcckliegende Unfall ihres Opas und dessen allgemein mit vielen Geheimnissen erf\u00fclltes Leben welche sie nicht sofort wieder abziehen lassen. Ihr detektivischer Sp\u00fcrsinn wittert etwas Au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliches, und so forscht sie \u00fcber die  Vergangenheit ihres dahingeschiedenen Gro\u00dfvaters, wobei sie auf Hinweise einer \u00fcbernat\u00fcrlichen Macht als auch verdr\u00e4ngte Erinnerungen aus ihrer eigene Kindheit st\u00f6\u00dft\u2026\n\nW\u00e4re KR so vor 25 Jahren erschienen, es h\u00e4tte problemlos in der Gesellschaft von Spiel-Ikonen wie Guybrush Threepwood, Larry Laffer und Co. bestanden. Es ist nicht allein der Nostalgie-Bonus, es punktet auch mit einer gut durchdachten Story die Spannungsmomente und Humoreinlagen gut miteinander verkn\u00fcpft, und die Titelfigur mit frecher Klappe, Bike und Nikotin-Sucht bricht wie mancher ihrer gestandenen \u201eKollegen\u201c auch mit g\u00e4ngigen Helden-Konventionen, was sie vielleicht deswegen auch gleich so ursympathisch und erinnerungsw\u00fcrdig macht. \u00dcberraschend kommt noch hinzu dass KR mit zugehendem Ende sogar mit einzelnen \u2013 teilweise unerwartet drastischen - Schockmomenten aufwartet.\n\nDas Spiel atmet den puren Zeitgeist der 1980er/1990er. Spielmechanisch wie auch inhaltlich. Die Spielstory selbst ist ungef\u00e4hr im gleichen Zeitraum angesiedelt, was sehr sch\u00f6n an der Technik (Computer mit Diskettenlaufwerken, R\u00f6hrenmonitore, Fax-Modem, Nadeldrucker, \u2026) und einigen popkulturellen Zitaten \u2013 hat da jemand TNG gesagt ??? - zu erkennen ist die hier Einzug halten. Und auch designtechnisch entspricht KR einer Zeitreise ins vergangene Spiele-Jahrhundert: VGA-pixelige Hintergr\u00fcnde und Sprites, deutlich abgestufte (und nicht sonderlich zahlreiche) Animationen, 4:3-Modus, und nirgends ein Hauch von Modernisierung. Die Entwickler halten konsequent am Oldie-Feeling fest, was Adventure-Hasen meiner Generation nur allzu dankend annehmen. Mit der handgemachten, wenngleich oftmals recht statischen Optik, melodisch recht einfachen, aber passenden Musikst\u00fccken und einer guten Auswahl f\u00e4higer O-Ton-Sprecher wird auch die grundlegende Stimmung gut getroffen. Die deutsche Text-\u00dcbersetzung ist weitgehend rechtschreibfehlerfrei, muss allerdings mit jedem neuem Spielstart abermals aktiviert werden, da KR aus Gewohnheit immer auf die englischen Ursprache zur\u00fcckstellt.\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad der R\u00e4tsel bewegt sich im einfachen bis mittlerem Feld, nur zwei Kopfn\u00fcsse auf die man st\u00f6\u00dft fallen etwas fordernder aus. Das einzige Zugest\u00e4ndnis an die Moderne bildet hier eine R\u00e4tselhilfe in Form einer Hotspot-Funktion via Tastendruck, um auch Genre-Neulinge wegen wom\u00f6glicher \u00dcberforderung nicht zu vergraulen. \n\nFazit:\nKR gleicht nicht nur jenen Point&Click-Grafik-Adventures aus Urzeiten, es wird auch den damit verbundenen Erwartungen gealteter Genre-Fans mehr als gerecht.

Et, quoi de mieux pour \"faire son deuil\" que de se lancer dans une autre aventure palpitante ? Je suis donc partie \u00e0 la recherche d'une exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s similaire, \u00e0 savoir un jeu \u00e0 la saveur \"old-school\".

Kathy Rain.\n\nEt pourquoi avoir choisi ce dernier plut\u00f4t que ces autres titres dont la r\u00e9putation n'est plus \u00e0 faire ? Tr\u00e8s sinc\u00e8rement, je ne sais pas moi m\u00eame.

Peut \u00eatre que le visionnage des trailers accompagn\u00e9s de cette musique magnifique, envo\u00fbtante, a fini de me convaincre ? Ou peut \u00eatre est-ce simplement mon intuition qui me disait de soutenir les d\u00e9veloppeurs en achetant leur tout premier jeu, car, si elle s'av\u00e9rait, cela pourrait donner naissance \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie, qui je suis s\u00fbre, deviendra culte ? Car oui, selon moi, Kathy Rain n'a rien \u00e0 envier aux classiques du genre. Avec une histoire bien \u00e9crite, touchante, intriguante et myst\u00e9rieuse, des personnages attachants, et surtout, surtout une sublime bande son aux tons m\u00e9lancoliques, nostalgiques enveloppant et magnifiant le tout, ce fut une exp\u00e9rience marquante, inoubliable dans ma petite vie de passionn\u00e9e de jeux vid\u00e9o.

Je les ai trouv\u00e9 bien pens\u00e9es, \u00e9quilibr\u00e9es, jamais illogiques, plaisantes et, ce qui est fort appr\u00e9ciable, on ne s'encombre jamais d'une rimbambelle d'objets dont les combinaisons farfelues sont souvent des moyens d\u00e9tourn\u00e9s de rallonger la dur\u00e9e de vie, non, ici, on va \u00e0 l'essentiel, ce qui ne veut dire pour autant que la difficult\u00e9 est laiss\u00e9e pour compte.

Au contraire, j'ai pris plaisir \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir ce charmant petit monde de Conwell Springs, truff\u00e9 de clins d'oeil aux oeuvres des ann\u00e9es 90, (selon Kathy, les \"hiboux sont simplement ce que l'on pense quils sont\", comprenne qui pourra ;) ), les d\u00e9cors \u00e9tant soign\u00e9s et plaisant \u00e0 parcourir et les jeux de lumi\u00e8res tout aussi beaux et r\u00e9ussis.\n\nLa dur\u00e9e est dans la moyenne du genre, bien que le sentiment d'arriver trop vite au g\u00e9n\u00e9rique de fin est in\u00e9vitable si l'on se pla\u00eet aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de notre Kathy bien aim\u00e9e...\n\nBref, une belle aventure que je n'oublierai pas de si t\u00f4t et qui fait maintenant partie de mes favorites.

Her good girl dorm mate Eileen brings into her attention that a certain \"Joseph Rain\" just passed away and whether he may be related to Kathy or not. He sure was - no other than Kathy's grandfather to be precise. Taking the news, Kathy takes off to attend the funeral, which opens a gate to her troubled past at the same time. As she investigates the recent demise and prior ailment of her grandfather which left him confided to a wheelchair, Kathy comes in contact with an uncanny mystery engulfing each and every corner of the silent, sleepy town of Conwell.\n\nThe storyline begins as an interesting enough detective mystery, yet quickly deviates from that context to take a seemingly supernatural path. Yet, under the layer of the supernatural, the game is - in my humble opinion - is a brilliant example for a psychoanalytical concept: the self and the shadow. According to Jungian psychology, every person bears an archetypal unconscious aspect that would be instinctual, illogical and wrapped in darkness; a mirroring opposite to our light, our self and the consciousness. This part is completely speculative on my behalf, and may contain spoilers, so feel free to skip to the next paragraph. [spoiler]Kathy's journey and her experiences throughout the game, are majorly symbolic acts of self-confrontation. The fictional red scythe flowers serve as hallucinogens which may be used for many psychedelic experiences of transcendence or self-discovery journeys - which explains most of Kathy's \"supernatural\" experiences. Thus, her main antagonist is herself all along, and all other figures are the ones that try to take similar journeys like her, yet failing to make peace with their own shadows. The antagonistic \"Crimson One\" is the personification for the hallucinogen flower itself. We already know that both Kathy's parents were somewhat into the consumption of the same drug also. Other characters involved, and their experiences may be explained in a similar manner. Yet, these are all my own speculations and interpretations. In the end, Kathy faces all her demons - her father's departure, her mother's insanity and her guilt driven from committing her into an asylum, the abortion, even not being able to be a part of her grandfather's life - and prevails. Thus, she leaves the hole and destroys the source of these symbolic drugs, preventing anyone who wouldn't be willful enough to face their own demons coming into harm.[/spoiler]\n\nKathy surely is not the most interesting of protagonists as we start, but as the game progresses, the storyline delivers. There are layers under her seemingly embittered and sarcastic personality, which makes her a realistic, even relatable character. Her relationship with Eileen is especially admirable, since she tries to protect her as if she is trying to protect her own extracted innocence. I regret that other characters were not as fleshed out as I would like, but they all serve their purpose within the plot.\n\nWe are familiar with the AGS engine already, and it is spectacular to see that the pixelated texture can present such admirable environment artwork and character designs. The game world itself was somewhat limited and the game time was short here, yet it is a great demonstration for the capabilities of the developer team. Voice acting, is really wondrous, with sincere emotions and character appropriate toning too, but since Dave Gilbert himself was responsible of that department, no less could be expected.\n\nThe gameplay? Well, it does not contain the most brilliant of puzzles, and sure has its logical impossibilities - like a scanner capable of copying sound files from cassette tapes, during 90s nonetheless - but I'd say it is quite alright as a whole. If you listen to the narrative itself and remarks made by characters all around, I'd say that you wouldn't have a hard time overall. It would probably take no longer than 5 hours or so to go through a complete playthrough, 6 if you'd go back for the achievements you've missed.\n\nAt the end of the day, sure, I'd recommend Kathy Rain but I'd also advise to take a %50 discount. The game is lovely, but it doesn't contain any replay value and quite short of an experience for the full price. I sincerely hope that we'd see a new adventure from Kathy in the future, which may explain various plot details that never see the light of day in this one.

It seemed like there should have been quite a bit more time and thought put into explaining the mystery behind the supernatural occurances in the game and simply put, it just feels like the game's ending has a lot of loose ends and really leaves you haning with too many questions left unanswered.

Its wittiness, style, humor, main characters, dialogues and pacing is exemplary and make Kathy Rain a good game, while the overall story, puzzles and side characters and cliffhanger / episodic nature have a lot of problems, which drags the game down a bit.\n \nIt all starts with a mystery, when Kathy Rain, a likeably cynical, suspicious young woman that is difficult to connect with others, goes back to her small hometown to witness the burial of her grandfather, who was paralyzed and died under strange circumstances. Kathy decides to put a fedora on and pursue her own investigation into what happened with her grandfather and the hidden history of her hometown.\n\nMade in AGS engine, pixel graphics are highly detailed and made with a lot of care that you\u2019ll regularly stop to enjoy the scenery. It does have a widescreen support, but due to the age of AGS engine, it looks unnaturally stretched out, which might irk some players. The animations are basic; they definitely don\u2019t have the same amount of details as the graphical presentation does. Kathy and her trusty sidekick, Elaine are well-developed and unique characters, both narratively and visually. Kathy is of course the star of the show, with a lot of character layers and quirks, as well as buried secrets that are both the source of her strength and weakness. Kathy\u2019s family that plays a prominent role in the story is also made of likeable individuals with their own traits and shortcomings. And last but not the least: Goober is such a great character that he deserves his own spin-off adventure game. Developers, make it happen :) The banter between these characters is a joy to listen/read and the voice acting is for the most part amazing, with special mentions going to actors of Kathy and Goober. Did I mention we need a Goober adventure game already :D The game is short and holds attentions throughout the entire playthrough and it will take you about 4-6 hours to complete it. And it is another reason to make a Goober adventure!\n\nOn the other side, Kathy Rain\u2019s biggest drawback is the lackluster story that builds up until the last 30 minutes and then it ends without answering most of the questions you\u2019ll have during Kathy\u2019s investigation. The supernatural aspect and its lore is not compelling and well-introduced enough to be interesting, and the story just abruptly deflates without any meaningful payoff. If you look at the whole thing metaphorically, you could say that the story is simple and complete, but if you are like me, and you chase for the \u201cthe devil lies in the details\u201d aspect, you\u2019ll find the screenplay is just not good enough and self-contained, especially since this was not meant to be an episodic experience that can allow to cut its story to little pieces for future instalments. I am sure an adventure with Goober would solve all this issues, though. Except the first, mausoleum and the last puzzle that are excellent, all other puzzles are quite basic and aren\u2019t fun, especially the hacker puzzle :( but this is not a huge minus since even adventure game legends suffer from this. Let\u2019s make that Goober game already!!\n\nAs a game made by a single developer, Kathy Rain turned out to be a good and fun adventure and dev deserves congratulations for it.

At the same time, the third season of Twin Peaks is on and I have suffered some withdrawal symptoms waiting for new episodes. So, a game that combines elements from Lynchian mysteries and classic point-and-click games seemed like a gift from heavens and I definitely wasn't disappointed. This is one of the best written small games I remember playing and that's saying a lot, because I'm a huge consumer of this genre. The voice cast is great, pixel graphics are beautiful and there's just enough music to create the right kind of atmosphere to each scene. If you are used to playing the earlier LucasArts games you might find the puzzles in this game to be relatively easy, but I was positively suprised to find that finally someone might have found a good balance between annoyingly straightforward puzzles (newer Telltale Games...) and stumpers that almost force rookies to google for some hints. In my opinion, even extremely story-driven games should provide at least some challenge.\n\nOnly some very minor things to whine about like annoyingly slow walking animations (that you have to watch every single time you arrive or leave a location!) and some pointless loose ends in the narrative.

Many parts of the story are left unresolved, but I sense that's a combination of two deliberate decisions: the possibility of continuing the story later, and the fact that really complicated mysteries shouldn't just be wrapped up with a little bow on them.

I'm not much into point&click adventure games, but i most certainly am into good stories, and this one was plain captivating, much due to the amazing main (and - to a high enough degree - side) characters, marvelous script and outstanding voice acting. \n\nThe plot grips you tight and won't let go until it's all over. And when it is, you feel so connected to Kathy it hurts to leave. Because, in addition to being a highly-likeable, witty, rebellious character packed with some charming and cunning foul language, she has some deep background and progresses as a person enormously along the storyline.\n\nAnother point this game nailed is the riddles: they are diverse, they make you think and leave you with a comfy satisfying feeling once solved, and, on top of it, all of them ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE. During the playthrough I could barely even once feel the irritation of being lost or unaware of what to do or where to go at that point.\n\nThere is one detail about the plot I feel uncertain of though. It is the fair portion of supernatural being involved into a seemingly-at-first detective story. The further you're in, the more plot swerves off into some eerie and fairly grim as-s s-hit (the darkest moments even reminded me of The Cat Lady, despite the two games being stylistically light years apart).\nAs long as it contributes to the intrigue, it's not a bad thing per se, but the lack of explanation leaves a mild taste of incompleteness, which, however, fails to spoil the overall satisfaction. Popular belief goes this is to prepare a solid premise for a sequel, which I'll be eagerly looking to.\n\nOverall rating: 1995/1995, would 'electrify' a bum's live performance about a romance with his own bladder with a stun gun again any day anytime.", "timestamp_created": 1499538903, "timestamp_updated": 1499541813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541176", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33376686": {"recommendationid": "33376686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367102255", "num_games_owned": 674, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494111498}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0448\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440. \u0423\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435. \u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430. \u0416\u0430\u043b\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u043f\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430, \u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b. \u041d\u0443 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u044f \u0435\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0438\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e.", "timestamp_created": 1499526071, "timestamp_updated": 1500152006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33375187": {"recommendationid": "33375187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283593691", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499522411}, "language": "english", "review": "A decent point-and-click game but it got into a very weird sci-fi-religion plot towards the end.

Calling this game \"A Detective is Born\" does not do it justice.\n\nFor those who grew up loving LucasArts and those who enjoy the games of WadjetEye, this is a no brainer. I marvel at how refined pixel games are starting to look. When the game goes for pretty....it's really nice. When it wants to be creepy...it is possibly the most disturbing thing I have every seen...and I thought The Last Door was creepy. The game plays as a standard point and click, with easy controls. The soundtrack is very fitting to the game.\n\nKathy is a strong, irreverant, foul-mouthed, bitter young 20 something year old, and I love her to death. I have seen other anti-heroes who have bad attitutes for the sake of the game, and I HATE that; but Kathy has good reason for being the way she is. Life has happened to her, and it hasn't always been kind. In fact it never really has. Kathy feels like a real person, thanks to the incredible vocal performance. She can be funny, tough as nails, and genuinely concerned. She grows TREMENDOUSLY through the game. I don't want to tell how because of major story spoilers. She is just a well written character who, along with how great the game looks, make this game work.\n\nKathy is surrounded by some great side characters who give good performances. All round, I really liked the voice acting and the script. Apart from the sci-fi/religion conspiracy gamey plot, the personal relationships between the people of this game felt very genuine. The family drama in this game had me in tears, since it can be extremely relatable. \n\nThis is no point and click for the kiddos, or even the teens for that matter. This game deals in some very serious subject matter: teen suicide, teen abortion, abandonment, and being ostracized from loving familly members. The consequences of these choices are fleshed out, and at times it was hard to sit through. The language is extremely colorful. Kathy has got a mouth on her (lot of f-bombs), but what bothered me was the c**t bomb. That I felt was the writers wanting to be edgy so they gave a bad acting NPC a line with that word. It was only a moment, but it was a moment wasted trying to be edgy, and it stuck with me long enough that I felt I had to write about, so there.\n\nOverall, this game was very enjoyable, in a reflective kind of way. To call it a detective story to me doesn't do it justice. It's more of a \"solve a family mystery that is affecting the whole town while dealing with personal demons\" kind of game.

La mayor\u00eda de los puzzles no son exageradamente complicados, y la historia logra mantener el inter\u00e9s hasta el final. La protagonista, y en general todos los personajes, aunque unos son m\u00e1s planos que otros, son muy interesantes y realistas.

Kathy es uno de los personajes femeninos mejor construidos que he visto nunca, y he logrado empatizar much\u00edsimo con ella.

Turns out it was her grandpa. She goes to the funeral and talks with her grandma. She learns that her grandpa was in vegetative state since an accident in 1981 (game's current year is 1995), but something was odd: medical exams showed his brain was totally fine, despite his symptoms of brain damage. Then the game actually starts: Kathy wants to discover what actually happened to her grandpa.\n\nKathy begins as your standard misfit that smokes, drinks and drives an older-than-her bike that looks like she's part of a biker gang. As the game develops, you see her kind and worried side.\n\nGame mechanics:\nIt's a pretty standard point and click. You have a bag with items, a notebook with \"things you want to talk about with people\" and a list of contacts whom you can call to. You can combine items (like a tape and a tape recorder/player to listen to it, or your cigarete with your lighter to smoke), as well as use items on objects (key on door).\n\nReview:\nPros:\n- It touches some heavy subjects, like a teenager aborting, suicides, kathy's parents (you'll get it) and some other dark sh*t\n- The game hasn't an autoplay mode, meaning you either think about the clues you have until now and do what you have to do or just try everything (which would be exhaustive, don't). Some point & click have too many clues that make the game being all about \"Click this place. Now click this. Now this.\"\n- The mystery goes really far and touches religious subjects. I'm a fan of these approachs.\n- The MC is actually charismatic and has many fun dialogues and rude answers, including to priests and the sheriff. Oh and she carries a taser.\n\nCons:\n- In a lazy gameplay, I ended the story in 7 hours. That means most of the story and character development is actually made in your mind, not by the game itself. The touches in heavy subjects are mostly shallow due this lack of time.\n- Even though it doesn't have clues every freaking moment, the puzzles are pretty easy and the course of actions is rather obvious most of the time. \n- Again, the 7h gameplay doesn't let the game have a great character development. Although you see Kathy growing as the game moves and see her sides, it's too fast.\n- (SPOILER OF ONE \"PUZZLE\") You put a TAPE on a SCANNER to get the audio sound into your computer. That made me go \"WTF?\" Then Kathy goes on and tells me that putting fire on a wood door that i want to open is not logical. GOSH\n\nOverall:\nFor the price, it's enjoyable as a casual game. Don't try finding a challenging puzzle-investigative game nor a master piece character development. It's a casual point and click game to spend time. It's worth it with at least 33% off, imo.

I was drawn in from the very beginning and really got a feel for the setting of game and the people who inhabit it. I actually cared about the characters, and they really all did seem quite fleshed out, from the protagonist Kathy to her roommate Eileen, Goober the homeles man and even Hacker Dave, who's only spoken to on the phone. \n\nPossible spoilers (really just about the feel of the game):\nSome people have complained in reviews that the game takes a turn and devolves into \"magic/supersition/supernatural\" themes, but really the story can be read however you want to read it. The game deals with serious themes from mental illness to drug use and suicide, and any allusions to the supernatural could easily be read as forming some allegory to traumatic struggles in life. \n\nOverall, this is a great adventure game with strong writing and a real Twin Peaks / Stranger Things / 90s nostalgia vibe. It's pretty short, and can be finished in under 5 hours, but I got it for $4 on sale and it was certainly worth all of that. \n\n7.5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1498920262, "timestamp_updated": 1498920262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33081969": {"recommendationid": "33081969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124777326", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498912153}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent point and click game that feels straight out of the 90's.

We play as Kathy Rain, a slightly stereotypical biker with an attitude and no-nonsense personality, who must figure out the event that unfolded up to her grandfather's death. The puzzles range in difficulty, from pretty easy to slightly out-of-the-box. I wouldn't say any puzzle is especially difficult, but I did find myself stumped for a little while on two or three of them. One puzzle, which should have been easy, was difficult because I didn't pick up the required item earlier in the game... which then lead me to visit every location and try clicking on everything until I found the necessary item (this was a bit tedious). Overall, puzzles aren't difficult. As for the story: it begins reasonable enough but, in my personal opinion, goes off in a direction that I wasn't expecting and (honestly) I wasn't that impressed with. I won't spoil anything, but I imagine the story will be amazing to half the audience and will land flat to the other half. Unfortunately, it felt like the latter to me.

I don't usually write reviews, so this could be a little janky, but bear with me 'cause I think this is worthwhile to say.\n\n--Characters and World\n\nThis game shines in characterbuilding. Not a single person (except one who is meant to be) feels out of place or annoying to encounter, and Kathy as a character both suits the position she's found herself in and has a personality you immediately recognize (Jerk with a Heart of Gold). She makes for an excellent protagonist, equally intelligent and witty with a personality that not only shows through her dialogue, but also through the solutions to some of the more impromptu puzzles you face. Rarely does she overstep believable bounds, and even the clues she gives you about objects you find do not come off as patronizing.\n\nIn other words, the voice acting and writing is spot-on, just as it needs to be for a story-driven point'n'click puzzler.\n\nNot much needs to be said about the world, as it is for all intents and purposes semi-rural America, before cellphones were invented. Nothing noteworthy is changed, a few things are added (related to the plot), but otherwise it is entirely vanilla and well-represented. \n\n--Puzzles and Difficulty\n\nDifficulty curve is notoriously hard to judge when it comes to puzzles, and often one individual will find some easier than others regardless of the intent. Despite that, Kathy Rain seems to have taken that a step further with puzzles that are far easier than the one that came before it found late in the game, and the hardest puzzles taking place in the second few hours. Thankfully, Kathy herself will at least let you know if you are on the right track with the harder puzzles, and stays silent when her suggestions aren't solicited. Most solutions (all but one, if I recall correctly) use a 'the easiest answer is the correct answer' policy, and (again, all but one) operate within the bounds of logic- even when reaching an area of the game where logic seems to have no meaning.\n\nPuzzles can invariably be solved just by using the mouse- there is no keyboard usage save for where it makes obvious sense to do so (such as when typing), and even that is extremely rare. If you can't click it, you don't need to worry about it. There is no 'hunt the pixel' gameplay, either- all the items you interact with are well-lampshaded and easy to see, to the point where some of them might as well be draped in neon lights.\n\nOverall, I found Kathy Rain very easy to get through, only having to consult a walkthrough once when I was missing a crucial item. Long-standing lovers of point and clicks will find this a walk in the park, whereas newcomers (are there any?) will find it a wading pool for the harder stuff. Most of these puzzles are character-driven as well, stemming from dialogue choices and showing the personalities and natures of those around Kathy (as well as Kathy herself), making them an integral part of the game rather than 'solve the soup can'-style pointlessness.\n\n---Story and Pacing (no spoilers)\n\nThis is the one point where Kathy Rain falls a little short, and it isn't for lack of trying. The story begins excellently and at a medium burn, with the catalyst to adventure occuring soon after you start and with little backstory off the bat. Most of the backstory, in fact, is discovered over the course of the game with notes, dialogue and recorded messages, all of which (save one) is inevitably used in one way or another.\n\nThis persists throughout the game's middle in a way that never reaches a white-knuckle grip, but rather a leisurely jog with occasional rests that involve quick humor and fun characters (Goober, I'm looking at you). While there are the occasional twists, they never feel particularly jarring because of the slow speed with which you reach them, lessening their impact and dulling the edge- an edge that I think Kathy Rain sorely needed. Despite that, said twists and developments do grant a desire to keep playing, to remedy the events that go wrong and to wrap up the story. Players are pushed on, also, through small snippets of Kathy's past that she isn't particularly open about, but these have less of an effect both because of the ending and the way they are delivered.\n\nAs for the ending, this is where Kathy Rain loses much of its characters and world, instead making it solely about Kathy as a person- and unfortunately proving that she cannot stand on her own as an interesting protagonist. Kathy is at her best when interacting with others, but this last stretch involved only her and her own feelings amidst puzzles that are mostly 'placed' rather than 'organic', and without any of the witty dialogue or charm you find in earlier parts of the game (with a couple notable exceptions). The ending comes and goes, and it left me with a 'well, that happened' feeling that can only be described as mediocre- a sad thing for a game that had me interested and invested up until that point. Despite that, I can say that the more personal details of Kathy's choices earlier in life are handled well and intelligently (at least, on my playthrough. A different dialogue choice may yield a different result), without insulting individuals who have chosen to do the same in her place.\n\n---End result\n\nFor a game with a new protagonist never seen before? Not half bad. Not half bad at all. For a point and clicker? Pretty frickin' decent. Is it worth fifteen bucks? That's harder to say. It is a short game, and depending on how quickly you burn through the puzzles at hand you may feel like you did not get your money's worth- especially considering the easy difficulty at hand. So since the puzzles are largely simple, lets judge it on characters and story alone. Would I hand Kathy and E fifteen bucks again, to help fund another investigation?\n\nFuck yeah, I would.", "timestamp_created": 1496170715, "timestamp_updated": 1496170715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32018705": {"recommendationid": "32018705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198229715796", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495974072}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Story and Dialogues...

I feel like a veteran in this genre...with that being said..........\n\n Kathy Rain does not live up to my personal standards of what I believe an adventure game should be. Its not terrible......but its not good either. Those that have different standards than me will obviously disagree.\n\nOne of the main problems is the story and lets be honest, thats what makes or breaks an adventure game. The story feels forced.....like the writers raped the story into this game. As the story progressed I found myself becoming more disappointed than excited. It is supposed to be set in the 90's and other than the story telling me it was 1995. I didn't feel any connection to that decade whatsoever. The protagonist, Kathy Rain, is a cardboard cut out of the classic 90's rebellious edgy teen with a bleeding heart. Kathy didn't feel like a real character but more of a stereotype of what some idiot writer had in mind for the story. \n\nThe story starts off with Kathy coming into her dorm drunk and wanting to sleep it off.  Then Emily, her little stereotypical Christian roommate, tells her she has been doing research on Kathy's hometown because..the writers needed the story to advance and tells her she found out that a man, Joseph Rain had died recently. This is her grandfather and despite being gone for 15 years she decides to attend the funeral and start doing investigations......because the writers needed the story to advance. The games handles story progression this way.... ALL......THE..... FUCK**G..... TIME.....\n\nThe puzzles are even worse than the story.....If you are looking for challenging puzzles....Try grabbing a brick and smashing it to your head about 5 times before you play this game. The swelling of your brain might make them more difficult to solve. \n\nAll of the characters in this game are cardboard cutouts of stereotypes. This is why you don't get shitty writers to make your game. \n\nI won't reveal any spoilers but....the ending didnt answer any questions......fortunatly the story sucked so badly that I didnt care. \n\nNote: I fell asleep playing this game...so the hours spent on this game can be misleading.

Coming out at about 7-10 hours of gameplay providing you take the time to enjoy the game and your surroundings, there's much joy to be had in this title. Some of the visuals are captivating and the sordid and mysterious plot is beautifully embellished by an apposite soundtrack, leading to some real thrills and shivers as you plunge deeper into the depths of what is a dark and harrowing tale (recommend playing alone and during the night for the full impact of the final third of the game, which had me feeling uneasy).\n\nThe difficulty of the game is moderate and some of the puzzles will definitely keep you occupied for a while, but the main meat of the game is in the dialogue and examination of objects in order to find new leads and destinations in your quest to find out more about the death of Kathy Rain's grandfather. In that sense, you must be observant and vigilant, though Kathy does a good job of reminding you of what reminds her of what (which might annoy some of the more hardcore adventure nuts).\n\nThe game does lack a little richness visually and is a bit light on locations, suggesting that the team couldn't produce a whole lot of art for the game. The locations that do exist are used efficiently and thoroughly, though there are no animations present in the backdrops. Looking at a completely still body of water as though I'm just looking at a painting made one location seem lifeless. However, there are a few locations in this game that are truly beautiful, with one in particular having multiple weather/sky backdrops -- a nice touch.

A game that is supposed to be following in the footsteps of Laura Bow, at least I\u2019m pretty sure I read that somewhere.  Like Laura Bow you start out in College as a journalism major, unlike Laura Bow you seem to be a punk biker who is a sociopath.  At the end of the day though I quite liked the character of Kathy Rain and the other major character Eileen.  Their voice acting, what little there is, is good.  Whoever voices Kathy does a good job and the same goes for Eileen.  Since you do hear their voices the most, it\u2019s pretty important for them to be pleasing.  That was one of the big problems with games like Gabriel Knight, Knight\u2019s voice drove me nuts.  It was just awful.  The same goes for Laura Bow.  However, I can\u2019t recommend this game too much is simply bad in it.  \n\nLike that\u2019s probably all the good stuff.  If a lot of stuff was good, I\u2019d recommend the game, but most of it is quite bad.  So lets go with puzzles.  The game basically has very very very easy puzzles.  Which I guess would be fine, except I think they are also bad.  One puzzle required me to pick up a thermometer, which I attempted already pick up earlier in the game and couldn\u2019t.  No dialogue or really anything lead me to think that later in the game I could now pick it up.  It\u2019s the one puzzle I had to look online for a solution to.  Adventure games need to stop this, either let me pick up every single item I need when I see it, or I guess maybe MAYBE if you heavily stress the fact by the character saying something like, \u201coh I really need to get a thermometer, I think I saw one earlier I need to go back and get it.\u201d  Then that MIGHT be acceptable.  Otherwise, never do this ever!  Almost every puzzle in this game can be solved in the area you are in, normally I would say this is fine, the problem here is that the areas are so small that it takes seconds to figure out puzzles.  That being said I guess I should give props to the game for having all the puzzles basically be logic puzzles as opposed to random math puzzles like a lot of adventure games do and which I hate.\n\nBefore getting into the story, I have to just add that one major problem with the game is the length.  It\u2019s a big problem.  There are so few areas to explore.  Each area, might only have one or two screens to it.  You don\u2019t really feel like you are exploring at all, which imo is critical in an adventure game.  The game also simply ends way too fast.  I suppose it\u2019s possible to tell a short story, this game however fails at it.  There wasn\u2019t any real time to get to know characters or have any feel for the town or even really to ponder what is going on in the game.  I\u2019d say it feels more like watching a movie then playing a game, which I know a lot of games do these days, but I don\u2019t like that.\n\nHowever, the biggest problem is the story and I\u2019m just going to count everything after this as spoilers.  [spoiler] The simple fact is this story makes no sense at all.  First of all I feel like it was a bait and switch.  I bought the game thinking it was going to be an epic murder mystery like a Laura Bow game.  Instead, I guess it\u2019s a horror game? That\u2019s really not the right word for it, it is a mystery, it\u2019s just that the mystery is so terrible I can\u2019t even really call it that.  I would say it\u2019s a very poor version of an HP Lovecraft story.  Yup, that sounds about right.  \n\nSo for starters characters act in ways no one ever would.  Kathy is a sophomore in college majoring in journalism.  Her roommate Eileen is super Christian and I guess loves reading obituaries, because the game starts with her finding out that Kathy\u2019s grandfather is dead and demands Kathy attend the funeral.  Even though Kathy hasn\u2019t seen her grandfather in 15 years nor talked to her grandparents she ends up going.  I found it hard enough to believe that your roommate loves reading obituaries and felt it was appropriate to talk to you about it when it certainly felt like at the start of the game that Kathy is super abrasive and doesn\u2019t get along much with Eileen.\n\nWhatever, I got passed that.  Then you get to the funeral though and hear from your grandmother that after a strange incident in the woods your grandfather entered a catatonic state 15 years ago and medical professionals were baffled.  This leads Kathy to \u201ctake the case.\u201d  No person would ever act this way, maybe some weird robot would, but no actual human ever.  For one, the incident happened 15 years ago, two no evidence really convinced Kathy this was anything other than a weird medical issue, three she didn\u2019t feel the need to even talk to her grandparents before and now that her grandfather is dead shes going to investigate his medical problems? She literally storms off to the chief of police to interrogate him and then steal evidence to look into this issue? Maybe a sociopath would do this, but even that seems far fetched.\n\nAfter Kathy learns her grandfather was investigating a woman\u2019s suicide 16 years ago, Kathy seems to decide to investigate that as well? Shes a punk biker sophomore in college, shes a journalism major, but unlike Laura Bow she isn\u2019t studious.  She apparently never attends class, and nothing leads me to suspect shes even a good journalism major, it\u2019s not like she thinks, \u201coh what a scoop, I\u2019m going to look into this.\u201d  Her chief motivation seems to be guilt that her grandfather died and she didn\u2019t know him so shes going to investigate this for some type of closure.  I just can\u2019t accept that the way she attempts to find closure is to break a variety of laws to investigate what by all appearances is a medical issue. \n\nThere are plenty of ways you could have written this story to work.  How about Kathy is a young detective on the police force in charge of a cold cases unit and is told to look into this girls suicide 16 years ago and through that discovers her grandfather who she was estranged from Kathy also was investigating it and then arrives to speak to her grandfather only to discover he just died?  Or how about Kathy gets a note from her grandmother telling her about how her grandfather was murdered days ago, not years, and Kathy rushes home and is sparked by this to investigate.  See that would make sense, what doesn\u2019t make sense is finding out a medical issue 15 years ago put your grandfather in a catatonic state and you decide to \u201cinvestigate\u201d it when you have supposedly class the next day and you almost decide not to even bother going to the funeral.\n\nEven then I could look passed allllllll of that if the rest of the story was good, but it\u2019s not!  You can\u2019t build a murder mystery without things like a cast of characters/suspects, dialogue/evidence, suspense, actual mystery.  The mystery is literally resolved in this game before it begins.  You learn people are disappearing a second later you discover the priest in the town is a serial killer murdering people.  I certainly suspected him, because he was literally the only character to really suspect other than either your roommate or your grandmother.  You don\u2019t find much evidence pointing to him, but that doesn\u2019t matter since he just straight up kidnaps and attempts to murder Eileen and you immediately know its him.  \n\nThen there is the whole weird HP lovecraft old God thing, where a weird guy has been I guess taking souls to feed on?  It never really goes anywhere, you defeat his weird puzzle game at the end and burn down his weird old god ceremony seemingly defeating a God and the game ends.  If that sounds abrupt, it\u2019s because it is, you know very little about him. You meet him throughout the game, but again the game is so short you don\u2019t really get any feel for what he\u2019s doing other than being evil [/spoiler]\n\nSigh, I was really hoping for a new Laura Bow style murder mystery, instead I got a mediocre horror story.  If you want to make a 10-12 hour Kathy Rain murder mystery with Eileen as her partner/girlfriend I would be up for that.

Almost a Twin Peaks-esque vibe that things are just mysterious enough to keep you engaged.  There are just enough unanswered questions to keep you playing.

First off, the graphic is really good. The pixel art is nice and full of detail. The protaganist is charming even if she suffers from I'm-a-woman-hear me-roar and I-don't-need-no-man attitude from time to time. The voice acting is excellent, and so is the music. The music together with the 90s setting sets the atmosphere - Twin Peaks anyone?\n\nThe gameplay is also fun. It has the traditional point & click gameplay in which you combine different objects to eventually pass a puzzle and advance the story. It also has this intriguing detective mechanic to the game that is really fun. You have to find clues in any way possible, then you use these clues that you have collected to ask other characters about the case. It works really well, and most of the time the people you talk to will have something interesting to say about the things you ask about. At times it really feels like you are doing true detective work. Though, the game isn't too hard. Most of the puzzles has a logical solution, but it requires you to pay attention to the details.\n\nBut... adventure games lives and dies on its story. The story in Kathy Rain is really good, well, at least 75% of the game. I don't want to go into spoilers here, but right from the start you get that whatever went down in this small town is not totally natural. I have no problem with that, it actually enhances the story since I love that out-of-this-world stuff. The problem comes at the end, or near to it. The game and story has an actual finish, but it feels really unsatisfying. Like I said, I don't want to spoil anything, but there is way too many lose ends, and nothing about the story is really explained. Sure, stuff can be left up to the consumer to draw his own conclusions, but there is nothing to draw from here. Stuff just seem to happen at random and then it ends. Really disappointing since the road up to that point was great. Maybe, I'm just stupid though and didn't get it :)\n\nAnyway.

The game has a length of around 6-8 hours, depending on if you get stuck and how much exploration you do.\n\nThis is one of the best games I've played in the genre, and I give it extra points for all the 90's and Twin Peaks references.

Each main area has its own theme music and each track works so well with the locale.\n- The Characters are really well written. Having a main protagonist that you grow to love is really interesting. Some other characters are really interesting and fun to interact with (Goober)\n- The story is really fun and exciting. You really don't know what's going to happen next.\n- Some of the Achievements in this game are really funny, fitting in with the game's story telling abilities\n- Fully voice acted. I don't think there was a single line of dialogue that was written only.\n- Multiple Save Files. Really good if you worry about an interaction or forget to do something\nCONS:\n- The game is a bit short for the price. I bought this game on a sale and felt more justified in the purchase of it. Took me about 5.5 hours to beat the story.\n- Some of the voice acting seemed a little off to me. Perhaps the emotion wasn't conveyed as well as it could have been in some instances. BUT ONLY SOME. The rest of the game's voicing is great.\n\nI really had to nitpick to find flaws with this game. A great story, well put together.

Some of the background music in particular really unnerved me. \n\nThere were some interesting features that I've not seen in point and click adventures much that I think worked well - the \"think about\" option, to provide some more insight on Kathy's thoughts on things, and the closeup of characters speaking with a few different facial expressions. The method of travelling between locations on Kathy's motorcycle was enjoyable too.\n\nMy only complaint about this game was that towards the end I felt like I was just going back and forth between a lot of locations figuring out how to trigger the next event I needed to. With some of the animations it felt a bit slow. Also I felt like it ended a little more abruptly than I'd like, and I would have liked the story to last longer.\n\nAll in all I'd love to see a sequel or more from this developer, Kathy Rain was an

Lo odio ! Ok, ok, cercher\u00f2 di essere pi\u00f9 professionale. Mettiamola cos\u00ec: credo si tratti di uno stile che ormai non ha pi\u00f9 ragion d'essere; che esisteva un tempo perch\u00e8 non c'erano alternative, giacch\u00e8 i computer di allora avevano una memoria risicata; infine \u00e8 fastidioso poich\u00e8 diventa difficilissimo dover cercare gli hotspot in una massa caotica di pixel colorati. Quindi trovo la scelta del pixellato abbastanza ridicola, se si vuole fare l'operazione nostalgia, ci sono tante altre cose che si possono fare. \nTolto questo, passiamo al resto. Il gioco prende ispirazioni diverse: nelle meccaniche e nelle interfacce da Gabriel Knight, nelle atmosfere e nella trama dalle opere di JJ Abrahms e sono questi due elementi i pilastri che sorreggono l'intera pericolante struttura. Gli enigmi sono buoni, di difficolt\u00e0 media e con un contorno di indizi per chi pu\u00f2 trovarsi in difficolt\u00e0. Le atmosfere sono create molto bene grazie a delle musiche accattivanti, personaggi ambigui pieni di misteri da svelare (inclusa la protagonista) e aggiungerei le ambientazioni se non fossero disegnate in pixellato che finisce per ridicolizzarle un po'. La trama l'ho lasciata per ultima perch\u00e8 mi lascia sconcertato. Tutta la storia si basa su un mistero ma alla fine quel mistero non viene svelato per nulla, non restano nemmeno indizi che possano permettere al giocatore di darsi la sua personale spiegazione; ma la cosa pi\u00f9 assurda \u00e8 che perfino alla protagonista che tanto si \u00e8 sbattuta per capirci qualcosa, alla fine non importi nulla. C'\u00e8 quindi il serio rischio che a qualcuno resti l'amaro in bocca.\nConcludendo, \u00e8 un gioco che avrebbe potuto offrire molto e invece si limita ad essere un esercizio di stile da parte degli sviluppatori un po' come quei film bellissimi esteticamente ma vuoti al loro interno. Ci\u00f2 nonostante potrebbe piacere l'atmosfera surreale che si respira e la storia dietro i personaggi ma di certo non vale la pena spendere 15\u20ac per un gioco con una grafica datata e una trama che che non va da nessuna parte, all'interno di una tipologia di avventura grafica in cui la trama diventa fondamentale.\nNon potendo per\u00f2 usare una scala di valori di giudizio o un voto neutro io dico: Lo consiglio CON RISERVA.", "timestamp_created": 1492252458, "timestamp_updated": 1492252458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502240", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31143426": {"recommendationid": "31143426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009371154", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492203255}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub625\uac9c. \uc774\uac70 \ud560\ubc14\uc5d0 \uc2dc\uc5d0\ub77c\uc0b0 \uace0\uc804 \uc5b4\ub4dc\ubca4\uccd0 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ud558\uc138\uc694. \ubd88\ud3b8\ud55c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4.\ud074\ub9ac\uc170\ub85c \ubc94\ubc85\ub41c \uc774\uc57c\uae30.\ud3c9\uba74\uc801\uc778 \uc8fc\uc778\uacf5.\ub300\ub193\uace0 \ud6c4\uc18d\uc791 \uc554\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 3\ub958 \ud50c\ub86f. \ub0b4 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc544\uae5d\ub2e4\uc815\ub9d0", "timestamp_created": 1492203385, "timestamp_updated": 1492203385, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31141495": {"recommendationid": "31141495", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970882976", "num_games_owned": 659, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492196557}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyable puzzle adventure with some satisfying puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1492196600, "timestamp_updated": 1492196600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31137430": {"recommendationid": "31137430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037557584", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492134198}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game, especially for those of us who fondly remember Monkey Island and other MS-DOS, 320x200 point-and-click adventure games.

It has a lot going for it: the style is very appealing, the voice acting is (overall) rather good, the story is decent, the tone of the game is well struck, and the puzzles are fun to solve.\n\nHowever, this is not a big production. That shows: the game is rather short. I've finished it in 5 hours. \n\nAlso, the game lacks a certain complexity. The puzzles are fairly easy, especially since the game hits you over the head with clues, often in the form of thoughts that the main protagonist has. Furthermore, the amount of inventory items you at any given point in the game have, does not exceed 10, which makes the inventory puzzles even more simple. \n\nThis lack of complexity also shows in other areas. There are a fair amount of things you can interact with on each screen, but, as I said, don't expect \"Simon the Sorceror\" amounts of objects to pick up and use. There are also limited areas you can travel to; they seldom exceed more than two screens. There are almost no outside areas you can visit, that could serve as a \"backdrop\" to the relevant areas. There are little people to interact with, outside of the characters that are fundamental to progressing the story, This makes the setting of the game feel less \"alive\".\n\nHowever, it's very difficult to fault the game for this.

If it homaged any more you could call it Twin Peaks the game. Inspiration aside, Kathy Rain marries the detective genre and point and click adventure game beautifully with a decent story and 8-bit graphics.\n\nThe art is done well, albeit in low resolution graphics. The game has some modern mechanics, but overall the look is quite dated (comparable to Broken Sword). Meanwhile, the voice acting varies between passable and good. Overall, the production quality gets passing marks for an indie development.  Nothing egregious nor outstanding.\n\nThe gameplay solid, it is a point and click adventure, but unlike most, there is no inane puzzle logic. Everything was either quite logically or Kathy hints at what she should do next. With that kind of gameplay the detective work shines through nicely. You end up doing interviews, looking for clues and following up on leads.  Puzzles are strewn in, but nothing feels out of place, and themed around unlocking via riddles or codes.  Gameplay is quite excellent for a point and click adventure.\n\nFinally, the story. You will get d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu playing this game if you have seen Twin Peaks. Many major elements from Lynch\u2019s work are mirrored here. From the Red Room to the dead girl in the lake, plot points really could not come much closer. To be fair, that\u2019s not a bad thing. Enough is different to call it original, but that does not mean it is not trope ridden. The main character, Kathy, comes off as a bit of a strawman.  Basically, she is the perfect example of a cynical girl from a broken home having made all the wrong choices but having the strength to endure it all anyway. I feel like she\u2019s the best friend from a poorly written RomCom and her temperamental attitude takes a while to get use to as she comes off as rude for very little reason for most of the start of the game. But as it progresses, she chills out and becomes more likeable as her sardonic quips become more sarcastic. Aside from the rough characterization, the story depicts a rural mystery with surreal elements with quite a lot of care.  I won\u2019t get into the details, but this isn\u2019t really a whodunit so much as a \u201cwhat the heck is going on?\u201d \n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of mysteries, point and click adventures or David Lynch this game might be up your alley.

And it was worth it.\n\nKathy Rain is a good \"old\" point & click game with a low-res nostalgic look that could make you think this game came straight from the 90s.\nAnd as a matter of fact the story takes place in the 90s: Kathy is studying journalism at college and lives at the dorm with her roommate Eileen and gets a phone call to be informed about her Grandfather's death. After the funeral, a chat with her Grandmother reveals some strange events that don't seem to add up, and that's where the real investigation begins.\n\nAs usual mouse is your friend, but for some odd reason the interface won't use your right click, as everything is set to work with the left click only. Besides that the interface is quite intuitive, so hovering with the cursor over usable items will make appear their names so you know you can use them, while items collected in your inventory can be examined, used or combined. Nothing new, but that's the point of reviving a classic, right? For some odd reason there are two different options for examining an item, and even though you don't get much more information then usual from them, I kind of liked the idea as classic P&C just have the same line for every item.\n\nThe soundtrack during the game is pleasant and appropirate, even though the title track and the travel track really are the only ones that really stand out.\n\nRiddles are well built, nothing extremely complicated nor easy as a click (except for [spoiler]the scanner that can scan audio tapes, seriously, the last thing I could have thought of was examining a scanner to realize that...[/spoiler]), the best part of the game surely lies in the story that will take you around the town and let you talk with characters... Long and interesting talks. And the story (no spoilers) will really go deep to end up in an unexpected direction.\n\nDefinitely a really appreciated work, made with heart and mind, and with this I'm definitely keeping an eye on Clifftop Games. (no, I'm not paid by the publisher nor the developer. I just grew up with games like Monkey Island and Sam & Max)\n\n[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]\n[*][b] STORY.[/b] What can I say, I have weakness for noir and detective stories, and I really had to force me to go to bed, otherwise I would have played the whole night (and slept instead of going to work)\n[*][b] SOUNDTRACK.[/b] A pleasant soundtrack during the game and outstanding title track. Need anything else?\n[*][b] RETRO' LOOK.[/b] Yes, growing up with Point & Click games from the 90s is something that can mark you. Seeing the images in the store page brought back memories of times where pixellous characters move in detailed backdrops, while during dialogues you can see detailed portraits of the speaking characters (as detailed as they can be in 320x200, of course)\n[*][b] DIALOGUES AND CHARACTERS.[/b] Dialogues are the essence in this story. Much is being told during dialogues, part of stories, clues, references and useful informations. They're not useless or pointless even when it's just a general chat, as they still help you understand more the characters.\n[/list]\n[h1]---CONs---[/h1][list]\n[*][b] DIALOGUES AUDIO.[/b] If I really really have to say something bad about something, well... Few dialogues have lower volume... That's it. Happy now?\n[*][b] STORY.[/b] That's not really a \"con\" about the story, more like a spoilerless opinion. I totally wasn't expecting the story to take that direction, yet I really enjoyed the adventure and the ending anyways. Even though I was confused by the change in the story, it was really worth accepting it until the end.\n[*][b] RIGHT CLICK.[/b] I admit I've been quite slow to learn ignoring my impulse to use the unassigned right-click...\n[/list]\n\n[i]I played this game on this machine:\nIntel Core i7-4970\n16Gb RAM DDR3\nGeForce GTX 660\nWindows 10 Professional x64[/i]\n\nWasted power...

The mystery was captivating, the voice acting was good, and the game was crafted such that you are always accumulating new clues that keep you motivated to keep going.  The voice acting and writing of Kathy herself was a constant delight.  The main flaw of this game is that I don't think there's an adequite payoff at the end of your investigations.  The answer to the mystery is just too vague, the motivation and even the origin of the... antagonist shall we say... is completely nebulous.  Still, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.

It checks all the boxes, from the font choice to the art style. You'd swear up and down it was made in the same Scumm engine as Full Throttle and Day of The Tentacle.

Cool! But... about halfway through... something terrible happens.\n\nThe writers give up.\n\nSee, they set up a lot of loose threads to handle. And, frankly, loose threads are fun - they make for interesting stories. Forcing characters to deal with the implications of their decisions is at the heart of any good narrative. Buuuut... rather than commit to that, they start hand-waving in a VERY big way. Investigation starts giving way to \"it's magic, yo\". And, ultimately, every single major plotline is resolved through magical means. And not interesting, well fleshed out magic, either (looking your way, The Longest Journey.) No... just boring, half-thought-out dream visions and spirit quests.\n\nIt's deus ex machina on steroids. And what\u2019s worse is it undercuts the core premise: its not Kathy\u2019s investigation skills that solve the day, but instead these mystical forces directly spelling it out for her.\n\nLook, you\u2019re not a ~bad person~ if you like this game.

There were features about it that I did enjoy, but ultimately I'd have to say that the negative aspects outweigh the positive.  For me at least.  I'm in the minority opinion here.  I'll start off with the positive.  I liked that all of the dialogue for the game had voice acting, including Kathy's inner thoughts.  You don't get that in most of these kinds of games, so I'll give the game credit for that.  There will be mixed opinions on the quality of the voice acting, but it was serviceable to me.  \n\nWithin the story, I do like that it tackles some very heavy emotional issues.  This includes mental illness, death and loss, and very imperfect family situations.  It's gritty and dark, but very humane.  I just wish the story didn't trail off and get weaker the further it went.  Along with this, I did like some of the characters quite a bit.  Kathy is a bit inconsistent, but she's mostly likeable.  I thought Goober was funny, though kind of tragic the more you learn about him.  The grandmother also isn't purely the sweet, loveable figure (towards Kathy she is, unquestionably).  She shows some anger and distrust, which gave her more range than most games show towards those kinds of characters.  I thought Eileen was kind of weak though - so over the top in her chipperness and having absolutely no sense of privacy or personal boundaries.  That was hard to swallow.\n\nSomething else done well is the art and graphics.  I liked the contrast of the pixel art for the majority of the scene, and the use of more detailed art to show facial expressions.  There were only a few varieties in the sprites though, so it didn't have as much nuance as it could have, but it added much more than only the pixel art would have shown on its own.  One thing I thought was odd about the pixel art is that everyone's eyes are set against a black dot instead of white, which makes them all look creepy.  Not sure why that choice was made.\n\nStarting off in the negative, I would say the story could have been better (and there will be spoilers throughout, fair warning).  Starting off I think it's pretty strong.  It builds Kathy's character pretty well (though she's very contradictory in nature - spiteful and angry, a smart ass who's harsh with her words and even actions, like when she won't give a homeless man $10, yet also very soft-hearted in other ways), and develops her family history.  It becomes apparent quite quickly she grew up in a troubled family situation, with her being so estranged from her paternal grandparents, and not so much by choice.  \n\nThe first couple of days where you try to figure out the basic details of what happened to your grandfather, who might know essential information, and starting to dig through the surface level events to the darker, hidden truth is quite good.  I'd say the second day especially makes you feel like a detective, as you play different people in order to get the tech. set up you need to further explore the clues you've found so far.  The hints are subtle but straightforward enough (very delicate but important balance), with Kathy giving you enough pointers that you're able to get where you need to go (I'm thinking especially with the voice recording manipulation - that was well laid out).\n\nHowever, it also becomes clear soon enough that the mystery she's trying to untangle about the possible foul play surrounding her grandfather was supernatural in nature.  Nothing in the trailer or game description suggests this, which I feel is very misleading.  The title especially hints at a strong female character unraveling a bigger plot or conspiracy, not trying to work out a paranormal activity that overshadows events in her life and the town she was raised in.  Plotwise the story comes off less like CSI and more like the X-Files, which isn't what I was expecting or really wanting to be honest.  Those sorts of stories are prevelant enough, especially in hidden object games (the closely related cousin to point and click games).  \n\nI don't want to beat a dead horse, but the more I think about the overall story of this game, the less it all makes sense.  I would summarize it in these few questions.  Who paid for her grandfather's storage unit the last 14 years that he's been in a vegatative state (those things aren't free and your grandmother knows nothing about it at all)?  Is the Red Man a force for evil or not (key characters flat out say so, but if that's the case his actions with other characters don't make sense)?  Is the Old God legitimate, a real thing, and how does that work stacked up against the Christian God (what's the reality of the supernatural for the game - is this a dimensional rift or what)?  Why is it that Kathy Rain was the only character that had the inner strength to handle the descent into the Abyss, especially when earlier interactions show she was probably more troubled than other people likely would be (dozens if not hundreds of people go missing or crazy because they can't handle it, yet she did)?  I also have to wonder a lot about the church and its members, since the pastor is clearly unhinged and sacrifices people regularly, yet plenty of people go there without reservation (the sheriff being one of them).  It's not that the game doesn't answer these questions that bothers me so much as that the game's story isn't internally consistent.\n\nA few other simple details in the game design bothered me as well.  I didn't like how, later in the game, certain areas you've been to before became grayed out, with you unable to go there anymore.  I feel like the point of these types of games is to allow the player to explore everywhere, even if it's the wrong place, until they figure out the next step to take.  However here those options are taken away, without explanation, which was disappointing to me.  It felt restrictive and didn't give a chance for me to wrap up what felt like unfinished business in those areas either.  It also raises the question of why not just gray out the wrong places for me to go all throughout the game if that's going to be done later on anyways?\n\nAnother one is how the game telegraphs that you'll do things later on in the game without any need to do so.  One that comes up very early is the mausoleum - it says you can enter it, long before you have any reason to think to do so, which tells the player you will eventually do that.  Another example of that is after you encounter the Red Man you don't ever see Sue again and don't talk to Nathan until far later in the game.  I wanted to talk with him very shortly after the experience, and while pursuing that goal the option to break into their cabin comes up.  There's no reason to do so since they aren't there (and the event where you need to do it isn't triggered until much later), but despite Kathy saying she won't do things needlessly, especially something that drastic, you're able to break in, even though it's entirely pointless.  That seemed out of character and weird for her.  \n\nThere are other nitpicks I have, but they aren't worth mentioning at this point.  I would say overall that I'm disappointed by the direction the story took in this game, especially since there are some pretty glaring plot holes and inconsistencies, along with plain unanswered or unexplained aspects to it.  Especially since it started off so strongly, with the game showing real promise in the first few days.  So for me, I can't say that I would recommend this game.  However, if a mystery game delving into the supernatural isn't a turn-off or a negative for you, then like many who have played this game, I'd say there's a very good chance you'd enjoy this.  I would have myself, but it just fell flat for me by the end.", "timestamp_created": 1484849179, "timestamp_updated": 1484849179, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29359845": {"recommendationid": "29359845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025625270", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484846996}, "language": "english", "review": "Not bad.", "timestamp_created": 1484847014, "timestamp_updated": 1484847014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29342839": {"recommendationid": "29342839", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985119883", "num_games_owned": 981, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484767476}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun 'new' old school point and click adventure game with a cool levelheaded female protagonist.

Het spel doet sterk denken als klassiekers als Gabriel Knight en Full Throttle, maar met een volledig eigen verhaal en originele puzzels. Veel puzzels zijn gebaseerd op dialogen en andere puzzles bestaan uit het manipuleren van de omgeving op een geloofwaardige manier. Geen schuifpuzzels dus of schermen met 'verborgen voorwerpen'. In Kathy Rain volgen we de lotgevallen van de eigenzinnige Kathy Rain, een tweedejaars studente journalistiek die in de geschiedenis van haar grootvader duikt. Nadat haar kamergenoot haar heeft overtuigd om naar de begrafenis van haar grootvader te gaan, raakt Kathy ge\u00efntrigeerd in het verleden van haar grootvader. Na een geheimzinnige gebeurtenis in 1981 (het spel speelt zich af in 1995) is haar grootvader als kasplantje in een rolstoel ge\u00ebindigd. Kathy was toen een kleuter en werd opgevoed door haar moeder, nadat haar vader hen had verlaten voor een motorbende. Gedurende haar onderzoek komt Kathy niet alleen meer te weten over haar grootvader, maar ook over haar eigen verleden en over wat er tussen haar ouder en grootouders is voorgevallen. Naarmate het verhaal vordert, worden er steeds meer bovennatuurlijke elementen ge\u00efntroduceerd.\nDe puzzels zijn op een goede manier in het spel verwerkt. Veel puzzels zijn dialoog gebaseerd en vereisen dat je met anderen praat en de juiste opties kiest of het juiste voorwerp laat zien. Andere puzzels vereisen het combineren of gebruiken van voorwerpen op een gebruikelijke manier. Voor sommige puzzels moet je een creatieve aanpak kiezen, maar ik ben geen puzzels tegen gekomen die onlogisch waren of waarvoor je ieder scherm minutieus moest uitkammen. In een van de puzzels moet je een opname van een antwoordapparaat bewerken en een nieuwe opname samenstellen. In Gabriel Knight moest je hetzelfde doen, maar werd de opname alleen goedgekeurd als deze woord voor woord klopte. In Kathy Rain controleert het spel of je de juiste woorden hebt geselecteerd en vervolgens past Kathy de opname zelf aan. Iets vergelijkbaars geldt voor het bellen van telefoonnummers. In de jaren negentig moest je in veel spellen elke keer het nummer volledig draaien. In Kathy Rain klik je op de naam die je wil bellen op een lijst op het scherm. Het is deze mix van retro en modern die het spel tot een goed afgewerkt geheel maken.\nKathy Rain is het resultaat van een eenmans studio en dus is het aantal locaties en het aantal personen waar je mee kunt spreken beperkt. Toch voelt het niet aan als een klein spel. Met 6-8 speeluren is het aanzienlijk korter dan Gabriel Knight of Full Throttle, maar die zijn dan ook door een volledig team gemaakt. Alle dialogen zijn gesproken en zo te horen door professionele stemacteurs. Door het interessante verhaal, de goedgeschreven dialogen en de goed in het spel verwerkte puzzels, voelt het onddanks de beperkte omvang toch aan als een volwaardig spel, een hele prestatie.", "timestamp_created": 1483902564, "timestamp_updated": 1483902564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29109747": {"recommendationid": "29109747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058682669", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483861391}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't played a pixel game in a long time so it was a little surprising at first but the story and gameplay were excellent.

That might be enough to convince you to play Kathy Rain, but if it's not, read on.\n\nKathy Rain is a wonderful graduation for those of us who grew up with HerInteractive's Nancy Drew series. Many of us also had a (perhaps handed down) NES, Atari, or Game Boy, so we've a nostalgic love of pixels. We're also a bit generationally jaded, sharing Kathy's world-weariness and sarcasm. There's a darkness in both the character and the game that feels personally relevant.\n\nNot in that demographic? No problem. Kathy Rain holds appeal for any fan of point and click mysteries. Bonus appeal if you're a fan of the supernatural and slightly macabre, and you like seeing it in pixels. The game is logical in its progression; if you get stuck, just try what you would do in real life. There's no tedious haphazard item combination. Puzzles are clean and feasible. Even with full achievements, you can complete the game in ~5-8 hours, so it's a solid adventure that won't eat all your time. (Great spoiler-free achievement guide[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679054771]here[/url].)\n\nKathy Rain is a satisfying offering in the PnC mystery/adventure genre, comfortable to play with a nice nostalgic aesthetic. You couldn't ask for much more, but the game gives it anyway: an intriguing story and a surprising depth of themes and character.

Great voice acting and immersive sound tracks.\n\n4. Surprisingly diverse interactivity with environments that can lead to interesting responses.\n\n5. Mostly simple puzzles and riddles so progress is easy enough for those new to point-and-click games\n\nCon's:\n\n1. The slow beginning gives a false sense of pacing for the rest of the game\n\n2. Some puzzles did seem a little obscure and required a sudden burst of 'thinking outside of the box'.\n\n3. Without spoilers; the end of the game seemed to reach out a little from what starts as a solid and down to earth detective's tale.\n\n4. After tying up all logical ends the game seems to bait at a sequel or at the very least ends on a rather predictable note.\n\nPro/Con??? : There were no credits at the end... Personally I like to pay respects to those who make such an entertaining game as Kathy Rain.\n\nConclusion: \n\nKathy Rain is a promising first game for the developers and for the most part stays true to what it promises. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to break into the point-and-click field or any one who is looking for a fairly good, story driven experience.

Non voglio scendere nei dettagli, ma il gioco \u00e8 chiaramente un omaggio a serie cult come Twin Peaks o la prima stagione di True Detective.\nI personaggi sono memorabili, ognuno con una propria personalit\u00e0 ben definita e un doppiaggio assolutamente ottimo che vi far\u00e0 percepire i personaggi realmente vivi.\nTrattandosi di un punta&clicca, saranno presenti numerosi enigmi nel corso dell'avventura, tutti abbastanza affrontabili con un po' di sana logica (a parte qualcuno verso la fine del gioco), e con una buona conoscenza della lingua inglese; si, perch\u00e9 Kathy Rain \u00e8 completamente in inglese al momento, e di traduzione in italiano nemmeno l'ombra.\n\nGli scenari proposti non sono moltissimi, a causa del ridotto team di lavoro che conta solamente una persona, Joel Staaf H\u00e4st\u00f6, che si presenta col nome di facciata di Clifftop Games. La grafica va a richiamare le avventure grafiche dei primi anni '90 (anzi a dire il vero anche troppo visto che all'epoca erano ben pi\u00f9 definite) e gira ad una risoluzione di 320x240 in 4:3, cosa davvero frustrante, ma capisco anche che cos\u00ec facendo si vadano a mascherare certezze e difetti di questa piccola produzione.\n\nAnche se con qualche incertezza, rimane un ottimo titolo, che va a guadagnarsi ben 4 stelle su 5.

It\u00b4s quite impressive that the game is mostly made by one single person, since it has good (pixel) graphic, nice music and fitting actors for all characters (the game is fully voiced). Also the writing is ok, while some of the riddles ain\u00b4t quite logical ... (i was especially surprised that a scanner can scan a tape into a voice file... must be one hell of a equipment). The story also takes some turns into the unlogical and is all in all quite \"serious\" (so don\u00b4t expect a comical adventure, despite Kathys sarcastic commenting), despite being a mystery story.\nIt also has some curious achievements, which you probably won\u00b4t get all, by playing \"normal\".\n\nConclusio: \nIn the end Kathy left me feeling a bit strange about her.. but i don\u00b4t want to spoil too much about the ending.\nIt is surely a nice, little adventure, which makes you want to see the end of the story. And that\u00b4s the most important thing of an adventure game, to suck you in and make you want to see how it proceeds, like a good book.

Dennoch ruht sich Kathy Rain nicht nur auf Zitaten aus, sondern versucht eine eigenst\u00e4ndige Geschichte zu erz\u00e4hlen. Das zeigt sich schon an dem Ende, welches auch ein richtiges Ende ist.

Dort angekommen erfahren wir, dass der Gro\u00dfvater nach einem mysteri\u00f6sen Unfall in den 80ern nicht mehr der gleiche war\u2026  \n \n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nKathy Rain ist ein klassisches Point&Click Adventure mit allem was dazu geh\u00f6rt. Einem Inventar, der M\u00f6glichkeit Dinge zu kombinieren, verschiedene Dialogwege zu gehen und kleinen sowie gr\u00f6\u00dferen Puzzles. \nDennoch ist Kathy Rain keine Kopie der Genre-Gr\u00f6\u00dfen. Das liegt vor allem an der Hauptperson, die alles andere als auf den Mund gefallen ist. H\u00e4ufig treffen wir das \u201eb\u00f6se F-Wort\u201c und zynische und sarkastische Antworten geh\u00f6ren zur Selbstverst\u00e4ndlichkeit. Die Orte des Geschehens wechseln wir auf unserem pinken Motorrad und wenn uns danach ist, k\u00f6nnen wir auch mal eine Zigarette rauchen. Was zun\u00e4chst aufgesetzt klingt, funktioniert jedoch tats\u00e4chlich recht gut und Kathy w\u00e4chst dem Spieler schnell ans Herz.\n\n[h1]Grafik und Sound[/h1]\nDie Grafik ist ebenso wie das Gameplay \u201eklassisch\u201c im positiven Sinn. Wer bis heute nicht genug von Pixelart hat, wird auch hier Gefallen finden. Die Szenen sind liebevoll mit kleinen Details ausgeschm\u00fcckt und alles wirkt sinnvoll auf die Zeit abgestimmt. So finden wir etwa ein Pulp Fiction Poster \u00fcber unserem Bett (und ein Titanic-Poster \u00fcber dem der Mitbewohnerin), spielen mal in einem Windows 3.1 Verschnitt und geben Nummern in ein Tastentelefon ein.\nDazu gibt es einen angenehmen Soundtrack und eine wirklich gute und authentische (englische) Sprachausgabe. \n\n[h1]Steuerung[/h1]\nAuch hier sei der Verweis auf fr\u00fchere Point&Click Adventure erlaubt. Ohne Maus geht gar nichts, extra Einstellungen gibt es nicht und eine Controllerunterst\u00fctzung sucht man vergebens. Maximal die Leertaste kann hilfreich sein um Objekte zu finden, mit denen man Interagieren kann.\n\n[h1]Schwierigkeit[/h1]\nDie Puzzles sind allesamt logisch aufgebaut und lediglich an 2-3 Stellen kam ich ins Stocken. Die R\u00e4tsel spielen dabei vor allem mit der Sprache, mathematische oder physische R\u00e4tsel gibt es nicht. Ein Hilfesystem wie man es aus moderneren Adventurespielen kennt gibt es nicht jedoch werden Orte, an denen es wirklich nichts mehr zu erledigen gibt ausgegraut. Die Leertaste kann helfen ein \u201ePixelhunting\u201c zu verhindern.\n\n[h1]Spielzeit[/h1]\nWie bereits erw\u00e4hnt, sind die R\u00e4tsel nicht so schwer, dass man an manchen Stellen stundenlang festh\u00e4ngt. Je nachdem wie erfahren man im Genre ist, kann dies jedoch trotzdem immer mal wieder passieren. Spieler, denen Point and Clicks jedoch bekannt sind, werden die Story jedoch nach etwa 4h beenden k\u00f6nnen. Der Wiederspielwert ist dabei leider gering, da die Story sehr gradlinig ist und es keine alternativen Enden gibt. Achivementsammler sollten also ggf. vorher einmal schauen, wie die Errungenschaften hei\u00dfen (dies sollte als Tipp bereits reichen).\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nKathy Rain ist ein kleines aber feines Adventurespiel, welches von der Grafik und der Steuerung sehr an alte Lukas-Arts Juwelen erinnert. Dazu kommt eine spannende Geschichte und sympathische Charaktere.\nEinzig der nichtvorhandene Wiederspielwert kann hier als Kritik angef\u00fchrt werden. Wei\u00df man einmal, wie es ausgeht besteht kein Grund das Spiel schnell noch einmal zu spielen (nach einigen Jahren kann man es aber sicher noch einmal raus kramen).", "timestamp_created": 1480805476, "timestamp_updated": 1480945485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501114", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28169409": {"recommendationid": "28169409", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990314140", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480796845}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice adventure with a decent story and likeable female lead.\nI've played demo, bought game afterwards and wasn't dissapointed, that's all I can say ;-)\nGive it a try!", "timestamp_created": 1480797181, "timestamp_updated": 1480797181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28161653": {"recommendationid": "28161653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062599735", "num_games_owned": 3005, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480771190}, "language": "english", "review": "I was about 60 seconds into playing 'Kathy Rain', just past the opening cutscene when I first got control of the titular protagonist, I  moused around and clicked on a poster: \"That's from 'The Thing' one of my favourite horror movies.\" explained Kathy. In that moment I knew that me and Kathy were going to get along just fine, and I also knew that this was one game that I'd be seeing all the way through. 5 hours or so later (accounting for some idle time) here I am telling you to take the trip too.\n\n'Kathy Rain' does nearly everything right. Kathy herself is a joy to work with and one of the best video game protagonists I've ever spent time with. The game is as much about her as it is about the mystery she uncovers, and while none of the supporting cast can quite match the engagement that she induces that's because she's a high-water mark. The puzzles are clever, but designed to be logically solvable, and while I'm not a braniac genius (although I do have the whole stable of Lucasarts and Sierra titles under my belt) nothing stumped me for more than 30 seconds and I was never tempted to reach for a walkthrough. I'd say the difficulty is slightly on the easy side of the genre average although good design contributes a lot to that ease; there are no moments where it feels like the game is jerking you around with 'game logic' and Kathy is always willing to offer subtle direction. \n\nThe story won't be to everyone's taste, and honestly the direction that the plot took was... interesting.

A lot of reviewers made this game out to be the return of old school games in 2016, and despite it being a fairly decent experience, there are better titles out there. For instance, I really enjoyed Primordia, Technobablyon and other Wadjet Eye Games. Don't get me wrong, Kathy Rain is going good so far, but there are inherent issues with the engine, it's not designed to accommodate things like Alt Tab, which is very annoying when I'm working and gaming at the same time. Often it would freeze the image on my screen and I'd have to restart my computer. Despite running an old engine, they need a way of accommodating modern ways of traversing applications, otherwise it becomes an annoyance.\n\nThe game itself is decent, with a fair story arc. The character is slightly unbelievable for a 90's goth girl? Seems like she has Emo streaks and then she drives a motor bike? Highly confusing. Despite that the character element and puzzles were fun and very reasonable. There was no major issues in figuring out clues or piecing things together, had to think about some but they did have a steady logical flow.\n\nThe settings are decent, but for the most part they feel a little claustrophobic. Often the emphasis of a scene is designed around the interaction of you and one character or one specific tasked object. This can be fine in Point Clicks but if over used and not given a grander context it begins to drag. \n\nI felt like they could've used points from games like The Longest Journey, and Broken Sword, Broken Age, where they give you nice large environments instead of narrow and claustrophobic settings. This might change as the game goes on but the pattern seems rather set.\n\nThe side characters are slightly uninteresting, bordering annoying. I felt like I cared very little for my roommate, my grandmother or anyone else that I really interacted with. \n\nOverall this title wasn't as fun as I hoped, the experience is okay however, and I would recommend this title at a discount...", "timestamp_created": 1480550677, "timestamp_updated": 1480550677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28085577": {"recommendationid": "28085577", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996130731", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480457473}, "language": "english", "review": "Katherine Rain, pulled me into her gorgeous pixel art world, and left me wanting more! :)\n\nI went in expecting a good detective noir story, but got so much more than that... let's just say you'll be pleased if you have a appetite for *ahem* Stranger Things ;) The characters are well developed, sprinkled with healthy doses of emotion and humour.

There are a number of backtracks, but none are deal breakers, as Kathy's hearty chopper bounces one from location to location in very short order.

I managed to complete it without looking up any hints or walkthroughs, though there were definitely a few times that I had some issues solving puzzles here and there. One plus, however, is that pretty much all of the puzzles where you use an item on a person or a thing make sense, which is more than I can say for some puzzles in Deponia and other adventure games both newer and older. \n\nThe graphical style is very neat, the voice-acting is well done, and you have an investigation notepad you update with new things you can ask people, scratching out old notes you've fully covered and have all the info on. You can zoom from one area to another on your motorcycle, with different areas opening up the further you get into the game, and when you've fully finished an area, it's unavailable on your area selection screen (which was good in my opinion, or else any time I got stuck, I would have wandered back to those areas fruitlessly).\n\nWhat I could not quite get into, beyond the initial purpose of the investigation, was the story itself. As soon as a character spoke to my character, I was like \"Yep, that person's probably evil,\" and the character was evil as a plot twist later on. Kathy is likable in terms of her humor and her nice appearance in design. She's sort of like a friendlier Jessica Jones (sans abilities), though some of her past and her dream sequences were a little off-putting and strange. What's worse, the game features a supernatural element that comes into play a fair bit in,  and it just didn't quite click with me. Supernatural stuff is great, but I just couldn't get into this game's form of it, and it's incredibly relevant to the plot at the end of the game. Right before the credits rolled, I was thinking to myself \"This is actually the end, isn't it?\" and it has a tacky \"Kathy Rain will return\" sort of message not-so-subtly voiced by a main character, as though setting up the intent for sequels.\n\nWould I play a sequel? Probably, if I got it super cheap, and though I did enjoy much of my time with the game and appreciate its design, the story and the supernatural element of it, especially, which did not appeal to me, left me dissatisfied with my experience and a bit somber. Granted, it's nothing like coming out of the Mass Effect 3 ending when unprepared for it!

Fazia tempo mesmo que eu n\u00e3o seguia t\u00e3o intrigado atrav\u00e9s de um roteiro e, melhor, sem reclamar do final (pois geralmente ao depararmos com certos tipos de trama o \"alerta\" j\u00e1 desponta para um poss\u00edvel final capenga ou vem o medo daquelas pontas soltas s\u00f3 para poder \"pescar\" uma sequ\u00eancia).\n\n Para o primeiro jogo do Clifftop Games, eu diria que foi um marco. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 palavra que o descreva melhor. E para uma melhor garantia de qualidade ainda teve o suporte do pr\u00f3prio Dave Gilbert (Wadjet Eye; e que criou a s\u00e9rie [i]Blackwell[/i], diga-se de passagem) na dire\u00e7\u00e3o de dublagem, o que s\u00f3 fez com que tudo ficasse ainda mais incr\u00edvel. Diante disso vale a observa\u00e7\u00e3o de que [i]Kathy Rain[/i] pode ser considerado at\u00e9 um sucessor espiritual da s\u00e9rie [i]Blackwell[/i], mas n\u00e3o pelos personagens ou roteiro, mas sim pela din\u00e2mica dos mesmos e o terreno considerado \"sobrenatural\" tamb\u00e9m.\n\n Falando um pouco da hist\u00f3ria do jogo em si sem entrar em detalhes comprometedores, posso dizer que Kathy \u00e9 uma protagonista extremamente carism\u00e1tica (mesmo podendo ser considerada indiferente e hardcore em certos aspectos) e contar\u00e1 com a ajuda de sua colega de quarto da universidade - Eileen (outra personagem carism\u00e1tica, mesmo com a pegada religiosa que a envolve, o que a torna bem interessante tamb\u00e9m), al\u00e9m de outra gama de personagens envolventes que surgir\u00e3o para ajudar ou atrapalhar a nossa \u00e1rdua jornada investigativa. Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o esta que certamente n\u00e3o pode ser considerada comum e, adianto logo, nunca \u00e9 o que parece ser. O mist\u00e9rio envolve todo o jogo do in\u00edcio ao fim, diante de uma trama adulta e fascinante. Adulta, pois o jogo n\u00e3o pega leve em diversos temas considerados tabus e utiliza uma linguagem que vai do leve ao pesado sem aviso pr\u00e9vio.\n\n Outra coisa que \u00e9 bastante v\u00e1lida ressaltar \u00e9 a atmosfera de estranheza que esse jogo emana, do in\u00edcio ao fim. N\u00e3o \u00e9 comum para jogos pixelados conseguir esse feito, ainda mais com hist\u00f3rias que se utilizam de contextos do cotidiano e dramas familiares, por\u00e9m em [i]Kathy Rain[/i] isso \u00e9 tudo plano de fundo mesmo. A trama central \u00e9 fascinante e tudo somente \u00e9 revelado mesmo no final. Mas o legal mesmo \u00e9 nunca saber para onde estamos seguindo, pois sempre aparece algo novo e o que pens\u00e1vamos ser realmente importante depois se revela algo bem menor. E n\u00e3o \u00e9 por menos que o jogo possui esse clima weird/nonsense, pois aqui temos inspira\u00e7\u00f5es da s\u00e9rie televisiva [i]Twin Peaks[/i], [i]Arquivo X[/i], e surge at\u00e9 espa\u00e7o para os amantes do horror c\u00f3smico em in\u00fameros momentos que n\u00e3o direi quais. Aqui estamos a abrir uma maravilhosa caixa de surpresas aterradoras.\n\n Os puzzles apresentados em [i]Kathy Rain[/i] s\u00e3o bastante intuitivos, apesar de n\u00e3o pegarem leve em certos momentos. Fazia tempo tamb\u00e9m que n\u00e3o lidava com enigmas t\u00e3o criativos e interessantes. Em resumo: \u00e9 melhor voc\u00ea ter um caderninho e uma caneta de lado s\u00f3 pra garantir. Nada demais, por\u00e9m tamb\u00e9m nada de menos. A trilha sonora \u00e9 muito boa e tamb\u00e9m nos remete aos cl\u00e1ssicos pixelados que tanto conhecemos, mas se utiliza tamb\u00e9m de toques mais dram\u00e1ticos em certos momentos, ou seja, n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 a dublagem que \u00e9 fant\u00e1stica. Como eu j\u00e1 mencionei, o conjunto da obra aqui \u00e9 realmente incr\u00edvel em todos os sentidos.\n\n Se o jogo ter\u00e1 uma sequ\u00eancia, ainda n\u00e3o sabemos, apesar de um final \"meio\" em aberto e da confirma\u00e7\u00e3o de seu criador acerca do desejo de conceber uma - talvez - nova s\u00e9rie.

In it a young woman with the ability to see spirits and her ghostly companion solve supernatural cases. That series ended in 2014 and for me, since then there's been a small hole which this series used to fill. It wasn't the best but the writing was decent, the puzzles thoughtful and you could really get into the story.\n\nFast forward 2 years and here's Kathy Rain. Albeit a completely different personality and game from Blackwell but made in the same engine and a little reminiscent of a game that I felt was great. Now while comparing the two isn't entirely fair I think it's on par with the level of story, puzzles and dialogue that the aforementioned had. \n\nKathy has quite a rebellious personality. She's got piercings, dyed hair and an attitude to match. Did I mention she also drives a motorcycle? She's got that air of angsty, feminist chic going for her and she smokes. But at the same time our badass rebel has a soft spot for family which is what brings her back to a small town from her childhood to find out about her grandfather's death. \n\nThere's a fair bit of detective work going on as you uncover the truth about your grandfather's past. You'll got to various locations. Meet many of the locals and get your hands dirty. And the great thing about Kathy is she's quite intelligent and resourceful. I also found myself enjoying her dialogue as in most situations she's giving a snarky remark not only to people in her way but also when I do silly things like try to light a little boy in the cemetery on fire or screw the local sheriff. The writing is definitely not boring or predictable. But it also doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nThe music and graphics also fit well with to complement Kathy's personality and general setting. There's semi-diverse locations that complement the somber mood and the music from the opening to the guitar track looping during your motorcycle transitions is great. \n\nAs for the puzzle aspect of the game there's some really well thought out and executed puzzles. They blend well into the story and doesn't feel like they're added to give the player something to do. Meaning you'll have to think a bit. Not too hard or long but consider things when you're chatting with people that there might be a clue somewhere not explicitly mentioned in your notes. You might even need 2-3 different items to figure out a puzzle but rest assured that it's never really complicated.

But i did finish this game in just two play sessions, which speaks volumes of this game quality by this fact alone. I got this game from my Humble Monthly subscription. Being tired of Battlefield 1 multiplayer, I wanted to try something with a good narrative. So I remember about this game and install it on my gaming laptop so I can play in my bed before turning lights off. I usually never play on my laptop, despite it's a gaming laptop that features gtx 1060 gpu, as I prefer to play my big games on my gaming desktop rig connected to a big screen. So I started at 11 PM, I check the clock it's 3AM. Thanks good it was Saturday. The is a very good Pont&Click adventure that actually has very interactive puzzle that don't come down to combing stuff from your inventory until you exhaust all possible combination. The puzzles actually require careful logical thinking and answers often lie on the surface. What I loved most in this game is a lovecraftian growing mistery, which absorpts you slowly until you become obsessed with the answers. \n\nThere is no better story than that produced by your own imagination, and this game craftly uses this trick against the player. It feeds your right amount of mistery without revealing or explaining to much leaving some stuff to your own interpretation.\n\nWell, I guess this is also constitutes the game's major flaw: despite  being a very good game with amazing story, it doesn't fully lived up to my expectations. I know that it's silly to await a small indie game to go epic and raise the stakes to the maximum, but it still it made me dream for more that it's - the game builds up the mistery to the point you start  fantasing about a big scale mistery or conspiracy, and then it's all suddenly resolved with a much smaller ooumph. It's like you exapected a 3-hour  movie, but it was just a 40-minute tv show episode.\n\nStill it was a hell of a 40-minute tv show episode. I highly recommend this game as it's ideed  a very well done adventure. The best puzzles and dialogs I have seen in years. \n\nAnd playing the game on my laptop in bed gave me such cozy feeling similar to reading a fantasy novel before going to sleep, as it only requires me to move mouse and nothing else.", "timestamp_created": 1478466787, "timestamp_updated": 1478466787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26462440": {"recommendationid": "26462440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046193538", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 173, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478464162}, "language": "english", "review": "My friend gave me this game as he didn't want it as part of a humble bundle, so I decided to try it.\n\nIt exceeded every expectation I could possibly have.\n\nThe pixel-graphics are implemented in such a way that makes it clear as to what is what, and there's no pixel-hunting so to speak. Holding the spacebar highlights all objects in the room that you can examine in case you think you missed something. I wasn't expecting voice acting, but every single line of dialogue and narrative is fully voiced, and spectacularly so; every voice fits the character's personality and setting. The puzzles and trials that you come across require a proper level of critical thinking; no information is explicitly hidden from you, and there is never any guessing involved if you've searched and discovered every detail available.\n\nWhat started as me giving some point-and-click adventure a try ended with a wild ride of puzzle solving, investigating and getting confused at all the plot that's being thrown in my face. Even after the story, I still feel a bit confused at some story elements that will most likely be made clear on a second playthrough (in which I'll get all the hidden achievements). \n\nIn conclusion, I feel this game is severely underappreciated, and definitely qualifies as a hidden gem.

And it was wonderful. This adventure had a great story, believable characters, a realistic setting (at least in the beginning), great (sometimes quite hard) puzzles, and a writing with some well balanced mixture of excitement, mystery and humour to it. GK1 immediately became my favourite adventure, and it stayed that way ever since.\n\nBut what does this have to do with Kathy Rain? Why would I bring this up?\n\nBecause KR almost immediately created the same feelings I had when I played GK1 back then. Almost from the title screen it felt like playing a Gabriel Knight game. But this was not only subjective - there are objective resemblances between those two games. And it was not just the visuals:\n- Both KR and GK1 have a great mixture of humour and mystery, without the humour spoiling the mystery\n- In both games the main character has a sidekick that does some part of the research\n- Both main characters are sarcastic, somewhat messy writers riding mororcycles\n- The family history plays a major role in both stories\n- Both games play roughly at the same time (GK1: 1993; KR: 1995)\n- Both games share a large set of common settings (like a church, a police station, a graveyard, a bar, [spoiler]and the scene in the mausoleum[/spoiler] ...)\n- Both games pretty much start off with the main character visiting his/her grandmother :)\n\nSo... is KR a rip-off?\n\nNo, definitely not. While the resemblances may be uncanny, KR develops its own dark story that occasionally makes you laugh, and other times gives you the creeps, and stays strong until the [spoiler](semi open, yet satisfying)[/spoiler] end. The puzzles can be quite challenging, but not too difficult and shouldn't get you stuck. And if you pay attention, you most probably will always know generally what your current tasks are and how you might complete them.\n\nSo basically: Kathy Rain is a great adventure. I would really love to see a second part, and it was wonderful to play something I would call a well done hommage to my favourite adventure of all time :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1476729054, "timestamp_updated": 1476729054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26071484": {"recommendationid": "26071484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107312311", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476630526}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed the atmosphere and the story.", "timestamp_created": 1476630798, "timestamp_updated": 1476630798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25965147": {"recommendationid": "25965147", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996523882", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476103947}, "language": "polish", "review": "Solidna przygod\u00f3wka na 4+.

It wasn't as long, wasn't quite as interesting, had a few technical glitches, and cost more. \n\nThe game was very polished, and the voice acting was good. The main characters had plenty of flavor, although the supporting ones were a little uninspired. Of course, it's hard not to love a feisty girl with a custom chopper. A few of the interaction icons could be improved (as in \"oh that's supposed to be an eye, not a boobie. I guess 'examine' is more reasonable than 'flash' at grandpa's funeral\"). \n\nThe resolution issues were troublesome, and the only real reason I considered a negative review. It took alot of struggling to get the game fullscreen with the right aspect ratio (4:3). I have an awkward TV setup, so part of that was probably my hardware, but I noticed several other reviewers who complained about this too. It was certainly playable stretched to 16:9, but the characters all looked a bit chubby and the bike looked a little comic.

I adore the Blackwell series and other recent adeventure game throwbacks like Technobabylon and Primordia, but Kathy Rain never manages to reach those dramatic heights. Uninspired puzzles, a tedious middle plot, redundant mechanics, and a Lynchian dream of an endgame all rank Kathy Rain well below titles published over two decades ago.\n\nUltimately, it's good enough for most genre fans, but there are far better titles out there; however, as a diehard genre fan, I truly hope we see more of Kathy because she deserves a second bout to prove her mettle. I had hoped to see a lot more from what I still believe a very clever character.\n\nTo its credit, Kathy Rain pays homage to the classics of Sierra and Lucasarts, even dropping a few references here and there (and an unmistakable Twin Peaks nod to boot). Applying the vocal direction of Wadjet Eye's own Dave Gilbert elevates the game's dialogue with a strong dramatic presence, and the background art is beyond reproach-- especially for a one-man effort. \n\nThere's a lot that point 'n click veterans will find almost all-too-familiar, though: a Gabriel Knight-style notepad for dialogue; a GK3 tape recorder puzzle; a Monkey Island 2 poem/song puzzle in which the verses correspond to a combination; and, of course, \"USE\"ing every item on everything just like in [insert adventure game here].  It's a game aplomb with such similarities -- similarities so frequent that you may find yourself saying \"I've played this game before.\"  Unfortunately, the borrowing tactic harms Kathy Rain's novelty, and its untethered plot cannot rescue it. \n\nTruthfully it would be easy to forgive Kathy Rain if the story didn't let me down. The plot's midsection drags as Kathy spends her time gathering new dialogue topics and trying them out on different characters. I admit that at one point during a particularly uninteresting dialogue, I Shift+Tab'd to Imgur and forgot I was playing the game. \n\nThe endgame leaves many questions to be answered in a LOST-Season-4 kind of way instead of a \"When is Stranger Things 2 coming out?\" kind of way.\n\nIf you don't mind \n-an occasionally dull pace \n-an ayahuasca-bender-inspired ending \n-\"puzzles\" that rarely ask more than using the right item on the right hotspot (and the few puzzles that do ask more are as challenging as applying the only clue available to the problem)\n\nIf you've already played everything else like it, Kathy Rain could be a fine way to spend a few hours.  \n\nIf you haven't already played everything else like it, there are a lot of games from two decades ago that are considerably better.", "timestamp_created": 1473216438, "timestamp_updated": 1473216438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25187720": {"recommendationid": "25187720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170045799", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472323016}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing adventure game, consider this as well spent 15 euros.", "timestamp_created": 1472323162, "timestamp_updated": 1472323162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25139278": {"recommendationid": "25139278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255411905", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471748370}, "language": "german", "review": "Super Spiel interessant gemacht und teilweise witzig gestaltet", "timestamp_created": 1472156692, "timestamp_updated": 1472156692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25122370": {"recommendationid": "25122370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111507425", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472080286}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished this and am really hoping there will be a sequel or two. \nI came to really like Kathy ; she's a gutsy, \"anti hero\"  but in no way resembles Nancy Drew\n(??

Interesting story that develops nicely. Perhaps a bit light on the puzzles. Did you enjoy the Blackwell games (and/or Twin Peaks), chances are you will enjoy this one. Looking forward to the next one.\n\nThe Game:\nThe game is simple enough to explain as it is a point and click adventure. The graphics are retro style and seldom does this feel like it hinders the telling of the story. You might have to sort to using the space bar to higlight points of interest. The pace is fast, dialog not to much and not to little. I sometimes find that endlessly convoluted dialog is just to much. Here I felt it was just right. Few items makes for litte \"brute force\" in combining items and points of interest. Its a logical game.\n\nThe puzzles:\nEasy and logical enough apart from a few that are really painfull, and they all have to do with finding codes. That is perhaps my one gripe with the game is that some things are really hard as things needs to be sequenced just right and other things are very simple. I admit to using walkhtrouhs when I know what I need to do, but need help doing it.\n\nThe story:\nIts something else, it starts out simple enough but then devlops nicely. PG guidiance is advised, not just for the strong language and some more grown up scenes. I have a little vibe of the earlier Broken Sword games, and a lot of Twin Peaks.\nThe main character is nicely written, perhaps a little one dimensional, but she develops ok.

The game features retro graphics which may put off some folks but also features full voice overs and character portraits to give you better feeling how a character is feeling.\n\nThe game is a bit short, as it took me five hours to complete it. Also, some people had trouble enjoying the game because the main character is a punk and is irreverent towards authority figures but that really depends on what you're looking for in a character. The protagonist, Kathy, does have an interesting personality and some of the dialogue can be quite amusing especially when Kathy doesn't get her way.\n\nI think this game has a lot in common with Gabriel Knight and worth checking out if you're a fan of the Gabriel Knight series.

It\u2019s a point and click game where you play as sassy Kathy Rain trying to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding your grandfather\u2019s death. It\u2019s a point and click detective game with a female lead plus retro pixel graphics; on the surface, it seemed like a no-brainer to me. However, upon delving into the game itself I found myself a bit conflicted. Everything about the game is top notch, from visuals to voice acting. The gameplay is smooth as are the controls, it\u2019s the story that lumbers. Depending on a player\u2019s taste, it will be either hit or miss.\n\nI admit when I jumped into this I was eager to play a detective game, working along with Kathy to figure out clues and solve the mysteries. The first half of the game does indeed invoke this tone. You\u2019re in control of Kathy Rain, a journalism major who has a bit of an attitude problem. Despite being a college student, Kathy doesn\u2019t seem to ever go to class, instead opting for being lazy and partying so she has ample time to be a detective on the side. She learns from her roommate, who is the complete opposite to Kathy personality-wise, that her grandfather has passed. Kathy becomes determined to figure out what happened to her grandfather, finding clues to his past as a war veteran as well as the shady history of the town he lived in. With a quick wit and a sharp tongue, we help our hero investigate the situation, finding out that it extends even farther than just dear old granddad all while learning more about Kathy\u2019s troubled upbringing and family issues.\n\nAnd then things got weird. While I had a suspicion things would take a supernatural twist, I was hoping that they wouldn\u2019t, but they do. Around halfway through the game it becomes clear that this isn\u2019t just a simple detective story, there is something other-worldly happening. I won\u2019t spoil exactly what it is, however I couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to. The ending of the game left me very confused to the point where I have more questions than answers. Between Kathy having weird dreams and talking to ghosts, the game tries to squeeze in character development by having her overcome inner demons that had been holding her back. I commend the story wanting to do this, however I personally didn\u2019t feel the need for the supernatural aspect to do this. The final chapter of the game unfortunately feels rushed because of it, trying to tie up the loose ends of the plot with her grandfather and the creepy town while also giving Kathy her epiphany. While the game seemed to be trying to end in a way satisfying for players, it also left itself open for sequels. \n\nStory aside, the game itself is very simple. It\u2019s a point and click adventure game so all you need is a mouse to play, though there are a couple of moments where you need to type something in with your keyboard but it\u2019s not a major gameplay aspect. Using your mouse, you control where Kathy goes and what she does, clicking on objects and people to interact with them. You have an inventory system where useful and important items are collected for later use. You can inspect items in your inventory, like to read a newspaper clipping, or combine certain items to either make a new item or effect another item, like using Kathy\u2019s lighter on a Bible in the church. The game has a few puzzles but nothing very complicated and usually Kathy will tell you enough details to figure things out. The only issue I had was that Kathy herself moves rather slowly when she walks, you also can\u2019t double click a door to instantly go through it so you\u2019re forced to wait for Kathy to walk everywhere. \n\nThe game is beautiful, I adored the graphic style and the choice to go with pixel artwork. It\u2019s very simple yet done very well, lovely shading work and the character animations all seem very natural. Each character also has a portrait as well, since it might be hard to see the details of their faces on their character models due to the pixels. The backgrounds are rich, fitting well with the dreary tone of the game. There is also full voice acting and it\u2019s done very well. Kathy has a witty line for almost everything so feel free to click away at items in the game. Every character you interact with has a voice and plenty to say making it easier to immerse yourself in the game. The music also helps with this, the soundtrack is perfectly fitting to the gritty backdrop of the small backwater town. \n\nThis is a game that packs a lot of punch in a small package, while on the surface it may seem like just another point and click game using simple pixel graphics, [i]Kathy Rain[/i] proves itself to be the total package. The writing is amazing, Kathy is an engaging character full of humor and common sense and while I may not have found the story to be perfect, I enjoyed it none the less. The truth is, there could have been flying dogs from Mars that came and took over the town, Kathy herself is such a great main character I would play anyway. She carries this game on her shoulders as she rides down the highway on her pink motorcycle. While the price tag may seem a tad high, you won\u2019t be disappointed if you add this to your library. It\u2019s a fun experience, a well made game and also Steam trading cards and achievements. I hope that this title is only the first in many more games starring Ms. Rain.\n\n[h1]Usagi\u2019s Rating[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*][b]Must buy.[/b]\n[*]A good game to buy.\n[*]Only buy if on sale.\n[*]Mediocre.\n[*]Avoid at all costs.\n[/list]\n\n[url=http://wordofthenerdonline.com/]Word of the Nerd[/url]\n\n[url=http://lunarproductions.tumblr.com/]Lunar Productions[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1469220762, "timestamp_updated": 1469478033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675550", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24455395": {"recommendationid": "24455395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299690769", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467371649}, "language": "english", "review": "Good character, easy play through, unexpected weirdnesses", "timestamp_created": 1469173807, "timestamp_updated": 1469173807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24416548": {"recommendationid": "24416548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027311681", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480195321}, "language": "english", "review": "Best quest i played for a long time, much better than any other around, strongly recommend:\n\n-great atmosphere, epic graphics, art is beuatiful, muic too\n-well designed puzzles that perfectly fit the gameplay and atmosphere (they are neither the hardest i ve seen in my life nor the easiest, but they are very well balanced not to make it too hard or too easy).

I thought the game really fell apart at the end, and the resolution kind of leaves more questions than answers, but the series itself definitely has potential going forward.  I do wish they'd settle on a tone.  Much of the game is serious and fairly dark, as the mystery centered around why Kathy's grandpa went into a state of catatonic shock years earlier and what happened to a girl who drowned around the same time period, so the bad attempts at humor really stand out.  The further problem for me is that the game hints at a mystery that is much more intriguing than where the story actually goes.\n\nAll in all, if you like old school, point and click adventure games, this is a decent Steam sale buy.

But the sheer balls of the ending in which they went all out with the creepiness (for better or worse) earned them that extra bit.\n\nI can understand why some people are ambivilant about that aforementioned ending.  No, it's not a problem that the ending is \"supernatural.\"  (Kind of a silly complaint, as it was clear from pretty early on that this was a supernatural plot.  Not a Scooby Doo type of thing.)\n\nHowever, what some people might not be prepared for is how fully the game descends (literally) into all out surreal horror.  (It's not completely out of left field.  I mean, the game had been gradually getting creepier and weirder, especially when Kathy visits that guy in the mental institution and he starts babbling about conduits to Hell.)  \n\nI'm talking specifically about the extended sequence at the end that brings to mind \"Hellraiser 2\" or \"In the Mouth of Madness.\"  Gone are the familiar, comfortable touchstones of the plot, and we as the player are now stuck with our main character in a claustrophobic version of her own personal hell.  In fact, it's so well done that it might hurt the enjoyability factor of the game as it veers into genuine unpleasantness.  I mean, it gets dark, people.  (If you were hoping for a Monkey Island knockoff, this is a bad thing.  If you were hoping for a game that's unsettling, then I guess it's a good thing.)\n\nThe plot, thankfully, does resolve itself at the end.  Sort of.  Even if I wasn't entirely clear on what it all meant, I still felt some closure.  And it made me curious--if this game is successful, how would they approach a sequel?  I mean, Kathy is not a typical mystery-solver in this game.  She's not a gumshoe who goes looking for crimes to solve.  (Such a premise would easily lend itself to more adventures.)  No.  This story, rather, was entirely predicated on a very specific supernatural problem having to do with her hometown.  So how could such a scenario happen again?

(This point doesn't mean much. Just go play an older, better game.)\n[/list]\n\n[b]Now for the cons.[/b] For the cons I won't even list it out. The main character is insufferable and she might just be one of the most poorly written characters in all of gaming history. The levels of cringe and regret I had within the first 12 minutes of this game were outrageous. I didn't even go into this game expecting much. I wanted a fun point and click adventure game and I got a game in which you play as a edgy, alcoholic feminist girly girl? What? Even her name is Kathy Rain Rain. It's like the dumbest shit I've ever seen. It doesn't end there though. So, the main character is garbage. I'm sure the others are good though, right? No. Every single character in this game gives me aids. They are ALL annoying. But no one is worse than Kathy herself.\n\nSo what about the story? The story, I did not finish. I'm not playing through your 13 dollar game if you do nothing but annoy me and bore me for 2 and a half hours. Plus, the game makes me jump through hoop after hoop in order to get from one point to another. There's a part really early on in the game in which you find an overexposed photo and Kathy says she knows a place she can go to fix the photo, but you can't go there until much later. I don't know what the writer of the story thought they were doing. It isn't a super complex story, either. I predicted, correctly pretty much every single thing that would happen as I played the game because it's just so simple which is probably a huge reason why thinking you're making a complex web of plot by putting crucial storyline items in very early areas of the game annoys the everloving fuck out of me. \n\nI know I said this next thing I'm going to talk about was a pro, but I was only talking about the backgrounds. The art in this game is ugly. All of the characters look horrible and most of the up-close areas are just simply not nice to look at. I realize it's supposed to be a throwback kind of game but you can put modern effort into the graphics and artwork of your game, believe it or not. If the game had an option to play at 1920x1080 or in borderless windowed, that would've been nice too. But nah, it's a throwback game. It has to look like dog shit because it's 1995 still, not 2016. K.\n\nI could go on and on about how cancerous this game is, but I really don't want to dedicate any more of my time to this piece of shit. Please, please, please spend your money elsewhere.

Aside from a couple of text entry screens, the entire game is controlled via the mouse. Your inventory lives in a handy backpack at the bottom of the screen, and naturally includes valuables like your notebook, taser, smokes, and your favorite lighter. The cursor lights up whenever you pass it over an object or character you can interact with, so you can say goodbye to the old, frustrating hunt-the-pixel puzzles of the past. The puzzles range from \u201cbraindead easy\u201d to \u201csomewhat frustrating,\u201d but in the end, they mostly make sense.\n\nThere's no way to die here, either \u2013 which, while it may take away from the tension a bit, is welcome in a genre notorious for killing characters off for really, really stupid reasons. If you're a fan of the genre, this game will bring you back \u2013 while alleviating many of the frustrations that traditionally come with the package. If you're new to the genre, it's a great place to start.\n\nStory and Flow\nThe year is 1995. Kathy Rain, the titular heroine, is headed back to her old hometown after finding out that her beloved grandfather has suddenly passed away. Once she arrives, of course, she finds out that some strange things have been going on. In the end, she has to face her own demons, even as she digs up those in her grandfather's past.\n\nIs the recalcitrant town sheriff in on some dirty little secrets, or is he just lazy? Is the pushy town priest just desperate for parishioners, or is he more than he seems? Is the crabby lady who lives outside of town really five seconds away from filling you full of lead, or is she just jonesing for a sweet, sweet cancer stick between her lips? Is the mysterious, wealthy industrialist the Big Bad with his fingers in all the local intrigue, or is he just some guy? Play the game and find out.\n\nControls\nKathy Rain uses the mouse and the left mouse button, along with a couple of very brief text-entry sections, but that's it. Simple and straightforward. Click on a location to go there, click an item (in the world or in your bag) or NPC to interact with or examine them. Choose \u201cCombine\u201d to light up a smoke, drop a cassette into a tape player (remember those, boys and girls?), and the like. Your character will automatically keep track of important conversation points and phone numbers in her notebook. When traveling between areas on your custom chopper, just click the destination and Kathy will ride there on her own. The connection to Full Throttle (which is getting an HD remaster one of these days) is very much in play.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n100% all-natural pixels, love 'em or leave 'em. Highly-detailed areas that all contribute to the look and feel of the game's odd little world. You may need to play with the graphics settings a bit to make it easier on the eyes. Right-click the game's list entry in Steam (or CTRL-double click) to access the config utility. Set the graphics filter as high as it will go; if the game refuses to run, drop it down a notch, one at a time, until you get one that your card is happy with (e.g.: screenshots in this article were taken at 1080p, 4X nearest-neighbor filter setting). If you can't stand to stare at pixels, this may not be the game for you.\n\nA free demo is available, though, so give that a shot; it's a good way to assess whether you'll like the visual and aural styles or not. And speaking of aural style, he game\u2019s subtle, effective soundtrack works perfectly with the just-creepy-enough setting, and the voice acting is really good too.\n[Eric Kei]\n\nSummary\nKathy Rain features a well-thought out, coherent story, with some superb voice acting that complements the clever writing. Fun bonus: Most of the achievements are for silly things that are unimportant to the plot \u2013 e.g. finding a victim for your secondhand smoke, messing with a teddy bear, or even something as simple as idling too long on a screen without doing anything productive. This is a worthy title, and an excellent modernization of the classic point-and-click adventure. I'm looking forward to more from this studio in the future.\n\nPreviously published on dlh.net -- Eric_Kei\n\nAlso at: http://www.dlh.net/en/reviews/2136/kathy-rain--pc-.html", "timestamp_created": 1467256144, "timestamp_updated": 1506125732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538840", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23891687": {"recommendationid": "23891687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045804563", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467056608}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Kathy Rain es una aventura gr\u00e1fica de corte cl\u00e1sico ambientada en 1995 y, en ella, encarnamos a Kathy, una universitaria un tanto rebelde que vive una placida vida estudiantil en un campus.

I was weaned on the early Sierra and Lucasarts adventures a a kid in the 80s, and stuck with that genre until it petered out in the 90s (with some notable exceptions). The recent adventure game revival has been exciting for me in theory, but none of them have really engaged me like some of the games I cut my teeth on once did (granted, as a kid, it was easier to capture my attention than it is now). This game was a masterpiece of writing, art design and voice acting. It wasn't tough, in fact I played it through in one (six hour) sitting. But those hours passed quickly because I was so taken with the story and the characters. There are none of the absurdly difficult combine-every-item-you-have-in-every-possible-order style puzzles, and the puzzles you will face are generally easy (barring one insanely obtuse, but thematically appropriate, one toward the end), but this is a good thing. That is to say the puzzles won't make you pull your hair out and get sick of the game for a week, only to come back to it later and repeat the process.\n\nI think this succeeds so well because it is a game for adults, and given its setting in the 90s, probably for people who lived through that period (ie. former adventure game addicts like myself). There are 'adult themes' and colorful usage of swear words, etc. Even though it's a fairly quick game (I finished it in 6  hours, as I mentioned) it's absolutely worth the $15 price point, and I hope a lot of people buy this so more games of this caliber, within this style, will continue to be made.\n\nEnjoyed it far more than any of the other new, flashier and 'prettier' adventure games. This one provides a memorable thematic experience that will stick with you the way the Colonel's Bequest or Space Quest III (to name a couple) once did. I have intentionally not said anything about the plot, because it's better to come into this game with an open mind, not knowing what to expect next.

There really needs to be a midpoint grade on Steam. But, I can't quite go as far as definitively \"not recommending\" Kathy Rain.\n\nWhether or not it's worth playing is a matter of interpretation. There's been a real lack of old-school P+C adventure games for a while now, and this will scratch an itch, but have a luke warm after taste. If time is precious and you're looking for quality in the realms of the Broken Sword games, though, you certainly won't find it here.\n\nPros -\n\nNice retro art style. The pixelation may just be a tad too far, but it works for the most part.\n\nFull voice acting - really well done too.\n\nMostly logical path progression. None of the bizarre and nonsensical methods of furthering the story with certain puzzles found in games of its ilk are found here.\n\nCons - \n\nThe story as a whole is very frail and quite slipshod. It's no surprise that references to Jacob's Ladder and other psychological related themes are found here. The problem is the game never really builds the house with which to explore the psycho-babble that presents itself toward the end of the game. Very minor, one-shot flashbacks are the sole source of story-engineering in relation to the main character, and it all comes across as gibberish that you won't care to analyze, unlike, say, a Silent Hill game, where there is a lot more to delve into. A cardinal sin of story telling is to unleash these elements long after the second act has passed. You change the genre and nature of your story at that point, and you have clearly no grasp of your plot, and neither does your audience.\n\nThe puzzles range from the incredibly simple to the incredibly simple but vague. Because of the small game areas it's never too hard to guess what actions you need to progress the story. And the puzzles never provide any real brains, except from a few downright nonsensical ones that involve partial riddle-solving that most likely seemed a good idea to the writer at the time. All the difficulty is kind of snuffed out when you can just randomly enter solutions with little recourse, though.\n\n\nAll in all, Kathy Rain has some things going for it.

If you have played more recent games  like Gemini Rue, Resonance, Primordia or Technobabylon, you will know what to expect from this type of modern day indie adventure.\n\nPlot: Kathy Rain is a young college student with an attitude and a chip on her shoulder. At the very beginning of the game Kathy finds out her grandfather, whom she has not seen since she was a young girl, has passed away. Due to a muddy family history she had hoped to turn her back on her family life, but she is relucantly drawn back in. It wouldn't be much of mystery if her grandfathers demise were just plain old age, so it's not to much of a spoiler to say that of course he didn't. Kathy is determined to find out what happened and set things straight. The plot is engaging and kept me interested throughout its approximately 7-8 hour playtime.\n\n8/10\n\nGameplay: This is standard adventure game fare. Kathy walks around the town talking to people to uncover leads, all the while picking up a collection of objects that can be used on each other or the environment to solve various puzzles. It's all pretty straight forward, and vetrans likely wont find much to challenge them for long.  This is not a knock against the game by the way, while I found it easy that'scertainly better than infuriatingly illogical puzzles that can only be solved with a walkthrough.\n\n7/10\n\nGraphics and Sound: The game looks really good, so long as you don't mind the 90's visual asthetic. Personally Im a big fan of this style of art and most of the environments pop. Sound and music is solid throughout, though nothing stands out as exceptional. The voice acting is really good for a small indie title, with Dave Gilbert of Wadget Eye stepping in to do voice direction. Everyone's voice suits their character, and I only found one voice grated a little, but given his personality I think that might be deliberate.\n\n7.5/10\n\nOverall: Another solid indie adventure made using the AGS engine, with good characters and an enjoyable story that left me hoping for more adventures with Cathy and her friend as protagonists. Honestly, I really want to see where they take her character as this feels like an origin story with bigger and better things to come\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1463224689, "timestamp_updated": 1463224689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22972294": {"recommendationid": "22972294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046281923", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463216933}, "language": "english", "review": "Even better than the Blackwell series.

Kathy Rain is the story of a budding journalist in college who has to come to terms with her troubled past as she investigates the death of her recently deceased grandfather. The journey will take Kathy to the town of Conwell Springs, where she\u2019ll begin to dig into a local mystery surrounding her hometown, taking her on a road full of emotional rollercoasters along the way.\n\nKathy Rain is about as standard a click-and-point adventure game could get. You have an items menu, a motorcycle to travel around on (more on this later), a notepad where Kathy will write down those important notes to talk to those in the town with, and of course, you have the ability to combine item a with item b along with the ability to view items yourself and ask people about certain items. Truthfully, it\u2019s fairly plain, but that\u2019s not inherently a bad thing. You\u2019ll play as Kathy, run around, talk to people, solve a mystery, have a crisis, it\u2019s bordering an old, Hanna Barbara Scooby Doo plot level of ham, complete with a certain character getting kidnapped. Just don\u2019t go looking into something unique in terms of gameplay, because that\u2019s not the hook, and the game doesn\u2019t pretend for it to be the hook. There is one thing that sets the gameplay apart, which is the motorcycle.\n\nThe motorcycle allows Kathy to \u2018travel\u2019 to certain points of significance in the story. Along the way, she\u2019ll travel to places like lakeside cabins, the home of her grandmother, and a mysterious church. It\u2019s a neat feature but really, it\u2019s more a way to hide the fact that there\u2019s no actual \u2018overworld\u2019 and instead, relies on the motorcycle traveling acting as a sort of hubworld for the game. It\u2019s nice for the developers because it means you don\u2019t have to build a huge, giant city or town to explore. It\u2019s sad for the players because (in most cases) those overworlds are used to add personality and character to both the game itself, and the characters. Since that overworld really only exists metaphorically (I.E, the town of Conwell Springs) you lose a lot of that character and personality along the way. You also lose out on any other side-quests or adventures because the lack of an overworld. However, the gain is that the game can focus almost solely on Kathy and her story. The question is, how is the story?\n\nTo answer in the best way we can, it lacks a clear focus. We won\u2019t spoil any huge plot points, but the game\u2019s story is it\u2019s central focus, and it seems rather off. The story starts off rather well, even complete with the clich\u00e9 90s things we know and love, but the focus on who\u2019s story we\u2019re trying to tell seems split between the dead grandfather, and the granddaughter Kathy. This wouldn\u2019t be bad, but at the very end of the game, it\u2019s heavily implied that Kathy was close to the grandfather, when in reality, it\u2019s never really shown in game. As a matter of fact, towards the end, you\u2019ll find a very important note, and she replies \u201c He did try to fight for me, up until the very end\u201d and we had presumed she was talking about the father, who walked out on her and her mother when Kathy was six. But (without spoiling it) Kathy then has an epiphany, and says less than 30 minutes later that she\u2019s over the father, and we just had this really bothered look. Turns out, it wasn\u2019t the father who tried to fight for her [from the mother], but the grandfather, and we were just really dumbfounded. We presumed that the father was the one because Kathy mentions the mother constantly lying about people, and the fact that the father walked out combined gave us the impression it would have been the father that would have tried to fight for her.\n\nThe game constantly tries to imply that the grandfather and Kathy had this really great relationship, but there\u2019s few times where we actually get hints of it. Like, everyone around Kathy talks about the relationship, but it\u2019s only mentioned once of ever having one. When something happens involving these two at the end, we just felt sorely disconnected by it all. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, and the story still isn\u2019t awful, it\u2019s just above average. The thing is, besides this lack of focus, everyone else is interesting. All the characters are (if a bit generic) defined and unique, and everyone has the traits to be really interesting. The only one that feels rather \u2018token\u2019 is the main character, Kathy Rain. She has some interesting things that go on around her, about her, and to her, but she herself is rather \u2018meh\u2019. She does have a defined personality, and she does have a character arc (which we can\u2019t say about a lot of recent adventure games have) but the character arc feels really forced towards the end and without the punk, rebellious teen character traits, the game gives almost an impression of a character that could have easily been replaced. She\u2019s not bad to play as or anything, she\u2019s just rather \u2018there\u2019 rather than being \u2018THERE\u2019 .\n\nThere\u2019s also the token puzzle elements filled with token. They\u2019re there, they exist, and they\u2019re not bad or good, rather than being simply there. Some work, some don\u2019t. On the plus side, most of them are short, fairly obvious, avoid (for the most part) Sierra levels of stupid and ridiculous, and mostly work with the story. None of them are particularly fun to play, but they\u2019re certainly not bad as they could be.\n\nVisually, the game looks well, and is fairly reminiscent of the Blackwell games. While Kathy Rain doesn\u2019t have any particularly unique style, it does look nice and places well. It uses AGS (Adventure Game Studio) and plays in a weird resolution (thanks to AGS) . It works for the game, but modifying the engine to support other resolutions would be nice. Most of the sprites for the characters are actually pretty well done. Kathy looks off, but she\u2019s the only one. The horizon on the backgrounds are also fairly low, and thus, makes characters moving far back or forward off.\n\nAs for audio, it\u2019s actually fairly decent. The music is well done, and the ambient effects are okay. The voice acting was something that stood out to us, mainly because it\u2019s really well done, and there\u2019s not a whole lot of 2D click-and-point adventure games that bother with voice acting. While the voice acting is really well done, there is a very slight pause between each character speaking, and it makes conversations sound off.\n\nThe controls are also quite standard. You click on things, and you move around with the mouse. You have some basic options for the audio, but nothing in terms of visuals or resolution.\n\nAs for the entertainment factor, we enjoyed our time with the game. It\u2019s rather short at 5ish hours, but it may be longer if you decide to get all the achievements.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a pretty standard click-and-point adventure game, with some nice voice acting and fairly fleshed out characters. The story while short and rather hit or miss at the end, still was enjoyable enough to playthrough, and the things we did have wrong with the game didn\u2019t stop us from playing. The puzzles, meh story (towards the end) and lack of resolution options may turn off some players, but it certainly wasn\u2019t a horrible experience. We\u2019re not sure if we\u2019d suggest Kathy Rain at $14.99, but we did enjoy our time with the game.\n\n\n\n- PROS -\n\nThe music, voice acting, and overall audio is well done.\nThe UI and controls have been simplified since the old days of click-and-points, making the game far more enjoyable to play overall\nside characters are fairly well developed, and have fairly distinct personalities\n\n- MEH -\n\nThe main character (and the story) are both fairly predicable\n\n- CONS -\n\nDifferent resolution options would be nice\nThe game's main story falls apart at the very end", "timestamp_created": 1463168428, "timestamp_updated": 1463168428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22954940": {"recommendationid": "22954940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102722866", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463147428}, "language": "english", "review": "I very much enjoyed this game.

Armed with her motorcycle, a pack of cigs, and a notepad, Kathy begins to delve into a local mystery surrounding her hometown that will take her on a harrowing journey full of emotional and personal turmoil.[/i]\nI gotta say that, at first, I was really digging the story: the characters were fun, the mystery was intriguing, and the twists were unexpected. But the more I played the game, [spoiler]the more paranormal things started to happen[/spoiler] and that started ruining the whole experience. The ending was not good, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. The first three days are very good, but the last two are full of WTF moments.\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\nThe pixelated art style is full of vibrant colors and rich of details. The character portraits are also well done, with different expressions depending on how they are talking.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nThe same old point-and-click formula: talk to people, pick up objects, solve puzzles. There are some interesting sequences, but it mostly feels like a \"been there done that\" situation. But it still is done very well, and there are many objects to interact with, without feeling too much like you are pixel-hunting.\n\n[h1]CHALLENGE[/h1]\nOne early puzzle aside, there are plenty of clues both from the dialogues and from your in-game thoughts that will let you know what to do next without feeling like they are spilling the solution.\n\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\nThe voice acting is mostly good, with a couple of actors being a bit over-the-top and the lead actress being pretty great. The soundtrack is also okay, but it never reaches a \"memorable\" level (except for the 45-seconds loop when you have to choose where to go next).\n\n[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]\nMy first gameplay run took me a little over 3 hours to complete. There are some instances in which you can choose what to say in dialogue without having any consequences for the future. There are some achievements that might be missed quite easily since they require you to use various objects in weird ways, but I won't probably play this again.\n\nOverall, this is a decent adventure game that delivers a compelling story with fun puzzles, that is almost ruined by its ending.\n\n[h1]Story: 6.5\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 8\nReplayability: 6.5\n\n[b]ENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 3[/b][/h1]\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VuBkttXIrpbrxwfYL_B-w]Subscribe to my channel[/url]\n[url=http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming]Like on Facebook[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EnjoyTheGaming]Join my Steam group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1462799612, "timestamp_updated": 1462799612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488279", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22876702": {"recommendationid": "22876702", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994782386", "num_games_owned": 779, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462601432}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0434\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0447\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f AGS-\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u0443 \"\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\". \n\u041d\u0435\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c \"Blackwell\" \u043e\u0442 Wadjet Eye Games, \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0449\u0443\u0449\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0430 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0451\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0443 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0434\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u044f\u0437\u043a\u0438. \n\u0414\u0430 \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f: \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442 \u0411\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \"Full Throittle\"!\n\n\u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b -

Designed with a classic low resolution look however the graphics are extremely crisp and detailed. The music fits the game very well and sets a nice tone for each of the scene. The voice acting is extremely well done, especially for a small indie studio. This was a coment noted a number of times in twitch chat.\n\nI will refrain from going to much into the story as it should be experienced however the game ended leaving some deep and dark thoughts in my head. The pace of the game is good, the obligatory puzzles werent incredibly tough. For times where I had to think Kathy was always on hand to offer her thoughts which usually pushed me in the direction I needed to go to proceed.

As Kathy explores her old hometown she begins to uncover a secret of the town\u2019s past, one that her grandfather tried to uncover himself years ago which left him a broken shell of a man.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see that Gabriel Knight was a major influence for Kathy Rain. The game opens up with Kathy catching up with her Grandma in the old family home just like Gabe did with Grandma Knight in GK1. The game is also separated in days just like the Gabriel Knight games. Kathy Rain does a good job taking GK\u2019s influence and doing well with it. One could even say it\u2019s a quality spiritual successor. \n\nKathy Rain has a really good atmosphere, channeling that sense of slow burn mystery that made GK1 such a great game as well getting across the feeling of a lived in small town. The art is of the same high quality as the recent WadjetEye games and its soundtrack of ambient guitar tracks also helps the feel. Writing wise it\u2019s mostly quite good. Most of the primary main cast such as Kathy have depth and the mystery is an interesting one that will keep you engaged. I\u2019ve seen some people here complain that the ending doesn\u2019t solve anything, but I thought it was fine considering what road the narrative went down. Dave Gilbert, the head of WadjetEye, was the VA director and it shows. The voice-acting is some good stuff, namely Kathy\u2019s VA who also did Max Lao in Technobabylon.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly pretty good. It\u2019s more akin to the Blackwell series\u2019 puzzles were the main focus is investigation, dialogue, and simple inventory puzzles. Kathy even has a notebook like Rosa does. There is only one puzzle that I say sucks because it\u2019s this big riddle type of puzzle that due to some awkward wording is way harder than it should be. (Like for an example ignoring that the narrative has a given another meaning to a phrase in the riddle that seems like that it would be more relevant than the actual solution.)There is another puzzle that while not obtuse, rather falls into the sociopathic adventure game protagonist solution problem, which is a bit jarring for a game that\u2019s trying to be more human and serious.\n\nOverall Kathy Rain is yet another addition to  the high-quality adventure games of recent years.

There's also a huge amount of the game that can be interpreted in many ways, which I think really keeps the mystery going. Ultimately, it is more than about what happened to her grandfather, and a lot about Kathy struggling to put the past behind her.\n\nThe game itself, while a little shorter than some similar games (I initially found it remeniscent of games like The Longest Journey, and there's quite a similarity between the two protagonists), has a mostly strong story. There are a couple of things that could have been elaborated on, and some that seemed to go on for too long, but that's the same with any game like this. The way you do things is not completely rigid, but you don't get the same aspect of control over everything - for example, while you occasionally get the options for different responses to people, most of the time it seems to have no future effect.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are quite well thought-out, though at times they are not obvious, and you might find yourself reaching for a walkthrough once or twice. There's nothing that doesn't make sense once you've done it, but a few (such as getting the clinic receptionist away from her desk) aren't what most would think of doing.\n\nThere also seems to be a running theme of mental illness throughout the game, and it's great to see it dealt with outside of the usual serial killer/unintelligible rambler tropes. Kathy is clearly troubled by the difficulties of those around her, despite her attitude, and it's subtly played throughout the game as she turns from a feisty no-s**ts-given biker chick, to a vulnerable woman whose past is possibly leading her to the same fate as her mother.\n\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend this game.

Squee. An investigation of an intriguing slightly ominous mystery with cool characters, funny dialogues and neat puzzles? Yes, yes please! I want to rub my face in these things like a herd of cats on a field of valerian plants. It's been such a long time since Gray Matter got released. Don't mind that the face gets red and a bit flattened when you rub it over your computer screen, just give me these things nao. \n\nBut there's no escaping that this is a story-driven game, which ultimately can't evade being judged by its story. Which is a well-delivered, intriguing, suspenseful, at times brilliant pile of cat shit that entirely unsuspiciously appeared on the former field of the valerian plants. I mean, seriously, the resolution and the whole mystery by extention just... suck. And this, sadly, won't do at all. It could work if everything wasn't hinged on them, if they were there to add some flavour to the story about completely different things. Hell, it could work even if the focus was shifted a little and everything wasn't so convinient and fitting for the protagonist. But that is not the case. The whole plot relies on the mystery (and this is a huge part of the appeal in the cases when the mystery does get pulled off), but when the mystery sucks, you can't really do anything. The whole game just turns into a huge letdown. You just feel like being slapped in the face while you're too busy rubbing it in your computer screen to see it coming.\n\nI mean, seriously, if the resolution to the whole thing was Sam Fisher hiding in the woods, it'd still be better. Heck, it would be better if the resolution to the whole thing was the protagonist being hypnotized by a hallucinations-inducing wolf before being eaten. There's literally almost nothing worse than the explanation to the mystery we get. Maybe it being ripped off from Twin Peaks in a really bad way, without understanding of what made Twin Peaks so cool? Oh wait. \n\nWell, there's a good side to all this. Somewhere. Probably. Maybe?

Her utterly routine life gets a rude awakening when she learns of her estranged Grandfather\u2019s funeral. Like a good granddaughter, she heads back to her home town to see him laid to rest. She learns that her Grandfather was inexplicably discovered in a vegetative state not long after she left town. A simple query into his ailment leads her into a long mysterious journey. \n\nKathy Rain is very reminiscent of adventure titles like Gabriel Knight and shows like Twin Peaks. It follows Kathy through a grounded mystery with some supernatural elements thrown in. I played the game for five hours straight trying to understand where the story was heading.\n\n There were areas when the game introduced supernatural elements, but the time surrounding these small moments often headed into muddy waters. Kathy obviously had a troubled life growing up with her mother after leaving Conwell Springs and has various bad dreams due to it.\n\nThe game touches on these dreams of her past so vaguely you might start to wonder why any of it was included. The dream events eventually flesh themselves out near the end but I had already forgotten most of the elements by that time. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that the story itself isn\u2019t compelling because it\u2019ll keep you hungry for that next piece of the puzzle. But if you aren\u2019t a patient person you could lose interest in the tale in just a few hours.  I\u2019m trying not to spoil anything so I\u2019ll just say that everything Kathy goes through is extremely mundane. \n\nFor instance, she\u2019ll have to use a floppy disk to steal an IT Tech\u2019s password. Make a Bloody Mary to gain a Motorcycle Gang Leader\u2019s trust. Needless to say, Kathy spends a lot of her time in low risk situations trying to solve a mystery that tries its hardest to stay hidden. \n\nSpeaking of the puzzles, they are fairly appealing for the genre. Everything except for the damn briefcase puzzle is intuitive and engaging. Seriously, the briefcase brainteaser doesn\u2019t make any damn sense compared to the rest of the riddles in the game. Every other puzzle gives us a logical idea of a problem and enough explanation on how to solve it. \nYou won\u2019t have to do any pixel hunting in this game due to the reasonable puzzle structure.\n\nKathy Rain is very straightforward about what it wants out of us as players. It keeps the story moving which works wonders because of the obvious pacing issues with the story. The brainteasers are well thought out and a contain some out of the box thinking compared many adventure titles. One of my favorites involves ripping words out of an audio tape to use it to trick someone into helping Kathy get her way. \n\nStepping away from the gameplay, let\u2019s talk about the visuals a bit. Kathy Rain is another game that harkens back to the good ol\u2019 times of adventure gaming. Expect pixelated sprites surrounded by detailed and colorful backdrops. \n\nThere are quite a few idle animations but frames were saved when it comes to characters speaking. The character portraits are distinctly represent each actor on screen. Although they are devoid of animation, they do change moods during dialogue sequences. \n\nThe voiceover is overall pretty great but some of the character voices are too soft. The music is slightly basic with only a few tunes actually sticking in my mind. \n\nKathy Rain is an amusing adventure that takes a little too long to get off the ground. It\u2019s not Final Fantasy XIII tutorial levels long but the overall mystery stays buried for far longer than it should. It\u2019s a fascinating mystery on the level of a Murder She Wrote, but those looking for more twists and turns may want to look elsewhere. I recommend this to fans of the Mystery genre but if you have any problem with a story taking more than five hours to flesh out\u2026 you need not apply.", "timestamp_created": 1462501559, "timestamp_updated": 1462501584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22819245": {"recommendationid": "22819245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014453566", "num_games_owned": 585, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462984657}, "language": "english", "review": "Kathy Rain is a throwback in more ways than one. For a start, it\u2019s set in the year 1995, with all of that period's now-weird retro quirks intact. I suppose it\u2019s quite a clever way to make players look stupid when they roll their eyes at a perplexing clue and yell \u201cjust Google it!\u201d at the screen. And the title reminds you of its era in other ways, like when it has you hack computers with floppy disks and calls those bulbous CRT monitors you still hide in your loft \"cutting edge.\" But, more than that, it\u2019s a proper old-school adventure game in the same vein as classic fare such as Full Throttle and Gabriel Knight. It consists of pixel graphics and inventory puzzles and people who don't get annoyed after being asked the same question or shown the same item dozens of times as you seek out increasingly obscure solutions to problems you just can\u2019t solve.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of that last thing, to be fair. Kathy has increasingly bizarre discoveries to make, but the mystery she hopes to solve never requires ludicrous leaps of logic. Or, at least, it never ventures beyond that special Adventure Game Logic\u2122 that insists all of the world\u2019s complications can be solved with obscure lateral thinking and whatever junk we can cram into the infinite spaces that are our pockets.\n\nFull review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12972/pc/kathy-rain/review.html", "timestamp_created": 1462493847, "timestamp_updated": 1462493847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22817582": {"recommendationid": "22817582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007078407", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462484492}, "language": "german", "review": "Great classic point-and-click adventure so far!", "timestamp_created": 1462484529, "timestamp_updated": 1462484529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22816451": {"recommendationid": "22816451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075164112", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485821061}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredible game.

She also humorously breaks the fourth wall when commenting certain commands and that's something that had me chuckle a few times. The plot, without spoiling anything, is solid and the mystery you're called to investigate goes down the rabbit hole a good way, sometimes giving eerie vibes that- for me- echoed shows like Twin Peaks.\n\nAs gameplay goes the puzzles are serviceable and straightforward, I think most of them will probably feel quite easy for most people so don't expect your brain to be majorly tested: while this keeps the adventure flowing smoothly it's a bit of a shame we didn't get more of a challenge.\n\nAs gripes go, having to click a bag and then use tiny arrows for the inventory feels a bit clunky in the long run, a more modern approach with a disappearing inventory'd have worked better. Animations when you enter/ exit a zone, especially those involving the motorcycle, can get dull as you revisit zones: call me spoiled but I'd have liked a \"double click to quick navigate\". Last but not least a few characters just seemed to be there to fill me with background information and/ or leads and were somewhat lacking in depth.\n\nAll things considered Kathy Rain is a well crafted adventure that I recommend to both seasoned players, who'd find a worthy detective story and captivating protagonist, and newcomers to the genre due to its straightforward puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1462476420, "timestamp_updated": 1462503157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612946", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22815289": {"recommendationid": "22815289", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970432053", "num_games_owned": 723, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463603107}, "language": "german", "review": "Kathy Rain ist f\u00fcr mich wie ein guter Krimi mit sehr tiefgr\u00fcndigen und spannenden aber auch lustigen Momenten.

I like you kid. [/h1]\n\n[b]This review will not contain any spoilers. [/b]\n\nKathy Rain is a point & click adventure game developed by Clifftop Games. You play as Kathy Rain, a third year journalism student who fancies herself as a bit of a detective. After the death of your grandfather, Joseph Rain, you decide to return to your hometown of Conwell Springs for the first time since you were a child to attend your grandfather\u2019s funeral. After the funeral, Kathy begins investigating a local mystery which has been left unsolved for a decade, as you investigate you\u2019ll learn more about Kathy\u2019s past as well as the people in the town.\n\nWorth a mention: It took me just shy of five hours to complete the story but it seems like the average completion time is eight-ten hours, probably due to the achievements in the game that I didn\u2019t get.\n\nWhen I first saw Kathy Rain (the game) I was unsure about the fact that the game is in a 4:3 aspect ratio. Thankfully KR is visually very good. The 4:3 aspect ratio works well (the window is automatically sized to your monitor with black bars on either side in fullscreen or you can just play in a 320x240 window) and the pixel art graphics are fantastic. There\u2019s not a huge amount of detail in the characters (not really an issue) but the backgrounds for the different locations are absolutely fantastic. During dialogue a portrait for the character speaking is displayed on-screen, these are also fantastic and their facial expression changes so it\u2019s appropriate for what they\u2019re saying which is a nice touch.\n\nKR is, at its heart, a story-driven game and so it\u2019s obviously incredibly important that KR has a solid, engaging plot. Luckily for those interested in playing the game, it does indeed have an excellent, well-written plot. What begins as a simple investigation into a decade-old incident quickly becomes something far more intriguing and sinister over the course of the five days the game takes place in. To uncover the truth you\u2019ll find yourself speaking to many different residents of Conwell Springs which also means you\u2019ll get to visit a fair few locations. I can\u2019t really say much more than that without spoiling the game but it really is an enjoyable story, particularly if you\u2019re a fan of detective stories like I am.\n\nThe actual gameplay consists of solving puzzles. I found them to be quite challenging as someone who doesn\u2019t usually play point & click games but genre veterans may not find them too difficult (there are hints in the game for how to solve them anyway). The puzzles aren\u2019t just thrown in for a bit of gameplay here and there, they are actually used to advance the plot which makes solving them far more enjoyable. Some puzzles will require the use of items you have previously collected from somewhere which are stored in your inventory. While it is possible to miss these items you can always go back to the location they are in later to collect them if you need them. \n\nAs well as a small bag which serves as your inventory, Kathy also carries around a notepad. The notepad is used by Kathy to note down anything which comes up when speaking to a character that needs some more information, i.e. something you\u2019ll need to talk to another character about. As you uncover more information about certain things Kathy will automatically update her notes so she can ask the other characters for more relevant information. The notepad is also home to telephone numbers which you find in the phone book at your grandma\u2019s house.\n\nSo, more about interacting with other characters. For the most part you don\u2019t have any dialogue choices when interacting with other characters (apart from choosing when to ask them what from your notepad, though that doesn\u2019t really have an effect) and when you are given the opportunity to choose what you want to say it doesn\u2019t really make a difference to the overall outcome. Personally, I don\u2019t think this is a problem, KR has a semi-linear story (I say semi because you have some control over what order you do things in) and the story is good enough so that it manages to be entertaining even with little player influence over the story. \n\nWhat\u2019s super important when it comes to story-driven games? The voice acting! The voice acting in Kathy Rain is excellent. There were a few times in the game where I thought there was too much of a gap between one character\u2019s line and then the next character\u2019s line but that\u2019s not a huge problem. The actors themselves did a fantastic job at bringing the game\u2019s characters to life, they\u2019re very compelling performances and they make the story feel real. \n\nCircling back to the whole semi-linear story thing, you can decide what locations to visit and when (you have to have unlocked the location before you can visit it mind you but you unlock new locations as you progress through the story). When Kathy leaves a location she hops on her customised Corley motorcycle and you\u2019re then presented with a screen where you can choose from any of the locations you\u2019ve unlocked. As you near the end of the game some locations will become greyed out (you can\u2019t return to them) but this only happens for minor locations where you\u2019ve already exhausted the location\u2019s relevance to the plot. For the rest of the game you\u2019re able to choose where to go when and since there is some wiggle room when it comes to what order you can do things in this does give you a tad bit of freedom.\n\n[h1]Verdict [/h1]\n\nKathy Rain is an excellent point & click game with an intriguing story, compelling characters, fantastic voice acting and a great visual style. If you\u2019re a fan of story-driven games then this is definitely worth checking out.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/lonerangerreviews#curation]Lone Ranger Reviews.[/url][/i]\n\nEl K.", "timestamp_created": 1462467647, "timestamp_updated": 1462467647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769675", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39466516": {"recommendationid": "39466516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036239997", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 388, "last_played": 1516392353}, "language": "german", "review": "nettes kleine old school adventure!\n\nhabs f\u00fcr 5\u20ac gekauft\n\n15 ist ev etwas zu viel.\naber einen 10er kann man mmn schon daf\u00fcr hergeben,\nwenn man auf diese art von spielen steht", "timestamp_created": 1516393091, "timestamp_updated": 1516393091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39451145": {"recommendationid": "39451145", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990705355", "num_games_owned": 987, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 302, "last_played": 1516337115}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\n[spoiler] \u6211\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u5199\u5b9e\u4e3b\u4e49\uff0c \u6ca1\u60f3\u5230\u540e\u9762\u5c45\u7136\u8fd9\u4e48\u7384\u5e7b\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662f\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u5267\u60c5[/spoiler]\n\u8c1c\u9898\u7684\u8bdd\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u90fd\u662f\u8ddf\u7740\u5267\u60c5\u8d70\u5c31OK\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e00\u822c\u5c31\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u4f46\u4e5f\u5076\u5c14\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u65b9.....\u5fc3\u7d2f\n\u6545\u4e8b\u8bb2\u7684\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u603b\u89c9\u5f97\u4eba\u7269\u4e0d\u591f\u4e30\u6ee1\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u7ed3\u5c3e\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u4ed3\u4fc3\u3002\n\n\u82f1\u8bed\u4e0d\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6bcf\u53e5\u8bdd\u90fd\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519\u3002\n\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\u3002\n", "timestamp_created": 1516335338, "timestamp_updated": 1516335338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39423863": {"recommendationid": "39423863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011571912", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 585, "last_played": 1516227044}, "language": "greek", "review": "Story is nice, short and predictable too. \nYou will need around 1 evening to finish this.\nThe puzzles are rather simple and rational, no diffculties at all.\nI liked a lot the acting voice of the protagonist.

The eponymous Kathy Rain is a punk sophomore in college for journalism when her plucky, polar-opposite roommate Eileen lets her know that her estranged grandfather had just died. When Kathy goes to the funeral and reconnects with part of her family she hadn\u2019t seen since she was a young child, she begins to follow the story of what, exactly, happened to not just her grandfather, but to a number of missing and insane people of the town.\n\nI don\u2019t want to spoil more of the story, because the way it\u2019s unraveled is really fun. The pixel art is gorgeous from the incredible backgrounds to the satisfying and fluid animated sprites. The writing is cool, and Kathy is able to be both at once annoying and likable, like a lot of college students can be. The voice acting in particular was great - it was produced by Dave Gilbert, of Wadjet Eye fame, and ol\u2019 Davie even made an appearance as a minor character.\n\nPoint-n-clicks are often criticized for really obtuse puzzles, and Kathy Rain avoids this in a wonderful way. The game is set in 1995, and the best, most satisfying, crunchiest bits of gameplay is just\u2026 acting like it\u2019s 1995 again. Using a phonebook, tapping in phone numbers, and dealing with an old timey-ass computer was just so fun for me, for some god damn reason.

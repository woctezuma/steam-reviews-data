I only experienced Climbey for the first time today and was left desperately wishing the controls were the same as Sprint Vector. SV just works a whole lot better on first impressions. The most dangerous part of the intuitive gameplay is that it makes you want to run forward, don't by the way lol. Jumping is still something I struggle with but it isn't needed for the basic courses I played, probably is for the more complex courses though but by then I'll have a handle on it. The tutorials are comprehensive, fun and easy to follow, so if there's a mechanic you struggle with the game is more than happy to help you. My personal favourite mechanic is the climbing and flinging mechanic and I sorta wish there were specific climb centric courses. I've only played three courses in single player though, so for all I know there are lol. The running, climbing and flying mechanics are extremely easy to use but drifting is certainly something that takes practice. But no matter what mechanic you need to use it doesn't feel like you're dragging the game, as challenging as it is to learn some of the mechanics (for me at least) and as challenging as the game is physically (for me at least) it doesn't feel like there's nothing I can do to improve which is a much welcome change from some of the glitchy VR games out there. The only downfall is turning, aside from drifting you actually have to turn your whole body to turn. I haven't figured out if you can go backwards yet either. So if you get stuck and need to go a direction other than forward or slightly to either side it can be a bit disorienting. This is, however, a very minor grievance that doesn't necessarily apply to those with better balance than me and honesly I don't know how I'd improve it.\n8/10 (one of the best games for gameplay I've played on VR)\n\nGRAPHICS\nGraphically speaking Sprint Vector wins out yet again. Most VR games leave me feeling like I need something more, not because the graphics aren't impressive or because they don't immerse me in the space necessarily but because they don't feel like a 'game'. Sprint Vector's graphics have personality, the space comes alive while you're inside. Everything from the menu to the lobby to the transition screen make you really feel like you're in a virtual world and not a demo. Sprint Vector is the first game I've played on VR, including Rickality, that doesn't feel like a demo or a mobile game brought to VR. A lot of that has to do with the graphics, the voice acting, the design. It's all perfect and I wouldn't change a thing. It's everything I hoped for from a VR game.\n10/10 (I'd give higher if I could)\n\nFITNESS\nOh yeah, you'll sweat. It's extremely arm intensive though, your legs get barely any work at all so Spring Vector isn't exactly gonna replace leg day lol. Sorry guys. That being said it certainly makes my shoulders burn and my heart rate rise and because of the competitive nature of the AI (only played solo) it really pushes you to go harder and faster. The races feel a little long when you can feel the burn in your arms but when you hit that finish line, man is it worth it. Just makes you wanna go again to get an even better score. It doesn't feel like work and the commentary indicates how far through the course you are so you can push that little bit harder.\n9/10 (For arms anyway, and for me... I'm pretty unfit so you'll have to see for yourself, but the work is definitely scalable.)\n2/10 (For legs, just cause you have to turn and stand the whole time lol)\n9/10 (For cardio, oh man...)\n\nSTORY\nWell other than an immersive premise and world with engaging characters and stellar voice acting the game doesn't appear to have much in the way of story. This makes sense because the premise of the game is that it's an intergalactic game show with the player being a competitor. You get an idea of the kind of world and gameshow you're dealing with through the commentary and perhaps there's more story as you progress through the courses, made obvious by the commentary or something like that, but where I stand in the game having completed three courses the story is certainly lacking. This is shame because I absolutely flipping love this game and really want a story campaign. I would absolutely lap up any story the creators felt like adding in. I'm extremely interested in Mr. E and the world and the gameshow and everything and would appreciate a soft story like most fighting games. However, the bare minimum story that the game has is one that makes you want to know more, that makes it feel like the world is real, alive, breathing. The fact that the existing premise is so enticing is probably why it's so painful that the game doesn't really have a story.\n7/10 (What's there is 10/10 but what's there makes me want so much more)\n\nUI\nLike all other points of design the UI is practically perfect. I've found with a lot of VR games the menus feel like they haven't been integrated well into the medium, Sprint Vector doesn't have this problem. It's believable to have this menu popped up in front of you and it's extremely easy to use. The hand that pops onto the menu to click things feels like an extension of your real self, which is good because that's what VR is all about. That being said, I've only played Single Player and haven't been able to find settings for the AI. I've been coping with it but I would like the ability to scale difficulty, as I am now the game is a little too challenging and as I get fitter I can imagine it becoming easy without scalable difficulty. That being said the store page does describe AI customisation in solo play so perhaps I'm playing the wrong mode. If, however, the settings exist in Single Player, I've been unable to find them. The settings and menus are extremely easy to understand and, for the most part, intuitive but where are the \"customisable solo game settings\"?\n8/10 (best interface design of any VR game I've played)\n\nPOINTS OF IMPROVEMENT\nThe game seems diverse and the world extremely interesting so... I'm disappointed there's no story campaign! I really wish they could add one, I really do. The store page mentions AI settings being customisable but I've been unable to find the setting in the single player mode, maybe it isn't in that mode but if it is the intuitiveness of the settings needs improving lol. If it isn't then, well, I guess it's fine and I'm just playing the wrong mode. The only gameplay point that urks me is needing to turn, you can't turn without turning your body which can be... annoying and disorienting sometimes. All these points are extremely minor concerns (except the story, I really do want a story mode) and don't bring my ultimate score down too much but this is a review and so it needs to be picky.\n\nOVERALL\nSprint Vector is by far the best VR game I've played. Hands down. All the \"flaws\" I've observed may just be me as well, might not even be the game, I'm not exactly a professional reviewer. All that being said I haven't played very much of the game, I can't comment on replayability or scale of difficulty or challenge modes or multiplayer or advanced courses because I haven't played them. This is almost a first impressions review, so take it such. /That/ being said though, I can't imagine my impression of the game changing, it's just so fun and engaging.\n8/10 Highly recommend, rabidly recommend lol.", "timestamp_created": 1521500907, "timestamp_updated": 1521500907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40882965": {"recommendationid": "40882965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120725738", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 98, "last_played": 1521605397}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Ka-chow!\" - Tow Mater", "timestamp_created": 1521320927, "timestamp_updated": 1521320927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40849840": {"recommendationid": "40849840", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961053737", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518371822}, "language": "english", "review": "Really cool and dynamic locomotion in this game.

You do this by skating at super high speeds, jumping and flying over obstacles, and climbing up massive walls. Each level also has a lot of variety in its pathways and various obstacles. You can follow each level's main course, grabbing powerups and stopping anybody in your way, or, you could find the level's secret pathways and easily get ahead of everyone else. There are also a handful of challenge levels and time trials that you can do, if you ever get bored of racing. And of course, if you feel the AI is too easy, you can play online and face other people in a race, which I find to be way more challenging than the AI.

It's incredibly frustrating in a racing game to constantly have all your speed wiped out, and that was happening to me constantly. But I'd only done the basic tutorial, and figured that was enough. I was wrong. It turns out some very essential things are in the subsequent tutorials, and they should not (in my opinion) be optional.\n\nNow that I know what I'm doing it is much more fun, and as a bonus it's a great workout. \n\nPros:\n- Designed for VR\n- Exhilarating play\n- No motion sickness despite all the movement, at least for me.\n- Bots are a reasonable substitute to fill when when there aren't enough human opponents\n\nCons:\n- Even after doing all the tutorials and building some knowledge of the levels, I still feel like the game relies too much on the design style of \"punish mistakes\" rather than \"reward skill\". I'd love to see a shift in level design away from things that completely elminate your hard-won velocity, and instead add more things that reward you when you pull off a great jump, turn, or glide.\n- Like any multiplayer game, the community is what makes it shine, but there's something about esports that brings out the worst in some people. It's only a small step from good-natured trash talk to being a total asshole, and sadly I've already run into a number of players who fall on the asshole side of things. There's absolutely no need for it, especially in a game with a small community. Luckily the game makes it easy(ish) to mute and \"hide\" people, but I wish I didn't have to.", "timestamp_created": 1519673625, "timestamp_updated": 1519673625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40411593": {"recommendationid": "40411593", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972527948", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1521028363}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very polished racing game, that I can absolutely recommend.\nHOWEVER, VR owners with cables beware!

I will immediately admit that there are probably a lot of people who will love this game, and that's great, but this game just isn't for me unfortunately.\n\nThere are two significant problems for me: \n1. The controls.  One of the reasons I love VR where I didn't love regular video games is that in VR I don't have to memorize a whole bunch of button presses.  Controls are intuitive in VR.  In Sprint Vector, the running motion (pumping your arms) should be enough, but they've added the requirement of pressing the trigger too.  You have to press the trigger to run and press the touchpad while pumping your arms to jump and grab the trigger and touchpad to drift.  And braking requires hitting both side buttons, which is weird and uncomfortable (I've always hated those side buttons).  All the buttons are annoying to remember and I can't count the number of accidental screenshots I've taken.  \n\nThose things make the game less fun, but I think I could have gotten used to it if it wasn't for the second issue:\n\n2. Motion sickness.  I've got hundreds of hours in VR at this point, and no game has ever really made me sick the way Sprint Vector has.  I put on the comfort options in the game, but I still can't run more than one (maybe two) challenges before I have to leave the game.  And for the rest of the day I feel dizzy and disoriented.  I have tried over the last few days to let myself get acclimated to the motions, but the discomfort just isn't worth it.  Others clearly don't have this issue, so this might simply be a case of this game simply not being for me, but if you are sensitive to motion sickness, be wary of this game.\n\nI wish I could recommend this game.  Unfortunately, even with more intuitive game controls, I just don't think I'd be able to play it due to the motion sickness issues.  \n\nI will say though that this game is polished, and when I was able to play, a lot of fun.

I'll be updating after I've spent a bit of time with the proper release.\n\n#Overall: I had a ton of fun in the closed beta and I will absolutely be buying (have bought) this game. It's a blast despite minor hiccups that seem fixable. DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT -JUST GRAB IT. It's really the only game I can think of that's mastered this sort of motion, feeling of speed, strong tactics and exhilaration. It's the best experience I've had other than Superhot VR.\n\n#Controls: The controls are fairly intuitive. The tutorials are HUGELY helpful at getting you to be comfortable with the controls and motions before even jumping in to a race. I WISH MORE VR GAMES DID THIS. Otherwise, each movement feels easy to grasp but tough to master. My only complaint would be climbing - it just feels awkward and I always lose ALOT of momentum at the top of a climbe as there is basically no way to propel yourself forward off the top off a climb. You just pop up and then start skating forward. Seems like a place for improvement.\n\n#Graphics: Feel just right. Definitely an arcade SSX-vibe, which I think fits this type of game perfectly. Great variation of character design. Very well executed. Ran smoothly on my i5 with 1060.\n\n#Sound: Basically same as graphics - super well done with lots of jokey, well-narrated and executed VO.

To get moving you have to swing your arms up and down - the faster you do so the faster you will get moving (\"Freedom Locomotion VR\" is a free Steam VR app that showed off this kind of armswing locomotion before). But that's only the basic movement, you can drive around curves by physically turning or by drifting (which you can do by pressing some buttons on the controller). The game also includes climbing (with comparable mechanics of the game \"Climbey\") and flying. There are powerups you can pick up during the game including different types of mines, boosters and rockets.\n\n12 racing tracks as well as 9 challenge maps are included at the moment. Also there are four well made tutorials with video instructions so that everyone should understand it even if you haven't played any VR before. It will be easily possible to complete all the tracks after that but to get through them nice and smoothly and to know all the shortcuts it might take some more time (which motivates to keep playing). \nYou can play in singleplayer with bots, challenge maps or in online multiplayer with up to 8 players.\n\nSo content-wise I don't want to complain but for long time motivation it would be great to have some more tracks in the future or even custom map support (that would be the best option if you'd ask me).\n\nTo sum it up, Sprint Vector really suprised me because of the innovative but  intuitive controls. \nIt's a high quality VR game and feels very polished, I've yet to encounter any annoying bugs.\nGet ready for sweating a lot and for your arms to get ripped! \nIf you own a VR system you really do not wanna miss this game, it's one of the best you can get right now.", "timestamp_created": 1518954836, "timestamp_updated": 1519481335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710220", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40182216": {"recommendationid": "40182216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072887450", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1520756779}, "language": "english", "review": "So i really wanted to enjoy this game but i dont know its nothing like the trailers for me. it may have something to do with my headset or something i havent done any help would be gladly recieved but when i play i find it very uncomfortable. i watched the intro and wanted to puke the fact that the world i was in was wrapped around my eyeballs every time i shifted my head everything would warp to the way  i moved. i dont feel like im in a 3d space. even the calibration menu when you move your head up and down it stretches. it looks like a super fun game but since i have this issue its become a dissapointment. maybe when the game picks up more followers there will be some fixes but ive had no luck.. help is needed....

For example it's hard to really be accurate when trying to guns a rifle or two handed sword when it isn't there, and trying to move around in most games feels a bit funny. However Sprint vector brings such engaging mechanics that works really well with VR style controls. YOU ARE IN CONTROL. Bringing you self up to  speed with wild arm swings feels fantastic. When you hit a ramp and send yourself flying you have so much control of where you are going and when you are dropping which allows you get where you want to be. power sliding around corners makes you feel like you actually know how to drift. To top it all off, the sounds of these movements really amplify with how satisfying each move is.

This has, within two days mind you, managed to become one of my all-time favorite games. It is easily the most immersive VR game that I have played as well as the most fun. I have met countless people who I already love hanging out with and it's so much fun to simply go online in a quick match, start racing with people and joking with them throughout the race and then laughing about all the great moments at the end of the race. \n\n\n\n   The game looks and feels amazing. I love the aesthetic and it just oozes charm once you're inside headset. It feels great to have the colors blur past you as you're sprinting towards the finish line. There is no feeling in the world as good as racing head-to-head at the finish line, trying any way that you can to just pass your opponent, tilting your head down and just giving it your all. Or, better yet, when you get a power-up midway through a race and realize the perfect spot to place a trap, listening to everybody behind you laugh and shout at your clever antics. \n\n\n   Another obvious point that has to get brought up is how much of a workout this game actually is. I am a person who almost never sweats, no matter the activity. Once I boot this game up though, within a couple of races, I'm drenched and chugging back water bottles out the wazoo. Your muscles will almost guaranteed be sore, even if you are in good shape. When I woke up the next day after playing 4 hours the first day, I could barely move my arms. The worst part is how much I was loving it. This is single-handedly, the most entertaining way to work out. Even though I was in pain from playing the game, I couldn't resist the urge to just boot it up that same day I felt sore and crank out another couple of hours. After my last play session, I couldn't help but come write this jumbled up review for the game and somehow try to express just how much I love this game. \n\n\n\n    Even though this may all be a jumbled, confusing mess, the main point I want to get across is just how good this game is.

The quality of the game is superb and the visuals are incredible. Just the loading screen alone I don't want to skip because I love the transitions in the game. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good arm workout and quick sweat session (HAVE A FAN GOING). \n\nCONTROLS: [8/10] The controls do take a bit to get used to. I only have an hour in the game so far and the controls are a little tough to get used to sometimes because if you are used to other climbing games and such, their controls are a  little different. There NEEDS to be an option to switch the movement direction from Headset to Controllers because I'd like to look behind me while running to check how far the other players are behind me. The powerups are a little hard to use because you need to guess where your shot is going to land because even with the small beams that come from your hand, its still hard to adjust for enemy speed and remember what kind of powerup you have.\n\nCONTENT: [8/10] There is enough content for hours of playtime, such as challenges, singleplayer courses and online options, as well as competing with friends and other players in the world to see who gets the fastest speed or quickest time. I'm almost positive they will be rolling out more content but as for now, it's pretty basic; as to be expected from a newely released game.\n\nFEEL: [10/10] My god the fluidity of motion, the thrill of getting full speed and keeping it makes me want to keep playing. The Grip Fields are something I personally have never experienced in a game before and they amaze me everytime, and I usually restart my race if I miss them because of how helpful they are. \n\nVISUALS: [10/10] The look of the game is unlike anything I've ever seen yet in a VR title. It has this 70's retro/futuristic vibe to it that works incredibly well with this type of game, and the characters (though they are a lil funny looking) all have different personalities and outfits that suit their persona. The glow coming off of your body and the environment are just incredible, and no levels are exactly the same, so it doesn't feel repetitive each time you race. There are different heights, shortcuts and obstacles that keep each map from feeling the same.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1518674752, "timestamp_updated": 1518674752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40093548": {"recommendationid": "40093548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068496887", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518915402}, "language": "english", "review": "you sweat in this game, do you need anything else from this?", "timestamp_created": 1518674584, "timestamp_updated": 1518674584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40093532": {"recommendationid": "40093532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013088070", "num_games_owned": 715, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518664253}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.....A game that takes an incredible amount of skill and requires you to be physically fit, while being beautiful and absolutely fun.

That leads you into a pretty amazing intro sequence where you get to meet Mr. Entertainment face to face. This was an amazing touch that blew me away.\n\nVisually the game looks great. If you stop and take a good long look at things, you might notice that they're a bit low poly but if you're taking the time to stop and stare at the roses, you're losing... The games art style fits the fast pace of the game perfectly.\n\nThe audio is also well done. From just the standard BGM to the voice acting and flavor commentary throughout the race, it's all very well done. The flavor commentary can get stale after a few hours of hearing the same line about Mud Bars but there's only so much dialog they can't reasonably record. That being said, they might pipe up a bit too frequently for the number of lines there are.\n\nThe controls are fairly easy to pick up but very difficult to master for some. There's a lot of fine movements or combinations of movements that will give a skilled player a distinct advantage over someone just flailing their arms. However, the arm flailing will mostly work and get you from point A to B. This is something that you'll want to run through the tutorials for just so you can get some practice. You'll also likely want to practice in the lobby which is a very large skate park that you can explore whlie queuing up for a game.\n\nAll in all, this game is a hell of a lot of fun and definitely worth the $29.99  (as of this write up, $23.99 after 20% off sale.)\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

Yes your arms will be moving a lot. Yes you may have to build up some endurance for it. I've already gotten my VR legs in \"Intense\" car racing and flight games so I no longer have a good reference point, but this seems like a \"moderate\" title to me.\n\nI love the scale in this game. You are frequently in wide open spaces that look great. \n\nYou are skating, but you also jump, climb, fly, drift, shoot and deploy various power ups. These power ups are of a number of types. There are boosts that affect your speed, there are mines that you drop behind you for players behind you and things you shoot at players ahead of you.\n\nBecause of this there is a lot of room to grow in this game and the multi-player competitions will become heated.  You need endurance, skill, coordination and a little strategy in terms of when and where to deploy various power-ups. It also helps to learn the tracks just like in a car racing game.\n\nI'm still getting the hang of it, but the depth of the game is already obvious and it is a lot of fun to play. \n", "timestamp_created": 1518487541, "timestamp_updated": 1518487541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40035759": {"recommendationid": "40035759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095570754", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518490396}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so much fun, sort of Spedrunners, but for VR and you'll get really into it.

I'm sure the developers will update and listen to the users since you can feel this game is developed with love and care.

Make SURE you play something medium impact \n(like audioshield) as a warmup for 5-10 mins, otherwise your muscle attachment sites in your arms, shoulders and maybe chest will get hammered. You will be moving your arms fast and contantly from the start of the first race. The only reason I haven't played more is because I jumped in raw and I've been waiting for my muscles to repair before I play another session.\n\nAnyway: This game game is great!\n\nThe controlls are responsive and well designed, so when you make mistakes it feels like it's your own fault.... and you WILL be making mistakes, because there is a learning curve for the controls. You will know what they are, but pulling off what you want to be a speedy arm swinging badass isn't exactly easy.\n\nThe courses are varied and will also take time to master... a lot of it! There are faster ways to take most sections of the courses if you execute properly, and plenty of shortcuts that you can take if you know what you are doing. It's the kind of game that you do better at when you gain actual skill rather than through leveling up.\n\nThe weapons will take time to be good with. When you first start, it's hard to notice what weapon you have, or even what it does - and there are a lot of them! Expect to just be firing stuff off not knowing what power-up you have until you learned your weapon icons through playing and practicing on the weapons practice area.\n\nSpeaking of which, there are great, well produced, tutorials that get you prepared well for starting playing. There's a weapons practice area that you sprint around in soaking up information and getting practice in using them.\n\nI didn't get any motion sickness at all, and I played long enough to know that I wont. Almost all the time your brain accepts your arm movements to explain the motion, but on rare cases some things can happen that are a little jarring - but it does feel like you would adapt to feel comfortable in those moments.\n\nAll in all, a great VR game that's simply on another league that most VR releases.

Personally, I've found that I take fast moving games right to the stomach (with expectations to games like To the TOP). I realize this might not be a complaint that is valid for most people (it seems like a lot of reviews have said nothing about the game\u2019s barf factor), but if you've found that most movement VR games make you want to hurl...this will too!! \n\nAnyway, VR needs more games like this!! It\u2019s a super original concept and the controls are intuitive. Give one hell of a work out. I just hope that there is a fix in the future of VR tech for those few of us that apparently have little baby stomachs. Five thumbs up!! Valiant effort!

I usually play BoxVR for about 20 minutes to get some light cardio in and raise my heart rate. This game beats my heart rate in BoxVR for like 80% of songs I box too in my library. It's definitely different and there are some things I hope they fix. However, the polish is amazing and the game mechanics for the most part work.\n\nIf you like Mario Kart and physically active games this game is both of them combined. \n\nPersonally, I'm not the biggest fan of kart racing games, but I love the physical intensity of this game as a workout. As well as racing makes you want to win over other players so you notice your tiredness less while playing. It's WAY more fun than a treadmill or other traditional cardio options.\n\nThe only cons that I really see right now is I get disconnected from lobbies occasionally and I'm not sure why. As well as the jumping mechanic is pretty weird since it seems to take awhile to finish the full motion. Many times I fall into pits since I don't release it correctly or don't make a long enough vertical motion making me fall. It's pretty hard to concisely hit the vertical motion for jumping with the touchpad when you're trying to skate as fast as possible. I wish maybe the jump would change to the same motion as skating, but with the touchpad instead of a perfectly vertical motion with the touchpad.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but it is definitely worth a purchase. The level of polish, level design, and population (since it's new, so it's pretty easy to find other racers) is pretty good. I also like that if there are like 3 out of 8 players it just fills in bots so it doesn't feel so empty.\n\nI would recommend purchasing it and trying it out and if you don't like it refund it, but I have a good feeling you will like it and keep it!\n\nTLDR: This is a physically intense game that oozes with polish and is worth purchasing.

Una muchedumbre espera en el estadio a tu presentaci\u00f3n a manos de Mr.Entertainment. Mientras vuela por el interior del gran estadio, va calentando a los espectadores hasta que finalmente os reun\u00eds en su plataforma. Un micro se abalanza sobre ti desde el cielo para que digas unas palabras. \u00a1Los asistentes enloquecen! Sin darte mucha cuenta, ya has elegido a tu personaje y tienes a los dem\u00e1s corredores a tu alrededor, la carrera va a comenzar. Solo queda que consigas esquivar todos los obst\u00e1culos del camino y los que te pongan tus contrincantes y, por supuesto, \u00a1Ganar!\n\nMEC\u00c1NICA Y CONTROLES\nSprint Vector es un juego de carreras en el que compites con ocho corredores portadores de unos patines futuristas que permiten ir a gran velocidad. Tu objetivo ser\u00e1 llegar a la meta el primero, ya sea corriendo m\u00e1s que nadie o no dejando que los dem\u00e1s lo hagan. Es un juego fren\u00e9tico, gr\u00e1ficamente estable, divertido y lo mas importante: No marea. \n\nSurvios ha creado una nueva tecnolog\u00eda para este t\u00edtulo a la que ha llamado \u201cFluid Locomotion\u201d. Seg\u00fan su descripci\u00f3n permite al usuario alcanzar velocidades muy altas sin ninguna molestia f\u00edsica, y sin duda lo consigue. Saltamos desniveles incre\u00edbles, escalamos paredes con gran facilidad, volamos como Superman, y todo esto con una sensaci\u00f3n de velocidad constante y cero n\u00e1useas. Hay que a\u00f1adir que, si no esquivamos y chocamos contra alg\u00fan obst\u00e1culo, s\u00ed que se puede crear alg\u00fan desequilibrio por el cambio brusco de velocidad que algunos jugadores pueden no tolerar bien.\n\nPara aprender a manejarlo, el juego nos presenta unos tutoriales que nos ense\u00f1ar\u00e1n a correr lo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido posible, a saltar, escalar, volar y a machacar a nuestros contrincantes. \n\nLos controles son f\u00e1ciles de aprender pero algo m\u00e1s complejos de aplicar, un mal salto nos puede sacar de la pista si no frenamos a tiempo, de forma que perderemos la ventaja que ten\u00edamos en la carrera. As\u00ed que en poco tiempo ya est\u00e1s agitando los brazos para intentar ser el primero. Es un juego f\u00edsicamente exigente; para desplazarse hay que mover los brazos como si corrieras, de arriba a abajo para impulsarte y saltar, y para escalar hay puntos donde tendremos que agarrarnos si queremos llegar a otros m\u00e1s altos. Tambi\u00e9n podemos driftear para coger mejor las curvas o volar para aprovechar las ca\u00eddas.\n\nHay varios modos de juego, desde el casual donde puedes correr m\u00e1s tranquilamente para aprender los entresijos de la pista y mejorar tu t\u00e9cnica; el modo desaf\u00edo donde tienes 9 recorridos donde poner a prueba tus habilidades contra el tiempo y luchar por subir en el ranking; y el modo competitivo, que es donde la cosa se pone m\u00e1s complicada. Correremos en una de las 12 pistas contra otros siete jugadores, ya sea contra la IA u Online, donde la velocidad es una obligaci\u00f3n y los fallos se pagan perdiendo posiciones.\n \nPara ayudarnos a ganar durante la carrera podemos encontrar distintos powerups al m\u00e1s puro estilo Mario Kart. Ya sean turbos, potenciadores o trampas. Misiles para ralentizar, minas de proximidad, sobrecargas, nitro... En definitiva todo un arsenal de opciones para tener ventaja sobre nuestros rivales y as\u00ed alzarse con la victoria.\n\nINMERSI\u00d3N Y GR\u00c1FICOS\nEl mundo de Sprint Vector es muy colorido y con una est\u00e9tica muy conseguida, que no desentona para nada en RV y, con la excusa de viajes interdimensionales, viajaremos por \u00e9pocas y mundos diferentes. Desde el antiguo Egipto o castillos nevados a f\u00e1bricas rebosantes de productos qu\u00edmicos. Visualmente no es algo impactante, pero tampoco decepciona. Hay que destacar del apartado gr\u00e1fico lo incre\u00edblemente estable que es el juego, incluso aumentando el escalado de pantalla no hemos tenido ni un solo tir\u00f3n ni problemas de seguimiento o desincronizaci\u00f3n con Vive.\n\nMientras corremos, veremos algunos detalles en el HUD que nos ayudar\u00e1n a saber como va la carrera: tenemos un veloc\u00edmetro que nos dir\u00e1 a qu\u00e9 velocidad vamos con una barra que aumenta y cambia de color para indicarnos la velocidad, la posici\u00f3n en la que vamos y un indicador de la acci\u00f3n que estamos ejecutando o si nos afecta alguna trampa o powerup.\n\nTambi\u00e9n hay se\u00f1ales visuales para avisarnos de que vamos lo suficientemente r\u00e1pido, como luces o rayos que aparecen para aumentar la sensaci\u00f3n de velocidad. Tambi\u00e9n nos indican los powerups que hemos adquirido y a qu\u00e9 distancia tenemos a los otros corredores. La mayor\u00eda del tiempo nos lo pasamos corriendo y fij\u00e1ndonos en los obst\u00e1culos que encontramos para esquivarlos, de manera que cumple con lo necesario evitando distraerte de la carrera.\n\nTenemos 8 personajes a elegir, cada uno con una est\u00e9tica totalmente diferente, desde una DJ gal\u00e1ctica a una rana ninja o un tibur\u00f3n martillo. Todos ellos bien diferenciados y con unos dise\u00f1os en general bastante buenos. Cada personaje tiene unas skins que podremos desbloquear a medida que vayamos ganando carreras. Skins por llamarlo de alguna manera, ya que solo son cambios de color en la indumentaria de cada uno que no afectan a la jugabilidad. Es solo por est\u00e9tica.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o de los mapas est\u00e1 muy conseguido, hay atajos escondidos por todo el recorrido, con distintas alturas, as\u00ed que la verticalidad es importante para encontrar atajos o power ups que permitan ganar ventaja. Hay que a\u00f1adir que algunas pistas se repiten y son las mismas solo que en el sentido contrario, aunque tenemos nuevos atajos y zonas s\u00f3lo accesibles de esta forma.\n\n \n\nConclusi\u00f3n\n\nLo m\u00e1s importante es que es un juego divertido con un gran atractivo visual y t\u00e9cnico. Si te gusta el Mario Kart, este t\u00edtulo te encantar\u00e1. Es lo mas parecido ahora mismo en RV y adem\u00e1s con un sistema de locomoci\u00f3n que funciona perfectamente (aunque no innova demasiado), y con una exigencia f\u00edsica elevada ya que has de estar movi\u00e9ndote constantemente.\n\nEn contra del titulo hay que decir que no va a tener localizaci\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol, ni la tendr\u00e1 por ahora. Apostar por el Online es un recurso habitual para la industria en estos momentos, pero en RV muchos t\u00edtulos centrados en el juego competitivo acaban muriendo por falta de jugadores. \n\nEsperemos que no sea el caso en Sprint Vector, y que en sus futuras actualizaciones a\u00f1ada el soporte de juego cruzado entre plataformas para paliar dicha situaci\u00f3n.\n\n\n\nPros\n+ Extremadamente divertido\n+ Muy estable gr\u00e1ficamente\n+ Fluid Locomotion\n\nContras\n- No localizaci\u00f3n\n- Centrado en la competitividad\n- Sin juego cruzado entre plataformas\n\nMas analisis en: www.realovirtual.com", "timestamp_created": 1518170486, "timestamp_updated": 1518170486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467347", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39947588": {"recommendationid": "39947588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147951437", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520490655}, "language": "english", "review": "Me so fastie, Me, Me so fastie!

By using many abilities like drifting, flying, climbing, and power ups it makes the races feel very engaging.  Its very \"Mario Kart\" esque where the power ups you pick up are conviently placed so you can use them against your oponents. \n\nThis game is one of the most polished VR games I've ever played. You really get a sense of immersion just by even standing still and looking at environments. The art style is very stylistic and it really stands out. The soundtrack is also amazing. The presentation of this game is top notch and I can't recommend this game more!\n\nMan is this one a workout! Arms are already sore after an hour.

Techniques like jumping & drifting are easily learned in the tutorials.\n* The feel of the motion, momentum, jumps, flings, drifts, flying, and everything FEELS good; satisfying. You feel like a superhero superstar!\n* Graphics and models are well designed. Good amount of detail, but not so much that things are ever a pixelated aliased mess at a distance.\n* Music is excellent for the game's style. I love this soundtrack -- you can buy it, it's 43 tracks ranging from 1.5 to 6 minutes long each.\n* Characters are fun and look good. Multiple skins for each, some to unlock.\n* Voice acting is entertaining & quirky, and not flat nor boring. Fun announcers!\n* Tutorials are explained both with audio speaking to you and showing you what to do on a video screen in front of you. Perfect for VR.\n* Single player mode with AI, challenge tracks, 8-human online multiplayer matching, and Steam-Friends-Only By-Invite modes. You & friends can even just hangout and chat & play in the Skate Park and not do races at all. Love the freedom.\n\nNEUTRAL\n* While the controls are easy to learn, mastering them requires a learning curve. The harder tracks will throw a lot of combinations of techniques at you back-to-back-to-back!\n* Like all interesting racing games, you need to play through the tracks many times to get used to the layouts and learn the tricks. That's part of the fun of leveling your brain up.\n\nCONS\n* As I said: There aren't enough painkillers to compensate for how your arms & shoulders are going to feel in the morning after your first long play session!\n* Watching your performance plummet after a handful of back-to-back competitive races as real life muscle fatigue takes over. ;-)\n* Wanting to keep playing and physically having to stop. =(\n* Increased water bill because you'll be taking long, ice cold showers after every 1-hour Sweat Vector session to cool down.

I'll waste no time and get to some scores, ranked from 1 to 5. I am in no way affiliated with the devs and this is totally unbiased. I'm reviewing as an HTC Vive player. I did a gameplay video if anyone cares to check it out, link at the bottom.\n\n\n[b] Graphics: 5/5 [/b] - The visuals, effects and animations are amazing. Such, such a polished game on the visual front. The maps are incredible. Handcrafted, no repetitive cut-and-paste portions with LOTS of detail. The characters are unique with a lot of creativity behind their looks and personalities. \n\n\n[b] Tutorial: 5/5 [/b] - The game might seem simple at first glance, but their is actually quite a bit to learn. Thankfully, the tutorial does an amazing job at covering everything you need to know, with NO READING. All audio with a video guide to show you the controls. That's the way tutorials should be in VR. Not walls of text.\n\n\n[b] Gameplay: 5/5 [/b] - This game is easily my favorite e-sport multiplayer game. Super fun, competitive gameplay. Single player and multiplayer options. The races are wacky, and even have some Mario Kart-like elements to them where you can shoot/stun opponents. The main abilities are: Sprinting, Braking, Jumping, Flying, Climbing, and Shooting. Besides standard races, there are also challenges you can do solo. A game like this will offer a lot of replayability as well.  \n\n\n[b] Controls: 4/5 [/b] - The controls are great, but definitely require practice. I docked 1 point because turning sharp corners can be tough and trying not to \"sprint\" and move slowly to avoid being knocked off ledges/obstacles can get a little frustrating, but I think I just need more practice. Some of the more advanced maps will definitely require mastering the games controls.\n\n\n[b] A.I.: 4/5 [/b] - The A.I. is quite good but doesn't matter a whole lot because I think most people will want to play online against other people. That's where the game will shine.\n\n\n[b] Sound: 5/5 [/b] - Great music, sound effects and the goofy characters are voice-acted well. No complaints.\n\n\n[b] Difficulty: 3/5 [/b] - This is one of those games that's easy to learn, but difficult to master. That's not to discourage anyone though. I'm not very good but still think it's a blast. I can usually get 1st or 2nd place on the \"basic\" difficulty maps, proof in the video below :P \n\n\nIn summary, I am very impressed with Sprint Vector. I knew little about the game going into it and that's when I sometimes enjoy a new game the most. It's fun for rookies and pros, competitive or casual play and I can't recommend it enough.

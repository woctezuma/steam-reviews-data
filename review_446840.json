It's such a simple game to understand and play, but the real challenge is in how you chain those various fluids to reach the finish line.\nEvery level brings up some sort of new gimmick or obstacle to overcome and goes wild with it. For example, there is a level where blue lasers kill you if you stay on them for more than a few seconds, and another level where there is a constant wind current dragging you forward. \nBut the basic gameplay always remains the same: you can jump and shoot the fluids. The level throws every possible situation at you using it's main gimmick, but you will be doing the same you have always done before.\nAnd its not like you get all the 3 fluids in one go. The game very smartly introduces one fluid at a time and gives you enough levels to get accustomed to it before giving you a new one.\n\nIf I had to place it's difficulty somewhere, I would say it is probably harder than the Rayman games, but easier than Super Meat Boy and Dustforce.\nI personally found it a breeze to get through, finishing the game with 100% workers saved in 5 hours only. But i have been playing games like this since I was a kid, so this all becomes subjective.\nAll I can say is that the game has the perfect pacing and ramps up the difficulty very well, the first level being a simple game about jumping over some platforms and the final level being a thrilling escape scene where you are scrambling the controller to use the right fluid at the right time.\n\nIf there is a negative point I can throw at the game, it's definitely the art direction and aestethic.\nI have nothing against the drawing style used in this game, but it has a severe lack of background diversity and lack of personality and humour.\nEvery single level has the same setting and background art utilized (and if it does change, its really not noticeable), and the premise of the factory is never really used to it's fullest potential. The factory is turning it's workers into potatoes, but they never do much with that joke, outside of some bland and uninteresting enemies to deal with.\nI'm fully aware that story and visuals are not the main appeal of this kind of game, but it goes a long way in making more people interested in the genre and giving your game some sort of personality. I think everyone would agree with me that Rayman Legends without it's art direction, Super Meat Boy without it's charm and humour, and Dustforce without it's background variety and unique soundtrack, would make them lesser games.   \n \nBut I understand that for a first endeavour, they decided to focus on the stuff that really matters: the gameplay. And in my opinion they created one of the most underrated games of 2017.

Pour cela vous poss\u00e9dez un pistolet pouvant tirer : - de l'eau ce qui inflige des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts \u00e0 certains ennemis et enlever la peinture, \n- de la peinture collante (rose) pour s'aggriper aux murs ou au plafond. Si vous tirez sur un ennemi il ne pourra plus bouger et si vous tirez au sol, elle vous ralentira,\n- de la peinture \u00e9lastique (jaune) avec laquelle vous pouvez faire de grands sauts.\n\nPourquoi je le recommande? Tout simplement pour son gameplay qui est frais, tr\u00e8s frais. Ce jeu n'est pas un plateformer classique o\u00f9 on nous propose de fracasser tout ce qui bouge mais du mouvement et de la technique. Il y a de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de gameplay que je n'ai pas dit mais leur r\u00e9alisation par rapport aux m\u00e9caniques font que le level-design est tr\u00e8s propre et que rien est inutile.

Un bouton, un fluide, une couleur, un effet. \nLe jeu est mignon, la progression bien dos\u00e9e avec une difficult\u00e9 suffisante pour ne pas d\u00e9courager le premier joueur venu. Le jeu est lisible, agr\u00e9able \u00e0 l'\u0153il et le gameplay r\u00e9pond parfaitement. \nEn ligne droite sans chercher \u00e0 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les personnages diss\u00e9min\u00e9s dans les niveaux, je dirais qu'il faut 6 heures pour le finir. Et une \u00e0 deux heures de plus dans le cas contraire. De plus, le jeu \u00e9tant clairement pens\u00e9 pour permettre le speedrun, la dur\u00e9e de vie peut devenir monstrueuse. Sachant que les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont pr\u00e9vu deux types de speedrun et un mode attrapez les tous. De quoi assouvir sa soif de Splasher.\n\nAlors, quels sont les d\u00e9fauts de ce plateformer qui a l'air fort r\u00e9ussi ?\n\nTout d'abord, la maniabilit\u00e9 bien que r\u00e9ussie est assez perturbante puisque la direction du tir est sur le stick gauche, ce qui peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s perturbant voire rageant dans certaines situations qui demandent de la pr\u00e9cision.\nEnsuite, le jeu manque clairement de folie dans ses niveaux. C'est monotone (justifi\u00e9 par le fait que l'on soit dans une usine), m\u00eame s'il y a quelques id\u00e9es (le train beaucoup trop court). Personnellement, \u00e7a manque un peu de passages qui poussent le d\u00e9lire du jeu. Parce que combattre un docteur Maboul qui se sert des patates comme chair \u00e0 canon, \u00e7a m\u00e9rite le d\u00e9tour.\nEnfin, il y a un c\u00f4t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s m\u00e9canique qui se met en place quand on parcourt les niveaux. C'est peut \u00eatre moi, mais j'ai l'impression que le jeu ne cherche jamais vraiment \u00e0 sortir de sa zone de confort et encore moins de chercher \u00e0 surprendre le joueur.\n\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, c'est un jeu de plateformes efficace qui a un gameplay ma\u00eetris\u00e9 malgr\u00e9 des passages qui en montrent les limites (peu nombreux). C'est mignon, parfaitement calibr\u00e9 pour le speedrun. Dommage qu'il soit trop convenu, ce qui l'emp\u00eache d'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 un niveau sup\u00e9rieur. \nUn bon jeu, un bon moment sans \u00eatre m\u00e9morable.\n \nP.S. : Le hub qui oblige \u00e0 utiliser les fluides pour atteindre les niveaux suivants est une tr\u00e8s bonne id\u00e9e sans \u00eatre lourdingue.", "timestamp_created": 1509210771, "timestamp_updated": 1509210771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36015856": {"recommendationid": "36015856", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967262187", "num_games_owned": 585, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 188, "last_played": 1514822672}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my top 3  GOTY for the year 2017. \n\nThis is a awsome platformer.

It's definitely worth the $12 if you're into platforming.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a fluid 2D platformer like Super Meat Boy, Ori an the Blind Forest, and etc (although Splasher isn't nearly as hard as some of those).  The motion feels natural, the level design is good, and everything flows very well.  You can see the basics in the video; I won't go into that stuff.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is that they made poor choices with the controls (on a controller) in my opinion.  First, \"move\" and \"aim\" are both done with the left control stick.  I don't know if there's a better solution, but it's uncomfortable.  Sometimes you want to be able to aim at the ground while you run forward or drift to the left while shooting to the right.  Most annoyingly, sometimes you want to stand still while you aim your shot.  I found it a bit frustrating.  (However, this mechanic does add a lot of interesting optimizations into a speedrun.)\n\nSecond, there are three projectiles you can shoot and you can only shoot one of them at a time so those three things are mapped to X, Y, and B.  That much makes sense (conveniently, the colors of those buttons match the color of the corresponding projectile).  The problem is that jump is mapped to A (like basically every platformer ever) so that your right thumb is responsible for both jumping and shooting which makes it hard to do both at the same time.  Toward the end of the game you often find yourself switching quickly between the three projectiles and jumping often which further compounds the difficulty.  For me, this is actually a big problem.\n\nIncidentally, I own the steam controller and I hardly ever use it but it does a great job of mitigating these things.  I remapped the projectiles to the two triggers and right bumper so that my right thumb only jumps and it works great.  Also, it takes some adjustment but the fake d-pad/trackpad on the left thumb of the steam controller works pretty well in place of the left control stick.\n\nThe speedrunning modes are a lot of fun.  There are three of them and they're a really interesting way to lengthen a game that might have been short on content otherwise.  I've already spent a lot of time pushing my way through the selfish speedrun mode (my personal favorite) even though I'm terrible at it.  It should be mentioned, though, that the in-game speedrunning modes are casual and will likely never be made official.  For some inexplicable reason the timer stops when you pause the game which means that official categories will likely use real time (although I'm not an expert).\n\nOverall this is a really fun game.  It's a well-made platformer with an interesting gimmick.  Also, I only bought the game because I saw GrandPooBear playing it on twitch, which he commanded me to mention in my review.  :)", "timestamp_created": 1494961020, "timestamp_updated": 1494961020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31774415": {"recommendationid": "31774415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046365755", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495292101}, "language": "german", "review": "Very good game. \nI was sick of buying platformers for 10 \u20ac, developed by amateur-ish developers that turned out to be shit, but i was really glad i bought this.\nThe difficulty curve is fair, the mechanics are quite complex, but are introduced so slowly that you get enough time to get used to them.

For that optimal time in a time attack mode, you need to know what gel needs to go where. Red gel on the floor slows you down but on walls and celings lets you move at full speed, so always make sure you spray down with water when there's some floor sections to have to traverse.\nLater on the game straight up gives you the bouncy and sticky gels to spray the floors yourself which ramps the difficulty up as you start relying less on reading the stage ahead of you and more on reactions, memorising stages and doing it fast, clean and stylishly. \nThere's also 7 people to rescue in each stage treated as 'collectible' you have to grab to unlock more stages. \n\nThe ability to switch between just the standard gameplay of playing the levels, complete with multiple checkpoints and the time attack and Selfish Speedrunner modes gives EVERYONE a good experience. Not very good at doing things personally? Can't memorise stages well? No worries just play the regular levels - it's still worth teh price tag. But for those who want that extra challenge, you've got the modes to test you.\n\nThe soundtrack is great too, nothing MIND BLOWING but definitely found myself appreciating it and every jamming along at times (Notably: The first 'auto-scroller' stage, with green goop rising). Especially when you keep dying and starting from a checkpoint and the music kicks in like as if to say \"BACK TO IT SCRUB\".\nVisually, it's got cutesy, cartoon character and visuals a la Castle Crashers or any flash style/Behemoth game though I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad or negative thing. The style works well with the whole aethsetic and the goopy bright gels compliment this.\n\nI'm really looking forward to playing the rest of this wonderfully sculpted game and overall, this is the kind of game that has a LOT of life in it. To grabbing all the dudes in the stage, to getting the gold in time attack to completing the extra speed runnign mdoea and then even trying to get that top time on the leaderboards.\nSplasher is the first platformer in a long while I've truly just been impressed and entertained without any discrepencies. If I fucked up - it was on me. The game is solid and the Splashteam guys should be proud of what they've made.\n\nAlso Shout out to GrandPOOBear for introducing me to this game.", "timestamp_created": 1494501587, "timestamp_updated": 1494748317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657634", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31597914": {"recommendationid": "31597914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200220035", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494140962}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5fc3\u91cc\u53ea\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\uff1a1.\u6211\u660e\u660e\u6309\u4e86 2.\u6211\u660e\u660e\u6ca1\u6309", "timestamp_created": 1494141030, "timestamp_updated": 1494141114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696262", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31552883": {"recommendationid": "31552883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107932495", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493297054}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5173\u5361\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519 \u5f88\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7528\u624b\u67c4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u4f53\u9a8c\u66f4\u4f73\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u503c\u5f97\u73a9\u7684\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1493959804, "timestamp_updated": 1493959804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31472222": {"recommendationid": "31472222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156449338", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496338702}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu d\u00e9couvert au Stunfest qui a le m\u00e9rite de fournir un eprise en main rapide et accessible.\nLes SpeedRunners pourront de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9 s'\u00e9clater.\nAttention, si le d\u00e9but est facile, le jeu monte vite en niveau et la vitesse s'acc\u00e9l\u00e8reeee.... pour notre plus grand plaisir.\nCouleurs, univers ludique ainsi qu'une addiction vous suprendront et vous plairont dans ce jeu qui ne paie pas de mine au premier regard.\nTestez ;)", "timestamp_created": 1493584421, "timestamp_updated": 1493584421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31465993": {"recommendationid": "31465993", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960301514", "num_games_owned": 615, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493488636}, "language": "french", "review": "Splasher...

And even though the actual speedrun aspect of this game can be questioned as it locks its \u2018time attack\u2019 game mode behind items that only hardcore fans will be inclined to get, this game is still a gem in an oversaturated genre and is a must have to any platformer fans, definitely for its low price tag.\n\nYou play as a \u2018Splasher\u2019: a character that can do what any other character in a platformer does: run and jump. But this character has something a little different; an ink gun that can shoot water to hit switches and kill enemies, red ink that sticks him to walls and ceilings and yellow ink that makes him bounce high and reach otherwise impossible heights.\n\nThe core gameplay of Splasher has you traversing through the 22 levels of getting through dangerous environments, saving the innocent co workers at Inkorp and destroying robotic enemies. Through these levels you\u2019ll come across creative ways that the game spices up usual platforming such as lasers that kill you, rotating death traps, being chased by acid and a handful of well designed robots that will try and kill you in stylish ways. And all these tropes never feel overused so that nothing ever feels repetitive and you only feel that you have really done and seen everything only at the end when all the different level designs come together in one amazing final level. \n\nOther things that change up the platforming is the light on your feet puzzles to save the Inkorp workers, portals that will send you into an arena fighting robots and the time attack game mode that gets you to reach the end of the level in the fastest time. But to get this time attack game mode you have to rescue all the workers and get all the special golden ink that you can extract from walls and ceilings with your water gun for each level respectively. But I feel like it\u2019s unnecessarily locked behind these collectibles just to increase the lifespan of the game as any hardcore platformer player could get through these levels easy and having to get these workers and golden ink just feels more tedious than actually difficult.\n\nBut the gameplay is still really fun and enjoyable. And when you do hit all the right buttons and fly through the level, it feels more fluid and amazing than any other platformer I\u2019ve played in the recent years. This is mainly because of the always tight controls and solid level design.\n\nThe artstyle of Splasher is a hit and miss at times. Sure, it\u2019s a colourful game and it suits well to the tight on the edge-of-your-seat platforming but when you stop to look you\u2019ll realise that there is barely any detail and feels overly minimalistic. Although this is a small concern as you\u2019ll never stop moving in Splasher, and you won\u2019t want to as the level design is so great.\n\nThe music though, is incredible. The techno synth heavy music never gets old and always aided in the gameplay and helped me push forward through some tougher bits. The sound design is just as good with you being able to hear the differences in each surface your character walks on and the sound of liquids hitting objects or enemies dying. You can tell just how much detail has gone in the sound design in immersing you into the wild and fast-paced levels of Inkorp.\n\nThe only story you get is less of a cutscene and more of a string of pictures telling you how the boss at Inkorp has kidnapped their workers and are doing crazy scientific experiments on them. You as a \u2018Splasher\u2019 has found out, and armed with the trusty gun you have stolen you aim to reach to the top of inkorp and defeat the boss. And this is less of a story and more of an introduction of what you\u2019ll see at Inkorp because this game is very funny in its style and ambience and you\u2019ll find out quickly that this game doesn\u2019t take itself seriously in the way that you die and interact with the enemies.\n\nIn conclusion, you can sum up Splasher with one word: fun. Even though its speed run mode is locked behind tedium, it still doesn\u2019t take away from the core gameplay, spectacular level design, detailed music, sound and a light-hearted ambience.\n\nThat\u2019s why i\u2019m giving Splasher, a 4/5.", "timestamp_created": 1489471940, "timestamp_updated": 1489471940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30463527": {"recommendationid": "30463527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248499818", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489750768}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5c4c\u597d\u5927\u554a\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u3002\u3002\u624b\u67c4\u73a9\u513f\u624b\u90fd\u5e9f\u4e86\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1489298911, "timestamp_updated": 1489298911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30459482": {"recommendationid": "30459482", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996596964", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489277458}, "language": "english", "review": "Splasher manages to mix in the goo elements from Portal 2 and the flow of Super Meat Boy into a fun platformer. The different inks are introduced steadily throughout the game and each level manages to introduce a new mechanic/concept to keep the game experience feeling fresh. While it's a relatively short game, having around 22 levels, there are still quite a few extras for the game such as a time trial mode and a speedrun mode to complete the whole game in a given time frame.\n\nOne thing that I did find kind of annoying is getting the timing right on getting certain inks aimed at a particular direction. The way you aim your inks is through the same directional pad as your movement, which works well in game.

Aiding you are a handful of brightly-colored liquids:  Water to wash surfaces clean (and blast most enemies), sticky goo to help you climb surfaces like a spider, and bouncy goo to propel you through the air like a lunatic.  It's all very vibrant and charming.  In this sense, the comparisons to Super Meat Boy and Splatoon are unsurprising.  \n\nChallenge-wise, however, Splasher never really approaches the balls-hard difficulty of Super Meat Boy.  There are certainly situations where the average player may die 5 or 6 times attempting to navigate an area, but it doesn't remotely approach Super Meat Boy on the whole.  That may disappoint players who have been sold on the idea that Splasher will scratch the same itch that Super Meat Boy does; there's simply no comparison when it comes to difficulty.\n\nSimilarly, at 22 levels, Splasher's packaged with a much smaller selection of levels than Super Meat Boy's 300+.  That isn't to say that Splasher's an especially short game, or that it's lacking material--on the contrary, between the \"normal\" game and the various speedrun modes/medals to earn, there's a decent amount of replayability to the game.  But again, it may disappoint players who expect for Splasher to boast multiple worlds, hidden levels, and various other secrets.\n\nThat being said, will you enjoy Splasher?   If you like games such as Dust Force and Super Meat Boy for their mix of platforming, speed, and relative challenge, you'll most likely enjoy Splasher.  If you like leaderboards and discovering ways to shave seconds off of your PR times, you'll probably like Splasher.  But if you're looking for a game that's so hard it'll give you a nose bleed, you'll probably feel let down.  \n\n\nPROS:  \n+ A clean aesthetic that is generally very readable, which makes it perfect for speedrunning.\n+ Overall, the \"feel\" of the controls and the way the player handles is well done.\n+ Between the normal game, individual medal runs, and 3 different flavors of speedrun, there's plenty of replayability.\n\nCONS:\n- On a gamepad, the controls for movement and aiming are tied to the same analog stick, which can result in a lot of sloppy aiming and/or accidental movement; while this stems from compromises in the control scheme, it's still an incredibly frustrating problem that you will likely encounter at the worst (and most frantic) moments, such as rushing headlong into a trap while trying to aim at a critical target during a speedrun.  \n- A very minor con, but for a game that emphasizes speedrunning so much, it's annoying to have to sit through various animations and cutscenes every time you attempt a run.  These don't count towards your overall time, and should be confined to the \"normal\" game.\n- The level-select hub is a chaotic sprawl that doesn't improve the overall experience, and essentially makes choosing (or simply finding) specific levels more work than it should be.  \n\nOTHER NOTES: \n* Not a huge fan of the art style--the general flatness and large spans of solid color remind me too much of a free flash game, which cheapens the experience for me.  There are little touches that stand out, such as the bublous green mutations that give a sense of transparency and depth, but they almost feel out of place next to everything else.",

But they\u2019re also perhaps the hardest to do well. There\u2019s really no getting around making the gameplay of one good, and failing to do that is practically a kiss of death. While Splasher doesn\u2019t reinvent the wheel, it does provide a very enjoyable experience.\n\nThe story takes place in a massive paint factory, Inkorp, whose owner has suddenly revealed himself as a mad scientist, kidnapping workers and experimenting on them, as well as using an army of killer robots to do the task. You know, as you do. As the only unique-looking worker in the bunch you have to put a stop to that using a gun that can fire water, and later on a few different kinds of paint. Red lets you walk up walls and on the ceiling, while yellow bounces you around. \n\nYour water gun is used to flip switches and defeat enemies, although aside from some moments where you\u2019re locked in combat is a bit of an afterthought, thanks to some liberal auto-aim on the game\u2019s part. That isn\u2019t to say enemies aren\u2019t dangerous though, as even the ones not trying to kill you directly can still cause your death by washing away the paint you\u2019re using to get around. Thus far they\u2019re placed fairly, to make the levels harder but still doable.\n\nIn each level of the game you\u2019ll find seven workers in peril that you can rescue that spell out Splash! Six are strewn about the level behind some tough jumps or puzzle rooms, and the final one is at the end, locked in a cage you\u2019ll need to have enough energy from the stage to unlock. You get that by destroying enemies and washing off special glowing patches of paint. \n\nThis set-up reminded me a lot of Donkey Kong, particularly the newer games by Retro, as well as the newer Rayman titles. The latter thought turned out to be quite appropriate, as three of the game\u2019s staff are Romaine Claude, Richard Vatinel and Aymeric Schwartz, the level designer, art director, and composer for Origins respectively. I can safely say all their talent is not wasted on the game.\n\nEach level I\u2019ve played - about six of the twenty-two the game seems to have - has been well-crafted, and built around speed. Apparently Splashy was made through a collaboration with speedrunners, and I can see why. If everything lined up perfectly, you\u2019d be able to get through levels quite fast.\n\nThe levels themselves are also a treat to look at as well as play. Factory levels in games tend to be really dingy, dark places, but owing to it manufacturing paint the one in Splasher is very colorful and almost feels alive. Water spouts up from pipes to propel you upward, turrets paint the walls and ceiling automatically - even things that kill you are very comfortable. You die in one hit, but so far I haven\u2019t felt any real frustration. The music is also very nice, being jazzy and upbeat.\n\nAbout the only knock I can think of to the game is that it\u2019s one of those games that takes it for granted you\u2019re playing with a controller. All the prompts are for one, and you can\u2019t change keyboard controls, which are WADS for movement and IJKL for shooting water and paint. Obviously not everyone plays games like this on a keyboard and that\u2019s fine, but it is something to be aware of. I\u2019d say it\u2019s perfectly playable on keyboard, though, aside from jumping over saws while wall-running, which I found a bit awkward.\n\nAnother thing that might be a flaw is that advancing through levels is gated off by you rescuing the workers in levels, so it\u2019s not entirely an optional goal. So far it\u2019s not too strict, but if you\u2019d just prefer to blaze through levels it could be a flaw. Some of them did take me a few tries to rescue.\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re looking for a well-done, if not exactly an innovative platformer, or a new game to speedrun, I think Splasher would do nicely despite these minor flaws.\n\nThis review was done on behalf of Save Or Quit (saveorquit.com).

The game's controls and level design are fluid and fast. Levels are designed in a way that rewards quick movement; lots of cycle-based stuff that you can make and just looks awesome when you do, but only if you're fast enough. Pretty dang tight platinum medal times to beat in single-level time-attack. Built-in full game speedruns for three different categories. An integrated split system that lets you easily track just how far ahead or behind you are of your best runs. The only things really missing are time attack ghosts and a quick restart (the latter of which is intended to be added soon and feels very sorely needed). As well there are a small number of short unskippable cutscenes but those are pretty minor. \n\nThe game is pretty dang great to play casually, too; a smooth progression of gameplay mechanics and difficulty across 22 levels, with the first few levels getting you used to the basic mechanics, then giving you the stick ink and bounce ink at about a quarter and 2/3rds of the way into the game. The levels tend to be focused on one core mechanic but still incorporate some of the other mechanics to keep levels diverse and interesting. And the last level ties everything together and adds a simple boss fight to boot. There's 7 splashers to rescue in each level, the last of which requiring you to collect 700 yellow ink, which tends to require nearly every speck of the level to be scoured, but never feels too hard to get (I never actually had to replay a level to get the 700 ink myself).\n\nVisually the game is also pretty gorgeous, a nice cartoony style with lots of vibrant colors. The level design itself is fairly blocky but it works well with how movement in the game works. And the control scheme makes quite a bit of sense (if you use controller, at least; I found it near unplayable on keyboard and I wouldn't recommend it regardless given how important aiming with the D-pad is). The soundtrack I'm pretty indifferent on, it's solid enough & doesn't annoy me, and it fits the mood of the game well enough. The plot's very simple and conveyed entirely without dialogue but it's basically an excuse plot to get the whole thing rolling and I'm totally fine with that.\n\nYou can definitely tell this game was made by a designer for the Rayman Origins/Legends games, up to using both those games as level titles (alongside quite a number of pop culture references). The atmosphere is pretty similar (though not as wacky), the level design is absolutely up to par with the Rayman games (heck, might even be better), it's just a great experience all around. The kind of game I am very seriously considering getting into speedrunning the full game for (though I haven't gotten there yet; soon, though, once I at least gold medal all the levels in time attack).\n\nIt's got minimal frustrations, clever and varied level design, a great length to not feel too short but keep the whole game plenty replayable, a lot of obvious fine-tuning to make it as player friendly as possible while still providing a decent challenge... absolutely worth checking out for any fans of 2D platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1487233703, "timestamp_updated":

2 et Oddworld le tout a la sauce Super Meat Boy et vous obtenez EXACTEMENT Splasher !\n\nCe que vous allez lire ci-dessous pourrait s'apparenter a un acharnement a chercher la petite bete... Mais sachez que si je chipotte autant c'est parceque j'ai ADORE ce jeu et vais surement passer de nombreuses heures a le speedruner !\n\nGameplay: \nAu premier abord il est tres propre. Notre avatar glisse legerement mais on s'y fait vite. Cependant on en viens vite a rager apres la visee. En effet quand la difficultee ce corse et que les combinaisons entre les jets et les timmings deviennent plus serre, il est parfois difficile de tirer sous ses pieds. De meme, il vous sera impossible de tirer en restant immobile (ou alors je n'ai pas trouve comment) et cela vous jouera parfois des tours.\n\nLevel Design: \nLe jeu a clairement ete concu pour le speerun. On regretera le manque d'embranchements et de choix de route dans les niveaux. Les timmings sont clairement definis par des triggers a des points precis (souvent au checkpoints) et on comprend tres vite que l'on peu en abuser . Pas vraiment de surprises dans leurs rythme et souvent (9 fois sur 10) courir le plus vite possible des le respawn et le moyen le plus facile de passer releguant du coup le skill et l'adaptivitee au second rang. Un petit detail qui m'a surpris, impossible de mourir sur les scies fixe au mur. En effet vous serez bloque avant par une barriere invisible et le seul moyen de mourir dessus sera de sauter directement dedans... Choix etrange.\n\nHa... Et ce lobby pour passer de level en level... Merci, mais non merci ^^'\n\nSound Design:\nL'environnement sonnore est clair et les sons bien definis. Une fois habitue, on sait ce qui ce passe les yeux ferme ! Par contre... La musique qui redemarre a chaque respawn est pour moi une grosse erreure et on en viens vite a la detester malgres les compos plutot sympa... Gros dommage !\n\nDifficultee:\n(N'ayant pas encore teste le mode time-attack, cette critique porte sur le mode Standard du jeu.)\nEtant habitue a speedrunner de Super Meat Boy (PB 23\"45'), J'avais entendu dire que Splasher etait bien plus dur/complex a prendre en main. Pour ma part, J'ai seulement accumule les try a partir du Niveau 19 sur les 22 que compte le jeu. Ceci dit, la difficultee semble relativement bien repartie tout au long du jeu et suivant le shema suivant: \n\n1) Un niveau assez simple vous presente de nouveaux mobs/pieges/mechaniques, \n2) Les niveaux suivant exploitent ces nouvelles difficultees en les combinants\n3) un gros niveau que l'on pourrait qualifier de \"niveau boss\" vous chalengera\n\nC'est assez banal me direz-vous... Et vous aurez raison! Mais dans le cas de Splasher la courbe de difficulte est vraiment tres definie et les paliers/piques de difficulte ce font bien resentir. Et ca c'est plutot cool et gratifiant pour les joueurs les moins experimentes !\n\nJ'espere que les temps du mode time-attack seront quand a eux calcule au poil des les premiers niveaux afin d'offrir un challenge un peu plus releve au joueurs experimentes)\n\nFeatures:\nLes dev's de Splasher ont bosse avec avec une belle brochette de speedrunner lie au NES.Blog.. Et ca ce sent ! Chrono IG, leaderboard, Differentes categories directement dans le jeu (100%, any%, time attack...) On est au top pour le speedrun et pour defier ses amis ! Si je peux me permettre une suggestion... Une galerie pour les replays et un mod ghost seraient la cerise sur le gateau !\n\nSinon le jeu entier baigne dans les references au cinema et aux autres jeu et c'est toujours un plaisir de decouvrir ses clins d'oeil !\n\nBref... Pour que je poste un pave tel que celui-ci dans les critiques de steam... C'est que le jeu vaut vraiment le coup !\n\n\nTL:DR \nSplasher soutient aisement la comparaison avec son concurent direct: Super Meat Boy\nSi vous avez ponce SMB en long en large et en travers ou si vous souhaitez changer un peu d'air, Splasher et fait pour vous malgres quelques petit defauts de gameplay et sa difficulte un peu en deca.\nVous n'avez pas joue a Super Meat Boy ? Splasher est egalement fait pour vous avec sa courbe de difficultee intelligement repartie !\n\n\nNB: J'ai eu la chance de gagner une clee.

Splasher is groovy platformer that has style and lots of mechanics to master. \n\nThe artstyle adds [i]so[/i] much polish to the game. I enjoyed the few cutscene images that popped up and the squishy characters and enemies were both unique and lovable.\nSlick animations do a great job of reflecting the flexible yet predictable controls. It\u2019s immensely satisfying to watch the employees you rescue rocket off and the gold-ink-points swirl into you.\n\nSplasher\u2019s music sound greats and meshes with everything nicely. The lively electronic jams have an industrial element to their beat and background elements and also provide a \u2018cool\u2019 feel, fitting both the setting and tone of the character and gameplay. Props to David Boitier and Aymeric Schwartz! The rest of the soundscape sticks as well. Success-related tones have a punch and level related noises help you keep track of conditions around you.\n\nLevels constantly have fresh ideas swapped out level to level while some return later alongside other recent mechanics. Levels do a great job of silently guiding you, providing a lot of trust in the mechanics. Given the context, certain jumps/moves/routes seem possible, even if they hadn\u2019t stood out to you before. While required to reach some sections of the game, the employees are mostly optional and a good challenge to go for if you\u2019re motivated. I reached the finale without having to worry about going back to and replay levels which an uncomfortable task. The levels that I saved the least employees on where probably the hardest ones for me so collecting them out of necessity would\u2019ve been a chore. I also appreciate who getting the ink-wheels and saving dudes inside portals are permanent.\n\n\nSplasher doesn\u2019t end on a high note though.\nIn general, I find it disappointing when the final level of a platformer is a chase segments. They\u2019re long levels that kill you if you can\u2019t complete each varied section near-perfectly. They\u2019re a good way to introduce tension while testing sight-reading and mechanically skill but when you die consistently (they are supposed to be challenging levels after all) it kicks you right out of that drama. It just becomes another demanding level. I usually don\u2019t like to do comparisons, but Ori and The Blind Forest had similar problem with its finale. The Kuro chase has forgettable, \u2018epic\u2019 music and punishes you for not being able to guess what mechanic it\u2019ll reintroduce next. All the while, it\u2019s a fairly janky sequence that tries too hard to integrate dramatically timed set pieces. Even during replays of the game I\u2019ve struggled with it. This section is, for me, the roughest moment for an otherwise beautiful and intriguing game.\n\nThe Kuro chase and Splasher\u2019s finale both require the usage of a huge catalog of mechanics. Thematically, it rounds everything off nicely, but in the end you\u2019re testing the player on a variety of skills they might\u2019ve forgotten, making them remember those older ideas while mixing them with other concepts. Despite my success elsewhere, they made me feel tongue-tied. It also doesn\u2019t help that Splasher\u2019s finale starts with an uninteresting boss that takes a lot of standing and waiting to beat.\n\nIn contrast, the Ori\u2019s early-game Ginco Tree escape is focused around using one move that was just previously the central mechanic of the an entire level. The fantastical music that plays uses Ori\u2019s memorable leitmotif and gives the sequence a serious emotional impact. The song also continuously plays rather than stopping and then starting over, playing the same 45 seconds segment up until where you always die. Similarly, earlier chases in Splasher were more entertaining as they primarily tested your skill with the most recently acquired fluid and the associated mechanics from the last act.\n\n\nI probably spent too much time talking about that, but writing these things are a good opportunity to reflect on other ideas like that.\n\nIn Splasher, all the elements complement one another making the game come together exceptionally. It\u2019s a well-rounded and organic experience.

I don't mean to say The End is Nigh is an inferior game, i enjoyed that as well, although the difficulty spike is maddening (I'm looking at you, The Future I ). \nIn complete contrast, Splasher has a gradual and fair difficulty curve. The levels are designed to be fun first which results in an enjoyable and memorable experience. You won't be gouging your eyes out and pulling your hair out with this game, not even close. There were plenty of opportunities for the devs to make the most arduous levels imaginable, levels that make you want to smash your head against the wall. But they didn't, and that is divine.\n\nThis game immensely reminds me of Oddworld.

How nobody thought of unbinding K  from jump is depressing. Thankfully, we are on steam and the community has made mods allowing you to change the keybinds. \n\nAll in all, if you frequent this genre often, care little for the experience and only looking for a nearly insurmountable challenge, you probably wouldn't like this game.\nIf you want to have an enjoyable, fun experience and always exit the game with a pleasant taste in your mouth, then this is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1520797052, "timestamp_updated": 1520797118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40743078": {"recommendationid": "40743078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146856046", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 708, "last_played": 1520863981}, "language": "koreana", "review": "18\ub144 3\uc6d4 \ud5d8\ube14 \uba3c\uc2ac\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub5a0\uc11c \ud574\ubd24\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ud55c\uae00\ud654\ub294 \uad73\uc774 \ud544\uc694\uc5c6\ub294\ub370 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uace0 \uac8c\uc784 \uc790\uccb4\ub294 \uc27d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c \uc124\uba85\uc774 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc5d0 \uc548\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc11c \ube44\ucd94\ucc9c \ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\nepic fail \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uae68\ub098\uc694?", "timestamp_created": 1520779706, "timestamp_updated": 1520791353, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40737755": {"recommendationid": "40737755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009217675", "num_games_owned": 473, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 272, "last_played": 1520730326}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr empfehlenswertes Spiel f\u00fcr zwischendurch.

It was enjoyable, it's a well refined game.\n\nI imagine that where it really shines (if it does) is speedrunning - the game has several speedrunning modes implemented: time attack (individual levels),no-collectible speedrunning and 100% speedrunning. Even during the main game, you'll see how many of the sections are built to go fast, rather than playing slowly and methodically.\n\nThis is a cool thing! Although it might have lowered the base difficulty somewhat.\n\nThe one rather big problem I have with the game is the controls. The main controls are fine, although the character seems to have a bit too much inertia - I found it difficult to stop exactly where I want, etc. I don't see it as a fault, necessarily- I assume it's just a matter of playing enough to get used to the subtleties.\nThe problem is the gun controls - they're pretty bad. The game relies on a mixture of 8 directional input and auto-aiming. The 8 directional input seems too primitive when most controllers have analog sticks. why force the 8 directions? Especially when, with auto-aiming, the aim becomes 360 degrees instead of 8-directional! It feels a bit inconsistent, and I often died because I expected to be aiming at something that, in the end, I was not.\n\nIt's also a bit awkward to aim while you're trying to go fast with the jumping gel - wall jumping, for example, forces you to shoot while pointing left and immediately point right for momentum. Similarly when running forward, you have to aim down for a big jump, while aiming a bit horizontally to keep running. \nThe controls weren't ideal, to me.

You don't make a game that requires pixel perfect platforming with crap controls like that.\nWhat is also a big mystery and weird is the horrible hub design to pad out this short game, because you will ge going back and forth to get to the other stage, and since there stage design level is pretty much non-existent, it is just a gaming limbo.\nIf you can ignore controls (it's harder than it sounds), then I guess you can ignore that part and get the game now, because you might enjoy it and have some fun.\nFor  me it was meh experience and I would rather go play SMB, Rayman or try some new ones than play this - there are plenty to choose from that are better than this game and many more still coming.", "timestamp_created": 1520168817, "timestamp_updated": 1520168926, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489302", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40559291": {"recommendationid": "40559291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323164577", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1521346192}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u4e86\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u80fd\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6296M\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u75db\u82e6\u5e76\u5feb\u4e50\u7740\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u53ef\u6015\u3002\u987a\u4fbf\u95ee\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u5fae\u8f6f\u5b98\u65b9\u5546\u57ce\u4e70\u7684xbox\u624b\u67c4\u80fd\u4fdd\u4fee\u5417\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u6211\u901a\u5173\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u624b\u67c4\u4e5f\u8be5\u574f\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1520161472, "timestamp_updated": 1520161662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40554201": {"recommendationid": "40554201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078339491", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520339649}, "language": "german", "review": "Das Game f\u00e4ngt Verdammt gut an wird aber gegen ende L\u00e4cherlich Schwer.\nhatte dennoch die meiste zeit echt spa\u00df, was unteranderem daran liegt das dieses spiel einfach einen Unfassbar Guten Spielflu\u00df hat.\n\nIch habe im vorletzten level kurz vorm ende(M\u00fcsste der letzte checkpoint gewesen sein) aufgeh\u00f6rt.\n\nKann ich im Gro\u00dfen und ganzen dennoch empfehlen.", "timestamp_created": 1520143791, "timestamp_updated": 1520143791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40552277": {"recommendationid": "40552277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096742168", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520135333}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like cartoony platformers that have a little twist on the genre, this one will be a welcome addition to your library.

For that optimal time in a time attack mode, you need to know what gel needs to go where. Red gel on the floor slows you down but on walls and celings lets you move at full speed, so always make sure you spray down with water when there's some floor sections to have to traverse.\nLater on the game straight up gives you the bouncy and sticky gels to spray the floors yourself which ramps the difficulty up as you start relying less on reading the stage ahead of you and more on reactions, memorising stages and doing it fast, clean and stylishly. \nThere's also 7 people to rescue in each stage treated as 'collectible' you have to grab to unlock more stages. \n\nThe ability to switch between just the standard gameplay of playing the levels, complete with multiple checkpoints and the time attack and Selfish Speedrunner modes gives EVERYONE a good experience. Not very good at doing things personally? Can't memorise stages well? No worries just play the regular levels - it's still worth teh price tag. But for those who want that extra challenge, you've got the modes to test you.\n\nThe soundtrack is great too, nothing MIND BLOWING but definitely found myself appreciating it and every jamming along at times (Notably: The first 'auto-scroller' stage, with green goop rising). Especially when you keep dying and starting from a checkpoint and the music kicks in like as if to say \"BACK TO IT SCRUB\".\nVisually, it's got cutesy, cartoon character and visuals a la Castle Crashers or any flash style/Behemoth game though I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad or negative thing. The style works well with the whole aethsetic and the goopy bright gels compliment this.\n\nI'm really looking forward to playing the rest of this wonderfully sculpted game and overall, this is the kind of game that has a LOT of life in it. To grabbing all the dudes in the stage, to getting the gold in time attack to completing the extra speed runnign mdoea and then even trying to get that top time on the leaderboards.\nSplasher is the first platformer in a long while I've truly just been impressed and entertained without any discrepencies. If I \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed up - it was on me. The game is solid and the Splashteam guys should be proud of what they've made.\n\nAlso Shout out to GrandPOOBear for introducing me to this game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1520101324,

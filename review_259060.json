Dazu z\u00e4hlen in erster Linie die eher detailarme Grafik (zumindest f\u00fcr heutigen Standard) und die daf\u00fcr ausgepr\u00e4gte Spielmechanik. Diese ist verglichen mit anderen Strategiespielen weit komplexer und mit allen Spielinhalten tiefer verankert. Der eigentliche Sinn in Strategiespielen  wird durch eine F\u00fclle an Einsatzm\u00f6glichkeiten gegeben und auch dank einer guten Menge (das zigfache) an Spielinhalten kann man daraus eine gute Abwechslung je Runde schaffen.\n\nWas an sich f\u00fcr Profis oder zumindest Spieler mit einer Portion an Einarbeitungswillen gut klingen mag, zeigt umso deutlicher die Schw\u00e4chen des Spiels. Das Spiel erfordert etwas Einarbeitung, zumindest wenn man auch gewinnen und nicht immer verlieren m\u00f6chte. Ich pers\u00f6nlich habe kein Spass daran auf  leichten Schwierigkeitsgrad zu gewinnen. Es sollte schon etwas h\u00f6her angelegt sein.\n\nEine kurze Anmerkung (Man kann den Schwierigkeitsgrad der KI selbstverst\u00e4ndlich festlegen, auch ob sie eher ausgeglichen, offensiv oder deffensiv spielen soll)\n\nDie Quantit\u00e4t ist einerseits ein Qualit\u00e4tsmerkmal die daf\u00fcr aber den \u00dcberblick erschwert. Man muss zu den Art von Spielern geh\u00f6ren die sich gerne etwas Zeit nehmen oder wieder zu ihrem geliebten Spiel zur\u00fcckfinden, falls sie denn mal die Lust daran verloren haben.\n\nEtwas Vorstellungskraft gleicht die detailarme Grafik aus und gibt dem Spiel eine gewisse Faszination. \n\nDie gr\u00f6sste Kritik vergebe ich der Musik. Zum einen gibt es hinsichtlich der Musik keine Abwechslung und zum anderen st\u00f6rt mich pers\u00f6nlich das Gedudel etwas. Ok es klingt etwas entspannend aber das wars dann auch schon. Gewiss kann man dar\u00fcber hinwegsehen.\n\n\n\nAlles in allem gebe ich dem Spiel einen Daumen hoch.", "timestamp_created": 1515666581, "timestamp_updated": 1515666804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39212249": {"recommendationid": "39212249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273937578", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 36979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501854523}, "language": "english", "review": "Did you know that every single weapon has it's own stats?

Unit movement cannot be queued, so moving say, an army, from one side of a map to another is tedious to the point of being annoying. You have to baby sit a unit as it moves from one location to another. This problem compounds in later stages of the game when you might have 15+ units on the board at once, all having different goals or going to different places.\n\nIt hurts to give this game a bad score because of something so simple.

Some illogical design choices like scattering of troops after a battle which you would then like to go around picking up, you cannot disband them or its not obvious?, provincial defense always gets replenished for the next turn.

It requires users to get past a UI and graphics interface that can be counter-intuitive to modern gaming standards, but once you do players will find a rare gem of a game that has more variety, thematics, and the capacity to create stories than any other 4X on the market.\n\nThe game is fun as a single player experience, which is honestly where most of my time in game has come from, but it really shines if you can find others to play with. That said, the game is more interested in incorporating the great variety of factions, spells, equipment, and units that make each play through unique than it is on strict balancing, so it is worth noting that you want to be sure to find the right folks that fit your play style. From my experience, the community is usually a fairly positive one and I have generally had good experiences. \n\nThe price point throws a lot of folks off, which I respect, but I still say this is one that is worth the full price of admission. I would love to see some of the unique mechanics here, especially how battle resolution and preparation is handled, be incorporated in more games in the turn based strategy genre.", "timestamp_created": 1509722318, "timestamp_updated": 1509722318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689392", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36227130": {"recommendationid": "36227130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136860313", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 10219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511964107}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best turn based strategey games I've ever played", "timestamp_created": 1509657296, "timestamp_updated": 1509657296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36222573": {"recommendationid": "36222573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044854637", "num_games_owned": 508, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507858927}, "language": "english", "review": "A amazing game with more depth than I can possibly explain.", "timestamp_created": 1509644065, "timestamp_updated": 1509644065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508507", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36177606": {"recommendationid": "36177606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028577509", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507754978}, "language": "english", "review": "I like a lot strategy games, rpg sometimes also.

(I bought it on Desura all those years ago, so my steam hours aren't at all accurate)\n\nIn short; this game is big. There are dozens of different races/factions - 'nations' - spilt accross 3 eras. There are hundreds of spells, units and items to learn. \n\nThe depth of this game is absolutely incredible, each individual soldier has a multitude of individual stats, each armour piece and weapon listed seperately. It matters in this game too, because if your soldier has a shield they're less likely to die to non-magic missiles for example. It goes further than that, what is that shield made of? If its metal there are spells which can cause it to rust and thus be useless.  \n\nEach of the nations is based off real-world mythology, from Norse and Arthurian Legend to Japanese Goblins and Devas. There are Vampires and Giants, Elves and Beastmen, even the otherworldly horrors of the deep sea. Most of the nations play on land, but some sit in the water, and others move easily between the two.  \n\nI mentioned spells, well the game has a stupid number. I have no idea just how many. These are broken up between schools, and then each spell has alignments (fire, earth, death etc) which govern which of the various mages in the game can cast what (in laymans terms.)\n\nThis review of course does not do this depth justice. If you're at all interested in this game, go what a few lets plays on youtube. DasTactic, TortugaPower, WadeStar, and  NuclearMonkee are just a few challenges that have good videos on the game. I really recommend doing this because the interface is absolutely terrible, scripting units and commanders can be a real pain in the arse and is probably the only real sore point I have with this game. \n\nThe graphics, while dated however, are really charming. It reminds me of tabletop wargaming in 6mm, Yes the game could look better, but download some community made maps and it really does look pretty. The sprites while not high pixel count DO actually look really nice. If you're at all interested, don't be that person who goes \"Oh the graphics look dated why?\" because you'll miss out on a great game. \n\nAs for custom maps and mods, there are tonnes.

I haven't yet tested the multiplayer (I'm still far too new to have a chance against more experienced players), but from playing several games against AI I can already tell that this is just the kind of game I have wanted to play for a very long time. \nFor those who know Heroes of Might and Magic this game looks familiar from the beginning, but turns out to be quite different in the long run. As in HoMaM armies need commanders to lead them around the map, and most spells are cast by commanders. Another similarity is that nations and units are based on various mythologies.\nWhat differs is how strategic the games feel. Dominions is mainly played on the world map, which is grouped into provinces. The player has to manage owned provinces (prepare defense, use commanders to construct buildings, etc.) to keep a steady income of resources and gold, and to be prepared should an enemy try to attack. On the other hand one can often choose one of multiple provinces to attack an enemy, and one has to scout for those that are not well prepared. This makes the player feel a bit less \"directly involved\" than Heroes of Might and Magic does, but on the other side one feels more \"in control\". What further contributes to this is that one needs a lot of commanders, as some of them will be busy building or researching, without ever leading an army.\nWhat also makes this game stand out is the incredible depth of simulation. A lot of things can happen in Dominions, and all of them have elaborate rules. I think it's enough to say that the manual has over 450 pages (mostly tables) to demonstrate how detailed this game is.\n\nAnyhow, it's one of the best turn-based strategy games I've played up to now.", "timestamp_created": 1505662572, "timestamp_updated": 1505662572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580758", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34925969": {"recommendationid": "34925969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031970534", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506814304}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1505331514, "timestamp_updated": 1505331514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448353", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34890947": {"recommendationid": "34890947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069897854", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 22282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514757953}, "language": "english", "review": "Conquered the entire known universe as the son of an archangel, wearing nothing but a cape and the suit I was born in, all while my ankle-spanker bellowed majestically in the winds. \n\n10/10, would flash an entire fantasy setting again", "timestamp_created": 1505166963, "timestamp_updated": 1505166963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34859423": {"recommendationid": "34859423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123770481", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 8270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 516, "last_played": 1515623814}, "language": "english", "review": "There should really be simultaneous battle when fighting at the same time, in the same province in disciple games.\nWhy would an army wait for his ally to get crushed.\nThen it's up to the players to field their units at the right position on the battlefield to avoid killing or get killed by his ally's units (like hydra with poison).\n\nIl faudrait vraiment inclure des batailles simultan\u00e9es avec les alli\u00e9s ( en disciple game), car c'est ridicule d'attaquer un ennemi commun, l'un apr\u00e8s l'autre.", "timestamp_created": 1505042479, "timestamp_updated": 1505042479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34850664": {"recommendationid": "34850664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134662362", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485770191}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game.\n\nI played it multiplayer with a friend and it has a very good amount of depth to it.\n\nThe graphics are serviceable.

But undeniable it is also a very niche game. I hope with this review i can help you in your decision if you should buy this game or not. \n\nLets start with the obvious stuff: the negative. \n- the graphics are the worstest graphics i have ever seen in a game. Like in every game you get used to it, and im still happy that at least every differnet unit has their own little picture, from which you can set them apart, but besides this, the graphic is very unsatisfying. \n-its very hard to get in. To play the tutorial (which is basicly a 1v1 game against a very weak AI) you have to print a 400 pages manual (or at least the tutorial part of it) so that you can follow the steps is it and have the chance to slowly understand what to do and how to play. \n-The AI is not very smart and in the Single player game their is no diplomacy option which means that after the AI or you have declared war to each other, their will be war until the end. \n\nSo basicly what is the problem with the game is the very poor presentation and its very hard to get into it. Their will be no feelings of success in the first hours so i can totally understand if someone wants to give it a try, buyed it on steam and then refund it after two hours because in this short time he did not get any fun at all. \n\nBut if you can overlook the presentation here are the reasons, why in my opinion this game is such a wounderful one. \n\n- The scale: This game offers 100 different nations, everyone with a unique backstory based on ancient tales i dont know how many hundret gods, hundret of spells 1000 of units...you name it. The scale of this game is immense and if you belong to the kind of persons who always wants to try new things out, then this game will make you happy. \n-With the huge scale their also comes: tactics! While the balance of so many nations and spells+ unitcombinations may not be perfect for hard core players who wants to play the best way possibile, since their may be some nations that are just stronger if you play them right, then other nations, but for a more \"casual\" player the amound of possible tactics that you can develop and try to outplay the opponent are immense! \n-the community: While this game is a very niche game, with only a few sells, the community is still very active, and it is way more likely to get help if you have a question in this game, then in even the most tripple A games. The community members are as far as i can say very friendly, and since they are so active you also shoudlnt get to many problems in creating or joining a Multiplayer Game. \n- The Multiplayer: To be honest i have to admit, that while i like MP games, and i like strategie games...i never played a round based mulitplayer game besides Civ5 before. To long are the games, to stressfull the games, so i never enjoyed playing in Multiplayer. But in this game the multiplayer part is the true way-to-play of dominions 4...and gives me the best multiplayer experience i have ever seen in a game! \nThe biggest reason is: the free diplomacy. (together with the awesome community) Because while the most games have very \"forced\" diplomacy, which means if you make a non aggression pact you are just unable to invade the opponents lands until this contract is active, and if you give someone in a trade 500 gold for 10 magic swords you get instantly the 10 swords. \n\nIn dominions 4 the diplomacy has no strict limitations, and is very based on the trust you develop with the other players. Which means that you write real messages to them and ask them for stuff like a trade deal or a non aggression pact and they can write you one thing...and do something totally different.\n So you can for example make a non aggression pact for 2 years, and all went well but then suddely, when your army is on the other side of the world, your \"ally\" betrays you since he have diplomacy against you which you dont know and invades your lands, you can give him 1000 gold for magic items that he dont send you and stuff like this.\n So you have to figure out in the game itself how you should punish such untrustful diplomacy. Because you have to think: Can i really trust this player who have already broken a non aggression pact against his other neighbor? Do i support the other player who claimed that he was betrayed from his \"ally\"...or is this player just tries to trick you into a war? \n\nFrom this open diplomacy so many intense \"game-of-thrones\" moments happens, and it really gives you the feeling of an emperor of your nation who has to find out his best way to get more power. Will you betray your weak ally to get his lands, knowing that this will hurt your reputation, and will make further diplomacy harder? Will you play honorable and dont attack a nation that has a non aggresion pact with you, while it is weakend from a war against a other nation? To risk that this nation will overcome your nation, if you give it enough time to regain its power? \n\nThis open diplomacy is of course a very risky option, since when you have the \"wrong\" players in your game that just dont communicate with you what so ever and start attacking you for no reason without any messages, this will really harm the fun that you get from this game, but thanks to the awesome community, most of the players i have seen so far are more then willing to \"roleplay\" the diplomacy which leads to the most interesting situations i have ever seen in any video game.\n\n After a while you get really into your games, you truely begin to trust some, misstrust others, you feel great joy, if a plan works as intendet and will cry in frusttration if your masterplan gets crusht by the plans of the other players. This leads to the most immersive gaming experience i have ever seen so far in a round based strategie game.\n\n If you love the idea of a diplomacy where like in the real world anythink can happen and a strategie game that is very hard to get into, but has so much to offer that even after thousend of hours you still have more to learn, then i really can recomment it to you.", "timestamp_created": 1501677015, "timestamp_updated": 1501677254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622081", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33969727": {"recommendationid": "33969727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005977733", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 6391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510949207}, "language": "english", "review": "Very complex, lots of variety  - I love games like that.", "timestamp_created": 1501675955, "timestamp_updated": 1501675955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33923108": {"recommendationid": "33923108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069164424", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 9645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511767369}, "language": "english", "review": "A U T I S M P O W E R H O U R\n\nThis game has so many micro optimizations that my autism boner simply cannot handle itself.\n\nIf you need autism food, here you have it.", "timestamp_created": 1501490350, "timestamp_updated": 1501490350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451255", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33910487": {"recommendationid": "33910487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028623799", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 94914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510128186}, "language": "english", "review": "It has its moments", "timestamp_created": 1501437632, "timestamp_updated": 1501437632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437036", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33908506": {"recommendationid": "33908506", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988566726", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 4232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512266359}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is like a stand offish girl, who dresses like an old lady, but is really the girl of your dreams.

It's like playing grand D&D 3.0 campaing by the book and with a lot of expansions, as a Dungeon Master. You either memorise most important stuff, have vage understanding of the rest and energy to manage dozens of NPCs, sites and events, or you will be like a blind child in the fog in the middle of earthquake. The abundance of content does not help either, especially with hundreds of spells to choose from. A lot of patience for loading times on big maps is also needed.\n\nBut after grasping the rules the game became brilliant. You can min max in ways that almost break it. You can play as heat loving nations and then magically create more suns to boost your armies with massive bonuses. You can give your mages so much power and artifacts that they will win almost every battle singlehandedly. You can build undead legions that do not need sleep and food and then make them even bigger with every battle that you won. There are thousands of combinations of nations, spells and artifacts that in every other game would be called overpowered.\n\nBut this game wants you to feel and to be overpowered. It gives you the ability to play as a demons summoning, fireballs throwing dragon, conquering the world with the armies of beasts, horrors beyond time and space, and released from Tartarus ancient titans. It gives you the power to craft artifacts like Sun Slayer, Carcator the Pocket Lich and Fenris' Pelt and give them to your commanders. It allows you to summon fire and ice storms, create vampires, hybrids and automatons, perform blood rituals to build castles and throw bolts of god's wrath onto your enemies. It demands a lot from you, but after that it gives you a lot of tools to experiment and have a lot of fun with.\n\nThe important think is, that you do not controll combat. You also can't tinker with economy, cause there is none. You collect gold and magic gems, provinces generate resources, there is unrest, temples and fortresses, but that's it. You build armies, equip commanders, choose formations, give them simple orders and then watch. It's like late game Total War, when you just build bigger forces than enemies and click auto resolve, but this time you can watch Cthulhu spawns beating dragon raiding minotaurs and archwizards using mage slaves to boost their powers. Did I mention that you can also teleport from one side of the map to the other, move your armies under the oceans and turn whole provinces into undead filled wastelands?\n\nIf you like grand strategies with tons of options, that can be expanded through mods, this game is for you. If you like to feel powerfull and do things on monumental scale, this game is for you. If you think that battles are more important than economy and base building, this game is for you. If you don't mind somewhat unfriendly UI and have patience for micromanagement 50+ armies and provinces, this game is definitelly for you. Full price may be a bit too much considering how much time is needed to fully grasp it's rules, but with regular patches and active community creating new maps, mods and additional resources like wikis, I would say it's worth the risk.", "timestamp_created": 1500764840, "timestamp_updated": 1500764840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33702816": {"recommendationid": "33702816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006714326", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502979036}, "language": "english", "review": "I can finally live my dream of using a shapeshifting lizardman to promote fascism to underwater fucked up mermaids", "timestamp_created": 1500661980, "timestamp_updated": 1500661980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33642159": {"recommendationid": "33642159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121203990", "num_games_owned": 867, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471757131}, "language": "english", "review": "love it", "timestamp_created": 1500429198, "timestamp_updated": 1500429198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33585126": {"recommendationid": "33585126", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980263904", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 75647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512067362}, "language": "english", "review": "Too much to do, too much to see... 800 hours of practice, and I think I've gotten a decent hang of the base rules.

However, once you get past the cover and into the meat of the game it's absolutely fantastic! It's the kind of game that has a pretty minimal story but if you pay attention to the details there is so much more happening to every single unit in your army. \n\nExample: The game lets you create equipment and give it to the commanders in your army. Around midway through a game I was looking through all of my units when I noticed that one of my commanders no longer had the sword and shield I gave him. When I looked closer I found that somewhere in the course of many battles this guy has been in he lost both of his arms! Now his only attack was a headbutt! This absolute badass was running around the battlefield headbutting everyone and commanding the army at the same time!\n\nNeedless to say he impressed me enough that I dedicated a huge amount of time and resources to get one of my mages powerful enough to create an item that would heal his wounds. After crafting the item (basically the holy grail) and healing his wounds he was back on the front lines with some other fancy equipment I decided to make for him. From then on he just had to deal with the minor inconvenience of being radomly attacked by questing knigts looking to take the grail from him!\n\nYou just don't see these kinds of details in many games! 10/10!", "timestamp_created": 1498880296, "timestamp_updated": 1498881071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32995349": {"recommendationid": "32995349", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976281073", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498745679}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent, deep strategy game with a solid community behind it.

Moving a commander to the next province will take 1 turn. The problem is that you can't order him to go to the front by one click and wait a few turns, no you'll have to move him manually 1 province EVERY turn! So you will have to give him 6 commands within 6 turns, 1/turn. \n\nImagine 3 castles scattered around your empire each 6 provinces away from your front producing units and want to support the frontline, then you will have to manually move 3 seperate commanders every turn. Resulting in giving 6*3=18 commands over a period of 6 turns, 3/turn for only 3 units (you have to locate them first by selecting the province), cumbersome and tedious.\n\n[h1]UI examples[/h1]\n\nThere is no total number of units view of your provinces. You need to grab the nation's overview and sum up the sizes of armies in that province by yourself. Seriously? There is no way telling from the world map how many units are occupying that particular province while there is a depiction of the total number of units in enemy provinces, doesn't make sense. \n\nThe pictures representing the type of commanders in the nation's overview table are so small that it is almost impossible to distinguish them from eachother. Overall the interface is cluncky and there are nested menu's. The game doesn't discriminate between mages and commanders with high leadership but without magic abilities (they are both registered as commanders), thus no hotkeys for selecting idle specific commanders.\n\n[h1]Short game description[/h1]\n\nThe game is similar to the board game RISK added with deep tactical combat. Economy and empire development are negligible. There is zero diplomacy (for SP). Combat is auto-resolving and totally hands off. Instead you will program your battleplan. You can chop up your army in different squads and got 3 general options for each squad; Formations (box, line etc), Battle order (attack, hold and attack, keep distance while firing etc) and Target (cavalry, rearmost enemies etc).\n\nI never thought it was possible to have auto-resolving combat with deep tactical layers, dominions 4 shows it. Spreading dominion (=religion) in this game is equivalent to spreading your sphere of influence in 4x games. Dominion affects abilities and/or environments, like turning farmland into swamps. The singleplayer is a skirmish free for all battle where you goal is to capture all the thrones on the map. The game revolves around countering builds of your opponent and since the AI does a poor job at it, it is therefore more suitable for multiplayer.", "timestamp_created": 1498575893, "timestamp_updated": 1498576644, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634431", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32818082": {"recommendationid": "32818082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016690091", "num_games_owned": 446, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491125563}, "language": "english", "review": "Upvote this, or i will cast the BURDEN OF TIME!", "timestamp_created": 1498489279, "timestamp_updated": 1498489279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482690", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32805866": {"recommendationid": "32805866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043815437", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497371550}, "language": "english", "review": "Steep learning curve but incredible depth.", "timestamp_created": 1498465732, "timestamp_updated": 1498465732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562737", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32765894": {"recommendationid": "32765894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038354248", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511667479}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!", "timestamp_created": 1498386711, "timestamp_updated": 1498386711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442308", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32653488": {"recommendationid": "32653488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024000754", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 11416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512116558}, "language": "english", "review": "This is simultaneously the best Grand Strategy, best Fantasy-Based Grand Strategy, and best Turn-Based Grand Strategy game that I have ever played.\n\nThe graphics are antiquated but the scope, scale, complexity, and enjoyment of play are second to none.\n\nI highly recommend this game for any fans of the genres listed above.", "timestamp_created": 1498168791, "timestamp_updated": 1498168791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32643367": {"recommendationid": "32643367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074977819", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501275468}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u70ba\u751a\u9ebc\n\u5abd\u903c\u7684\u70ba\u751a\u9ebc\n\u5c31\u9019\u6a23\u73a9\u4e0d\u505c~", "timestamp_created": 1498141193, "timestamp_updated": 1498141193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32611709": {"recommendationid": "32611709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035902812", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 29544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499770514}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game that allows you to play at whatever pace you want.

The unit models are very varied, have liitle in the way of animations, in the end they are not that pretty , but do good job to show the action of the battles. The music is pretty nice and fits the theme of the game on the other hand the sound effects are maybe to simple and not varied enough for the most part. \n\nIts really a game not for everyone many would just look at the graphics, the complexity or other elements and decide its not for them.

I know life is not free but I think the game is already amazing as is that it does not need much more stuff (except for maybe another UW LA nation and Land LA nation) and maybe a few simple balancing changes but they are pretty good at balancing the nations at the moment in my opinion.\n\nIf you are looking to buy this game, I totally recommend it but you really need to play against other people to get the full experience out of it.

I am here to set the ancient records straight.\n\nLong have I labored in service to the Ancients, dead and forgotten though they may be to most of the civilized world. Only after extensive research and tireless experimentation had I uncovered a ray of hope in the sea of Agarthan darkness. \n\nOf course, it is without doubt that in these late ages, the truest and noblest of the Pale Ones magistocracy have fallen. Only nearly forgotten memories and decaying mummies remain. But I knew there must be a way towards something more, some way to rekindle this magnificent people.\n\nAt first, I placed my hopes in a Wish spell... but it came to naught. No matter how I phrased my wish, e.g. \"resurrect the pale ones\", \"awaken the ancients\". \"rebirth of agartha\", nothing worked. The arcane powers behind the spell continued to inform me... \"I cannot give you that.\" \n\nFinally, some of my most skilled and dedicated Ktonian Necromancers happened upon an archive in one of the lowest reaches of Deep Agartha... an ancient record that held an account of some of the greatest of the Pale Ones. \n\nEcstatic, I raced to cast the powerful Wish spell... only to have my hopes dashed when I received the dreaded \"I cannot give you that.\" After arduous experimentation, my most talented Servants of the Oracles finally uncovered the answer... I would need to wish for them by title, rather than by their given names!\n\nWith renewed vigor, my mages and I prepared the ritual. After a great deal of gems disappeared into the nether, finally what I had worked towards stepped out of the blazing astral light! An Earth-Blooded oracle, in the flesh, alive and breathing in these Late Ages! It was Ogon, Founder and King of Agartha!... but it was not.... to my gravest disappointment, it became abundantly clear that he did not know his own name... nor did he recall his ancient knowledge... he was a blank slate... a newborn, almost. \n\nI stowed the King away, letting him putter around and reacquaint himself with the world. In the meantime, I turned the entirety of my magocracy towards finding a way to help this Revered Ancient remember himself. After many months of diligent study, the secret was uncovered! Some obscure incantation known as the bestowing of a Divine Name, held the key to restoring our fallen king to his old self.\n\nThe spell was cast. Finally, at long last, the King and Founder, Ogon the Earth-Blooded, awoke to himself! And he despaired. His friends and family were dead, and his entire kingdom was a tomb populated by tiny, warm-blooded freaks that worshiped the rotting flesh of his people. I was devastated by his melancholy. All I had wished was to restore Agartha to its former glory, but this suicidally depressed Founding Father seemed anything but a good omen.\n\nAfter many weeks of frustration, I resolved to continue on my course. Soon after, I had brought back Golog, the esteemed and long-lived Oracle of the Dead. I restored his mind in the same manner as I had Ogon's, and soon he was aware and amiable... well... I say amiable. More like cynical and curmudgeonish. However, according to historic records, this is not very different than how he was during the prime of his life.\n\nI swiftly introduced King Ogon to Golog, confident his spirits would soar at the sight of his living brethren! Alas, I was badly mistaken. Golog was as much a dissenter in his younger years as he was later in life, and I found that he had spoken against the invasion of the surface world by Ogon and his son so many centuries ago. Golog displayed an obvious air of superiority and his demeanor fairly reeked of a sentiment of \"I told you so\". Ogon, naturally, found this completely repugnant, and shut himself away in a lower cavern just to be rid of his old, smug political rival. \n\nClose to despair myself, I bade my mages search the archives again. They came up with another oracle, one who had been close to Ogon in life. And what was more, it was a female! Her name was \"Moss Agate\" and she was a member of the Closed Council that Ogon had founded. Quickly, we gathered our gems and ritual tomes and Wished her into existence and restored her old memories.\n\nWhen we finally pried open the door Ogon had locked, Moss Agate lumbered through and Ogon's eye fairly popped out of his socket. He cried, he laughed, he seemed like he must have been in his younger days. If only it had lasted. Joy turned to nostalgia turned again to that deep bitterness that had gripped him since his memories had returned. It seemed contagious, for even Moss Agate seemed to take on his feelings soon after. \n\nI realized what needed to be done. I gathered them, the three oracles I had resurrected, in the now neglected and decrepit Hall of the Ancients. I released them from my service, so that they might make their own way in the world, away from the painful memories of the past. As I watched them gaze around themselves regally, I saw for but a moment what they were seeing. The halls were richly adorned with orange and purple tapestries, embroidered with every conceivable gem from the deepest reaches of the earth. Many revered and vibrant oracle and lord lounged around these pristine marble tables. All was a bustle with activity. \n\nNow, when I looked around, those halls were drab and barren. The shuffling of arthritic feet could be heard as Ktonian Necromancers and alchemists wandered the halls in search of odd tomes or ritual materials. Quiet whispers could almost be discerned, seemingly coming from the direction of the burial caverns, but no other voices filled the halls. \n\nIt was then that I bade my grand entourage farewell. I sent them on their way with two mummified Oracles, that they might keep them company on their journeys. While this diverse group may not have been the closest of companions, they were now all that was left of the glorious past of the Pale Ones. I believed they would stay together unto the end. \n\nThis oil painting is the last image I have of their departure: http://s1073.photobucket.com/user/Sanctus57/media/Return%20Of%20The%20Ancients_zpsx5owdhp9.jpg.html\n\nPerhaps, even now, Moss Agate is with child, and the rebirth of the Pale Ones is already underway. Or perhaps they have decided to let their great race pass from the world.\n", "timestamp_created": 1495082541, "timestamp_updated": 1495082541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31724293": {"recommendationid": "31724293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178127313", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462865992}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1494682523, "timestamp_updated": 1494682523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31717830": {"recommendationid": "31717830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026572727", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494661369}, "language": "english", "review": "deepest strategy ever.", "timestamp_created": 1494660535, "timestamp_updated": 1494660535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467870", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31692387": {"recommendationid": "31692387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036803290", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510174994}, "language": "english", "review": "Most amazing soundtrack.

It's the kind of game you could write a novel about your experiences in your last game. What makes Dominions 4 special is the fact that every single game feels unique, for real. You can't just read a guide and use the same meta-strategy over and over for a specific nation, because each game and each turn requires tons of planning. The feeling of making the right choice in the right moment is awesome. And the opposite goes for a stupid mistake or bad planning. Consequences can be really chaotic, but not always unforgiving.\n\nI've read several times that this game is hard to get into. I really don't agree with it. It's really easy to get the basic concepts and the real difficulty comes with the huge amount of content the game has to offer: nations, gods, spells, units, items, management, customization... And this is something you will learn with time.\n\nMagic is really great. It goes from tiny fireballs to huge spells that can make the entire map goes into an eternal night or spread diseases worldwide. So magic is not just an alternative to normal weaponry or armors; magic can completely change the fate of the events.\n\nI won't go deep into nations, becuse there are like 60? 70? But you'll find tons of them based on old civilizations and mythology: Roman empire (with undead version on a certain era), a mix between Spain and France heavily based on Inquisition, germanic barbarians, nordic giants, fire creatures, a chinese nation, a japanese one with demons from japanese folklore, nations with monkeys, spiders, fishes, shrimps, fucking crabs, squids, winged beigns, demons, trolls, dragons, eagles, dawgs, wolves, direwolves, hobbits... blablabla, tons of nations all of them with extremely different units and gameplay.\n\nGraphics are for sure paleolithic-school, but somehow it makes a better experience for me, as it creates a nice true RPG experience, kind of reading a book.\n\nAnd lets not forget the crazy situations that may happen during a game: an entire army out of place because your bard was flirting with their commander, a game you are about to win when your prophet is about to claim a throne but then he dies when it's about to reach it because of pestilence or a broken limb, a commander sent to some important mission suddenly finds a frog and adopts it as pet, a battle between Dracula vs Cthulhu because... why not.\n\nPS: I still have no fucking idea how to play this game, but I'm having a blast.", "timestamp_created": 1494203355, "timestamp_updated": 1494241589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706625", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31579374": {"recommendationid": "31579374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000619523", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 8739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494726057}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu est une pure merveille de fond, malheureusement desservi par une interface pourrie. Considerez le comme un Total War hardcore (ou le mod Fall from heaven de civ4 pour les  vieux baroudeurs) mais les batailles se font en auto, on se contente de scripter ces escouades.\n\nTout d'abord, le monde est divis\u00e9 en r\u00e9gion et chaque civilisation commence avec sa capitale et une petite arm\u00e9e, le reste \u00e9tant control\u00e9 par les neutres qu'il faudra chass\u00e9, sachant qu'il y en a des tonnes de differend, du simple bandit hobbit qu'on \u00e9clate au groupe d'amazone \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 vampire qui m'envoyait des arm\u00e9es de squelettes et m'a bien fait galerer. Chaque r\u00e9gion produit des unit\u00e9s differentes, et est sujette \u00e0 de nombreux facteurs (froid/chaud, bonus/malus en or/ressources etc); elle peux cacher des sites magiques que vos mages devront trouver.\n\nEn d\u00e9but de partie, vous choisissez une civilisation parmis la bonne vingtaine (!) disponible, chacune ayant un background, une religion et un type de jeu differend. Ca va des l\u00e9zards type azteques qui font des sacrifices pour \u00e9tendre leur religion, aux japonais qui se sont alli\u00e9s avec des d\u00e9mons, aux atlantides qui vivent uniquement dans l'eau, \u00e0 ceux qui volent en passant par les bons vieux necromanciens-elfes-romain-grec-viking-etc... enfin vous avez le choix et c'est pas juste pour le skin! Ensuite vous choisissez et personnaliser votre Dieu, qui sera physiquement pr\u00e9sent dans le monde. Un arbre incapable de bouger mais maitre en magie? Un mage de guerre ou un general? Une machine \u00e0 forger? L\u00e0 encore vous choisissez! Et enfin vous personnalisez votre religion, qui influence les r\u00e9gions ou elle se trouve. et encore une fois c'est personnalisable: plus de ressources, de population, ou alors plus de magie pour booster la recherche etc...  \n\nVoil\u00e0 avec tout \u00e7a vous mettez autant de temps \u00e0 cr\u00e9er votre civ que de faire un perso sur un RPG. Et autant on peut faire des builds p\u00e9t\u00e9s, autant l'IA aussi et franchement c'est la premi\u00e8re fois qu'une IA m'inquiete tellement on sait jamais \u00e0 quoi s'attendre avec eux.\n\nLe vif du sujet, la magie. Il y'a 8 magies differentes, et de t\u00eate 8 \u00e9coles aussi pour un total de 150 sorts, voir plus, qui seront accessibles grace \u00e0 la recherche. invocation/heal/buff/aoe/teleportation tout y est mais aussi des mega sorts genre eclipse, peste sur une r\u00e9gion, maphack, faire pop des arm\u00e9es de nulle part... Le probleme c'est que c'est tr\u00e8s mal foutu et c'est une gal\u00e8re de savoir quelle \u00e9cole de magie recherch\u00e9 actuellement d\u00e9bloquera CE sort. Tout \u00e7a marche avec des gemmes que des sites magiques fourniront. Ces derniers sont cach\u00e9s et neccessite que des mages lance des sorts de recherche. Il y a aussi un systeme de crafting magique, chaque heros ou mage pouvant porter un arsenal complet allant de l'\u00e9p\u00e9e +1 au bateau magique permettant de faire voler toute une arm\u00e9e... M\u00eame constat, difficile de pr\u00e9voir ce que l'on va pouvoir faire.\n\nEnfin les 2 GROS points noirs: Diplomatie et interface. \nLa diplomatie est inexistante. Le joueur d'Europa que je suis en pleure des larmes de sang. Vous \u00eates en paix tant que l'un n'attaque pas l'autre. Une fois les hostilit\u00e9s commenc\u00e9es c'est jusqu'\u00e0 la mort. point. POINT! Y'a m\u00eame pas d'\u00e9cran qui fait un topo des autres civ, \u00e0 part des graphiques (que l'on voit gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un sort, sympa). La seule fa\u00e7on de les connaitre c'est de les combattre.\nL'interface. C'est pas qu'elle est mal foutue, mais elle est 75% clavier. J'ai jou\u00e9 30h avant de voir un \"tips\": appuyer sur \"n\" pour selectionner le prochain perso inactif. Sans cette touche j'aurai stopp\u00e9 le jeu, vu qu'il y a aucun \u00e9cran de type liste des heros/provinces. Y'a plein de chose que l'on peut faire facilement, mais faut savoir que c'est du \"shift+J en laissant le curseur de la souris dessus\" ou autre delire.\n\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, super jeu que je recommande chaudement. Comptez une vingtaine d'heures de jeu pour comprendre la b\u00eate, plus quelques unes pour le manuel de 300 pages (anglais, tout comme le jeu) et ensuite regardez votre civilisation au caract\u00e8re unique marcher sur le monde, massacrant tous c...

However there are times where as a player it can be frustrating trying to understand what certain things do. Indeed there are scenarios that crop up that confuse veterans of the game now and again.\n\nA quick pros, mos and cons\nPros:\nMassive customisation available in god creation stage\nStrategies can be altered mid-game\nCute graphics for different units, and there are many of them\nNations feel very unique, they all have their own niches, and there are many of them.\nGame devs still adapt the game even after all this time.\nRandomisation in map creation leads to unique game scenarios\n\nMos: (neither a pro or a con but something I think a new player must know, must know = mo)\n_Battles are scripted beforehand, you cannot interact with them while they are in progress. But you can watch the replay and learn from your mistakes or successes.\n_God creation is important, if you pick a bad set of scales before the game properly starts you could find yourself in a difficult situation with no way to escape the situation. Don't be afraid to start a few test games to make sure exactly what plan you have in mind for the units you will be working with.\n_Not all spells are equal. Especially when considering the variety of unit types. Some spells don't work underwater, some don't affect mindless, undead and some simply cannot be cast without communions or blood slaves. \n\nCons:\nGraphics are super dated, although they're very cute for what they are. \nSound effects can be a little loud at times. Snakes and archers have the sound dialled up to 11.\nInformation overload is a big problem. Guides are a must. I would recommend watching a playthrough. \nInformation availability can be a problem too. Sometimes there are questions I have that simply bring up no search results.\nThe sheer variety of nations and spells and units can be a challenge to keep in mind.\nDue to the massive variance in the nations and starting conditions game balance may not always be ideal.\nUnderwater combat can feel a bit limited in variety and some underwater nations do require a bit of game experience before attempting to play. \n\nRandom babble:\nThings like figuring out encumberance (spell/melee encumberence is a big deal), what curses do and how important reinvigoration is can trip you up. For instance units with \"cold blooded\" fighting in cold climates suffer an encumberance penalty when fighting in cold terrain, to the point where in very cold climates these units are a liability.\nOr if you click on the \"Morale\" in the unit card this brings up the unit upkeep, which is how much the unit costs per year. Kind of a big deal when figuring out why a unit costs a certain amount. This vital info is just tucked away under a little word.\nOr that Undead seem great right? high morale (basically unbreakable), no upkeep and can go underwater...riiight up until you hit an enemy who uses priests, then all those undead summons get banished into nothing. One size does not fit all. (However with the right build you can totally make undead nations work. Watch out for multiplayer with them though, due to their dominion killing population other players generally want to kill them quick)\n\nThis is a game of layers. Once you figure out one layer a dozen more lie beneath. However once you figure out ideal paths for your god, scripts for unit combat, what gear you need and research goals the game is fairly straightforward. The rest comes down to good old fashioned strategy, (depending on if you play multiplayer or singleplayer this will differ significantly).\n\nDue to how much you have to micomanage everything your strategy can change quite drastically and thanks to the  massive number of spells available you will be able to adapt how you play. The rest comes down to how much time you have to spare.\n\nThe game really shines in how you use your mages and thugs. Also not all Gods (or Pretender gods) are equal, some are designed to be combat monsters from turn 1, others are designed to support your nation from behind the curtain while other still lie imprisoned waiting for the time to come into the world. There are valid reasons to use each of them. \n\nIt's a God game of god games, you control everything and yet when the battles come all you can do is watch. It can be very rewarding watching all that time you spend preparing scripts for your units come together at just the right moment.\n\nFor all that it's not a difficult game, it really isn't. It's just a matter of having the time spare to learn what you need to know.

As much as I love this game, I would recommend waiting to buy that, since they added a lot of improvements to the game. It's basically gonna be a straight upgrade to Dominions 4. [url=http://www.illwinter.com/dom5/] Here's the link... [/url]\n\nIn Dominions 4, you play a pretender god who has risen up to claim the spot of Pantokrator, after the last one dissapeared for reasons unknown. There are others however who wish to take that spot, and only whoever proves themselves the most worthy will take the place as the god above all gods!\n\nDominions 4 is a grand strategy game with a few interesting twists. First of all, you are a god, and as gods are, you need worship to survive and become the one true god! Second of all, unlike other grand strategy games, you don't give orders to troops directly during combat. You give them a set of orders and tactics to use when combat begins, as if you were commanding an actual army of troops. Finally, magic is a ever-present necessity in any age, and a great deal of magic requires the use of magic gems. Magic gems are an incredibly compressed form of magic, and even a single one can unleash a great deal of power to an experienced mage.\n\nPros:\n+ Customizability allows for a variety of different playstyles for each nation.\n+ 75 nations to play, if you count all three ages.\n+ Has a modding community supported by the devs.\n+ Has a great depth of strategy, coupled with a large library of spells to bolster any tactics you choose.\n+ Great deal of replayability, since only a few nations are identical to each other, and the ones that are is intentional.\n\nCons:\n- The learning curve is quite steep, but there's a manual to help on their website. It's about 100 pages long, but the vast majority is just listing artifacts and spells.\n- Can get very tedious with alotting magic gems and artifacts to units each turn.\n- Games tend to be very long, and on very large maps, a turn can take upwards of 15 minutes.\n\nVerdict: The price is a bit high, but if you're a fan of the grand strategy genre, and want some fantasy to spice up your library, this is a great game!", "timestamp_created": 1486571768, "timestamp_updated": 1508374995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29751677": {"recommendationid": "29751677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012849649", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503753032}, "language": "english", "review": "Play it now.", "timestamp_created": 1486425147, "timestamp_updated": 1486425147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29744411": {"recommendationid": "29744411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106536334", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501628453}, "language": "english", "review": "Would pay this for the soundtrack alone, the amazing game bursting with content is a nice bonus.\n\nif you learn it and singleplayer seems lackluster find some mates and convince them to buy and learn it and you will see multiplayer is where this game truly shines", "timestamp_created": 1486398658, "timestamp_updated": 1486398658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29698557": {"recommendationid": "29698557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062282873", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481925177}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bon jeu de gestion/strat\u00e9gie.

Actually, the sprites are really nice, but since there's no animation at all, I have to admit that the game is not a delice to the eyes.\n- Lots of text, and it's all in english. The first half of this con is actually not really a con since you can play the game perfectly well without reading most of it. Also, it could even be considered as a pro, since this text is often very poetic and inspiring - it's all about myths, cultures, and metaphysics. The second half of this con, obviously, is only a con if you're bad at english, which you're probably not if you're reading this.\n- Very very complex game. Actually not a con, since it also means that there's a lot to learn and do before feeling like you know this game very well. However, be aware of the fact that you'll be pretty much lost about most of the game for a long time. You'll still be able to have a lot of fun with it.\n- No music. There's one on the game menu, and it's nice, but since it's the only music in the game, you'll disable it very quickly.\n\nAnd that's all. Yup, that's not much. I guarantee you one thing: if you don't mind too much these points and like turn-based strategy games and mythology, you'll definitely love this.\n\nThis game is a real treasure. A true independant game, made by two people alone, and yet extremely deep and interesting. I have more than 100 hours in the game at this time, and I still consider myself a beginner. There are something like 50 playable nations. Most of them have real gameplay differences (they're not copies with slight quirks like in Age of Empires for example), some of them even bending the rules of the game. All of them are very inspired and original.\n\nYou can play a lovecraftian nation, the roman empire, the UNDEAD roman empire, byzantium, the tuatha de danann of celtic mythology, the knights of the round table, giants of jewish and mesopotamian mythology, weird and creepy beings that live under the earth with psionic olms, a greek philosopher's kingdom, a greek philosopher's kingdom-that's-undead-and-doesn't-know-it, vampires, inquisitors, egyptian lizardmen, mermaids, at least three different kinds of vikings and their giants, zoroastrian angels, japanese demons, wise sentient monkeys, etc, etc, etc. And in each case, you customize your god (you) with an incredible number of possibilities.\n\nThe amount of content in this game is tremendous. Also, it is being updated very frequently and sometimes even receives new nations. All of this for free. Yup, no DLC at all. And it's heavily modable. And once you've tried everything in solo, you still have a whole new layer of strategy to discover with multiplayer games.\n\nAs /vg/ says, \"it's an autist\u2019s wet dream of a war game\".

In Hearts of Iron, you have thousands of things to think about. In order to make your life easier you are spammed by messages that you can carefully select on: to they pause game or not, is it shown in a separate square or just in the corner as a report. \n\nIt's EXACTLY the same thing in Dominion except that you are given very few information on what is happening.

I like not having the right of missing something if I want to win.\n\nI'll give you an example of my first game:\n\n\nMy empire is strong, well defended. No roaming armies. Strongholds near the bridges and mountain passes. Very cool.\n\nI'm at war with my neightbore. I gather 3 strong armies and start a grand campaign in order to invade it's major cities.\n\nAnd at one point. BHAM! A general has been killed by a spy. Army scatters. Enemy armies hunt them down and consolidate to counterattack my two other armies. And I lose...\n\n\nOK COOOOOOL. Next time I'll provide spies to my armies.\n\n2 hours of gameplay later. I gather 3 strong armies. Fully equiped heroes and my pretender God commanding another; Each army is followed by several spies. Not only their are followed by spies but equally spies are ahead in order to scout the territory.\n\nOn ONE SIGNLE F****G turn I forgot to move the spy along with the general and on that very specific turn, the general is killed by an enemy spy. Distructing my entire campaign...\n\n\nThis is starting to be annoying. Because, as I mentionned in the comment and uphere the tools you have in hand are extremely limited in comparison to what is asked to you.\n\nIt's really like playing Civilization (way less deep than Dominions) but with almost no help at all concerning the actions you are doing:\n- auto movement for example is missing\n- you can see a list of heroes but you can't quickly see their gear or assess the situation in which they are. There is visually and information-wise nothing at all that allows you to do this (and I don't want to hear \"use F1\")\n\nBy making those very simple things, the experience would clearly be enriched. \n\nAnd some other things too that do not require any further development:\n\n- use colors instead of flags to delimit each and every one empire. Sometimes flags are too similar. It's already an overwhelming game, why not making things more userfriendly?\n\nI mean.. Is it on purpose or what? I have the impression developers in this game said during their brainstorming meetings \"So you know what? No colors!! Let's put an additional flag on a already over-filled of pixels and information region (with fate, with armies, with temples, with threes etc) so that the player needs extra focus!!!!! It will a pain for him to conceptualize the size and borders of it's empire!!! Hahahahah\"\n\n- use something nicer to provide the player with a quick look on the map of where are the heroes. Make them pop-up more clearly for god sake!!! F1 screen is useless... You anyway need to go over every single of your Hero to see: where he is on the Campaign map, what is the situation around him, what he is doing and if he is doing the good thing etc.\n\nWouldn't it be better for example to use Sliders for heroes and leave the arrows on the screen so that you can assess all your orders and you can quickly see the stuff? \"No no no no it would be too nice to provide this to the player.\"\n\n\nThese are very small examples on how exhausting this game can be on larger scales. So imagine you need every single turn to:\n- go over about 20 to 40 events (battles, regional occupation, spells casted etc)\n- go over every of your hero to see: is the gear ok? Are the troops situation ok? Where he is? Where are it's spy colleagues? Are the spies doing to good thing? \n- go over every of your city to see: are the heroes summoning the good creatures? Are they researching? are they iddle? etc\n- go over your entire map to see: any roaming army? am I losing fate? \n- I created a new army: provide orders to the general, provide formation for every troop, provide a stance to every troop.\n\nAnd about 20 other things.\n\nAnd do this every turn.\n\nAnd a single game is counted in several hundreds of turns.\n\nMake a single mistale, forget to do one thing once and you're nearly screwed. Another example: for the 100'th time you gave all your armies the correct plannings for the battle, but once, you forgot to say to the general to stay behind the troops. Ooooops!! Too bad for you!!! The general went in suicide mission alone because you forgot to activate the correct stance.\n\nAnd this kind of mistake will happen because, I don't know about you, but I'm NOT a VBA Macro. I'm a human being that will forget something...\n\nThere are too many things to do manually all the time. And all the time the same things you'll do a countless number of times just to conceptualize the empire situation. THAT IS NOT OK!!! Empire situation, as in any other game, should be clear at the FIRST sight... And only once the situation is assessed then the player can dig into the various possibilities at hand... It's NOT OK having to do the same things over and over just to understand what the situation is... Assessing the general situation should be effortless... But it's clearly not. So if such a basic thing is already requiring an effort since you don't see s**t on the map imagine the titanesque effort needed to assess the details...\n\n\n\nTo the developpers, make something to make life easier. Still as punishing, still the same number of things you need to think about, but make it less overwhelming. Provide standard Army templates a player can save and then use after creating an army / before a battle or like a reminder: \"are you ok with your battle stance?\"\n\nAnother hint: it's turn based but why not, like any other 4X, during enemy turn: show the armies moving? Show a spy has been spotted? This way the player would conceptualize more quickly the situation. No no no. You don't see s**t about anything and you just have to read a bible size report of everything that happened instead...\n\nAgain: no no no!!! such things would be too helpful or what????\n\nThings like this and this game would redefine, without improving the graphics, the 4X genre... \n\n\nAnd to potential buyers: this was my warning.

Recruit troops, set formations and unit orders, move army into neighbouring provinces.  You do not control the battles themselves, you can only watch the battles to see if your orders worked or not and adjust your orders for next time.  Rinse and repeat.  Your build options are castles (allow recruitment of national troops in province \u2013 otherwise limited to the usually poor natives), temples (spread your faith \u2013 prereq to recruit holy units) and labs (prereq to mage recruitment, allow research, magic item forging and rituals in the province).   \n\nThis game does not have a learning curve.  It's a learning minefield.  This charming game looks deceptively simple but it's subtleties and complexities hide underfoot ready to trip you up, especially as magic research progresses and options open up and the game shows it's true colours and depth.  \n\nThere's an asymmetry to the game as the nations can play very differently, with 20+ nations in each era  (3 era's) giving lots of options of play styles.  For a new player it can be a bit daunting and it will take a while to find which nations you find fun but there should be a few in each era to suit.    \n\n\nA good game for single player, a great game for PBEM multi-player.  The biggest flaw in this game is the AI cannot handle all the complexities of the magic system, either to use it against you or to counter your own gambits.  Trade is non-existent and diplomacy is limited to either the AI is attacking you or not.  Still, you'll still get enough mileage out of single player to make this a worthwhile purchase but be warned, once you've played multi-player it's hard to go back.

Players are tasked with leading one of the game's many, many factions to victory in a couple of different game modes that all boil down to \"defeat all enemies and paint the map your colour\".\nIn this way the game, like Risk, is very simple. You take over and occupy provinces that you can use to generate soldiers to build into armies. Contrary to Risk however, fights are not won with static dice, but through simulations where fights between armies plays out based on unit composition, mages on the battlefield, or the positioning of the soldiers, all available to the player to organize. After a simulation starts, players lose control of the army, and it follows any instructions its components are given. This takes some getting used to, but emphasises the planning phase of wargames that has taken a backseat to directly controlled combat popularized in the current climate of hard and fast macro oriented games, even among non turn based grand strategy titles like contemporary Total Wars or the crop of RTS available that follows the entertaining-to-watch format of Starcraft 2.\nNothing wrong with such energetic gamestyles! Variety is the spice of life, and Dominion's spice is old and venerable, slow paced and strategic to the hard and fast tactics above. Be advised though, if you are looking to command the armies in person, Dominions would fail you.\n\nWhere it will not fail however is in the lore department. As mentioned previously the game sports what many dare call the most varied set of people and factions available in any strategy game in existance! Dominions 4 sports a cast made up of mostly unaltered figures (gameifies of course, and some original faces are brought to bear) and beings stemming from the imaginative real world mythologies around the globe. This makes factions varied and plentiful, further exasperated by the sheer ammount of optional but plentiful information that has been appropriated from myth to everything from individual characters to unit types, or the factions themselves.\nThese factions are organized into three separated time periods, chosable at the beginning of game-setup that serves the dual purpose of varying each game in terms of playstyles and factions available, and also -cleverly enough- as the game's meta plot. The three eras are separated so as to allow for the passing of time to be implied to take place between them, meaning that descriptions of factions found in the lore, will change between eras.\nSome factions will change over time, radically in some cases. Others will split or dissapear completely, being present perhaps only at the dawn of the game's timeline or emerging later on only to get snuffed out, during implied conflicts (IE the games you play!) or from internal strife. Others still remain intact from the passing of time, with blurb describing how they made it through each eras rather than how it all crumbled underneath them. It feels truly epic to read about the factions and see how they change or gets destroyed, and overall this ominous method of story telling, while as passive as the game's combat, is really what makes you fall in love with the game. It is truly unique and really does make it feel as if you are part of a vast, age long struggle between ancient civilizations and their even older gods. \n\nYou are one such god. Did i mention that? \nYou are represented in game by a fully customizeble borderline-divine being looking to step it up a notch and assume the right of rule over all of creation. Power is excerted through the titular \"dominion\" translated to domain power, spread by your followers and priests, but you can also participate (still in a non-controllable fashion) in combat as a force of nature (think movie-Sauron) a tempestuous mage, or a benevolent buffer. As with the factions, godly archetypes are taken from authentic myths both in terms of gameified kit and in game lore, and you can play both as great beasts or ambitious wizards to more conventional divinities, all of which further diversifying the way you play your faction.\n\n\nGames such as this, with cluncky UIs and crappy graphics are perfect for \"making your own fun\" or creating interesting story threads (think Crusader Kings II or Dwarf Fortress!). And given the amount of lore and the underlying ominous note to your excursions into it, Dominions 4 tickles the imagination and succeeds in providing the fantasy of world shaking struggle between pretender gods!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1480065856, "timestamp_updated": 1480065856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27406321": {"recommendationid": "27406321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072284660", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 15981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504332337}, "language": "english", "review": "My personal favorite play style is to equip an army of Giants with the best magical gear possible and watch 5 of them beat armys of hundreds", "timestamp_created": 1480062615, "timestamp_updated": 1480062615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27379559": {"recommendationid": "27379559", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977615752", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505361063}, "language": "english", "review": "A game where you can read an 80 page manual and not even begin to understand it.

Main drawback is a very steep learning curve that can be helped by having people to talk to about it that already know how to play. Another way to get into the game is an excellent new gamemode called disciples where you play on the same team. Other than that I would say that you have to put in quite a lot of hours training with AI and trying to figure things out to get anything done in the multiplayer which in my mind is the actual game, while the AI are just there to try things out fast or get into the game ( I guess it is more or less the same for other 4x games too though). Finding multiplayer games can take a bit of doing also, especially if you want one with rules tailored to your taste. You might very well have to end up waiting a few months for one to start unless you host one yourself. If you are a beginner I wouldn't advice on doing that since I've seen several games suffer greatly the host doing strange things.\n\nTLDR\n\nPros\n-More content than you can ever want.\n-No seriously you will certainly get bored of this game before you have to play the same nation again not to mention that same nation that have so many different builds. I have played this game for 350 hours and so far done a game with less than 10% of the factions.\n-Make your nation, customize and plan so much that no two nations are alike (unless you take a build from forums?).\n-Epic matches that last for a long time.\n\nCons\n-Epic matches that last for a long time. Can get irritating if you know you have lost and want to get out of the game or perhaps you got a holiday coming up and need to do turns with a laptop (other solutions exist too).\n-Epic learning curve, I don't think anyone truly knows everything about the game. Certainly not the developers at least.\n\nIn closing. Play for fun as the game is far from perfectly balanced. Multiplayer diplomacy is the main thing keeping the balance up. Don't be the guy always jumping on the same strong faction.

You will need a sound understanding of the Magic Paths (hundreds of spells), your God design will determine if you're an early game nation with a Dragon rampaging through hordes of unprepared half-naked barbarians, or a late game nation with an old but powerful Crone biding his time in his cell, carefully planning research and assembling around you some of the most powerful magic users in the land.\n\nI must warn you : If you come aboard, there's no turning back.

Then it went on sale one day and I took the plunge, and I haven't looked back since.\n\nDominions 4 is a turn-based strategy game about warring nations each ruled by a mythological entity (titan, monster, wizard, etc) that is trying to become a god.  In the most commonly played game mode, this is accomplished by capturing a certain number of Thrones which are scattered around the map.  In addition to granting victory points, each throne also gives some kind of bonus to your nation when you claim it.\n\nThere are dozens of different nations to choose from, and while the diversity keeps things interesting, balance seems to have unfortunately been a secondary consideration, and some nations are really better than others.  Once a nation is chosen, the next step is to create your pretender, the previously mentioned creature that's trying to become a god.  Each nation has a dozen or more pretender options to choose from that fit that nation's theme.  So nations with a Norse theme can choose pretenders like frost giants or giant serpents, while Greco-Roman nations get a variety of different titans and monsters like the Manticore.  Each pretender is also highly customizable, and how you build your pretender can have an enormous impact on how you play the game.\n\nOnce the game actually starts, turns consist of recruiting units from the territories you control and sending them out to conquer more territory.  Which sounds simple, and even seems simple when you first start playing.  But soon you realize there's a TON of strategic depth to this game.  When you tell your units to attack a province, you don't control the battle directly.  Instead, you issue the orders that you want your units to follow during the battle before the battle starts.  So you might tell your frontline sword-and-shield infantry to take up a line formation at the front of the battlefield, hold position for the first two turns of combat, and then advance on the enemy, while your archers stay behind with orders to fire on any flying enemies that appear, for example.\n\nYou also recruit mages to perform your research and cast all your spells.  There are literally hundreds of spells to research, which creates untold opportunities for play and counterplay - like I said, strategic depth.  Again, balance doesn't seem to have been a primary focus here, and the fact is that many spells are rarely if ever actually used in competitive games, but it's always interesting to encounter spells you haven't seen before, or familiar spells used in new ways.\n\nBottom line: if you're a fan of complex turn-based strategy games and don't mind a steep learning curve, Dominions is as good as it gets.  I started out playing single player exclusively, which is fine if that's what you're into or just looking to learn the ropes, but multiplayer is where this game really shines in my opinion.  I would be remiss if I didn't point out the game's flaws as well, which include the general lack of balance I've mentioned before, the frankly unimpressive graphics, and a UI that often leaves much to be desired.  That said, the good outweighs the bad here, and while the normal price point might be a little high given the lack of polish, I highly recommend grabbing this game when it's on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1477211581, "timestamp_updated": 1478633236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26153154": {"recommendationid": "26153154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017127434", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 12184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513615193}, "language": "english", "review": "Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 + Hearts of Iron 2.  \nMassive Manual, no trifle matter.\nMorale, production, campaigning, transport, order, fertility, temperature, research, casting, summoning...\n4x for the fantasy geeks.  \nFavorite game right now.

Crush other would-be gods with your armies, one turn at a time. Ignore the graphics.\n\nLong version:\nDominions 4 has come a loooooong way.\nThe Dominions series has evolved, and its forth iteration boils down to the exact same core mechanics as each of its predecessors. This is not a bad thing.\nLet me elaborate:\nAs for the Background and story: The former \u00dcBER-God, called the \"Pantocrator\", is dead. And now the position is up for grabs by the rising gods, like You! But, lots of \"Pretender Gods\" claim godhod for themselfes and like you, they have marshalled a whole Nation to do their bidding.\n\nTraditionally, you recruit armies, and supplement that with powerful combat magics to decimate enemey armies and conquer their provinces. Add to that that your mages may also perform powerful rituals out of combat to do anything from summoning strong monsters to make everyone in the world age at the rate of a year a month. Watch them wither and die.\nDominions 4 has other Victory options to supplement the traditional \"Conquer all\" approach. Several strategies are possible for most Victory conditions.\n\nBreaking down the Game in Pro's and Con's\nPRO: Depth\nThe amount of material to go through is amazing. There are, literally, hundreds of different spells and rituals that can be researched and wielded by your mages. The amount of different troops availible to you ranges typically a dozen and more, not including summonend monsters. And the number of Factions you can choose is currently about 60, I think.\n\nPRO: Replayability\nNot only are there a ton of factions you can play, and they all play differently, but also many factions allow for different strategies. \"Hmm, Marignon focused on troops was good, but what if I use fire magic instead...\"\nAlso, Depending on the size of the map used, the game plays totally different. \n\nPRO: Multiplayer\nMultiple variants are supported. From traditional \"Play by mail\" and hotseat to direct connection to a server.\nSingle player can be considered \"training wheels\" for multiplayer, since this is where you will find the challenging plays.\n\nCON: Graphics\nThey are bad. Old-timey at best. They also have evolved a lot and look way better than Dominions 3, but are not on par with current releases of major triple A titles.\n\nPRO: Mods.\nSo many. So many. Toooooo many. Simple mods can tweak a Faction or a few troops. But total conversion mods exist too. And they add variety to NO END.\n\nCON: User Interface\nThe user interface is subject to current optimization. Playing the game without keyboard shortcuts is feasible, but it gets tedious. You will be thinking \"Why can't I order my mage to forge the same magic item every turn?\", you can, but only if you know or look up the keyboard shortcut.\n\nMy conclusion is: As a hardcore strategy game fan, you should give it a try. If you consider yourself a \"casual\" gamer, this game probably will not be for you.", "timestamp_created": 1474620497, "timestamp_updated": 1474620497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25600854": {"recommendationid": "25600854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126278109", "num_games_owned": 1620, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501419284}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best strategic games you can find in Steam, and my all-time favorite. There is only a couple of insignificant flaws, and I will be short about them. First flaw is graphics, obviously, if you want to see beautiful picture, Dominions is not an eye-candy game. Second flaw is micromanagement, it may be quite tedious to play on huge map with a lot of provinces and opponents. Well, it is always hard to control a vast empire, is not it?\n\nAnd what is good in this game? Well... everything else. Dominions offers a huge amount of content and deep, well-designed and balanced mechanics. By other side, it is not hard to learn basics, Dominions is one of these games that \"easy to learn but hard to master\". You may gather an army and send it to conquer neighbours in just a couple of clicks... and then realise, that you need to think about strategy.\n\nI absolutely loved all playable nations, they are not typical boring \"elves, dwarves and orcs\", but thoroughly developed groups, based on myths and cultures from all around the world - from celtic myths to slavic folklore, from african stories to chinese legends. Game offers wonderful lore, and it was really interesting for me to explore it.\n\nCustomization offers a lot of choices, it has a huge impact and also provides wide capabilities to roleplay, if you want to. Do you want to rule a scorched land of sloth and misfortune? Maybe you prefer frozen realm full of magic and mineral resources? Or lush green paradise with rich fields and bountiful harvests? And how about your avatar, will it be a huge dormant dragon, or ancient powerful lich, or even a marble statue smeared with blood of sacrificed virgins? And all this customization is not just cosmetic changes, it has a huge impact on gameplay and, in fact, determines your possible ways to victory.\n\nEconomic system is simple and effective. You need to manage three types of resources: gold, production and gems, used for most powerful spells, troops and creation of artifacts. There is no penalties for territorial expansion, so Dominions is true heaven for conquerors. The more provinces you control - the more resources you will have, so expansion is absolutely necessary for victory.\n\nBattles are interesting and quite unusual. You can not control your troops directly, but you may plan, how your squads must act and what you expect from them to do. Planning the battle, placing troops and choosing what spells your wizards may cast, is vital part of game, and you really need to think and develop your tactic and strategy. And when it comes to magic... game really shines there, lots of schools and tons of spells, and again you really need to think, what and when you need to use. Easy to learn, hard to master, as I mentioned before.\n\nAI is decent. For me it was interesting enough to play on medium difficulty, of course AI can not be compared with human, but he actively resists, collects armies and punishes player for mistakes. And if you want challenge, you can always try hard difficulty or, maybe, join multiplayer... if you can find another players.\n\nMain thing that Dominions can offer is huge replayability. So many combinations, I am sure that you will not get bored soon. So. You love turn-based strategic games and still did not tried Dominions? I sincerely recommend this game for you then.

I have only really played it as single player, but I find that it offers a heck of a lot of replay and depth to it.  Don't let the old style of graphics turn you from this game, it is incredible.  While the AI is far from perfect, it is still solid and the depth of strategy is beyond basic explanation.  Take combat, for example.\n\nYou build up an army, you can tell the men what squad they are in, and where that squad will start.  From there, you can give a SINGLE basic order to the squad and that is it.  The order can be Fire (target type, which does NOT include leaders), Hold and Attack (wait two turns then attack target type), and similar.  But that is it, the rest is out of your hand.  Your leader you have slightly more control over, able to give orders for the first five turns through script like commands set up with the armuy (such as cast a certain spell, hold or cast, etc.).  And since it is required to be done before you go into combat, once combat starts, you can only watch it play out, no Total War controls here.\n\nThere is NO diplomacy in single player, that is a big downside for me.  The computer though does seem to recognize when you are at war with them, which is nice.  You attack their lands and they will fight and attack you, otherwise they seem to leave you alone (until you are their next target).  Kill their pretender and they won't stop attacking until they are destroyed.  No trading, no NAPs, nothing of that nature, but still, it is a remake of an old game.\n\nReplayability is incredibly high.  There are three ages (High Magic, High Human, and inbetween) each with their own races avaliable.  Each race, unlike some games that are simple reskins, are very different in play.  Some are high magic focused, even for the high magic age, while others rely on mythical creatures or humans blessed by their god.

Even the same race over the different ages play differently, and some races simply don't exist in certain ages, just to show the type of race they are.\n\nOverall, its an incredibly addicting game, active community, and lots of fun.

I waited for a special to buy it and at 60% off it's definitely worth the money.\n\nI wouldn't compare it to Civ. It feels more like Rome Total War during the grand campaign mode but it gives me some Warlords 2 nostalgia feel too. There's a lot of depth to it and the different factions do handle very differently, which is great. The differences go beyond just combat and units and there's a LOT of factions so we're spoilt for choice in this game.\n\nAll conflicts are automatically resolved for you, but you get to organise your troops into batallions and tell each batallion how it's meant to behave. For example, you can organise a line of infantry which is meant to advance towards the enemy, a line of archers that follows behind and shoots, and cavalry on the sides which flank. Morale is a big deal and if your troops rout then the battle is certainly lost.\n\nSo unlike in Total War where you have to micromanage everything, there's no micromanagement in this. You have to plan in advance and hope for the best.\n\nI think if you enjoy Total War's grand campaigns then you're probably going to enjoy this.\n\nEdit: After more time with this game, I would buy it at full price.

That you [b]will[/b] need to read... Or see lots of youtube videos... You won't even be able to [b]start playing[/b] without that.\n\n*And* you probably will have to play the game with lots of spreadsheets by your side to become good at it... Yes, yes:[u][b]MATH[/b][/u]... [u][b]TABLES[/b][/u] .\n\nSo, are you still reading this? Ok, then: let me talk about the good:\n\nIt is clear to me: the devs have disregarded almost everything that makes a modern game to be considered 'good' and instead focused on having a game with *really deep* folkloric roots, picking on lots of myths ever imagined by humanity, and a very complex, deeply thought-about game mechanics. \n\nWhen I play this game, I unexplicably feel like reading a Tolkien book... And feel the urge to enter the wikipedia to know more about the myths the game is based on. There are many layers of game mechanics in this game, so you can always become surprised (and sometimes infuriated, I reckon) with something new. Until you go to back to that *f* manual, and then gets that 'Oh! Of course!' feel, and the urge to slap yourself in the face... And this is one of the strongest points of this game: The game mechanics are all there, in that big manual. There is nothing really hidden, it is only stashed somewhere inside it. (Or, sometimes, in some game hints in game).  Unlike many strategy games that hides the crappy mechanics they have based the game upon behind health bars, or cute graphics... \n\nThe game options are overwhelming: it mixes religion-based myths with lots of magic, a complex and RPG-like promotion system that I'm only beginning to grasp, and researching spells... The game tactics are deep, very complex: It is surprising me all the time: units *age*, get crippled, blinded;  there is ritual magic, crafting, human sacrifices for blood magic... Commanders become heroes in fame, can receive magical equipment, and some equipments may even be needed to actually win the game... Or not! Because every single faction is completely unique. And can be made even more unique depending on a very deep \"leader\" customization...\n\nUnless I discover, as I play the game for more time, that there is *the* shortcut around all these rules and complexities, I can say this game is something of almost infinite replay value... To tell you the truth I can't even play more than a few turns before wanting to start over and try something different with this game... And every time I restart lots of what I've learned is thrown away: the new random faction I've got appears to demand a completely different strategy ... Because there is land factions, sea factions, factions with ranged units, factions *without* ranged units, factions that demands lots of magic, factions that favors absurd strength in numbers... or not. You may discover that that army of 200 little monkeys with bows that you have amassed in a few turns do not make even a dent at that army of 10 heavy cavalry... But, hey... what if I turn those little monkeys into zombies some turns later? Oh, c*p... I've just chosen a leader with no death magic... Ok, ok, let's restart the game *yet again*... And now I've started with with a chinese lore based faction... Or the fabled city of Ur that have only very expensive, strong units in the army... Hm... how many monkeys do I need to kill an Ur Guard?? Let's go back to the *f* manual... And make some spredsheets , and some simulations.... \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1472779683, "timestamp_updated": 1472779683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score":

I only wish I had discovered it earlier than I did. I am not going to describe the game here but would rather explain why I consider this one of my favorite games of all time. Here are the three greatest strengths that I am compelled to highlight: high replayability, choice driven game play with consequential outcomes, and an excellent system for managing a complex combat system. The game is not perfect but the drawbacks are easily overlooked if this is the style of game you enjoy: relatively simple graphics, a clunky interface system, absence of good networking support, and it can be daunting to jump into the game due to the high number of moving parts.\n\nFor those who want more detail here I will go over the strengths of the game:\n1) High replayability: The game has dozens of different nations each with a distinct set of leaders, troops, as well as available magic paths. Some nations are mythical in nature (giants), some can fly, some are aquatic - each of these dramatically varies how you can approach the game. On top of that you choose a pretender who can be customized to shore up your weaknesses or build on your strengths. Not all the nations are equal leading to some interesting asymmetric game play. That means if you like this game you have hundreds if not thousands of hours of enjoyable game play ahead of you.\n2) Choice driven game play with consequential outcomes: There are many highly impactful events in the game including choosing a nation, a pretender, the magic paths you will research, what units to recruit, and how to arrange them on the strategic map and tactical maps. If you are playing a multiplayer game then things become even more complex as diplomacy and reading your opponents intentions become huge factors. What is nice is that once you are experienced at the game you can see how your choices lead to success of failure.\n3) Excellent system for managing a complex combat system: This is a turn based game so movement/combat occurs simultaneously between turns and is completely handled by the computer. At the start of your turn you can observe the battles and see how your troops performed and watch in incredible detail how the battle unfolded. But combat is not entirely out of your hands. During your turn you can organize your armies and describe how they should approach the battle with a relatively simple scripting system. For ordinary troops you can position them and give them a fairly basic orders for how to engage the enemy. Leaders are particularly potent because they may be able to cast spells and they can be scripted more complexly. Learning how to position and script your troops is a HUGE part of learning Dominons. This system means that you can organize your army once and fight many times, that your choices are impactful, and most importantly that you don't have to micromanage every battle. Instead you get to watch sometimes nail biter battles to see whether your plans succeeded or resulted in catastrophe. If you are someone who gets fed up with the tedium of 4X games that feature long drawn out turn based tactical based that have to be played out because the AI isn't smart should love this system.\n\nSo the weak points:\n1) Simple graphics: This game doesn't look great - its not bad but the sprite based graphics have their limits. Maps can be beautiful or not depending on how much effort their creator put into them.\n2) A clunky interface system: The interface is servicable but its sometimes hard to figure out how to do things and there are a ton of keyboard shortcuts to learn. In particular being able to set orders for lots of troops particularly the spell casters can get tedious.\n3) Absence of good networking support: This game can be played multiplayer over the internet but setting things up can be challenging. A nice play by mail system (llamaserver) has been set up by fans of the game and greatly facilitates game play but it could be a lot better.\n4) Daunting to jump into the game due to the high number of moving parts: This game has a ton of depth and there is nothing to be done but get started. The manual is HUGE but understanding the manual and learning how things work in practice takes time. It is both the curse and the joy of the game. Experienced players will tend to dominate the game.\n\nThis begins to touch on the strengths of this game. I wish more developers would learn from Illwinter/Dominions and build more engaging 4X play.", "timestamp_created": 1471639336, "timestamp_updated": 1471639336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24977357": {"recommendationid": "24977357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104361263", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448137341}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game. it's easily one of the most intricate strategy games i've ever played. don't let the graphics fool you, this game easily has just as much content (if not more) as any Civ game or other turn based strategy game. i haven't finished either of the games i've started, but the almost overwhelming number of civilizations/deities to play as as well as how much they affect the gameplay itself makes this game a little hard to grasp at first. there are just so many options. tons of world maps and different civs each with their own playstyle. there are underwater nations (mind-blowing) and magic based nations, and evil nations, warlike nations, monk like nations, all kinds of nations. there are several different schools of magic as well and each nation is better at some types than others but all nations can research any type of spells. you also get to create your own deity to play as and they act like a beefed up version of your nations commanders, but what's really cool is that it doesn't matter what nation you pick, you can have them ruled over by any kind of god. dragons, fish, undead liches, stone monoliths, etc. and whatever form your deity takes affects their abilities as well. and beyond all that, the different nations also have climate preferences. some like it hot, some like it cold, some like it in between and if they're outside their comfort zone, they suffer a slight penalty in combat and defense. you can control your individual armies' tactics and formations and you'll have to because there's a lot more depth to the combat than just unit strength or weapon power. some really powerful armies can get crushed by a smaller, weaker army if they have the right weapons or mages/spells. honestly, i don't know of another turn-based strategy game that has as much variety and depth to it as this game does. it's not just raising armies and researching new spells-you also have to build up and maintain an empire made up of several smaller zones and if you don't build and maintain infrastructure and defenses between them, you're going to mowed down not just by your opponent(s) but by the neutral natives on every map.\nin short, this game has so much content to it, that it has a bit of a steep learning curve, but once you get past it and figure out what you're supposed to be doing, you'll likely have as much of a blast playing it as i do.", "timestamp_created": 1471455022, "timestamp_updated": 1471455022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24975592": {"recommendationid": "24975592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119297620", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 45453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "last_played": 1516443658}, "language": "english", "review": "This is hands down the best strategy game I ever played, and I have played quite a lot of them. Virtually unlimited variety and strategic depth keeps me coming back for more for a few years now. In a Dominions multiplayer game everything can happen, and your opponents are always coming up with clever ways to defeat your strategy that you thought was unbeatable. Another big argument in favor of this game is the rich lore that was put into the 50+ different nations you can play. It is not based only on commonplace pop culture influences like so many other fantasy games around, but in real world history and mythologies.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are not interested in multiplayer, the game is not nearly as exciting, since even the most advanced AI engineering in the world wouldn't be able to handle the game's intricacies. After a while, at least for me, single player became mostly a testing ground for new strategies. So yes, that's a downside of the game, but which complex strategy game has decent enough AI to keep you on your toes for years? None.\n\nOther downsides I can think of are the outdated graphics (about which I personally couldn't care less) and the sometimes awkward UI. But the game is still occasionally updated, not only with new content, but also with AI and UI improvements, which is always very welcome.\n\nSo yeah, if you're into a strategically complex set in a rich fantasy setting and don't care about AAA graphics slowing down loading times, there's no better game in my opinion.

What the game is in a nutshell:\n\n-You are a god; you must vanquish other gods and conquer their dominion, while maintaining control of your own\n\n-The game's lore is mixed with history and fantastical mythos. There are no elves or dwarves. There are byzantines with hydras (hydra cataphracts), undead roman legionaries, demonic samurai, and conventional vikings, greeks, English knights, HRE-style armies, aztecs and more.\n\n-There is a massive roster of magical units and monsters you can add to your army. The game is a good depiction of how mortals would fare in battle against giant cyclops, phoenixes, dragons, and more. Every mythical beast under the sun is in one form or another in this game.\n\n-Magic is devastating; swaths of fire can swallow entire platoons of mortal soldiers. However, the backbone of your armies will still be conventional forces until the late-game.\n\n-You don't control armies in battle; you set pre-battle orders and the battle is automatically resolved (though you can watch it play out to analyze why you won or lost).\n\n-AI is actually rather competent and ferocious in war. For some reason, while there is utterly no alliance system, certain AI choose not to attack you while you're fighting in your own war. Perhaps they were busy fighting someone else; but my point is that it feels smarter than the AI in CIV. But forget about trade or diplomacy - there is only war in Dominions 4.\n\n-You truly understand what war of attrition means in this game. It is a GRIND to defeat another nation; you will lose many, many soldiers and officers and provinces will change hands often. Strategic placement is vital; you have to leave strong garrisons at certain strongpoints. Sieges are lengthy. By the time your large army smashes through the remaining enemy defenses, you will find that your men are 8 years older, many losing limbs and walking on a limp, and slowly dying from disease.\n\n-Every single unit has permanent stats: if they lose an arm in battle, they will fight one-handed for the rest of their life. You can equip officers with magical equipment. Also, if one of your generals gets horror-marked, his fate is sealed. Demons from another dimension (the strangest looking demons I've seen in any fantasy game) would periodically attack, and one of these things are strong enough to destroy entire nations. Very rare, but dom4 has bizarre events like these.\n\nThe only problems I have with the game are that the logistics are quite clunky. You can't route your army to a far away location; the maximum routing distance is an adjacent province. Battle orders are also very finicky. Graphics of course are not the game's strong suit, but that's a part of the package.\n\nRecommended for meticulous and patient 4X gamers who want to feel the immersion of empire building and strategic war of attrition.", "timestamp_created": 1469292594, "timestamp_updated": 1469292594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24455769": {"recommendationid": "24455769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055990164", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 42338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1458, "last_played": 1516428858}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game!

Basically that meant that I have played it using only the most obvious magic ( e.g. fireballs, summon elementals and such ) and concentrated on learning troop strengths + weaknesses and developing battlefield tactics. I've propably spend 200 hours playing one nation in one age: Machaka in middle age. Why? It was one of the first I have tried and it had Zulu like warriors riding giant, no sorry GIANT Tarantulas. I've read many reviews and nobody writes about the terrifing noice those tarrantuals make, when they chomp their victims...Or how almost every spell has its own sound so the battle is like a strange symphony :-)\n    Other things people don't mention:\n1.The developers are commited to make the game even more deep and complex, BUT they are also commited to cut on micromanagement where only possible, for example: to reaserch magic, to buy a new mage (this with a castle 90% of the time), to perform a magic ritual ( e.g. send winged monkeys to enemy province and capture a comander; summon bunch of ogres or dragons ), to send a magic item from one end of a map to another, to access the gem treasury (gems are needed for summoning monsters, crafting magical gear and using more powerfull battlespells), to send blood virgins to the central dungeon (you'll find out yourself what THEY are for, you rascals, you), to make the magic gear and maybe for few other things as well, \nyou need ONLY ONE BUILDING in that province! In other games you would need to buy 7 different buildings because thats the way other games try to achive complexity.\n    Another example: those troops that have lost their armor during a battle (there are spells with that effect like Rust or Acid Rain) get it back automatically afterwords providing there is enough resources in the province - its so automated that most players have no idea it even takes place!\n    Another example: in Dominions 3 there was an craftable artifact called Burning pearl(?). It had the efect that the commander wearing it would lose one point of life a turn but you would gain one fire gem. You could give those Burning pearls to all your commanders( after 20 turns maybe 40 of them? ) and then try to keep an eye on them so that you take the magic amulet from them after 9 turns, so they do not die because of it. Imagine the level of micro if you had 150 commanders :-)  In Dominions 4 this amulet got scraped, we got Fire in a Jar amulet, that provides the mage with one fire gem during a battle. Nice, elegant solution.\n\n2.The diversity of the game is greatly increased by the aviable mods, especially NationGen. I am currently passionately playing a Hoburg ( essencially warrior hobbits) nation. The blessed, sacred unit is a boar cavalery.They have swords and throw Tomahowks; I gave them fire bless so the Tomahawks are on fire when they whirl towards the enemy! I am sure the Boar's gore attack has a fire element to it as well, but the grafic does not show it :-(  \n    This nation has also a deer cavalery unit, Heavy Infantry with clockwork armour ( there is game mechanic connected with the properties of the armor), a scout that is an assasin as well, flying cavalery with giant hawks and bunch of mages, commanders and infantry which seem vanilla in comparison but would be crazy interesting in other games.\n     NationGen mod can give you unlimited amount of new, unique nations, including the one where Velicoraptors ride to battle on crocodiles!\n\n3.There is a certain beauty in the way a battle progresses in the game, especially in multiplayer. Before battle you decide how big the units should be (one soldier minimum, I don't know if there is maximum - the biggest I remmeber was 250 soldiers), how many of them and what their behaviour during the battle should be e.g. attack closest enemy or wait 2 turns and attack the archers and so on >> about 20 possible combinations. Making those decisions, you will face tradeoffs like: do I make one extra small unit and order it to guard my precious commander but this will result in small morale penalty for all the soldiers this general has under him. \n    When battle replay starts (you have no control over the battle during the battle) you see how different units move on the battlefield, how when they touch some of them melt under the assault like snow on lava, others stand the groung like a stonewall. Units get mixed with each other; some catch fire others get paralyzed; buffing spells change their color or opaqueness; they get covered and traped by nets, vines or the earth itself. You see how a line of tough, armored, veteran infantry sloughters the cheap militia before them but there is 4 militiamen for every veteran. In the center there is 1v1 fighting but militia gradualy envelops the flank of veterans. The last warrior in line faces suddenly 5,6 militiamen- he fights and dies, then another, and another. You see how the flank of the falange is crumbling, you see how the militia is about to anihilate the veterans (while losing 50 % of their number) when suddenly 5 tarrantula riders charge the militia. Their god pretender blessed them with weapons that are on fire and they make use of it. The giant tarantulas cover the enemy in spider webs, inject them with poison and terrify you with otherwordly screeching. The militia breaks, runs away only to get massacred by the pursuing spider cavalery. The veterans break and flee to - from a 30 man unit there is only 6 left and every one has a battle affliction: missing eye, crippled leg or unhealable chest wound. One of them has 7 afflictions and his stats are worse than a blind militiaman's. If only there was a way to kill him it would be a mercy. But there isn't so in next battle he is going to be part of the Archer Bait Unit...", "timestamp_created": 1469045663, "timestamp_updated": 1469045663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24421652": {"recommendationid": "24421652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003955822", "num_games_owned": 3147, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 2406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511797692}, "language": "english", "review": "Where to start?

Dominion is basically your chosen gods influence, and will give provinces modifiers based on how you designed your god.\nConquering land is vital for securing enough resources and gold to build an ever bigger army. Enemies will usually not be far away, and on multiple fronts. Smart decision making will often decide the outcome of your games.\nAs you gain land, send skilled mages into them to search for magic sites. Magical sites will provide gems, which are mostly used for spellcasting (combat) and rituals (world map spells). Having a high gem income can a lot of times be the edge needed to subdue enemy nations.\n\nPersonally, i prefer less micro intensive strategy games, which is why i like this game so much.

Even now, years after its release, Illwinter continues to update it. Just a few days ago, one of these updates added and entirely new faction to the game. That kind of dedication to their game impresses me, and I appreciate it a lot as a player.\n\nDominions 4 is a pretty complicated and difficult-to-learn strategy game. That complication comes mostly from the sheer depth of the game's mechanics, and a lack of an in-game tutorial. You'll probably need to read the manual (which is linked here on the store page) to learn the proper way to play. I'd recommend skimming over it even if you haven't bought the game yet, as it can probably give you a pretty good idea of what you're buying.\n\nThe gameplay focuses heavily on the use of magic and the managing of your dominion - dominion measures the population's belief in you, and their willingness to worship you as their god. One method of victory involves spreading your dominion across the entire map, eliminating all belief in other gods through fanatical preaching and construction of temples. \n\nThe community still seems pretty active, and you can probably find people to play with on the forums - along with user-made content like maps and mods(including player-made factions).\n\nAs far as fantasy-themed grand strategy games go, I haven't played very many... but I'd hazard a guess that Dominions is by far the most deep and varied one, with 83 factions, almost 400 craftable and equipable artifacts, and like a zillion spells (I actually have no idea how many there are, since almost every faction has faction-specific spells).

Someone sitting down with Civ 5 or Endless Legend could quickly enjoy intuitive and simple mechanics, while Dominions 4 is a struggle from the start. \n\nThe setting is very rich, with mythological and history-based factions ruled over by a God of your design competing to bcome the omnipotent divinity. Dominions 4 requires a lot of investment to understand what's going on, why it's happening, and what to do, but it's very rewarding once you do so. 70 hours in I am still learning new things- Axe-equipped infantry are more likely to lop off an enemy's arm in combat, giving him hideous penalties and generally ruining his day. How awesome is that? But the game is in no hurry to tell you about its many wonderful features and possibilities. \n\nFinally, the multiplayer is much smoother than other 4xes i've played, moving along comparatively fast.

For now, I'd like to post a short comment, since I intend, as mentioned to Yakri - great player with excellent tutorials for this game - to build up a few gameplay videos discussing strategies in the near future.\n\nThis strategy game, although simple in it's graphics, is a great option for all those who love TBS. I've been around for a while as a gamer, mainly working my way through RPGs and strategy games, and this is by far the most addictive and entertaining I've played so far. You get to choose between several nations with many distinct units, spells and playstyles. If that was not enough, you also get to choose between 3 different ages, each with a unique set of nations (more than a dozen per age at least) and unique peculiarities (such as magic intensity). You nation will be led by a pretender god, a charater you may build as in an RPG, Depending on your choices, you'll be able to increase nation's productivity, research, faith, etc., as well as defend it directly, once you are awaken (you may start as an active god or as a dormant god, at your leisure). \n\nIt is a military-inclined game. No diplomacy here (I'd recommend Seven Kingdoms, if this more to your liking, or maybe Europa Universalis series). No need, though: the game is filled with tension, above all in bigger, more crowded maps, as you have to face wars in multiple fronts, calculating your moves and adapting to several different types of units, trying to counter them with your own, maybe trying to cast global spells to increase your chances, hiring mercs, gifting magic items to your heroes and generals, pitching against other champions in the arena for it's prizes, and so on. There's so much to this game it's really hard to sum it up.\n\nAs a final note, I'd like to recommend the community. One of the greatest, most welcoming group I've ever seen. Dev team is also great, dedicated, studied and impassionate about the fanbase and the game. Check it out for great discussions, amazing online games and great chats in forum or anywhere else. \n\nAlso, be sure to check the former iterations of Dominions, as well as the also excellent Conquest of Elysium, now in it's 4th entry as well (not to mention the great IOS version of CoE 3, one of the best cell phone games available).\n\nEDIT: 23 hours later, I still have the world to learn from this game.

I wasn't expecting much from this game as I've bounced from 4x to wargames, and back again over time never really being that impressed. So let me write a quick love letter to this one, that I've been hopelessly addicted to over the past several days despite its flaws. \n\nThis game does not compromise on what it's supposed to be. It's a lovesong to the heydey of the past, and it's built without regard to any mosquito-like whining of the modern age. It never adapted except maybe to make controls easier, and it's so easy to love for it's somewhat rustic charm. If you played this sort of game in 1998, you will be well at home here. \n\nIt treats graphics as though they were petty things for lesser purveyors of the arts. Instead, each and every facet of the game is just rich with an 11 herbs-and-spices of flavor. Every \"pretender\" God is interesting to read about, as is each civilization. As far as I can tell, they're all derived from one collection of lore or another, but they're adapted in such a way as to be interesting. Do you want biblical fanfiction? Norse mythology? The Deku tree? There's something for everyone here, and none of it is compromised to plebs that tend to fill modern video game audiences. \n\nLet me also mention the depth here. This game is so incredibly deep that many complain about it. As a caveat, the depth may not be entirely perfectly crafted. I feel there are some imbalances between the value of units, and the sheer amounts of spells makes it unreasonable to have a good grasp on what any given casters capabilities are. However, I kind of enjoy the \"fog of war\" this creates, and as my group of bros got this on sale, we're all kind of on the same curve.\n\nDO BE AWARE. There are a LOT of things in this game that are never explicitly explained, and I absolutely recommend looking up a guide. I watched the first 5 videos in this guy's guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgp1s16zUFA\n\nThings like garrisons, prophets, many facets of casting, even just creating your nation are not obvious or intuitive. You can totally crap your way through it, but it'd be easy to go a few hours and still be missing things.\n\n(on a side note, there are no dedicated servers, you have to use a VLAN with port access, however it has been the most seamless experience I think I've ever had with this system, even flawlessly connecting overseas) \n\nMultiplayer aside, this game is really great on single player as well. I pretty much immediately put in several hours. \n\nThere's just so much meat here, and the meat is delicious. I havn't had such a boner for a game in quite some time. So please accept my full-bellied sloppy semen-soaked recommendation.

Also, there are still no elves, and that's awesome.\n\nDominions 4 is a turn-based fantasy strategy game that is about 99.985% substance and .015% style. The graphics endearingly suck, and that will turn more than a few people away, but a thorough check under the hood will reveal one of the most complicated and rewarding strategy experiences out there. Though it doesn't share all the features you may expect in your typical modern turn-based strategy game, the ones that it does have are taken to levels so unbelievably high that other games lose sight of it from their big-budget pedestals.\n\nIf the music upon boot-up sounds familiar, you probably played Dominions 3. I think I've heard a few new tunes, but it seems that all the originals are back. Once again, retuned Dom3.\n\nDiplomacy is nonexistant, so don't expect any non-aggression pacts or trade and research agreements with the AI or with your friends. Although a form of coop has been added, it has a certain wonkiness to it that makes it a little less enjoyable than simply making secret alliances with other human players. Backstab, backstab, bacsktab!\n\nThere are a ton of factions to choose from inside of 3 different ages of existence, all with many, many unit types serving many different purposes. I'm not going to try counting the number of unique units in this game, but it's definitely somewhere between holy crap and even more holy crap.\n\nDid I mention that in spite off all this variety there are no elves? That's a breath of fresh freaking air.\n\nThe magic system is just as varied as the soldiers in your armies, and there are tons of spells ranging from useless to game-ending. Experimenting with magic and finding what works what needs a little adjustment, and what just accidentally killed your entire army is half the fun. Compile that with a single save file and you may develop a light case of paranoia. I did.\n\nIf magic is the potatoes of this game, then combat is the steak, and it probably runs a bit different than what you may be used to. It involves a lot of indirect control and tactical trial and error. I'll admit it took some getting used to, and you will often find yourself wondering how your 400-something close-combat soldiers were scared off by a dozen elephants, but unexpected catastrophic defeats are all part of the fun. Just like when your fate conspires against you and a stray arrow takes your necromancer out of a fight, leaving your horde of undead to mindlessly scratch their butts while they're picked to pieces. There's so much to go into and so many hilarious stories, but you'll have plenty of opportunities to make your own. \n\nMy biggest warning: If you played the ealier Dominions and could not get into the swing of it, don't expect this to change that wind's direction. It's more of the same, but the keyword here is 'more'. If it was more you wanted, it's what you got. And It was definitely what I wanted.

Don't be fooled by the seemingly complex nature of Dominions 4, at its heart it is a turned based strategy game about conquering thy neighbor with a light build aspect to the game. While there are only about five buildings you will choose from to construct, what makes the game so complex and interesting is the myriad of magic research, races, troop types, and crafting items you can make for your heroes. When these are coupled with a wide variety of customizable deities/wannabe gods vying for ascension, different victory conditions (research, a capture the flag like thrones of ascension, domination, etc.) as well as different Ages with different technology and magic, you get a very complex layered game. The ability to set battlefield formations for your troops and command types whereby you can march them into war and watch the battles play out (adjusting accordingly should your plans backfire) makes it even more interesting.

Most of the civilizations for example, are based on historical civilizations but are changed to suit a more mythological theme. Meaning, you wont be fighting elves, orcs and dwarfs, but rather giants and lizard men. And the use of priests and religious figures is also an almost prominent factor of the games main objective.\n\nStory:\nThe god of all has vanished and in the abscence of this supreme being, many 'pretender gods' have risen to take the throne above all. These pretender gods will raise armies, and fight eachother in brutal combat to ensure claiming the throne for themselves. You play as one of these pretender gods. You must claim the thrones of ascension to accomplish the goal of winning the game, however, you can also just dominate the land with your mighty armies.\n\nHow it plays:\nThis game plays very much like a board game. You can see the map on a birds eye scale of the world and you can move different units to different settlements in a turn based manner where they can perform different tasks. Such as, spreading your dominion (being your influential power over different areas), killing off rebel forces in nearby areas or build temples, forts and castles for extra deffensive capabilities. This game can be delightfully tactical.\n\nUnits:\nThere are many different units in the game. Each civilisation often has their own unique ones. But your pretender god is the most powerful a lot of the time. You can take your pretender god into battle, and it can increase the fear of your enemies more than anything which makes them more likely to flee the battle. Which is what happens a lot of the time, usually not all enemies get killed, they eventually run away. But the pretender god can be good for ensuring success in risky battles. There are then more weaker tier units you can simply use as cannon fodder, because of how cheap they are, resource wise. And then there are more powerful infantry and calvalry and as well as more powerful archer units that can be made for more resources. Different settlements may also allow you to recruit different units you can't recruit anywhere else. You can also make scouts and priests. Priests can spread dominion and scouts can swiftly move through enemy territory with ease.\n\nCustomization:\nAs far as customization goes, you get to choose what kind of pretender god you would like. Different civilizations have different kinds of pretender gods available, and a lot look different in their own unique ways. Also all will have different stats and abilities, but those can not be customized. You simply choose a god, give your god a name and then you get to choose the game options which there are many, as well as many different maps to play on, making the game very replayable for most I imagine. Also game options include victory conditions, difficulty and number of AI, etc...\n\nGraphics:\nThis is not a game made for good or even half decent graphic design. The graphics are not that great, but that shouldn't be a problem for any gamer with a reasonably decent imagination. You play the game and as you play you can see everything that's going on inside your head and that's pretty easy to get into, and fun. If you do not have a good enough imagination the game will probably feel empty or hollow.\n\nLearning curve:\nThere is a big enough learning curve at first, but things start to click into place eventually and when they do, you'll be flying through this game. There is a tutorial in this game, but for me it was quite a poor one. \n\nOn a sad note:\nDiplomacy system is almost non-existent. To declare war means to attack someone. And the AI can declare war on you without even havind to attack you straight away. No sort of trade involved either, (But that seems okay.) or any kind of peace treaty can be made from what I have seen so far. Once war is declared, it goes on till one kingdom falls to the hands of the other. I wish diplomacy played a bigger role in this game it would make things a little more interesting, but then again, there can only be one winner.\n\nVerdict:\nTons of fun to play, if you have a good imagination and don't mind bad graphics.\nSteep enough learning curve, with poor tutorial.\nCan be very tactical, with vast amounts of units and civilizations and different abilities for each one.\nIt immerses you in the story and goal to ascend to the throne above all gods.\nNo good diplomacy system.\nMore could have been added on to the soundtrack I guess, but that's my opinion. Many might disagree there.\nLoads of stats and information is given throughout the game on all main units and battles are done accuratly.\nGood AI from what I have seen.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game. \nIt's worth your time, \nand can have some very epic and memorable moments.\n\n8/10\nI throughly enjoy this game. But I wish there was more to diplomacy.\nMy imagination has done fair work on this game, but extra graphic\ndesign in certain parts wouldn't hurt at all.\nAnd having a bad tutorial mode can be a real pain.

The only other game i've played anywhere near as much is tabletop rpgs.  But i'm biased, old hand, fan, etc.  This guy isn't.  Here's what he had to say on the Steam forum.\n\n[quote=Stephen]Earlier tonight, one of the most epic occurences I have ever seen in a video game occured. Seeing that as a sign of a good game and also worth telling about, I decided to post here for your reading pleasure. Since it is only due to a confusing chain of events that this occured, I'm going to tell the full story from start to finish. Enjoy.\n\nRecently I started a MA game with my friend. It was Agartha and Pangea (me and my friend) up against 6 other pairs ( Ermor and Arcosephale, Ashdod and Nazca, Tien Chi and Caelum, Eriu and Ulm, Asphodel and Vanarus, Sceleria and Man ). Settings were for a long enjoyable coop game against the AI, with story events, conquest all, clustered spawns, and common random events. To start, we are luckily positioned with the one sea as our northern border ( the map had full wraparound), and mountains close by. We expand quickly and have a nice lump of land before we begin having conflicts with our neighbors, Ermor to the west and Ashdod/Nazca to the south. Im forced to support my Pangean friend with large blocks of Agarthan infantry supported with living statues so we can push back the enemies to the south. During the delay, Ermor casts a global enchantment, Burden of Time. Realizing the issues with all of our units dying of old age, we immediatly leave a small border garrison and charge our resources at Ermor. The endless legion combined with the death 3 provinces causes massive attrition, wearing our armies down to nothing and resulting in the deaths of my top commanders, excpet for one, Ernst, the Cave Captain. He has already aged to 45 / 50 from the Global Enchantment, so I prepare a suicide battalion of my remaining elderly units to rush Ermor and slay their god to end the enchantment. In a long battle across Ermor, I manage to corner and kill him in their capital. In the mean time, I've also rushed my way into Blood Magic to unlock Boots of Youth, which Ernst gets at the ripe age of 49, 1 year before old age. The Encantment is dispelled, but most players without undead focus have been crippled from its effects. My researchers are all diseased and my armies crippled. Ernst and only a few other commanders were given boots in time, the rest being too wounded to salvage. I recruit new generals, one of which being Aripert. The game is peacful for a time, but soon Ashopdel begins attacking. Im ready. Aripert and Ernst lead a combined force of over 400 Agarthan infantry, supported by foul spawn and living statues. Ashopdel is crushed, but their ally Vanarus pushes me back, killing most of my army. My commanders retreat, and I get a story event at my capital. A band of adventurers has joined the cause. I put them to good use as supporting commanders and mages for Aripert and Ernst. I launch a new attack at Ashopdel and Vanarus, killing the former and sieging the latter. My ally in the meantime has been fighting the war from the opposite side, and we meet together at Vanarus's capital. I storm first, Ernst, Aripert, and adveturers as commanders, a a vangaurd of Agarthan Living Statues in the front, foul spawn on the flanks, and Agarthan infantry in the core. The battle is brutal, with the archer towers killing 2 of my 6 adventurers, and my force being hit with many spells. Inside the fort is Vanarus' God, the Son of Fenrir. My own commanders have reached hall of fame status with 4 EXP and a heroic ability each. The battle rages, and I notice the adventures have been casting Nature 2 spells Enlarge and Enrage on my commanders. Suddenly, my small Cave Captains Ernst and Aripert have turned into size 4 killing machines, but are unable to get into combat. Eventually, morale breaks in both sides, and the mages run off the fields. My statues and the enemy elementals collapse into dust, leaving our core infantry to fight. The Son of Fenrir enters combat with his wolves, decimating my men while their men are whittled away by my more tanky infantry. The core infantry of their side routes, but mine route aswell after slaying the wolve body guards of their pretender god. All thats left are Ernst and Aripert, leading the charge alone. Against a god. With 200 hp. and Regen. I prepare for the worst, and to my astonishment Ernst strikes their god down with his enchanted Sword of Swiftness, with Aripert supporting. Vanarus was knocked out of the game, and a basic Cave Captain recruiting for a suicide mission many years ago had slain a god.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1460909788, "timestamp_updated": 1460909788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22413196": {"recommendationid": "22413196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027032507", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494901095}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is almost everything I've ever wanted in an RTS.

deserving of reccomendation. \n\nDominions 4 is a game made by two devs who have worked on every iteration of Dominions.\nUnlike many games which release and then charge you for additional content Dominions 4 recieves patches for new nations and units, FOR ABSOLUTELY FREE.\n\n\n                                   -------------GAMEPLAY-------------------\nThe gameplay is a turned based military management, strategy and tactic based game.\n\nYou have a Pretender God, the choices available depend on your nation.\nYour pretender God is basically a demi-god who is trying to become the only God for the world as the big G that came before dissapeared.\n\nYou can then modify your Pretender God with magic scales which is representative of the gods magical skill. These scales also determine bless amounts which are bonuses given to holy units, which each nation has.\n\nThere is also Dominion which given it shares the name with the game is one of the most important aspects. Dominion is the Pretender God's influence, without it your God will die and you will be subjected to other Gods dominion which brings a morale detriment for you and a postive boost for morale for your enemies.\n\nYou can take negative dominions traits like chaos or death or positive ones like magic or growth. Depending on the nation some will be postive for some while harmful to others, for example MA Ulm benefits from drain and Ermor benefits from Death.\n\nWinning conditions can be point based, deathmatch or my favorite Thrones of Ascension which are thrones of varying power that have an effect on provinces, dominion and gems.\n\nMagic is fueld by Gems and much be researched to be usable.\nSome spells require no gems but only effect Fatigue while others do. There are spells which have in battle effect and spells which can be used on the map to summon units, or attack provinces.\n\n                                               ----------------Setting----------------------\nThe setting of Dominions 4 is amazing, each Nation changes based on the age its in.\nSome dissapear other change dramatically.\nXibalba goes from a nation of Bat people to a nation of Frog people who enslave the Bat people.\nRlyeh goes from a nation of mindfrying fish called Aboleths into Squid people loosely based on Lovercraft who summon horrors from beyond to use as BLESSED units.\n\nSome nations like R'lyeh that I mentioned are sea based as they start in ocean provinces and all units are able to breathe underwater.\n\nNations have diffrent spells which all come with their own flavor text describing the spell and its origins and value to the people who cast it.\n\n                                                            ----------------Music & Sound-----------------\nDo not expect an epic soundtrack, one song and one song only, that goes on forever.\nSounds are good not great but indicate what is going on and are quite good when using iron blizzard in masse and hearing enemy splat noises.\n\n                                                            -------------------Maps------------------------\nThe game comes packaged with quite a few high quality maps, there is also the ability to make random maps however they don't look the greatest.\n\nHowever the game does have a very simplified map creation tool, and quite a few maps have been made for DOM 4 or converted from Dom 3.\n\nOne of my favorite maps is called Valanis and is quite beautiful visually and mechanically.\n\n                                                   ----------------------Performance----------------------\nThe performance is sex.\nOn a crappy lenova laptop which I use for work mainly is able to run the game and with most graphical options turned off can simulate very large battles which is impressive seeing as my laptop lacks a seperate video card.\n\nMy rig at home is a monster but even with a toaster with mild specs the game will run wonderfully.\nOne of the best aspects of the game as I enjoy being able to take my work laptop up with me on trips and being able to play the game without lugging my Tower around with me.\n\n\nI highly recommend Dominions 4 for anyone looking for a great Tactics and Strategy game with a fantasy flair.\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1458844112, "timestamp_updated": 1458844112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.364809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21998385": {"recommendationid": "21998385", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968847284", "num_games_owned": 599, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499729806}, "language": "english", "review": "Kinda hardcore game but i like it.

No automation features, having to move armies or heroes province by province makes the game cumbersome. The micromanagement is intensive, especially in the late game where more automation would have really made things better. There is no diplomacy in single player either.

Casting storm makes it hard to fly in combat, or shoot arrows. Rain will cause more fatigue to casters using fire magic.\n\nMoving in world map is turn based and battles are resolved automatically, you just set unit formations and script spells for mages (not necessery, AI does mostly good job). Watching these battles after each turn is probably best way to learn game mechanics.\n\nYou can see stats for all units and there are many. Units gets older and old age makes you more vulnerable to diseases and injuries.

You create your own customized pretender god and lead your pixel hordes to world conquest, spreading your religion and snuffing out belief in any god other than you. \n\nThe game's learning curve seems intimidating.

I got started with gaming on Age of Empires 1 and Starcraft. RTS and turn based strategy games have been some of my favorite genre's for about 15 years.\n\nDespite the fact that I've played one or two dozen such games extensively, nothing comes close to dominions 4.\n\nAlthough this game isn't for everyone, as it focuses very clearly on only one aspect of what would make a standard 4X strategy game, it does that one part of gameplay better than anything else by miles.\n\nWhat aspect is that? Combat. Everything revolves around crushing your oppenent in glorious combat, or erroding the his ability to fight with powerful magic. Dominions 4 has 78 unique nations. Although some nations keep their themes and gods through multiple ages slightly reducing diversity from what you might see with 78 totally different nations (the game has 3 \"ages\" it is played through, and many nations exist in multiple ages, but generally they transition to a different playstyle from age to age, with different mages and troops).\n\nThe sheer number of nations alone makes for an incredible degree of variety and depth, but you can also customize a 'pretender' , the demi-god ruler of your nation. This can make for vast differences in gameplay giving each nations 1-3+ viable strategies, not counting meta-strategies you might employ versus a group of players you know well.\n\nWe haven't even gotten to the good part yet though. The meat of the game is a powerful combat simulation engine that allows detailed troop formations, powerful magical spells, special monster units, and magical artifacts to be employed in battle. This provides enormous opportunities for you to turn the tide of battle with clever strategy and planning.\n\nOn top of that, supplies and research do play a role. You can base strategies around researching powerful magics quickly, securing vast amounts of gold to build a powerful mundane army around, or raiding your opponent until they can no longer support their forces.\n\nTake a look at the hours I've put into this game. I'd say I'm intermediate skill level. I could play most any nation competently, although I haven't nearly played them all.

So here it is.\n\nHow Heroes are Made\nEarlier tonight, one of the most epic occurences I have ever seen in a video game occured. Seeing that as a sign of a good game and also worth telling about, I decided to post here for your reading pleasure. Since it is only due to a confusing chain of events that this occured, I'm going to tell the full story from start to finish. Enjoy.\n\nRecently I started a MA game with my friend. It was Agartha and Pangea (me and my friend) up against 6 other pairs ( Ermor and Arcosephale, Ashdod and Nazca, Tien Chi and Caelum, Eriu and Ulm, Asphodel and Vanarus, Sceleria and Man ). Settings were for a long enjoyable coop game against the AI, with story events, conquest all, clustered spawns, and common random events. To start, we are luckily positioned with the one sea as our northern border ( the map had full wraparound), and mountains close by. We expand quickly and have a nice lump of land before we begin having conflicts with our neighbors, Ermor to the west and Ashdod/Nazca to the south. Im forced to support my Pangean friend with large blocks of Agarthan infantry supported with living statues so we can push back the enemies to the south. During the delay, Ermor casts a global enchantment, Burden of Time. Realizing the issues with all of our units dying of old age, we immediatly leave a small border garrison and charge our resources at Ermor. The endless legion combined with the death 3 provinces causes massive attrition, wearing our armies down to nothing and resulting in the deaths of my top commanders, excpet for one, Ernst, the Cave Captain. He has already aged to 45 / 50 from the Global Enchantment, so I prepare a suicide battalion of my remaining elderly units to rush Ermor and slay their god to end the enchantment. In a long battle across Ermor, I manage to corner and kill him in their capital. In the mean time, I've also rushed my way into Blood Magic to unlock Boots of Youth, which Ernst gets at the ripe age of 49, 1 year before old age. The Encantment is dispelled, but most players without undead focus have been crippled from its effects. My researchers are all diseased and my armies crippled. Ernst and only a few other commanders were given boots in time, the rest being too wounded to salvage. I recruit new generals, one of which being Aripert. The game is peacful for a time, but soon Ashopdel begins attacking. Im ready. Aripert and Ernst lead a combined force of over 400 Agarthan infantry, supported by foul spawn and living statues. Ashopdel is crushed, but their ally Vanarus pushes me back, killing most of my army. My commanders retreat, and I get a story event at my capital. A band of adventurers has joined the cause. I put them to good use as supporting commanders and mages for Aripert and Ernst. I launch a new attack at Ashopdel and Vanarus, killing the former and sieging the latter. My ally in the meantime has been fighting the war from the opposite side, and we meet together at Vanarus's capital. I storm first, Ernst, Aripert, and adveturers as commanders, a a vangaurd of Agarthan Living Statues in the front, foul spawn on the flanks, and Agarthan infantry in the core. The battle is brutal, with the archer towers killing 2 of my 6 adventurers, and my force being hit with many spells. Inside the fort is Vanarus' God, the Son of Fenrir. My own commanders have reached hall of fame status with 4 EXP and a heroic ability each. The battle rages, and I notice the adventures have been casting Nature 2 spells Enlarge and Enrage on my commanders. Suddenly, my small Cave Captains Ernst and Aripert have turned into size 4 killing machines, but are unable to get into combat. Eventually, morale breaks in both sides, and the mages run off the fields. My statues and the enemy elementals collapse into dust, leaving our core infantry to fight. The Son of Fenrir enters combat with his wolves, decimating my men while their men are whittled away by my more tanky infantry. The core infantry of their side routes, but mine route aswell after slaying the wolve body guards of their pretender god. All thats left are Ernst and Aripert, leading the charge alone. Against a god. With 200 hp. and Regen. I prepare for the worst, and to my astonishment Ernst strikes their god down with his enchanted Sword of Swiftness, with Aripert supporting. Vanarus was knocked out of the game, and a basic Cave Captain recruiting for a suicide mission many years ago had slain a god.", "timestamp_created": 1457325022, "timestamp_updated": 1460345794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602642", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21672466": {"recommendationid": "21672466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185936073", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510908420}, "language": "english", "review": "Malazan: The Game", "timestamp_created": 1457293324, "timestamp_updated": 1457293324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21671303": {"recommendationid": "21671303", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973245321", "num_games_owned": 415, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507974788}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite strategy games of all time.

There are three key problems with this game. \n\nThe first is that the game gets boring after a while. Yes, I'm talking about multiplayer. Initially, it is exciting learning how to outwit other human players -- raid and counter raid, various strategies, spells and their counters. After a while, though, there is a serious lack of variety. There are many spells, units and items in the game, but the reality is that over 90% of them are plain bad and you'll always be restricted by a very limited selection to what is feasible/competitive.\n\nThe second problem is a rather toxic community. For some reason, many people who play the game think that they are geniuses and have sky high egos. It can be really frustrating communicating with them especially if they know that they are wrong but just plain refuse to admit it. I guess that people who play this game are naturally more logical and hence think that they are smart. \n\nThe third is that many multiplayer games end up dead. It is difficult to find a game where everyone is playing competitively until the end. Most of the time, someone will give up and disappear halfway through the game, resulting in his neighbour becoming stronger. Some times, people refuse to attack the leader and let him run away with the game. Some times your starting location is bad, you have no chance. In any case, it gets really frustrating when people treat the game flippantly.

Lovecraft. You start out the game by choosing a map, age, empire, and then making a god. The game consists of three playable ages that show the development of the playable empires. The early ages have Magical and Nonhuman factions in abundance, while the human factions of the time are just discovering Copper and Bronze. This age also has the greatest amount of Magic, but also the least organised casters. The second age is marked with Human factions beggining to subjigate the assorted nonhumans with weapons of Iron and Steel augmented by enchantment. This age has a moderate balance of Magic and Organised casters. The Third age is a time were Man has all but destroyed the magical wonders of past ages. Magic is nearly drained from the world, but well organised wizards make do with what is left. After you choose your age, you choose your empire, Then make your God. Your God making sets how you will spend the next several hours of your life in this game. You select an available Deity for your faction, then get to choosing how strong it is in magic and what bonuses you get in lands were you are believed in. Say you're faction has very good yet expensive troops, yet poor magical researchers and practitioners so you can't get any late game spells, you would make your god have a dominion that boosts production and can cast what you need to be cast.

I think im going to stop soon so I am going to make this as simple as possible to summarise what you do in the actual game. Your first play through will just be throwing bodies at other bodies till you win or lose. Though what makes the game fun is the magic. One magician with some magical items and gems can single handedly destroy a quarter of an army, but what makes it complicated is knowing the exact stats of those items, spells, and how much your caster can take before fainting.

It might even be the king of fantasy strategy games.\n\nDominions 4 has incredibly deep mechanics that will, truthfuly, be quite frustrating at times but are also incredibly rewarding. This is a game where you invest alot of time into to fully understand. Every time you play you figure out a new strategy or mechanics you didnt know about. At the time of writing this review I have 274 hours into this game and I'm still learning. You can put a hundred hours into one nation and still not unlock its full potential. If you arn't willing to put time into this game you will only leave frustrated. Luckily there is a very active and incredibly helpful community over at Desura.com.\n\nPlaying this game you will raise vast armies filled with simple human warriors, incredibly strong giants, magic demi gods, demons, angels, half fish men, dragons and many more creatures. You'll have armies of hundreds of units battling eachother as mages set the battlefield afire and call upon divine lightning to destroy their foes while corrupt priests cast unholy rituals by spilling virgin blood. You'll have a unstoppable army conquering and pillaging your enemies lands but then your opponent summons a powerful hero, hundreds of years old, from ancients crypts in his home city. This hero will fight your unstoppable army. One man, versus hundreds. And he'll win. You'll have a crippled commander who can barely move. Old in his age and speaking in croaks and whispers. but all your men respect him because he is a master tacticitan, he has never been defeated in battle. Guarded by your most trusted men he commands huge armies and crushes enemy forces with ease.\n\nThe modding is where this game truly shines. Their are hundreds of mods available that change every aspect you could possibly imagine. From mods that balance to mods that are simply for fun, there is dozens of mods for every kind of player. If you're feeling brave you can mod yourself, all you need is a text and image editing program, with a official modding manual available at Illwinter's website. You can create any nation or creature you can think of. Want to play as a nation of cannabilistic, necromatic hobbit warrior society, go ahead, easily done. create as many and whatever spells you want.

There is a wide variety of races with their own racial spells that lean you in a style of play but by no means are you required to do so. Each race has a subset of Gods aka Pretenders that further alter a playstyle. The races themselves have deep back stories. The game play doesn't limit you to create massive armies and bashing them into other armies. You can create hero commanders with a deadly arsenal of equipment and magic knowledge. You can focus on killing your opponents with the spread of your beliefs. Every game can be different in one way or another.\n\nMixed in with the good points I also have some bad. The graphics are very old school. I have grown to like them but anyone looking at the game with its current $35 price tag are likely to be apalled with it. Aside from the price tag I really wish the game utilized better tooltips when you hovered over buttons or had an actual in game tutorial that didn't require you to go out to the website and read a PDF.\n\nOverall I am absolutely happy with my purchase of Dom4.

The individual details on the lore of each faction and its units is incredible, while the gameplay itself is significantly less deep.  However, you are a Pretender God, a being of great power with ambitions to ascend to ultimate, monotheistic godhood over his or her rivals.  So there's that for you powermongers out there. \n\nWhen starting your game there are three separate eras that you can play your campaign in.  Each of these eras is packed full of at least a dozen factions that are unique from one another.  Often this means that each era introduces entirely new factions as well as a good number of them that are evolved from the previous ones.  For example, my personal favorite, Ulm, is a faction composed large, human barbarians that worship steel in the Early Ages.  In the Middle Ages, they have evolved into a civilization that has mastered the art of crafting with the legendary resource known as blacksteel.  They now have armies full of black knights clad in this fantastic metal and are the most powerful rank-and-file infantry in the era.  In the Late Ages, however, civil war has destroyed what they once were and the secrets of blacksteel have been lost.  Though their troops are know wearing more standard armor, their aristocracy has become corrupted by vampirism.  This is but one of the many examples of a faction's evolution and some of them even have branching factions such as an empire that becomes three unique kingdoms.\n\nThe strategy mechanics of Dominions 4 are not particularly remarkable, however, supplemented with the vast lore, they do make for a very enjoyable game.  Each faction has a fairly large number of units to build their armies with that have varying strength, weaknesses, special abilities, and a handful of stats.  As you conquer territories, you will also be able to recruit units not originally from your faction's unit pool.  This can result in some wonderfully unique armies that you conquer the world with.\n\nThough the lore in the game is fantastic, I do believe players should be aware before playing the game that after starting your campaign there is nothing much that is added to it.  There are exciting random events and, obviously, your conquest of the world will vary every time, but the story from the time you hit the 'play' button is all headcanon.  Granted, that is often the best canon, especially when shared with others.\n\nI recommend this game to strategy gamers, especially, as long as they don't mind the ancient graphics.  If you enjoy well written and unique lore and aren't expecting flashy, cinematic battles to play out before your eyes, Dominions 4 will be an experience that you'll come back to and share with others for a long, long time.", "timestamp_created": 1453347030, "timestamp_updated": 1453347030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20625286": {"recommendationid": "20625286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007397467", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 66330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511713287}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a great game, the only thing I do not like about it though is it has long turn times, and there is no diplomacy.

It is a strategy game, with armies, regions, castles, and research, although I don't think many players would go so far to call it a full-blown 4X.  Maps are designed, rather than generated procedurally; diplomacy is remarkably limited; economic growth is streamlined to and past the point of CA games.\n\nThe short version of the review is that D4 is clearly a labor of love from an amateur developer with serious problems in presentation and interface.  Even if D4 is your cup of tea-- which it won't be for most-- this is not a game worth the asking price.\n\nSo before we get to what's bad, let's talk about what's good.  If you want variety, D4 has it.  There are a vast number of pretender gods to choose from, and each customizable from there, 3 eras each with 15 or so different factions, and each faction has a good supply of units to build, including heroes.  But the real variety comes from the spell book.  The number of spells may very well approach 1000.  Just a handful of those spells in the construction school allow you to build innumerable magic items.\n\nBut this vast variety is one of the failings of D4.  How many different spells protecting against fire need to exist?  How many different missile spells?  With D4, things are either unbearably streamlined (travel, growth) or else abstraction of mechanics is ignored completely (spells, magic items).  Consider D4's units.  When you open up your recruitment window, you're going to be greeted by as many unit descriptions as you'd ever enjoy reading-- and with each region conquered, you'll discover more.  Yet the actual differences between these units are slight and difficult to puzzle out.  Oftentimes, not even the unit's [i]name[/i] is changed between two incarnations.  Some stats are byzantine and presented in great detail while I was never able to find other, more important statistics like size.\n\nSo how do you play D4 well?  Part of it is via an encyclopediac knowledge of the game system.  And a large part of [i]that[/i] is through watching presentations of battles.  With each battle, you're supposed to see how the system works.  These battles are repetitive, barely more dynamic than damage numbers floating from people's heads, and painfully slow to watch.  Yet you're not going to get good at D4 without watching a great number of these.  D4's tactical system combines the interactivity of autoresolve with the mind-numbing tedium of watching grass grow.\n\nThe problems in D4's design are compounded by graphics that would be appropriate to the 486 era and interface issues.  There isn't much to say about the graphics beyond the fact that they're bad, but I can talk about the interface issues.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is that D4 decided to go its own way with regards to standards set by other strategy games in regards to rmb/lmb role, and for no apparent reason.  This is frustrating, particularly since the interface will easily cancel your orders anytime you get it wrong, without any warning.  Still, one can adapt.  Heroes frequently decide to stop doing what you told them to, so you're going to have to babysit them, but the only way I found to check on my heroes wasn't with a hotkey nor a button, nor a menu, but a submenu.  If you can't do something right now, the game isn't going to tell you that it can be done, and definitely not why you can't do it right now, although there's little consistency to this-- there are exceptions.  Winning battles is all about understanding unit capabilities (remember how many there are), yet the vision/intelligence system gives you no way to check these units' statistics until you actually fight.  Can your forty troglodytes take on the three winged bathyor?  There is no way to find out beyond trying.  Overall, you have a game that absorbs a lot of attention in small, unimportant details while the really important things are never presented with the weight they deserve.\n\nI haven't fully explored the depths of Dominions 4.  There may very well be parts of an interesting game buried underneath there.  What is clear is that it would take me several hundred hours to be able to find out whether D4 is even worth playing, and that even then, problems with interface, presentation, and balance would remain.

Pretenders, not gods. Ctenophoros, the prophet of the Archmage, corrected himself. There had been no true gods since The Pantokrator had left this world. In his absence his former servants, wives, and adversaries shook off their shackles and began to reach for his thrones. How strange it had seemed back then, amongst the mystical giants and beasts and frightening monoliths, that the alien races of R'lyeh had chosen to worship a mere mortal. Stranger still that the stars had revealed to Ctenophoros that he was destined for victory.\n\n\tIn the early days, Ctenophoros had seriously considered if he had misjudged destiny. True, their early campaigns to subjugate the merfolk provinces had been a dramatic success, but no other pretenders cared for the deep ocean. Instead they fought bitter wars for control of the rich provinces and magical sites that lay further inland. The Archmage had thought it wiser to bide his time, research forgotten lore and fortify his treasury, while his rivals clawed at each other's throats.\n\nThen the undead of Ermor struck. R'lyeh had considered itself safe below the waves, but the skeletons and ghouls of Ermor had no need for air. Worse still, R'lyeh's Illithids found themselves unable to strike at these mindless creatures, and were cut down in droves. Only a desperate counter-attack of shark riders from the merfolk provinces was able to turn back the undead forces, but for five years, the Sea of Woe would be contested.\n\nThe bitter stalemate extended to the nearby coast, where R'lyeh had founded mighty a castle. There, they began a recruiting campaign. Compared to Ilithids, human priests were frail, but their banishment spells would stop the undead just the same. The strategy worked, after a fashion. Ermor's undead knights had a nasty habit of cutting priests down like wheat, but soon the Archmage ordered whole contingents of hybrid soldiers (born of the surface mortals and Deep Ones) to accompany them.\n\nThe tide had begun to turn, but when R'lyeh's forces marched into the newly-conquered land of Zenthra, they found a terrible surprise. The land was desolate, ruined, dead. Ctenophoros had remembered staring in awe at shear number of ghouls and skeletons who had attacked the Sea of Woe. How could Ermor have acquired so main bodies? As he looked at this newly-conquered wasteland, utterly devoid of life, he knew the terrible answer.\n\nThey had retreated, of course. R'lyeh's armies would find only starvation there and Ermor still threaten the eastern sea. Ctenophoros thought the situation hopeless, but the Archmage had a plan. In his endless nights of study in his library on the ocean floor, he had learned the secrets of the Naiads. Now he called upon them. Together, they forged enchanted bags of near limitless supplies. And thus magically equipped, their armies began the offensive anew. The Naiads had also lent their expertise in the magical school of evocation, teaching R'lyeh's armies to wield torrents of cleansing waters to purge the undead from the land. They pressed onwards, towards the undead capital.\n\nTo their surprise, Ermor was already under siege. The traitor princes (so called because they had abandoned Atlantis to serve R'lyeh) had summoned a massive army of fishmen and enslaved Atlanteans and had struck from the sea as Ctenophoros and his god had marched up the coast. But the undead don't starve, and R'lyeh could have no peace while Isis, the Neteret of many Names, still walked the earth.\n\nCtenophoros' god, The Archmage had insisted on taking part in the assault. His body has frail, but every spellcaster was needed. He would remain safe at the rear of the army and rain elemental fury down on the fortress's defenders. It should have worked, and maybe nine times out of ten, it would have. But this time he caught an arrow in the chest and was dead before the troops reached the walls. His death sent the army into disarray\u2014the Atlanteans routed. But The Archmage had been right about the need for mages. Cleansing water decimated the undead ranks until only Isis remained. She stood 20 feet high and possessed armaments and magic the likes of which had never been seen in R'lyeh. But in the end, she was just a pretender. And eventually, the hybrid soldier's spears struck true and Emor was conquered.\n\nTwo pretenders had fallen, but they would not stay dead. So long as their faith held sway in this world they would return, soon or later. Ctenophoros hoped it would be later in Isis's case. Still, Ermor was not his largest concern. While R'lyeh was engaged in this bitter struggle for wastelands in the North, the Golem Cult of Agartha had come back from the brink of extinction to dominate the lands to the south. Troglodytes and terracotta warriors circled their southern borders greedily and spies had already been spotted in their lands. The Archmage had foreseen this war. The night before the assault on Ermor, he had given Ctenophoros an ancient scroll. Now, the prophet poured over this gift from his departed god\u2014it was a summoning spell more complicated and terrible than anything had ever known. The Eater of the Dead, an amorphous mass of semi-liquified dead flesh. It was banished to the void by The Pantokrator before he left this world.

There wasn't a true tutorial by todays standards, but that's no problem for someone, who doesn't like to explore. Now let's get to the crucial point. ...\n\n20 hours into the game and I spend most of it yet to create my own map (mostly INGAME, only 3 hours outgame). So what happened? After watching the map  editor tutorial on youtube I figured out: I could do that too and with my own favourite fantasy maps as well. So what I did OUTGAME is: \n1. find a picture of the Map of your desire (without provinces)\n2. Use GIMP to open the map\n3. FInd all white Color Pixels that are 255/255/255 and change them into 253/253/253 (How you do that? Google if necessary)\n4. Use the path tool and do Shift+Left Click at all your desired points on the map. (these will be the centers of your provinces (be aware that 1500 is the max for the game)\n5. Use the Voronoi Path plugin (need to install it) and make a right click on the path window to choose the option Voronoi path\n6. Choose the option \"Preserve the original path\"\n7. Now you have to paths: the original path dots you made and the path net you created with Voronoi path.\n8. Choose the Path tool and choose the option \"Stroke path\" to draw the Voronoi path net onto the picture (tada you have your provinces borders ready)\n9. Choose the pencil tool and chance its brush to \"1Pixel\". Choose the foreground color 255/255/255 white. \n10. Select your original single dots path and select the path tool and the option \"Stroke path\" and the option \"stroke with paint tool\" and use the pencil. When it's done then there should be a single white pixes in each province.\n11. Now the map is ready to use in the map editor. (Takes may be 30 mins to do all that, but you can use any map you like)\n\nSo year I am now about to finish my big map 1500 Provinces and I do a lot of test in betweens and it is a lot of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1452354498, "timestamp_updated": 1452354498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20310268": {"recommendationid": "20310268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045849075", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499829693}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Vi o jogo em promo\u00e7\u00e3o (30R$) e n\u00e3o hesitei em comprar, \u00f3timo jogo 4x Turn-Based Strategy, aqui est\u00e3o alguns pontos do jogo:\n-Alto pre\u00e7o mas que vale cada centavo gasto (espere uma promo\u00e7\u00e3o de pelomenos 50% se n\u00e3o quer/ n\u00e3o pode gastar 64 reais);\n-V\u00e1rias na\u00e7\u00f5es (75 na\u00e7\u00f5es jog\u00e1veis), possibilitando v\u00e1rias estrat\u00e9gias diferentes;\n-Tr\u00eas eras para se jogar, sendo a era com mais magia a Early Era e a mais t\u00e9cnologicamente avan\u00e7ada a Late Era;\n-Cria\u00e7\u00e3o de Pretender Gods, voc\u00ea cria o seu deus que te ajudar\u00e1 nas batalhas e magias;\n-6 Caminhos diferentes de Pesquisas em Magias que v\u00e3o d\u00eas do n\u00edvel 0 ao 9 (mais de 600 magias diferentes);\n-6 Elementos para Magias diferentes (Terra, Fogo, \u00c1gua, Ar, Morte e Sangue);\n-V\u00e1rias formas de se ganhar um jogo (Voc\u00ea pode escolher antes de iniciar o jogo a condi\u00e7\u00e3o de vit\u00f3ria por Conquista, Tronos de Ascen\u00e7\u00e3o, Pontos de Vit\u00f3ria e etc.);\n-Singleplayer e Multiplayer;\n-Mapas Gigantes permitindo at\u00e9 28 players;\n-Jog\u00e1vel em Windows, MAC OSX e Linux;\n-Atualizado Frequentemente;\n-Multiplayer apenas por LAN.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1451956395, "timestamp_updated": 1451956395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586894", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20279701": {"recommendationid": "20279701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010708806", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 19339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508989364}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an excellent game of strategy, but it is very niche.

It definitely has one of the most steep learning-curves I've seen in the various games I played, and even when the mechanics have been mastered, the possible strategies that can be adopted in the game are almost endless.\n\nThe lore of this game is set in a fantasy world taking inspiration from mithology and legends across the whole world. \n\nConcerning the game, Dominions is a turn based wargame with deep mechanics, allowing the players to play the different factions (there are many and all different) in various ways, even the same faction can be played using different strategies, and often there is no clear superior strategy, so it is up to the player to decide which one to adopt and how to adapt it to the evolving game. Dominions 4 is not only about grand strategy but also about tactical decisions, since the player will have to decide its armies formations and somehow how they are going to approach the eventual upcoming battle(s) the coming turn, along with decinding which spells the mages in the armies are going to cast, allowing in this way to create powerful combos.\n\nTo conclude this short review I would like to point out that Dominions 4 is not \"The perfect game\". But to do so I need to elaborate a little bit: I personally think that Dominions 4 is \"the perfect game\" for what it is supposed to be, a very deep slow paced niche strategy game requiring lot of thinking every turn and even before the game to select the strategy to adopt (I'm saying slow paced since during endgames, turns can take two or more hours, especially on big maps). However the game is not for everyone. Given it's depth, the only proper way to play it is multiplayer, even if the game allows the player to play against AIs, as to be expected due to the game complexity, they do not represent a challeng to a player who learnt the mechanics and has some experience with the game.\n\nFinally, if you are interested in a challenging turn based game and you don't mind spending time in learning it and play it against other players (the community has been usually quite friendly and willing to help newcomers), then pick it up and give it a try, I am pretty sure you will be happily surprised by this odd-looking game ;)", "timestamp_created": 1451584580, "timestamp_updated": 1451584580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505417", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20114796": {"recommendationid": "20114796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103631729", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451371537}, "language": "english", "review": "This reminds me, in many ways, of the board games I used to play when I was a child. \n\nThe artwork and map seem to give off this impression, at least to me.\n\nI purchased this because another reviewer compared it, favourably, to Crusader Kings.

There are massive amounts of strategies and a lot of depth, with a detailed world that all factors into how factions play. There are a large amount of factions, all of which have their own units and their own backstories, and a large amount of mythological beings, potential gods, and random events that can potentially completely change your experience.\n\nThe game is a tale about pretender gods, all together trying to eliminate the others so that they become the one real god. As the player, you control one such pretender god - Fully customised to your own likings and their nation/faction. Expand, research, play to your nation's strength, build up a massive army, and try to conquer the world. The keyword here being TRY, because every other faction has a pretender god trying to do the exact same thing, and things will often not go as planned.\nYou do not personally control the tactical combat, you only control the large picture. The army movement, the research, and important people(Such as scouts, mages, and commanders).\n\nIt may be overwhelming, and with a 300 page manual it's certainly not an easy game, but you don't need to know the top tier strategies to understand what's going on. Even without understanding most of the game you can enjoy it, with the large amount of mythology, customisation, and detail involved, you can easily weave your own tales of what happens in the world. \nAs a side note, the interface needs a little bit of learning too, but things become clear if you take a step back and calmly read the buttons and try them out\nAfter all this time, I still have moments where I meet entirely new things I haven't seen yet, so I can not tell you much about the great strategies that will let you win. But I can tell you that if you try hard enough, you can at least not get overrun by the AI most of the time, giving you all the time you need to learn more about the game, regroup, and fight back.\n\nIt's difficult to truly explain its appeal, but Dominions 4 has a massive amount of content out there, with a lot of lore and depth to it.

That out of the way, your mileage with the art style may vary.  If you don't like looking at the battles, you can simply look at the summaries to see how your army fared.\n\nApart from that, you have the deepest turn-based strategy game available, fourth generation and better than ever for what it offers.  Easily modifiable.  There are plenty of mods available if you know where to look (start at the Desura forums for this game).  If you don't have an imagination, this game probably isn't going to come through for your inner strategy geek.  Many of the pre-made maps are beautifully realized in a variety of art styles.\n\nThe game is easy to learn, but complex.  Certain civilizations will outperform and outclass others.  The worst civilizations are there to handicap better players so that they may play with their lesser skilled friends, or simply for the challenge.\n\nThere's multiplayer mode, which is the preferred way to play the game for many.  The AI isn't perfect for those who prefer single-player, but there are ways of meta-gaming if you want to challenge yourself solo.\n\nI'd recommend this game for anyone who can see past the game's flaws.  Perhaps wait for a sale and put this on your wishlist, but know that this game doesn't go on sale often.  If you do go full price, know that you're supporting a good indie developer that provides support for their games years after they're released.", "timestamp_created": 1448466914, "timestamp_updated": 1448466914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19261560": {"recommendationid": "19261560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195736022", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 41602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512172517}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game", "timestamp_created": 1448429997, "timestamp_updated": 1448429997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19187076": {"recommendationid": "19187076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019856429", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 7067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503692200}, "language": "english", "review": "amazingly fun game", "timestamp_created": 1448088137, "timestamp_updated": 1448088137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19186882": {"recommendationid": "19186882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038252618", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448084881}, "language": "english", "review": "Purchased this game for it looked stimulating.

Estamos hablando que existen m\u00e1s de 2000 unidades diferentes cada uno con sus atributos totalmente diferentes. Si a las unidades le unimos un sistema de magia muy amplia con centenares de hechizos que van desde una simple bola de fuego hasta hacer llover sangre para bajar la moral de las unidades, eso abre un abanico de posibilidades dificilmente de imaginar en cualquier otro juego.\n\nUnidades sagradas, guerreros de diversas civilizaciones, arqueros, lanceros, monstruos peque\u00f1os, monstruos grandes, con dos brazos o con 4 (puede llevar 4 armas diferentes), bestias voladoras, zombies, dragones y un sin fin de unidades conforman un universo muy rico por lo que cada naci\u00f3n con la que jueues es totalmente diferente una de otra. Naciones basados en algunas reales como los vikingos o los romanos o fant\u00e1sticas. Yo estoy jugando una partida ahora llevando a una raza de monos dominados por unos demonios de sangre (Lanka) y tiene tropas que van desde unos monos que arrojan piedras y que se espantan en cuanto le ataque cualquier mindungui hasta unos demonios que se transforman en mitad de la batalla en unas bestias foribundas.\n\nY es que he mencionado el multijugador porque es donde esta la verdadera gracia del juego. La diversi\u00f3n se multiplica puesto que entra como nuevo factor la diplomacia, que es nula en solitario. Os aconsejo que os paseis por el foro de Punta de Lanza si quereis organizar o participar en partidas \u00e9picas con m\u00e1s de 10 personas.\n\nEn el juego tu papel es de un dios que tiene que prevalecer por encima de todos los dem\u00e1s, por lo que tu puedes hacer que tus comandantes lancen una serie de hechizos que antes deben haber aprendido, o puedes crear objetos que mejoren a dichos comandantes que van desde un l\u00e1tigo para poder llevar m\u00e1s tropas o una espada de fuego, un casco que atemoriza a las unidades o unas botas voladoras que haga que tu comandante armado hasta los dientes se plante en la otra punta de la batalla y ataque a ese mago que est\u00e1 diezmando tus tropas lanz\u00e1ndole meteoritos... lo malo es que el dios enemigo haya mandado a un espia y haya adivinado tus intenciones y haya dado la orden al mago enemigo  para que lance un hechizo de tormenta y te impida volar hasta \u00e9l, y luego lance un nuevo hechiz\u00f3 y te parta literalmente por un  rayo...\n\nEn resumen, un juego de estrateg\u00eda de verdad. Puede parecer un poco comlicado al principio, por la cantidad de opciones que tiene pero una vez que aprendes (mirar tutoriales o AAR en PdL) es una gozada.\n\n\u00a1Nunca fue tan dificil ser un dios!", "timestamp_created": 1447877451, "timestamp_updated": 1447877451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506634", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19126537": {"recommendationid": "19126537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030732709", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 74679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509414467}, "language": "english", "review": "An awesome game for awesome people.\n\nIf you are a mythology buff like I am who also happens to enjoy games like those in Sid Meier's Civilization series (or Conversely Europa Universalis/Crusader Kings), as well as nigh on Dwarf fortress level learning curves, then this is the game for you.\n\n- Preposterously deep (multiple ways to play an asthma attack inducing number of different races)\n- Mouth wateringly creative (A million spells of varying effects and quality)\n- The game really caters to the modding community.

Send commanders to kidnap their virgin daughters so you can turn them into boots.  Soft, youth sustaining, extra spring in your step boots.  Give them to her father on the front line, he'll never know.  The old veteran is dying of old age and you still have a use for him.", "timestamp_created": 1446006322, "timestamp_updated": 1446006322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 13,

Wow!\n\nI can't say enough good things about this game. It is like all of the best old school fantasy 4x rolled into one.

This game never caught into the mainstream because of the graphics but people are truly missing out on some of the best 4x gameplay in the genre. There are tons of different races, empires, nations, etc with thousands of possibilities for each different nation to be played. No two nations play alike and even within the nations there are many ways to play.\n\nMy favorite nation is known as Ermor, it's a romanesque nation which as it progresses through the ages it becomes undead. In the early ages you have great armies marching under royal banners, formation fighting with towershields, being supported in the back by toga-wearing wizards. In the middle ages the empire falls and rises again as undead. The rotting legions rise from the grave and march out of the capitol to ravage the countryside. In Ermor's undead regions, everything slowly dies due to the power of the Ermor god, so most Ermorian regions end up with 0 population. So amazingly fun, deep, and detailed.\n\nCheers.", "timestamp_created": 1445285655, "timestamp_updated": 1445285655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18485557": {"recommendationid": "18485557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112468248", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421669248}, "language": "french", "review": "Complexe mais ouf!", "timestamp_created": 1444924706, "timestamp_updated": 1444924706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18466367": {"recommendationid": "18466367", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989401145", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511567198}, "language": "english", "review": "I love strategy games. LOVE THEM. My favourites from the last twenty years include (in order) Age of Wonders III, Zeus: Master of Olympus, Crusader Kings II, Seven Kingdoms II, and Warlords III. Strategy fans will know that that's a fairly ecclectic mix of strategy sub-genres. Well, three days after purchasing Dominions 4 I can safely say that it has a place somewhere near the top of my list. I can't stop playing this game.\n\nI'd heard whispers about the Dominions series down through the years. Legend had it that it was the most hardcore of the hardcore. In all honesty its reputation was rather intimidating. The ancient sages were right: I was baffled for my first three games. However, don't think that it's a project to merely get into Dominions 4. It really isn't. The appropriate phrase is, \"easy to learn, difficult to master.\" That's Dominions 4.\n\nThe supreme god who brought order to the universe has disappeared, leaving it to a bunch of pretender gods to fight it out for His former position. You are one of those pretenders. Your first decisions will include what faction you want to control, which age of time you wish to play in, what physical form you'll take in the world, and how your influence will impact the lands under your dominion. The depth behind these choices alone is awesome.\n\nOnce you've chosen one of the many pre-made maps (or generated a random one) and have customised the scenario settings to your liking, it's time to conquer the world one province at a time until you've claimed the required number of Thrones of Ascension. Though even the victory condition is customisable.\n\nIn the process of doing this you'll command mighty armies, raise glorious heroes, spread the truth of your holy word, cast powerful spells, quell uprisings, contend with the fickle hand of fate in the form of random events, forge magic items, manage the economics of your realm, and a whole load more. This truly is one of those games that makes it impossible for you to keep track of time while you're playing. You may think that the graphics are simplistic (and they are), but trust me, after five minutes I don't see pixels anymore. All I see are my Atlanteans (or \"Atlantians\" as these developers have it) emerging from the ocean to crush all before them. I can't remember the last game I played that was so immersive. Your expectations would be better adjusted by considering Dominions 4 a board game with animated battles.\n\nOne thing that made me hesitate to buy the game were the number of reviews (positive ones) that cast a negative light on the single-player. This concerned me since I never have any interest in multiplayer whatsoever and only buy games for solo play. I'm very glad I decided to take a risk because the AI is a worthy opponent even on \"Normal\" difficulty. Looking through the updates I can see that a lot of work has been done on the AI since the time of release which probably accounts for the earliest reviews complaining about it and my experience towards the end of 2015 being totally different.\n\nBy this point in my review you'll probably already know whether or not this is the game for you, but let me share some of the cool elements in Dominions 4. You can rename not only your pretender god, but also any of your commanders. The factions in the game (there's loads of them) are all totally unique and change depending on the age you choose to play in. Those factions are all based on mythology from around our world, meaning you can live out your Arthurian or Atlantean fantasies (you have them too, right?) Your heroes can get wounded, which may involve losing one or more limbs. Characters will age and can weaken as they get older before finally dying, however some species live longer than others. The combat is detailed to the point that each unit not only has specified methods of attack, but does particular types of damage too. You can fight on the ocean floor, and some factions are aquatic. The music is wonderful.\n\nIn conclusion, Dominions 4 is one of those games that you come away from with a thousand hilarious and tragic tales to tell. It's perfect for emergent storytelling. In terms of being a strategy game, yes it's highly complicated and very deep, but it doesn't put a brick wall in front of you. With each game you play you'll utilise the latest thing you've learned until at last you understand the dynamics in play. This discovery process doesn't make you groan at the prospect of facing it; it excites you and makes you want to learn more. You'll be thinking about potential strategies as you lie in bed at night. The fact that the entire Dominions series is created by just two guys (under the company name \"Illwinter Game Design\") makes all the great aspects of the game even more amazing.\n\nOn a final note: I've ordered the physical manual available from the game's website.

He had assembled an army of 80 men clad in the finest black steel, his own black armor was forged by the master smiths of Ulm, the two handed black halberd heavy enough to chop through even a knight and his horse. He strode forward with the weapon in hand, alone except for his thoughts when movement through his narrow eyeholes in his helmet drew his attention. A man clothed all in black stared at him, nodded and ran forward a longsword appearing in his hands.\n\nGawain parried the first blow with a sweep of his halberd and launched a furious blow diagonally downward catching the man across the legs as he attempted to dodge the blow. The man stumbled but still stood, blood poured from the massive gashes across his legs, crippled and limping the man could barely move and Gawain laughed as he stepped in close to deliver the final blow. The man, just barely staying on his feet slashed desperately at the young prince....and blade met flesh and tore through into open air only to bite into flesh and rip through again. \n\nGawain stared at the spurting bloody stumps where his hands and part of his forearms had been. The huge black halberd lay on the ground next to him his hands still clutched tightly around the handle. The young prince screamed as the pain assailed him and he tried to stumble backwards, away from the man with the blade but his eyes locked onto the blade the man was swinging and he could not bring himself to turn his back and die without seeing. No, the young prince would not die at all. Still screaming in pain but feeling anger flair in his chest Gawain hurled himself at the man with the sword and without a fist to swing found himself kicking with all his strength into the mans chin. \n\nWith a loud crack the man fell backwards and lay still. Gawain stared at the motionless body for a few seconds and stumbled away. His blood dripped onto the ground and he found himself feeling rather tired. In the distance he could hear the shouts of his men. Dully he thought they might've been drawn by the sounds of battle or his screams. Either way, they would find him soon. Sighing he sat down against a tree, and waited nothing in the world but exhaustion and pain.\n\nTLDR: New commander had an assassination attempt on him, gave the attacker cripple and limp afflictions with first blow, and then got both his arms cut off, then he kicked the assassin to death.

I can't even concieve of how long it would take to complete a single game, and not because of any kind of \"gameplay\", simply hours and hours of clicking the same thing in menus. \n\nA building queue. That's all it would take. Let me queue up multiple buildings to be built, like you can with infantry. If I have 20 provinces, I have to go back and build every single building individually 20 times.

I could go into MSPaint, write the word \"build this\" and click it a few hundred thousand times and get pretty much the same experience. \n\nThe actual game? The infantry battles, the heroes, the actual \"PLAYING\" part? It's awesome. It was really fun! It's really in depth, a lot of tactics involved, and I loved it! But how does this game not have a better management system!? HOW?! How has not a single fan of this game told the developers \"Hey you know what would be a good idea? The ability to queue up buildings.\" How can I possibly reccomend a game where I would completely cut out 50% of the \"gameplay\" if I could? It's horrendous. It's inhuman.

Its negative aspects are relatively minor, especially to attentive players who prefer gameplay to pretty pictures.\n\nSo let's address those negatives, shall we? I see two complaints more than any other: the interface and the graphics.\n\nIn regard to the former, everything is labelled one way or another and any and every action you take during your turn can be changed or undone until such time as you click the \"End Turn\" button. For attentive players, the interface should be no problem after a few minutes of browsing and experimentation.\n\nWhile I agree the graphics aren't pretty, I would argue that they don't need to be. As Dominions 4 is a turn-based strategy, there's no pressure to be able to identify everything immediately on sight. The graphics are sufficient in light of the type of game Dominions 4 is. Were it real-time, then I would agree entirely with the argument of sub-par graphics. As a bit of a tangeant, the game is a very small download, thanks in large part to the lesser graphics.\n\nDominions 4 has perhaps more positives than I can list, mostly in the form of its complex mechanics. While I would love to comment on them, I'm just trying to promote interest in the game, not write guides for it. Dominions 4 handles similarly to Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic, in that the map is divided into spaces (called Provinces) and armies are composed of commander units who lead squads of lesser soldiers. Assuming either series is of interest to you, I would suggest looking into this game as well.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Dominions 4 is a turn-based strategy with many complex mechanics that appeal to people looking for thoughtful gameplay and strategy over simplicity and high-end graphics.

I played as R'lyeh (named for the city in which Cthulhu lies in deathless dreams) and zerg rushed everything unfortunate enough to be underwater. Then I turned my attention to the land. This is difficult as R'lyeh, as most units available to it can only survive underwater or with costly magic to allow them to breathe air or transport them in a bubble of water, and my enemies had fortified the coast at this point. So instead of raiding their ports the traditional way I summoned a bunch of sea trolls, which can survive both on land and underwater, and had them repeatedly throw themselves into suicide missions along a coastal region until the area was strewn with corpses. Then I marched the Eater of the Dead, a massive undead horror summoned from a nether realm that feeds on corpses to grow in power until it inevitably becomes too powerful for its summoner to control and breaks free, wreaking havoc indiscriminately, over to the battlefield and had it gorge itself. It broke free quickly and began rampaging, but this was all according to plan- I cast a spell to freeze the oceans over, so it could not get back down to my oceanic empire, yet was free to destroy all unfortunate enough to live above sea level. Sadly, I did not comprehend the importance of proselatyzing, so belief in me gradually ran out throughout the empire, until I had no divine dominion left and lost anyway.\n\nSince then I have played as the lavamen of Abysia and created a second sun so there was eternal burning day, crippling the offencive of my cold-loving Niefelheim foes; As the Ashen Empire of Ermor, an undead post-apocalyptic Roman empire that spreads like an infection, turning the world into skeletons, and did the opposite, blotting out the sun and causing the entire world to age at an incredible rate (skeletons have great longevity, humans not so much); As Kailasa, an Indian-themed realm of reincarnating monkey gurus, I used the power of the stars to transform a demigod of mercy into a ruthless and indiscriminate killing machine, flying around the world with a shapeshifting dragon princess she once saved in tow and bringing destruction upon my enemies; As the amphibious subterranean civilisation of Agartha I broke an ancient seal, releasing mad gods upon the world; And so on- These are only the more prominent examples, stories many players are likely to experience because they align with each nation's strengths and lore.\n\nMake no mistake, Dominions is only superficially yet another army-management turn-based wargame. In fact it is more of a game about great magical beings at war with each other, and the havoc they wreak in their strife for supremacy. Like certain other absurdly complex modern CRPGs with minimalistic graphics (the most prominent being Dwarf Fortress), Dominions has decent gameplay, but its real strength is in its equally complex and convoluted lore and the intriguing stories that come from it.\n\nOne of my favourite games, strongly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1436903966, "timestamp_updated": 1436903966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16982531": {"recommendationid": "16982531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001933064", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500055784}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game.

Good games (imo) arnt all about the graphics but they're bad enough to make it hard to play.\n\n2. starting a game you are presented with a dizzying array of nations, gods and possible setups, the most complex part of the game is deciding on your setup - but you really have to understand the game quite well in order to do this, these choices are fundamental and important. There is no guidance in game that helps a new player, the 397 page pdf manual is little or no help (once you find it) googling 'dom4 nation setup' gives lots of forum postings by those who use so many acronyms they're illegible.\n[e.g. EA Neif Monolith E9A1E6 D6 O3P3C3G1M3D0 - really didnt help me - though now I know the game better I can see is a helpful build suggestion]\n\nIn short you really have to put work in to get to the point where the game is anything more than a turn based terrirtory domino fall game of conquest.\n\nDominions 4 is however far more than that. Yes you can just pump troops out and spread your gods dominion by attacking and taking over all other gods territories but there is so much more here once you look. Research of spells & items to forge add a lot but other than being a wider available choice you get similar tech tree approaches in many other games. \nAdding the divine to the game is a somewhat new, interesting and brilliant twist - the aim is not global military dominion but instead for your god to spread his dominion to the world, to spread belief in your god to the exclusion of all other gods. Belief can cross borders stepping right over a turtled mass of troops in a pinch point.\n\nAs a suggestion:\n1. find the online pdf manual (linked in guides) play the 9 turn by rote guide to controls (found somewhere about 90 pages in interspersed with irrelevant and unhelpful history of how the game was made and waffle about the designers inspiration for the game.\n2. Play a Late Age (LA) Nation called Man, dont worry about nation / god setup on a small map against any random land based nation, dont research anything / forge any items just work with longbowmen to get the feel of the game.\n3.

I thoroughly recommend this game for those who enjoy turn based strategy games, and D&D players.\n\nThe game features well researched historical nations fighting alongisde their own mythologies, such as Japanese Ashigaru being supported by Tengu, or Viking raiders paired with dragons. These nations are led by your own custom god who radically changes the territory that he/she/it controls, wether by making it into a fertile and well ordered land or turning it into a disease ridden, unproductive region of unrest. Or your god can simply be a towering behemoth that smashes its opponents to pieces in battle. Both methods are completly viable. The final component is the deep magic system, with apocalyptically powerful spells and summonable creatures divided into different schools. Some nations have excellent soldiers but terrible mages, and vice versa. It is very rewarding to create your own deadly combinations of different nations, gods and magics; the amount of combinations is staggering. The game is still updated fairly often bringing more nations to the increasingly large roster. Furthermore, there are many mods to keep adding content to the game.\n\nHowever, the game can be rather intimidating with a frankly inadequate tutorial, making a read of the manual essential. I had to lose several games before even starting to understand what was going on, and I'm still pretty bad at it. The graphics are certainly functional but they are not exactly good either. In singleplayer there really is no diplomacy to speak of, you are constantly at war with the other players - I think that the lack of diplomacy is the biggest issue the game has.\n\nUltimately, Dominions 4 is a great game that I greatly enjoy playing.", "timestamp_created": 1434115094, "timestamp_updated": 1434115094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502694", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16324992": {"recommendationid": "16324992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044661781", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 116473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494550182}, "language": "german", "review": "Nach Dominions3 scheinen die Neuerungen auf den ersten Blick gering, sind aber alle sehr durchdacht und haben den Spielflu\u00df deutlich verbessert. \nZur generellen Beschreibung: Dom4 ist ein rundenbasiertes Strategiespiel, in dem sich M\u00f6chtegerng\u00f6tter (von einer 750 Jahre alten Hexe, die bei einem Windhauch umf\u00e4llt bis zum Drachen der ganze Provinzen allein planiert) und ihre V\u00f6lker darum streiten, wer denn nun wirklich der neue Gott werden soll. \nBevor man das Spiel \u00fcberhaupt startet, muss nun erstmal die eigene Nation und vor allem ihr M\u00f6chtegerngott ausgew\u00e4hlt werden. Die Auswahl ist gigantisch. Gew\u00e4hlt werden kann, was f\u00fcr eine Kreatur es sein soll, \u00fcber welche Magie sie verf\u00fcgt, welchen Effekt (im Guten wie im schlechten) ihr Glauben auf die Provinzen des eigenen Glaubens (was nicht zwingend identisch mit den eigenen Provinzen ist) hat und wann die Kreatur in Erscheinung treten soll. Jeder Bonus/Malus kostet/bringt Punkte, die dann so entsprechend verteilt werden. W\u00e4hrend der eine also besagten Drachen w\u00e4hlt, diesen nat\u00fcrlich gleich zu SPielbeginn zur Expansion nutzen will, wird dieser vermutlich ein wenig im Magiebereich gehandicapt sein, und auch der Effekt seines Glaubens wird weniger stark sein. Ein anderer Spieler entscheidet sich f\u00fcr einen station\u00e4ren gro\u00dfen Steinsch\u00e4del, der zudem auch erst nach 3 Jahren ins Spielgeschehen eingreift, daf\u00fcr aber dank seiner hohen Magielevels (schon ab Spielbeginn) allen heiligen Einheiten des Spielers einen potentiell sehr gro\u00dfen Buff gibt. Und ein dritter Spieler entscheidet sich wom\u00f6glich f\u00fcr eine agyptische G\u00f6ttin, die nach einem Jahr auftaucht, mit ihren mittleren magischen F\u00e4higkeiten die Zauberer der Nation gut erg\u00e4nzt und au\u00dferdem ein Glauben hat, der sehr viel mehr Gold abwirft, die Forschung erleichtert und die L\u00e4nder fruchtbarer macht.\n\nW\u00e4hrend im Kartenmodus alles abl\u00e4uft, wie man es aus anderen Rundenstrategiespielen kennt(inkl. Zauberrituale, Beschw\u00f6rungen, Gegenst\u00e4nden, Geb\u00e4udebau etc), wird es in den Schlachten richtig interessant. \nDenn in diesen kann man zwar (w\u00e4hrend des Rundenmodus) die Aufstellung w\u00e4hlen, sowie Einheiten grobe Strategieanweisungen geben und den Zauberern einige Zauberspr\u00fcche vorgeben... Doch dann k\u00e4mpft das Spiel diese Schlacht selber aus. Klingt einfach, doch sp\u00e4testens wenn man mal gegen andere Spieler gek\u00e4mpft hat wird man sehen, dass es das definitiv nicht ist. Und umso sp\u00e4ter im Spiel, umso mehr Magie ist verf\u00fcgbar und umso aufwendiger und umfangreicher werden die Kampfskripte. Und w\u00e4hrend ein Anf\u00e4nger wohl einfach noch alle seine Truppen vorrennen l\u00e4sst und die Zauberer den besten Schadenszauberspruch, den er kennt, zaubern l\u00e4sst, wird ein Spieler mit Erfahrung schnell die Feinheiten des Systems erkennen, und mit gezielten Archerdecoys, Flankenangriffen und kompositionsabh\u00e4ngigen Buffs und Debuffs den Kampf f\u00fcr sich entscheiden. \nAlles in allem sind die Schlachten meist sehr nachvollziehbar, auch wenn es einige Zeit braucht, die Feinheiten zu erkennen und die Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr das Geschehen zu erschlie\u00dfen. \n\nGr\u00f6\u00dftes Manko des Spiels ist mit Sicherheit seine Zug\u00e4nglichkeit. Wer sich nicht zumindest das Handbuch einmal komplett durchgelesen hat, wird extreme Probleme haben. Und auch danach ben\u00f6tigt man \u00fcblicherweise zum Spielen ein paar externe Tools, wie zum Beispiel dom4inspector, der einem eine gut aufbearbeitete \u00dcbersicht \u00fcber alle Einheiten, Gegenst\u00e4nde, Zauber etc zeigt. Und dann gibt es noch viele n\u00fctzliche Hotkeys, die quasi nirgends erw\u00e4hnt sind, und meist nur per Mund-zu-Mund Propaganda weiter gereicht werden.

Every faction is different - and I mean different not just cosmetically, but to the very essence. To give an example to show the contrast between the factions:\n\nLate Age Agartha is a nation of cave-dwellers. Their version of cavalry rides cave drakes, their mages are skilled in earth and death magic. They also recieve a bonus to alchemy. Their best soldiers require a large amount of resources to produce. Since most of their soldiers have darkvision or are already blind, they don't get harmed from spells like Solar Eclipse and Darkness. \n\nLate Age Lemuria is a land of the Undead (it's basically a fantasy counterpart of Ancient Rome which gets corrupted). The extent of your pretender god's dominion will always kill off the populace in provinces. You then use these dead bodies to bolster your army with spectral centurions, velites, and consuls  - not through training, but through summoning with spells. Thus, you have little use for gold or resources.\n---\nThere are also many Pretender Gods to choose from. From a mere sculpture that has gained power through millenia of worship, to a divine burning glyph, from a titan of the sea, to a dragon. You can further customize your pretender by changing the effects of its dominion (the extent of its power), and its capabilities in magic.\n\nUnits differ wildly. Some are only recruitable in some regions, most are only available to a single nation. They have tons of attributes, a stat sheet, and commander/spellcaster/scout/priest units have an inventory for items.\n\nThe graphics are a bit of a shame, it's true. Most of the time, you won't even watch the battle replays, the random map generator creates ugly looking maps. However, the userbase (and potentially you will too), have created some lovely looking maps, worthy of Tolkien himself.\n\nThe gameplay is very complex. I don't like Let's Play videos, so I had to learn by myself. You'll need a bit of patience, some intuition, and curiosity to understand fully how it works.\n\nBut here's why this game is really worth playing: The storytelling.\nThe richness of the world and its backstory will pull you in. Every single unit type has a story. Every \"hero\" type character has the potential to be your favourite character in the game. \nYou will spend astral magic gems, month after month, empowering Sybil - your Oracle fountain pretender goddess. And you will craft the most powerful of items, to arm Eteonos - a 54 year old Strategos. Eteonos is 54 years old. His best years should be behind him, but he still fights with the vigour and heart of a young hoplite. A shaman you've recruited helped you put a spell over your dominion - where creatures of all kinds age slowly and every wound heals given time, even a lost eye or limb. Eteonos's stiffening joints move with ease, his reflexes and strength are active as ever. You don him with the arms and armor of the Warrior of Dawn, and you send him to the Arena, to fight other champions on your behalf, to bring honour on to your name, and win the prized Champion's Helmet.\nWill he succeed? W\u0130ll he fail? Who knows.

Here's what you'll find in the game\n\nPros:\n- The largest variety of choices I've seen in any video game.\n- Over twenty races, each radically different in a way that still tends to balance itself out.\n- Three eras of play, each radically affecting said twenty races. Changes range from shifting their focus to turning them into different nations entirely.\n- Weird and wonderful lore everywhere.\n- A robust and well-crafted magic system.\n-Most of the actual micromanagement is under the hood, and a lot of things can be automated, allowing you to spend your time on the more important stuff.\n- It'll run on a potato.\n\nCons:\n- Said choices are shoved in your face up front, and even with the handy tooltips, it's hard to get what they all mean.\n- Unless you read the doorstopper of a manual, you will be confused. And even then, it takes experimentation to actually know what every number means.\n- The wrong mistake at the wrong time can send your entire civilization kicking and screaming into the abyss.\n- Multiplayer is plagued by a meta nearly as bad as DOTA 2.\n- All that important stuff you micromanage?

It\u2019s a fantasy title and has something like 10,000+ unique spells between the different factions.\n\nYour deity\u2019s avatar (pretender god) will appear at some point, which you preset. You pick the time period you want to start the game in, which will affect technology and available starting factions. You need a pretty hefty system to run it at max fps, there\u2019s a lot of calculations that go on in the background. The graphics aren\u2019t spectacular either way. Combat is hands off. You set the tactics and formations your commanders will use, as well as the dispositions of the units. Spying will help you know how to set your tactics. Proselytizing will give you advantages as the faith of the locals will change advantages. Watching post-combat reports and fact sheets will be hugely beneficial on how you change your tactics for the next conflict with that particular army. As you learn the game it becomes even deeper. The dev\u2019s made it so it\u2019s easy to make your own maps, and the community has uploaded quite a few between Dominions 3-4. The game does allow you to build up territories that you control. You can also search for places of power, which give you advantages. Research will allow you to have access to more powerful spells (and better craftables), which allow you to more fully utilize the power of your casters (individual units have caps on capabilities and with what kinds of spells they can utilize; it\u2019s all part of the strategy).\n\nI\u2019ve enjoyed this title, and if you like strategy games this is a title you will like. It\u2019s from a small dev team, which has a long heritage of solid strategy/tactical games. If you buy it from the dev\u2019s website (or their publisher) you will get the DRM-free version as well as a steam key.

To quote Maxi\u2019s review \u201cIf you really usually jump for TLDRs don't bother getting the game.\u201d\n\nI want to be clear about this, I love this game. I think it's great fun. I've sunk around 100 hours into Dominions 3, with another 70 into Dom 4. I think Dom 4 is a flat out improvement from its predecessor, and given the choice I would chose to play Dom 4 every time. That said this is not really a game that I could recommend to my friends, let alone to some stranger on the Internet. To start off the graphics are old fashioned and I know a LOT of people who will turn up their nose at a game just because it doesn't look pretty. If the idea of some simple sprites moving across a painted background isn't your idea of an acceptable battle animation then turn around and walk the other way. \n\nThe combat may also be something that turns people off. The combat works through a scripting element, something that was designed in part so that players could engage in multiplayer through a play by email style (if that doesn't show you that the game might have some antiquated design ideas hanging around, I don't know what will). This means that you as a player cannot engage in combat in real time, it happens between game turns and you receive a summary and video of what happened in the combat while you were away. You set up your units, tell them where to go and what to do (within certain limitations of course. You cannot, for instance, order your archers to stop firing if friendlies come into danger of being shot, nor can you order your troops to wait more or less than two turns before charging headlong into the enemy), and then they handle everything by themselves without any more input by you. This can sometimes make you feel as though you are being cheated, like if you didn't get a very good scout report and the enemy wound up having cavalry you weren\u2019t prepared for that decimate your troops with their lances. Maybe if you could alter orders on the fly, you would have ordered your mages to cast a spell to stop or slow the cavalry instead of trying to buff your own troops. I find this to just be part of the game, and I enjoy the strategic fetters it places upon my gameplay. Some people, though, may not. This, I think, is the main point of contention one will have with the game. If you can find yourself enjoying the combat, then you'll probably be fine. That said, there are a smattering of more tedious issues that can still turn you away.\n\nOne such issue is micromanagement. On a small map with one to four other nations, you can manage your little empire without too much of a struggle. If you try to play on a large map with 12+ nations, you'll be working through a micromanagement slog the likes of which you may have not even comprehended before. If you are playing as a nation with heavy troops capable of only moving one province per turn, may the Pantokrator help you. Add in the fact that the UI is not great, and you might not even know how to do the thing that you want to do. I love micro (I play vanilla Dwarf Fortress as well), and I don't mind referring to the manual when I forget how to do a little thing like copy orders or make a mage cast the same spell every month, but if you aren't willing to find those little time saving things the micro can weigh you down even more quickly.\n\nThe last detractor is the AI, and this is the only real reason I'll ever take a break from the game. Dominions is the kind of game that was always developed with multiplayer in mind, and I think that the game gives players a lot of tools to build, execute, and adapt to different strategies. While I haven't played any multiplayer in my time with the game, I have seen several games and read a lot of the theorycrafting involved. While that isn't the same as playing a MP game, I think it gives me a measure of insight into how the game can function differently in MP as opposed to SP. Sadly, the AI isn't very good at using a lot of those strategic tools designed for human players. For example, let's say you have two kinds of units that can \"hold the line\" and buy time for either your ranged units or mages to kill the enemy. The first are heavily armored pikemen capable of repelling, and thus negating, enemy melee attacks. The second are heavy infantry with a shield, these ones better prepared to tank volleys of arrows. While I can build both and adapt which one I need depending on my opponent, I see the AI often just building one or the other and fielding that against all opponents regardless of attrition rate, or building both in equal numbers (which admittedly isn\u2019t a very bad idea if you haven\u2019t seen what your opponent's army looks like, but if I march in with a cadre of longbowmen maybe some more shield guys would be prudent). I have seen the AI do some cool things, I was foiled often in my early days by some spell I didn't even know about, but after a while I find myself wishing that the AI could bring something new and exciting to the table (Master enslave. Just once, I want to have to worry about Master Enslave in single player). Of course, this doesn't keep me away for long. The AI is fun enough to face at high difficulties that I enjoy myself, and after a while I just think of a new exciting thing that I want to try, so I don't care if the AI isn't amazing. \n\nAll in all, none of these things stop me from loving this game. I walk away from time to time, but I always find myself coming back, or even just thinking about the game when I'm taking a break from it. If none of the things I mentioned sound like they would bother you, then I would encourage you to go read some multiplayer threads, watch lets play videos, or in the best case scenario ask a friend of yours who has the game to let you try it. While I jumped into the Dominions series blindly and wound up loving it, I know that I'm exceptional in that regard. I don't think this game appeals to the average gamer, or even to the average strategy gamer. I think this is a game for the kind of person who was never bothered by the Dwarf Fortress UI or \u201cfun,\u201d who always thought the diplomatic options in Civilization were just there for babies that didn't have the guts to earn their victory on the point of their spear, who likes the idea of a world in which no one is ever the \"good guy,\" and who doesn't mind playing a game that might not be balanced if that imbalance allows one to tell a better story. Most importantly though, it is a game for someone who doesn't mind gambling 35$ on a game they may very well not like. If that doesn't sound like you, then that's fine. But if you're the special kind of crazy for whom it does, I'll be waiting here for you. Just you try to take my throne away from me.

I think perhaps the developers avoided that as they wanted a board game style that didn't get bogged down with combat.  The result is that, without extensive forum-diving, the average player will end up simply building large armies and throwing them around with no preconception of what will be effective.\n\nOn the other hand, the game developer continually updates the game and there are avid players from whom one might receive help.

Quality updates continue to trickle in, and I'm more than glad some of my money went to help the devs, and the future of Dominions.\n\nFor a \"real\" review, I'll talk about how the game plays. For each turn, you: 1. create new units or commanders and assign troops to those commanders 2. decide if you want to build any structures (temple, science-research, and castle/fortress/fortifications, basically) 3. assign new magic-school research, if needed 4. issue move orders, if any 5. End Turn. I mention this because I know, at first glance, Dominions 4 seems like it might be one of those \"Cool concept, but too complicated to play!\" kind of games, when it is not..\n\nThe game is nowhere near shallow, despite the above statement. Each faction (spanning through three different eras of time) has many tricks and strategies, some obvious and some downright devious, and \"learning\" a faction is quite challenging.. Adapting to your opponents strategy is also serious business..\n\nThere is no \"diplomacy\" here.. If Pangaea has a massive army of elite Shark Tribe warriors supported with massive underwater behemoths, well.. There is no \"playing nice\" :) Your goal is to conquer, one way or another..\n\nAnyway, I'm sure there are far better reviews than mine, so I'll quit rambling.

It is good, but it is by no means worth as much as they are charging for it. I decided against that, however, because how much money a player is willing to throw around will vary greatly from one to the next, and I want this review to be based solely on the experience of playing the game, rather than on the experience of buying it.\n\nThe game is very complex, and you will probably have to play several times before you are even aware of all of the options available to you during play. There are many factions to choose from, and some of them play quite differently from others. I have probably spent as many hours reading the 400+ page manual as I have browsing through the character creation screens, designing \"pretender gods\". If you saw the screenshots, and didnt lose interest immediately, then you very likely are the kind of player who can set aside graphics for depth of content, and this game will reward your attitude.\n\nIf I were to seek to complain, two things would come to mind. ONE: the user interface could really use some work. There are many icons which can be clicked which give absolutely no indication of it, and many things you would think were interactable which serve no function at all. It is very easy to lose track of an army or leader, and then discover him again 40 turns later, only to realize hes gone to waste all that time. And TWO: much of the depth of this game is merely superficial. Many units are near carbon copies of others, only a single stat apart, and once you throw them both into a battle, you wont see any difference. You can research volumes of spells, and build hundreds of items, but most of these things will \"come out in wash\", as they say, proving to be mere distractions when it comes right down to it... although I certainly enjoyed being distracted, as such.\n\nIf you get a boner looking through pages and pages of stats and lore, while micromanaging every tiny aspect of a massive and complex empire, than you are going to love the hell out of Dominions 4. If you want to learn to play a game you spent 40 bucks on, in less than 10 hours, then you will hate it.

Each and everything you control (or don't) in this game has their characteristics explained in one or two paragraphs entwined with lore which in the end is mythology.\n\nTL;DR: If you really usually jump for TLDRs don't bother getting the game.... there will be long necessary reading in the game and honestly you will need lots of patience to learn it!

There seemed to be awesome depth, with tons of units, races, leaders, status modifiers, spells, and victory conditions.  My first game I picked a magic heavy leader with a race balanced between magic and combat.  I left faith at the wayside and pursued magic early on.  Magic is very costly to develop, and gives very little back, not to mention the high cost when you do use it.  I switched to being combat heavy and did well, though I was still trying to grasp all the nuances of battle (it has tons of options, but is ultimately autocalced).  the enemy had a delayed start, and when they did come unto the scene I beat them at every turn, though my casualties got higher with each battle.  As I started to clinch my victory I suddenly lost.  I was out faithed, and my leader suddenly died due to such.  so for my second game I sat down and tried to figure out a better approach.  I realized that just by dumping all my points into faith, and picking a race that had good priests I would win without having to win many battles, or develop any magic.  I picked a combat heavy leader, but maxed out faith, and picked the race with the best priests.  Early on I was too aggressive and suffered a lot of losses.  In the end I was a push over in every area, except faith (which i was being very innefficiant at), and I won easily.\n\nThe problem is that faith is cheap and easy, and there is no way to remove it as a victory condition.  Have a low faith side, and end up dead quick.  Have a High faith side and almost auto win.  Don't get me wrong, the faith mechanics other than your leader insta dying are great.  In fact most aspects of this game is great, however all of it means nothing due to the current death by faith mechanic.  balancing all enemies to have the same faith is the only way to actually use the majority of the game's mechanics, which is easiest to do via multiplayer with humans.\n\nEDIT: After the patches it is now seems somewhat balanced better, though the AI can't really keep up with all but the newest players (doesn't handle faith well and tends to end up killing itself off) so I can't really recomend the game for singleplayer use.

The game lets you take mythological lore from around the world and pit it in wars for ultimate domination. You will see Titans warring against undead legionares, yomi fighting against valkeries, and lich kings unleashing death on the men of Avalon.\n\nTo me, Dom4 feels like a Ck2/Total War-esque type of strategy game, where you fight to expand your territory, spread your dominion (religion), and develop your nation. Where it really shines is its deep magical paths and unit diversity. I play the game with my second monitor open to the Dom4 mod inspector (http://larzm42.github.io/dom4inspector/) where I can compare and contrast every item, spell, unit, and magic site in the game. With 25 nations in each time period, combined with the numerous magic paths one can decide to branch into, their are many many combinations of strategies and development. In other words, no two players may play the same nation the same way, they may play off different strengths depending on how they designed their pretender (leading god of their nation).\n\nThis game to me is an easy to play, tough to master - which opens up for hours and hours of gameplay. You can play against the AI who offer a fair challenge (albeit becoming predicatble as you play more - such is expected with strategy AI), and when you seek a higher challenge it offers both real time and play by email multiplayer. I didn't think I would enjoy the play by email system but it's really relaxing to have a few games going at once and getting to do a turn or two per day before and after work/school. I always look forward to downloading my turns and seeing how my wars turned out, what kind of events popped out, and coming up with a plan for the next turn. All the while trying to formulate long term magic goals that will keep me relevant into the late game.\n\nIn short, if you enjoy strategy, fantasy, mythology, or games such as Total war, Paradox strategy titles, or even the Civ series, do yourself a favour and give Dominions 4 a try.", "timestamp_created": 1423191911, "timestamp_updated": 1423191911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746071", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14331681": {"recommendationid": "14331681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027547845", "num_games_owned": 800, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431140763}, "language": "english", "review": "A really good turn-based 4X strategy game.

Unlike in games like Master of Magic where you can easily pick the spells you want to cast with your nation all the time to develop a theme or strategy that enhances the weak points or strengths of your race. Now, you can design your pretender to cast any spells you want. But this is a strategic game and your caster can only be in one place at one time and can usually only cast one of the big spells and then he/she/it is knocked unconscious. Its not very fun and does not make a lot of sense to me.\n\n2- Low Strategic Value/Adaptability offered by units - As with spells, each race has a handful of units that are great at certain things but there was not a lot of strategic decision making offered by the units. After you get used to constructing a line of spearmen who can push back units or are fronted by trampling war elephants/cavalry, there is little to be done adapting to an opponent. I wished spells or different units could respond better to the how the game changes on the combat scene, but it does not offer any adaptibility.\n\n3- The Strategy Game that makes you work - This is a big one for me. I don't mind researching unit stats and comparing them to each other. I really dont mind reading a 400 page manual to find out how each of the different nations function on a strategic level. But trying to figure out what spells you can and can't cast and trying to plan for it...and then just trying to see if it is even worth it because it feels like half of the spells are worthless in most situations ( aka, only affecting the weak ass caster with a melee damage buff...wtf...i guess this would be only for pretenders), is just frustrating.\n\nSo overall, I gave Dominions 4 a pretty fair shake. It has so much that would have been fun with a bit more tweaking and forethought, but the warfare is too one dimensional and cookie cutter. \n\nNot recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1421887571, "timestamp_updated": 1421887571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14082801": {"recommendationid": "14082801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043070902", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465640309}, "language": "english", "review": "Has foxes, must buy.", "timestamp_created": 1421766884, "timestamp_updated": 1421766884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14074216": {"recommendationid": "14074216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031970141", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 64042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514575429}, "language": "english", "review": "I find Dominions 4 to be fascinatingly intricate and polished, a credible result for 10+ years of dedicated evolution over four sequels, from what I've gathered.

There aren't too many games in which you can raise a Hydra, magically give it the ability to lead troops, and then make him the prophet of your faith; or to take a Hoburg (think Hobbit...), give him a magical item that makes him larger, and then give him boots to (literally) walk all over his enemies.    Or, say, for irony's sake summon an a powerful angel and equip him with weapons and armor gained only with the extensive sacrifice of virgins... if you want to play a drunk, demented (or both) god, this might amuse you.  I find outlandish prophets and strangely geared units funny, and I'd rather drink instead of methodically optimize my research and armies, so this is what I tend to do.\n\nIf you'd rather play it straight and less goofy, and you want competent opponents, then there's the multiplayer mode -- either via PBEM, or with one player hosting a server.\n\nWhile the game doesn't support Workshop mode, it's quite moddable (sprites and text files) when it comes to adding new units or factions or modifying existing ones.  If you and your friends think that some spells are completely unacceptable, you could mod the game to make them inaccessible.   Too cheap units could be made more expensive.  And so forth.  Heck, if you wanted everybody to start with a single-use unit named \"Nuclear Missile\" that could teleport 10 provinces away and cast a kill-everything-on-battlefield spell but would vaporize after its first battle, you could -- you'd need to define the slay-all spell (presumably called \"Explode\" or \"DEFCON 1\"), create a unit with desired stats and a trait that makes it die after a battle, and rig it to autocast the spell when battle starts; and then you'd mod the starting forces for each faction to include the missile unit.

I purchased the game on sale, but after having played it I would recommend it even for full price to anyone who's looking for a deep, complex strategy game.\n\nDominions 4 plays like a highly advanced fantasy version of Civilization or similar turn-based games. That's not to say that it's super difficult to play - the basic mechanics are pretty simple once you get the hang of the somewhat odd control scheme where LMB is used for most things where you'd normally expect to use RMB (RMB is always used to get more info on something, instead of giving orders). I was able to feel somewhat competent without any tutorials, having only watched some brief gameplay on YouTube. However the game reveals layer after layer of complexity once you really start getting into it, and it definitely follows the \"easy to play, hard to master\" philosophy. There will be a learning curve once you get beyond the basics - the manual is almost 400 pages long.\n\nSo, what can you do in this game that makes it worth the time instead of just playing a Civilization?\n* Choose a faction and a pretender god as its leader from just about any mythology and creature you can think of. Dragons, wizards, lizard men, frost giants, weird fungus monsters, sea serpents, cthulu, you name it.\n* Recruit a general for every one of your armies, with his own name (given by you), stats, equipment, and experience.\n* Separate your armies into formations and give them orders to follow in battle (you still don't need to micromanage the battles themselves; they play out between turns)\n* Sacrifice virgins to your blood god and use the power to summon demons or forge magical artifacts.\n* Spread your icy dominion to freeze over rivers so your armies can cross it.\n* Call forth an army of undead and march it into the sea to surprise your enemy or control undersea territory.\n* Cast a spell to plunge the entire world into utter darkness.\n* March huge armies over all the land, then suddenly lose the game because no one believes in your god anymore (yeah, that happened to me).\n\nSo if you can get past the graphics (yeah, I know, it takes a lot to get past the graphics), you'll be rewarded with a rich, cerebral, highly replayable game in Dominions 4.", "timestamp_created": 1420749038, "timestamp_updated": 1420749038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900135", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13894671": {"recommendationid": "13894671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039402834", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 31648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423405362}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredibly deep turn-based strategy game with fascinating and deligtfully detailed game lore.

Single player AI is remarkably useless creation that in battle contends itself with throwing completely random selections troop at you, with no ability to plan strategies or conduct diplomacy. Make no mistake, Dominons 4 is a multiplayer game to the bone, and much of it's lasting appeal is directly in proportion to how much you enjoy scheming and devicing strategies for beating human players. \n\nThe multiplayer system itself is frankly archaic, requiring the hosting of an old-fashioned game server for other players to connect to and upload their turns to specific games. Individual matches might run for months at a time. \n\nThe magic system while complex, is daunting to master and requires memorization of the vast spell lists to properly use. There are numerous exploitable mechanics that are slow to get fixed, as well as a plethora of bugs.\n\nDespite all it's flaws, Dominions 4 is still a true gem for turn-based strategy fans.

Now this is my only downside to the game... multiplayer is by far the best experience ever, but the time/difficulty to join or create  a game is frustrating... and I end up playing single player becaue I just cant be bothered to spend so much time finding a multiplayer game.\n\nDont be offset by the graphics, its really not what this game is about, think of it in terms of a board game, a really, really complex yet enjoable board game where you strategy to beat your opponents are so diverse, thet the entire game is about finding counters and opening using different tequniques, units and spells. Earthquakes of firestorms, awe or poison, flaming arrows or undead elephants, summon demon riders or archangels, go economy or blood sacrifices, dominion kill or assassination, compete in death matches or forge powerful magic items to choose rom 8 different elemental forces, each with specific reqirments and unique powers, use flying units or underwater units, choose a powerful fighting god or a researcher, awake or asleep for more points to your empire, and it goes on and on.... I just scratched the surface of endless possibilities...\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1419606761, "timestamp_updated": 1419606761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13612285": {"recommendationid": "13612285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135540046", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 35077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510617333}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5b89\u5229\u516c\u53f8\u51fa\u54c1\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1419604576, "timestamp_updated": 1419604771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571358", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13611508": {"recommendationid": "13611508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019091407", "num_games_owned": 730, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472135074}, "language": "english", "review": "best turn based strategy out there. a million ways to play it!", "timestamp_created": 1419601907, "timestamp_updated": 1419601907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13610891": {"recommendationid": "13610891", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965771164", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 54998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506906396}, "language": "english", "review": "Dominions 4 is a grand strategic game where you play as the god of one of the 77 nations available (spread out over three eras: Early, where magic is plentiful, technology is not, and giants (as well other magical beings) are common; Middle, the time of iron; and Late, time of steel and the ascendance of man.)\n\nEach nation is fully fleshed out, based off of different myths, and has their own strengths, weaknesses, and quirks.\n\nGameplay is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. You queue up your orders (such as building troops, casting spells, moving, attacking, searching for magic sites, etc.) and, when you've got everything to your liking, you end the turn. Combat takes place simultaneously between turns. Armies are broken into individual soldiers, who are placed into squads. Each general has a command limit of how many men he can lead, and how many squads those can be broken into (although you can make more, at a hit to morale for all the troops under that general) and each squad can be given a formation and basic orders - such as \"attack closest\" or \"fire at archers and keep distance\". Your generals themselves can be given a list of 5 commands as well as an overall tactic - this is best used for mages, who you can instruct to cast specific spells.\n\nThere's research, with 7 different schools (conjuration, alteration, evocation, construction, enchantment, thaumaturgy, and blood magic), all of which offer a cornucopia of spells which are available to your mages, depending on which magic paths they are specialized in.\n\nGenerally speaking, the game can accommodate just about any number of players (up to 25-ish), and there's a huge number of user-made maps, as well as a random terrain generator which does a pretty good job.\n\nThere's a huge number of mods too, which can do anything from changing the cost of a spell all the way up to making entirely new nations. \n\nPros:\n+ One of the deepest strategy games out today.\n+ Battles can be huge, with potentially thousands of troops (each one an individual with its own stats) on either side.\n+ Spells which can cause massive effects.\n\nCons:\n- Interface can be intimidating to a new player.\n- Old-school graphics: functional, but not pretty.\n\nOverall: \n+ If you're a fan of this genre, you should buy this

I say experience, because the gameplay aspect can be lacking compared to other games that are primarily meant to be played single-player(script based combat, turns being resolved all in one go, no interaction with the AI. Stuff that has to be the way it is because it wouldn't work in a 3 month multiplayer game otherwise) \nSo why would you play Dominions 4 in single player? For the incredible amount of background lore, or fluff, the game has to offer. There are three separate Eras, each of which has it's own nations(29 for the Early era, 29 for Middle, 23 for Late Era). Now, the beauty of the nations is that each has a very detailed history, which is usually interlinked to other nations both within the era and outside the era. \n\nFor instance, the nation of Man(boring name, I know) comes to existance in the Middle Era. It's a nation of knights and witches that live deep in the woods. Quite basic stuff, but they are based on several nations from the Early era. In the Early era, there existed the nation of Marverni, a gallic tribal nation that spread out to the faery land of Tir'na'nog. The fae were driven out, and their magic was stolen by those who would become the witches of Man. The magic of these witches is very similar to that of the fae, but also has aspects of a nearby nation of sea giants that has since gone extinct(In gameplay terms, they share national spells and magic paths). With the fae magic, the witches created a holy order of wardens to protect themselves. During the Late Era, many drastic changes have happened. Magic has fled the lands of Man, and the witches have been replaced by a more secular class of mage-judges, who are some of the only ones that can work magic in the mystically drained land. The wardens of old have lost much of the power the witches had imbued them with, and have had to adapt their tactics in the changing world, turning to the use of crossbows from their old melee-only ways. Most of the nations change in a similar way to this, some die out completely with only remnants of their former nation diffused to other nations, and some new nations arise from nothingness, perhaps containing a smattering of elements from the Early Era, despite showing up in the Late Era.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the multiplayer. Where the gameplay was lacking in singleplayer, it's the opposite in multiplayer. It is incredibly deep and satisfying. With so many different nations and hundreds of spells(most of which have a purpose in the game. Though a handful are more or less useless, I think), the different possibilities are quite insane. Perhaps your army is composed of only flying troops, meaning you can fly around the world, striking where the enemy can't defend itself? Perhaps you have spells that can kill enemy commanders, which prevents them from flying around with their armies? Perhaps you have cast a spell of global repercussions which causes the world to be plunged to darkness, where the gold income of every place in the world plummets, unrest increases and battles are fought in pitch black darkness.(quite useful if you use a large amount of undead or you are a cave-dwelling troglodyte). Are your own national troops weak and useless? Well, you can make them more powerful with spells enchanting their strength, or perhaps giving all of them flight during battles, flaming arrows or turning them to mist. Suppose you wanted to summon creatures of legend such as manticores? Perhaps a dead hero you had was dear to you, well you can bring him back as a mummy that causes diseases to anyone nearby! Some may find it useful to craft an artifact sword that causes the temperature on the battlefield to raise, spontaneously combusting troops and causing them to tire out very quickly.  Does your nation lack archers? Why not craft magical bows that shoot a dozen arrows per shot and give a few of them to your commanders, instant ranged ability.\n\nJust keep in mind, Dominions 4 is designed to be played as a slow paced multiplayer game, where you play a turn every few days, so a multiplayer game may last several months. Of course, a singleplayer game is much faster, but since the enemy lacks human ingeniuity, it's far less exciting to play against.", "timestamp_created": 1419585972, "timestamp_updated": 1419585972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498894", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13607202": {"recommendationid": "13607202", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971484093", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483556572}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Turn-based strategy in fantasy/mythology setting at its best.

In short, gameplay is excellent while the graphic/music is really bad in the year 2014. The current US$35 price is a bit too much so I would highly recommend it during a sales. \n\nGameplay: \nFirst of all, there are so many nations to be chosen from. For example, in \"Early Age\" setting, there are currently (\"currently\" because the Dev just added one new nation in a Nov 2014 patch) 29 nations each with different troops (some nations share the same troops because of the fantacy setting) and starting magic strength. As for magic, there are 8 types in total (Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Nature, Death, Astral, and Blood) while the research for spells are divided by schools instead of type (except for \"Blood\", which is both a school and type of magic) so that you can't really too concentrate your research on one school while ignoring the others. \n\nAs for buildings, there are only a few; I guess the Dev want you to spend gold on troops than fancy buildings. \n\nLast but not least, there are hereos for each nation and generic heroes to be summoned by spells. When there are heroes available, you certainly want to equip them with fancy equipments... and yes... there are so many you can build as long as you have researched the magic school level and the magic resources. Although they are called \"Heroes\", they aren't invincible even if they have reached a high experience level or even if you teach them very high magic level. It is because experience only adds small increment to their combat skills while high magic level requires substantial investment and casting stronger magic creates alot more fatique (high fatique can kill them) to the hero. Further, you can't exactly revive heroes in Dominions 4, you can only bring them back as \"mummy\" which is a undead hero. \n\nIf you want to check how many nations, spells, or equipments, you can read the manual from its official website. \n\nGraphic/music:\nThe graphic is really 2008 and there are only like 4 or 5 music in the game.

You get to create a pretender god that's basically your king, you pick his physical form, his proficiency in the different schools of magic (Death, Fire, Earth, Air etc) and the effects your god has on your dominion.\n\nYou got soldiers and you got commanders, commanders lead armies, perform rituals, build buildings, move around on the map, and they can also forge and equip items and search for magic sites in your realm. In this way Dominions 4 has an awesome RPG system, your commanders got stats and traits that affect a lot of things, not only their attributes. For example, there's an item for Ermor that allows my commander to summon 3 lictors for the price of one if I have it equipped. Some items let your armies and commander travel under water or fly. All sorts of cool shit.\n\nThe empire management is awesome, you allocate commanders to research, forge items, lead armies, you search for magic sites that give you gems and other positive effects (or negative).

This character will lead your faction through the game and keeping him alive is extremely important even if you can bring him back after a while. You can customize his appearance (around 20 skins per faction) and his skills to suit your gameplay: Will you be a terrible fighter relying on massiv armies, a talented spell caster focused on searching and summoning powerfull spells or maybe the both and wait few turns until he awakes from his dormant state ?\n\nDominion is a turn based strategy game where you, the pretender god, have to exterminate every other factions or sit on  one of the Thrones of Ascension to reach a new plane of existence and became the god above all other pretender gods.\n\nYou start with a main fortress with different bonus and buildings depending on what kind of faction you have choosen.\nAs an example my favourite faction is R'yleh: Fallen star, inspired of Lovecraft's Cthulhu, this faction has a portal named the \"Void gate\" where you can try to summon new creatures by using a competent summoner.\nEven if you can get some of the most dangerous units of the game, the void gate can bring hostile monsters capable to kill your wizards.\n\nLike for every factions, everything has its price, thinking and planning carefully are keys for victory.\nAll factions are different and quite a lot of them forces you to learn an other way to play the game.\n\nAs an example R'yleh is mainly based on brainwashed magical units and when you need to use humans or humanoid troops, you will be forced to get new commanders and divide your army because magic beeings can only be lead by a magical commander. \nAdd to that the moral and the supplies your army needs wich can affect their health or worst, to be more encline to fail against the enemy dominion and run away.\n\nDominion is an other great aspect of the game. It represents the spread of the culture and the religion of your faction.\nEach pretender god can boost its dominion to give malus to the enemy or bonus to his land.\nAnd it's where the game is clever because quite early you will have to choose if you rush into the battle with spells or try to stay back and research in new magical disciplines to summon many things or affect enemy dominion, ect....\n\nThe game is quite open and give you the ability to enjoy quite a lot of strategies. The A.I is really powerfull and has always, ALWAYS, a way to get the upper hand. \n\nThe screenshots you see on the store page are the recordings of some battles.\nAs a turn-based strategy game, you have to plan everything, from the spell your wizards will cast in the battle, to the actions/ movements your squads will do.\nYou can even choose a formation with bonus and malus. Will you trample the infantry and rush to these coward archers ? Or let you wizards/ range units rain hell upon enemy heroes ?\nThere are plenty ways to manage fights even if you can't act during them.\nBut be ware ! You can enable events wich can affect you on every tiles of the map or everybody and sometimes things turns really bad...\n\nThe most important aspect in Dominion is magic wich is related to an enormous tree of research.\nYou can summon creatures, structures, cast world wide spells, teleport your units, bless and give tons of abilities to your troops such as invisibility, the gift of underwater breathing or flying, ect...\nYou can even forge magical items to give to your commanders !\nEvery spells must but prepared and choosed before each fights or you can let your commander decide but you won't get all the subtleties of magic.\n\nEach school of magic is related to a mana gem that you can gather on the map or with special events. Some kind of currency between your units, you have to manage and give them to you commanders before they go to war. The more you have the better, some schools of magic need slaves for sacrifices and of course give powerfull spells but reduces the stability and the population of your regions. Some factions are even unable to recruit units with gold, so you will have to spare mana gems for the invocation of new troops or commanders !\n\nBut i will stop here for the gameplay because nobody can deal about every aspects in a review.\nThis game is unforgivable and has a slow paced learning curve as many said the game manual has 400 pages...\n\n400 PAGES ! (Thanks to Niky 45 because I was wrong about the  number of pages)\n\nSo you understand why it can be so hard to talk about everything this game has to offer ^^\n\n\n\nAs an  example my last game session: after few hours (22 hours !!) of fail attempts to master Ry'leth and the map i've choosed (the game has quite a ot of maps with different strategies, to master one is allready a prowess...),  I was beaten by and army from a corner of the map (hate thoses war elephants !!!)  capable to  trample my best commanders and units  and with spells I've never seen before !\nI had an army of arround 2000 or 3000 units and Ry'leth has covered about 2 tiers of the world after having slain 6 pretender gods.\nMy pretender god, Kraahaul the Void Lord, died in a miserable fight against this suddent powerfull new enemy...\n\nAnd you know what ? I want more !\n\nEven if you can't build much structures ( only labs, temples and 3 types of castles with their upgrades) and affect your population ( a research tree about the dominion itselft would have been great), or use diplomatic skills between factions (you are at war with everybody) this game is really good.\n\n\nIn fact the perfect strategy game would be a mixt of Dominion, Total War and Warhammer.\nI hope to see the day when this kind of game will come !\n\nIf you are not scared about a very hard/deep strategy game and simple graphics try Dominion 4: Throne of Ascension.\nYou won't be disapointed...\n\nAnd i put you to the test to master R'yleh: Fallen star and spread the void and the tentacles of the Starspawns on all over the world !\n\nMUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !\n\nThis is why i love this game ^^\n\nN.B: i've forgot, this game has a multiplayer. Yeah i know i'm a coward... because i haven't tried it !\nDominions 4: Thrones of Ascension is a game for men, be ware !", "timestamp_created": 1415207155, "timestamp_updated": 1417949034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 125, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841217", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12801819": {"recommendationid": "12801819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019956562", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512847293}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an awesome 'grand-strategy' game.

In the game you control a pretender god and its respective nation of worshipers. Various thrones of ascension exist (based on how you configure the scenario) in different locations around the world map. By claiming enough thrones before the other pretender gods you can attain victory. Each nation has its own units, pretender gods, priest units, magical units and traits. Want to be a Cthulu-esque monstrosity which ushers its amphibious armies from the depths? Do it! Want to be a peace loving and fair deity skilled in the magics of nature? You got it! Forge magical items for your generals and prophets? Spread your dominion to all corners of the globe? Do you want to conduct sacrifices for different benefits? All of these things and more are possible. The game is not perfect, however, as the graphics are dated. And that is being very generous with my wording. I, however, with a deep love of grand strategy and fantasy have found the hours I've explored this game to be quite rewarding.

That may be so, though I don't see how we're supposed to know that in advance -- they certainly don't advertise it that way.  But I'll concede that point and note that this review is targeted mainly at folks interested in the single player experience.\n\nAnyway... I *really* wanted to like this game.  I've been a strategy game addict going back to the days of board games with thousands of little cardboard counters.  So I was as excited as a puppy when I read that Dominions 4 has a 400 page manual.  It had to have incredible depth, right?  Wrong.  It has a lot of *content*, but that's not the same thing.\n\nDominions 4 has hundreds of different spells and units -- but who cares when you can't actually use them?  The game ultimately revolves *entirely* around combat, but combat is always resolved automatically.  At best you're a spectator, but after watching a dozen or so battles with a new faction to get a feel for what combination of units works well, you probably won't even bother with that.\n\nAnd without the ability to participate in combat, there just isn't that much to do.  Despite the creative and well-researched styles particular to each of the many playable factions, no matter which faction you choose, gameplay quickly degenerates into a tedious slog of building units, moving them to the front, and throwing them into combat.  Build, move, repeat.\n\nThe game has features like combat scripting and magic items, but unfortunately they don't affect the *experience* provided by the game.  For example, you can craft a magic sword and equip your army commander with it, but the only difference that makes is that when you read the next battle report, your army's losses might be 10% less.  If that's your idea of fun, good for you, but as far as I'm concerned it's about as exciting as playing a spreadsheet.\n\nThe game can be broken into two main parts: the strategic level, where you build and move armies around the map; and the tactical level, where combat is resolved on a smaller-scale map containing all the units in the two conflicting armies.  I'll contrast each of those parts to a game that I think does that part really well.\n\nIf grand strategy is your thing, I would say the state of the art is currently exemplified by the Europa Universalis franchise.  In EU4 different nations really *do* play very differently, and you actually *do* have the option of pursuing many different strategies that make real differences both in how the game plays and in the outcomes you get.  Maybe I'm missing something, but Dominions 4 hardly seems to have a strategic element to it at all.  For all their different \"background flavor\", the different factions ultimately play virtually the same way.  It really makes no difference whether your armies are composed of human swordsmen or giant hydras, whether your spellcasters specialize in blood magic or fire magic, whether your faction likes heat or cold or even lives underwater -- the only \"strategy\" you can pursue in this game is universal conquest, and the only strategic-level decisions to make are the order in which you attack enemy provinces.\n\nThere's some slight interest in choosing the best unit combinations for your army, but it's not that hard -- in fact it's mostly a rather tedious chore of comparing unit statistics -- and once you do that you don't ever have to bother looking at them again.  Once you've chosen units A, B and C for your army, regardless of your faction it then boils down to \"build 5 of A, 3 of B, and 6 of C\" every turn, stacking them up, throwing them at the enemy, and then *reading* the combat results.  Put all that together, and Dominions barely even qualifies as a strategy game.  It certainly doesn't excel at it.\n\nAt the tactical level, Dominions is two or three *decades* behind the times.  Consider the King's Bounty franchise: like Dominions, those games also feature lots of different units, spells and magic items; but unlike Dominions, you can actually *use* them in combat, where they have obvioiusly differing, tangible effects.  What's more, you can *see* these effects via their superb unit and spell animations and sound effects.  In fact, I'd argue that \"despite\" its vastly superior graphics and sound, King's Bounty is also a vastly superior combat simulation.  Even if you're OK with Dominions simulating combat for you (and I don't see why you should be), there's just no way its AI is going to do a tenth as good a job as you could, regardless of any \"scripting\" you might do.  Building and customizing your army requires every bit as much planning in King's Bounty as the nearest equivalent in Dominions 4 -- and it's about 1000 times more satisfying in its execution.  In fact, combat resolution in Dominions is the most boring I've seen in a game since Risk.  And that's a problem, because this game is entirely focused on combat.\n\nThe final page of the tutorial highlights just what I dislike about this game.  It gives the example of how, if you want to invade a sea territory, you need to \"plan ahead\": you must first research construction magic until you know how to forge a ring of water breathing; and you also need a mage with sufficient skill to forge it; and you need enough magic gems to perform the construction; and then when it's all ready you give the ring to your army commander.  This all sounded very exciting when I read it, but then when I did it, it was just colossally dull.  There's no substance to any of these steps, and no payoff when it's been achieved.  They amount to nothing more than selecting items from text menus, and when you do, the game looks and plays looks exactly like it did before, except now you can move that leader into water provinces.  Whoopee.\n\nPlus, the game doesn't have any personality -- there are no quests, no dialogue, no diplomacy.

Among the turn-based heroic fantasy strategy games (sorry), Dominions is the ugly guy that no one is talking to. If you dare to speak to him he'll give you access to an amazing world. But not before 3 quests:\n\n- Overcome ugliness: Dominions 4 is ugly, the screenshots dont lie! Units are 2D sprites, poorly animated and there's a good reason for that: content. I dont wanna go into numbers but with so many units, spells, magic items.. you can't expect a shadered 3D model reflecting the sun through tree leafs. Try to imagine the map as a a real map someone just scrolled in front of you asking: how are we going to make those guys believe in you? About the battles: it's somehow poorly animated (but everything is visible i.e units/spells/damage) but i can't find the words to express how i felt in front of my first 300vs300 battle, spells going on from both side, oh man that was awesome.\n\n- Provide a proof of imagination. What is going on in Dominions 4 is the rise&fall of your God in a world where Gods are in competition with each other. This is your story and it's even more funny if you can put yourself into it. There is a large background (descriptions for each races, heroes, units...) to help you with this.\n\n- Get ready for complexity. This game is deep, really deep. The learning curve is slow & long but not frustrating. You'll be amazed how detailed things are. Last game my god got killed cause one of my sorcerer casted an armor spells which explode on death, guess who took the blast? Not mentioning my 1 armed/1eyed Heroic centurion commanding the largest part of the empire's army. The interface is strange, but i can't say it's bad cause i got used to it after a couple of hours, and you can play with the mouse only. There's also a huge 400 page manual (27 pages for tutorial) to explain everything.\n\nHeavily recommended\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1411621735, "timestamp_updated": 1411621735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 148, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.880110", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12221397": {"recommendationid": "12221397", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960451002", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 1960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473094322}, "language": "english", "review": "Dominions 4 is the latest in the Dominions series.

He plunges the entire battlefield into darkness whenever he shows up. You can rain sacred flying jaguar demons on your enemies, free titans trapped in tartarus and nurse them back to health, and literally cause a zombie apocalypse. I've got a weakness for this kind of stuff, but the game is large enough you're bound to find a nation that appeals to you.\n\nNot to say the game is without problems. The game's breadth makes it almost inaccessible, and as a game goes on, it increases your workload of fiddly micromanagement. Want to find errands for 30 wizards every turn? Dominions is the game for you. The game's mechanics are unnecessarily complex, and incompletely described in the long manual. The AI is almost non-existent, mostly useful for testing out tactics on the most basic level. The game is not especially balanced, and there are some awkward results of the game's committment to mythological versimilitude. (Women, across the board, have 1 less point of strength than men of the same group. Mechanically, this is largely insignificant, but it is still stupid.)\n\nThese problems are significant, and if you aren't entranced by Dominions 4's unique qualities, I don't recommend it.

Nor is it meant to particularly entice new comers to the game. While I clicked the yes button I really wish there was a \"maybe\" option as it is not for everyone.\n\nIntro:\nIf you have played Dom 3 you may think you have played Dom 4 after starting it up. The interface is pretty much identical and much of the game is the same (with old school sensibilities about interface, so not much flash). However, many things that were fun for me, and perhaps too awesome (I don't think so but meh) were nerfed/toned down. \n\nItems are no longer all that awesome if you focus and invest all your effort in forging. In fact they are barely worth the effort imho but you can still get some fun things out of them. Just don't expect them to be very effective. In particular the items that produced gems, no longer do so for all uses. They may give you something called \"Temporary\" spell gems which can be used in battle but not with rituals. And much of the skill enhancing items are either gone, nerfed or very much more expensive to make. \n\nId say you are better off not making items at all (as tempting as it may be when you realize that some items still seem fairly powerful.) If you do be prepared to be underwhelmed by the end result. \n\nSpells & researching them were left largely untouched except for minor nerfs here and there to make them more balanced. \n\nOn Balance:\nI will say I am not a proponent of fine tuning/balancing games. Particularly ones that are as successful already as the Dominions series is. However if you are going to do it, don't take away fun things unless you are adding in something to replace them. It is too easy to make a game all hard edges (and difficult even on easy mode, and forget the various coolnesses that may have attracted some people in the first place.) My $0.025 anyway.\n\nDoes Illwinter do this with this game? Yes and no. Some of the new strategic possibilities with disciples look fun. However,  the practice is tricky and is probably best suited for multiplayer. (Full disclosure: Which is something I have never done with any of the dominions games. I like playing 4x-likes solo/single player mode for the most part.)\n\nI like and dislike the Thrones of Ascension mechanism. I like it because it allows you to play in a different manner than the old victory points system. And each throne adds something to the game though you may not enjoy all of the effects of controlling one. I dislike it because the AI at least on the non-cheating (impossible etc) modes does not seem to know how to properly exploit the thrones, only capturing one if it happens to be within easy grasp. \n\nBut since the whole goal of the game changes from \"conquer your enemies  and make them cry (or turtle up if thats your strategy)\" to: \"conquer this tough independently held province and do it quickly to win before your opponents can mount their own campaigns against\", it does not make sense for the AI to still go into conquer every territory mode (standard behavior). \n\nAlso once youve captured a throne you have to use it (with a prophet or your pretender) and make sure to hold it. Independants can and will recapture neglected provinces as inexplicable events. (You don't get to see troop movement or anything, as a warning first.) Which makes the game more and less interesting. More because you have to pay attention to defenses perhaps well inside your territory that you might otherwise neglect, and less because the same. Micromanagement is ever the bane of the 4x player. Yes it is important but it make the game drag to the point of wanting to go play tiddly winks or something else equally inane. \n\nGod Making:\nPerhaps still the best part of the game is being able to set up the game in any way you like. Hard? Easy? Large? Small? Make your own maps. Make your own deity. Choose a form that is all combat or go with many schools of magic and master the arcane. Lots of choices is a good thing and you get a lot of that here. \n\nModding:\nYou can still mod it, though it seems that some of the modding rules have changed. And I would not begin that task unless you really want to see it through and have some actual ideas. Do it because you have a story you want added, not just to up the power level of some item, nation or diety. Or whatever but be warned that once you look under the hood you may feel less enthusiasm for the magic of the game ever after. \n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are unsurprisingly primative but adequate. Sprite based battles still look haphazard and may require some getting used to, to interpret properly. (Why DID that priest suddenly lose morale and run?? You may never really know...)\n\nOverall:\nThe most disappointing thing for me is that as a solo game Dominions 4 has no real innovation, only small refinements on prior editions, which don't really rise to the expectations I had when I saw it was out. As they say: \"Caveat Emptor\" but I really expected more for some reason. Yes I bought it earlyish and didn't do my due dillegence (feh at brand loyalty) on checking other reviews but the product is what it is. Illwinter does not make bad games. So no matter how you feel about it, it will be a game to play not just one to sit on the shelf of buyer's remorse (Because steam never refunds you anything, ever.) You should still get fun out of it.\n\nBuy it if you want a fantasy RPG-4x to play. It is challenging and the UI can be a little inscrutible at first but read the manual and you'll be fine.

Epic (Battles with a thousand units vs a God. One Survivor), deep, intelligent and growing (new races are still being released in every age). If you're browsing then know it is well worth the price even full price. I've played it twice as long as Skyrim... longer than most of my games library added together. And each game I've played has been different:\nI lead a race of aquatic mind-lords, deep in the ocean. My pretender to the throne of godhood a great Polypal Queen, giving birth to a host of magical beings that swarm the enemy with their writhing tentacles. My massive ancient mind-lords enslave the enemy with a look, curse entire armies and form communions to enhance their power to incredible levels - enslaving entire battlefields and shredding the souls of the enemy.\nI've led a race of winged humanoids that live high in the mountains crafting weapons and armour from magical ice. Summoning back splendid beings from the astral spheres, 'adorable ones' beautiful to behold, too awesome for living men to dare strike.\nI've seen the temptation of power topple empires. Mages suffering the ravages of old age turn to healers and eventually to death magic to be reborn as wight mages, drawing on the power of conquered lizard shaman to blot out the sun and cover the battlefield with a never ending horde of undead warriors. Then in a latter age casting spells that change the entire globe, covering the lands in darkness and advancing the slow decay of time till all is withered and dead.\nI've felt the fear of a horror-mark. A towering giant of a God, multi-armed and terrifying touched by the unspeakable powers. The last act of a doomed race to mark it, a slow, pyrrhic victory. My God, with power beyond reckoning destined to be stalked forever by the creatures that lurk beyond the veil. Each touch from the terrifying apparitions further marking the Great God for the attention of the astral beings until at last... a doom horror, Each name more frightening than the last. The Eater of Gods arrives to feast. My God is no more...\n\nA brilliant game. I could say more, it's worthy of praise. More than a little tough to get into (you'll make lots of mistakes and you need to practice in SP before trying your hand at MP), dated graphically (2D spites, only one artist working on the game) and a little micromanagement heavy (Ok very micromanagement heavy. You can script every mage, every squad, equip every commander and forge every magical item... lots to consider, lots to weigh up and lots of stats if you're into that).

After playing for about the 6th or 7th time with other factions I came to the realization that while the game is quite fun learning how it works and discovering all the options that are avalailable to you there are 2 key things that make this game falling a few steps short of greatness which I will point out later in this review. Now please note that this is my first Dominions title I've played and I have no prior knowledge or experience playing of any of the titles before it.\n\nFirst off let me say what I like about this game, and there's quite a lot to enjoy in such a involving strategy game such as this, but a few I like to mention are the amount of content and spells that is within the package and how each nation plus god that you play as feel worlds different from each other, with different nations having access to a variety of different units and even their own spells, for instance the Bakemono nation in the middle age has their own racial summons to summon Oni onto the world map. Even after all that variety with approximately a dozen of different nations for each age and leaders you can choose from the game is won only by acquiring a number (chosen at the start of the game) of different thrones of ascension that are scattered throughout the map which can have quite a significant impact on all nations nearby once they are claimed by a player. I won't go into the specifics on how they do so now as it would take a whole summary of the game to explain details in the game that are prominent and quite arduous to understand (such as how dominion works and how your empires influence spreads). Let's just say that when you acquire these thrones, apart from giving you additional resources in the form of mana crystals, they can make the lands that are surrounding them more arid, temperate, hot, cold, or even unlucky just by having someone in control of them which can cause a huge impact on your playstyle or how you strategize about future moves. Another thing I like is that when I lost battles I felt that it was my own fault for not paying attention and not giving orders to a commander or a unit, or to forget putting my units in better defensive positions to deal with the enemies units, and while the combat is automated I still felt I had control on the outcome of each battle, which is not an easy thing to do for a strategy game that encapsulates so many different tactics and decisions to be made. The last thing I would like to mention about the pros of this game is that while this game may ultimately seem complex to many new players, in actuality it is a really simple strategy game to learn as your primary concerns are conquering lands and claiming the thrones of ascension, but the amount of choices that you have to achieve that goal are massive.\n\nNow on to my opinions on the flaws of the game. The 2 greatest flaws this game has is the diplomacy aspect of the game and the balance of each nation. Now normally the balance of each nation wouldn't be an issue for me in a strategy game like this but considering the degree of difficulty that can scale based on the nations you play can be quite offputting ESPECIALLY for new players trying to grasp the concepts of the game. It took myself 3 failed games and numerous attempts at reading strategy guides to try and figure out what I was doing wrong to win as the yomi in the early age and after failing miserably I finally pursued playing another nation that apparently was much more powerful and won with relative ease without that much of any challenge minus a few times where I had left my lands undefended, or stupidly throwing all of my units in a nation's home base. But balance issues aside, the one thing that I absolutely wish that this game did a better job of is diplomacy, and while I haven't played a game with the Disciple mode (where one nation is a pretender god and other nations are that god's disciples) the game is primarily focused on combat and map positioning as opposed to diplomatic relations and tech trading. And while you can research a massive amount of spells it would seem that having the better units in the army trumps out any spell that you can research midway throughout the game . Now I may be wrong on this for later spells that are high-end, but for every instance that I've played the spells that are cast in combat usually are a minor thing to worry about as opposed to whoever has the better quality and quantity of troops in battle. There are no peace treaties that you can formulate with other nations and one is forced to solve every situation in the game militaristically by conquering their neighbors and fighting for the thrones of ascension , which can be fun for while, but it leaves something to be desired. For instance, after around the 100th turn of a game or so I will still have some of the same enemies that I have dealt with handily since the start of the game that are still pestering me, and it gets kinda worn and laborious to cycle between creating troops, sending troops, and defending. Although I have only played on a Normal difficulty setting, the A.I. doesn't actively try to win the game by going straight for thrones of ascension but rather conquer lesser defended provinces of the player which is a decent enough strategy, but I feel is not realistic enough because any human  player would immediately try to go for the victory points with as many units they have from the get go. \n\nAll in all Dominions 4 was worth my hard earned cash, as I have no gripes about the graphics (as I really don't care about how a game looks) or my experiences with the game and I do expect to play more of it in the future but probably on higher difficulty settings. But as I said at the beginning of this review, what stops this game from achieving greatness in my eyes is the fact that there are no diplomatic relations that you can have with the other nations and there are nations that are drastically better suited for winning the game than others.", "timestamp_created": 1408781176, "timestamp_updated": 1415449056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598655", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11827595": {"recommendationid": "11827595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027253582", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510725061}, "language": "english", "review": "This is hands down the best computer game of all time and I've been playing since Might and Magic I on a 286.

It has tons of replay ablity as every game is different and there are almost 100 nations spread across 3 ages. Each age is different as well. The early age being the more magical age and the late age being less magic and more tech advanced (when i say tech i mean better armour weapons etc.) magic is still around in the late age however. Magic in this game is very powerful but you can win without it. So if you want a Magic nation only you can do that and wipe all other god's nations off the map with massive lighting bolts OR if you dont want to use any magic you can, you can send 1000 of troops head on into battles (which can get massive). Dominions 4 can be quite difficult as well. I have yet to do online so i cant rate that but the single-player against Ai can be very diffcult as it is not dumb and provides a good challenge. At first Dominions 4 is overwhelming but its a grand stratagy game and so if you take it slow you will do fine and have a great time as I have. There are random generated maps as well as drawn maps and you can create your own which is always fun.

I think people criticizing this game are not to blame. The problem is that game is horribly NOT for general audience, who \"fans of Civilization and HOMM series\" and don't intrested in wargames as a genre. It's not a casual game, it's developed by very small team for very specific type of player, to those who value very complex game mechanics more than anything else. Those people don't care about graphics so much. These are the same people who play SS13, Dwarf Fortress, Steel Panthers and the like in 2014 and don't understand why those games appear \"outdated\" to someone - they still have unrivalled mechanics as of today. And that's the only thing that matters.\n\nCriticism of PBEM MP in this game is baseless. Actually, it is THE MP format best suited for such type of games. After game session progresses beyond initial expanding and settling stage, some turns can take literally HOURS of thinking and trying different solutions. In bigger sessions with bigger maps it's uncommon to have turnlimit time set to several DAYS, so no one would feel pressed by it. Do somebody intend to wait hours while his opponent tries to figure out his best plan for this turn, like, at the keyboard? I don't think so. We actually played it like this in Dom3, and after first 10-20 turns it becomes just too painfull to endure all the waiting. It's much better to play this in PBEM. That is, it's so for any turnbased wargame.\n\nThe criticism of lack of tutorials and not so convinient UI is at least acceptable. The problem with first is that the game is so complex behind the curtains, that to write some good and all-embracing HOWTO is nearly impossible. One can go to fan forums and check for himself that for every of several dozens of ingame races (I'm takin in account three different Ages existing in the game, so one race, if present in all three, can feel substantionally different depending on Age) there are several - sometimes totally different - aproaches, which many times will depend on whom you are facing in this particular game session as an enemy and a friend. The problem with second is that development team is quite restricted in terms of resources and try to focus on more important (for the audience of such games) things, related to game mechanics.\n\nThe combat's design stems out of those peculiarities layed out above. They tried to do it the way somehow predictable and transparent, as you won't be able to correct it in real time. Still I'll give it to haters that it's a little oversimplistic, but hopefully will be expanded in years to come (in Dom4 they added formations, for example).\n\nBasically, those reviewers didn't even have a chance to peek behind the curtains of simplistic looking UI to discover the indisputable variety which comes with magic system and different Pretender's/dominion's types strategies, which really make this game shine.", "timestamp_created": 1404202625, "timestamp_updated": 1404203390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797562", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10989201": {"recommendationid": "10989201", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970348980", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 3064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511724943}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been a huge fan of the series since I first picked it up with Dominions 2. \"Good\" doesn't even begin to describe how truly excellent this game and its developer, Illwinter is.

It is well worth the effort to learn.  If you enjoy this sort of game and have not played previous Dominions games, I *strongly* recommend it.  This is true even considering the high price tag for what is essentially a niche indie game.  You will enjoy a unique and well-crafted strategy game.  It is well worth it!  \n\nHowever, I am personally disappointed that it is only a small upgrade from Dominions 3.  The interface is much better and everything is cleaner.  But gameplay-wise, it is virtually identical with only a few new features.  This is a shame because - while the game is indeed quite well designed - it does have areas that could have been improved or redesigned.  For instance, the spell research system could be done better, the spell circles could feel less generic, and there is certainly room for more spells and more interesting spells.  Likewise, although Prentender customization (A Prentender is your nation's god who is vying to become the one true god) is one of the most fun parts of the game, an even deeper system would be appreciated.  Yet it is essentially unchanged from Dominions 3.  Furthermore, I would have loved to see even basic diplomacy and trading introduced to the series.  As it stands, there is only war between you and the other nations unless they are on your team from the start.  Additionally, while graphics are not important in this sort of game, it is still disappointing that they are mostly unchanged from Dominions 3.  There are some higher-res sprites and the 3D ground combat textures are slightly higher resolution, but it really looks pretty much the same.  Sadly, there are still no overworld spell visual effects; Dominions should take a page from Master of Magic.  Even basic overworld spell effects would make spellcasting much more satisfying!  Overall, I felt as though there were many missed opportunities for improvement.  I felt like I was playing Dominions 3.5, not Dominions 4.     \n\nSo if you own Dominions 3, is it worth the price tag?  Well, if you play a lot and want a better interface with a few new features, then yes.  Just don't expect much of a change in actual gameplay.

I think, I will stick to \"good/bad\" parts instead, to show what is there.\n\nSo, my pros:\n\n- Game is complex. Scalable complex. You can blindly research everything, and throw masses of your troops to win; or you can tinker with initial placement and orders; or you can plan anything - from right artifacts equipped to expert armies assembled - everything will work in single player... for some extent, of course. (Multiplayer requires good knowledge of game, so it will be complex by default).\n\n- Game is vast and diverse. I cannot remember another strategy with at least 4 significantly different races to play (and no, 3 units and 2 advancements doesn't count as \"significant\"). Dominions 4 have dozens of races, and most of them requires different approach. Sometimes vastly different. There are hundreds of researcheable spells - and it's real, significant spells, not another \"Fireball III\" type of things. There are dozens of craftable artifacts too - from simple helmets and boots to unique Holy Arc or Staff of Mages that can be only one per game. And there are whole lot of magic sites! And random events too! You got the picture.\n\n- It have planned orders, and what more important - turn-based AI-controlled battles with initial order queue! I think, it's most realistic turn-based scenario: in real battles it's local commanders who matters, not warlord - after initial plan developed, of course.\n\nAnd now contras:\n\n- Graphics. Poor pixellated graphics from 90s. I still believe that good pixel artist could vastly improve visuals here - but, well, I am not the author, and forums thinks that graphics not matters. Oh, well.\n\n- Interface. It greatly improved since first installation, but still can be very unintuitive here and there. And many commands accessible only via hotkeys. And no filters and sorting for statistics. And not very elaborating reports for everything that are not battles... Oh, well, it definitely could be much better.\n\n- No diplomacy. No pacts, trades, unions or anything. Last part have \"minions\" system, but it not matters much for single-player, given you AI-controlled armies - and that's all. I think, MP-games more affected by that, but I am not a big fan of multiplayer.\n\n- Limited exploration. You can see whole map right from the beginning. Of course, you cannot see province details, enemy armies, and all magic sites still must be searched individually - but still, in my dreams it could be better!\n\n- Realms-based gameplay. I like to be free, with vast territories, journeys to foreign places and founding cities where I need them. Well, not that game, obviously.\n\nBut regardless of described flaws, game remains one of most big, and complex, and elaborate 4X-strategy on market. I love it.

This is not another Civ or HoMM clone; here we have a spell list that makes the tech tree of any 4x game you've played look like a post-it note.  Every single troop and item has a back story and a sprite, and every spell has a counter strategy to a counter strategy whch acts as a counter-counter-counter strategy.\n\nUnfortunately, the learning curve is sharp.  The game comes with a read-along tutorial, but nothing can prepare you for the blistering amount of options you have at your fingertips until you play the game.  A lot of the game is figuring out how your different units can behave, because unlike other games where your troops simply \"move, attack, or build a structure\" commanders in this game can search for blood sacrifices, preach the word of your god, cast a staggering variety of ritual spells, patrol for spies, assassinate commanders with stealthed heroic squads (I made Brock Samson and some OSI agents) and so much more.  Once you amass a healthy army, troop setup and positioning before battle is also vital.\n\nThe game is also not very pretty.  The only nice thing to say about the UI is that it's functional.  No form here; you're presented with a drop-down list that looks like it came from a primitive spreadsheet document.  The backgrounds are pixelated, and the pictures of the troops look like they came from a 16 bit game, though I actually find that charming.\n\nWhat this game lacks in eye candy, it makes up in strategic depth.  Whether you like min-maxing or discovering new strategies on the fly, the absolutely massive toolkit this game gives players means that there is almost always a new way to screw over your opponents and be screwed yourself.  There are so many ways for players to customize their win conditions and other game settings, though this often feels like an old-school war game where the players have to commit to a solid 3-5 hour chunk of play time (though you don't have to do it all in one go because the game saves everyone's progress).  This game also makes you feel like a real deity with spells that let you do anything from creating a global hurricane, ageing the world's population supernaturally fast, or summoning elder gods to rampage indiscriminately across the continent.  There are just SO MANY ways to build your god, nation, and heroes.\n\nAlso, I would like to say that this is the first game I've played in a long time where I've felt like a proper necromancer.  You're not raising a handful of skeletal minions here, oh no.  If you so choose, the entire world will wither and legions of the dead will rise from the doomed populace to do your bidding as your carrion dragon leads squads of bane knights you equipped with weeping blades of venom against your enemies.\n\nThe developers patch new content in on a regular basis, and have claimed they will continue to do so for the next 2 years at the least.  If you are a strategy enthusiast who has the patience to power through a steep learning curve, this game is an absolute must-buy.\n\nTo get an idea of the sheer amount of things your can summon, forge, and cast check out this site: http://larzm42.github.io/dom4inspector/", "timestamp_created": 1401517943, "timestamp_updated": 1403494420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432707", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10283934": {"recommendationid": "10283934", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992964908", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401316557}, "language": "german", "review": "Nicht mein Geschmack, die Men\u00fcs nicht selbsterkl\u00e4rend, man muss auf jedenfall erst das Handbuch lesen um \u00fcberhaupt etwas auf die Reihe zubekommen.

I'll go ahead and get the (tiny) amount of criticism out of the way - the game has an unusual user interface, and targeted selection of units can be especially tedious at times. With that detail out of the way, I only have good things to say about Dominions 3. The writing in the game is top-notch, and very immersive. You often have to play multiple races to get a fuller picture of the history, but it's rich and satisfying once you piece it together. The Tuatha and the Fomorian Giants are a good example. The game plays in a traditional fashion concerning territories and the movement of agents and armies, much like other turn-based games. However, to locate the useful goodies in a territory, you'll have to cultivate a few powerful mages among your commanders, to find hidden sites that can provide mana gems, unique and powerful units for recruitment, or special effects, once unearthed. You'll need them (and magi once again) for the forging of magical items to equip your agents, priests, mages, generals, prophet, and your Pretender God. But the true meat of the game is in spreading your dominion (aka faith) across the map. It is the source of your power, and since it can flow into enemy territoy, it can also hamper their efforts to withstand your (inevitable) attack. Be sure to build lots of temples in your own honor! Put those puny mortal mages to work researching powerful magic that can affect the whole world. Turn day to perpetual night, bring on and endless winter, summon hurricanes, kill someone from anywhere in the world, dispach the flying monkeys to pluck away some unfortunate soul! Last Pretender God standing wins the prize - true Godhood. Sounds simple, right? Think again. It's a deep and complex game, and can be quite the challenge at times. So join in the fun, weave your own epic tale! Smash vampires with giants, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 queens (yes, its a real Pretender) with a midget masher, or run from Cthulu!

Even if the game wasn't practically limitless as far as strategy goes, the extensive mythological and theological research that composes the game's universe, reflected in the lore, is probably worth the price of admission alone.\n\nSure, you will see bad reviews but the fact is that the vast majority of them are made by people that simply didn't bother or couldn't manage to understand the game. You'll see comments about the lack of a tutorial (which is stupid, as a single cursory glance at the manual or ingame menus would reveal,) or things like the \"lack of control\" during battles (which again is stupid since the very core of combat is understanding unit strengths, positioning and scripting.) You'll see people whine that units are samey even if a couple games with different nations would prove otherwise. Likewise they have complained that the unit roster of each nation is limited, blissfully unaware that most every one has access to tons of summons, including nation unique ones. The list goes on and on and every single review in that vein is both as much a testament to laziness as it is pathetic.\n\nThe game has some problems, for sure, but they are seldom tied to content aside from a fairly rudimentary AI that doesn't have access to the breadth of tactics that a real opponent would. The interface can be clunky and micromanagent tough IF you don't bother to read the hotkeys reference. Setting up a live multiplayer game can be confusing the first time you do it (although not if you are used to running a server in any other game,) back to the AI issue it has no built-in way to do diplomacy or trading so during single player games you won't have that option. Units are plentiful but without careful reading it can be easy to miss why they should or should not be used at a given moment and chances are that at the beginning and at least at some point you will have to look up information on how to play a particular nation.\n\nIn multiplayer the game's AI problems are alleviated and the game shines to its full potential. There is simply no other game that offers as much variety in troops and strategies thanks to the combination of  pretender god options, the inherent strenghts and weakness of each nation and the plethora of spells plus equipment that you can research on top of whatever the map and the game's random events might bestow upon you. For example; even if you follow the absolute same strategy in two different games, in one game you might find territory that comes with independent mages or summons that can give you access to entirely different magic schools and in the process completely change how you go on about the game. In the same vein; the game has over two thousand random events that can range from national heroes appearing at your door to hellish portals opening somewhere in the world and letting demons pour out unchecked.\n\nSomething else that I haven't seen a single negative review touch upon is the fact that the game has a pretty extensive modding community. Mods can do everything from adding completely new nations to tweaking the so often called too easy AI. There's lots of balance tweaks, tools, nations based on other popular franchises, sprite changes, magic changes, even a mod that grabs bits and pieces of sprites to easily create entirely new nations with randomized units. Of course, there's also hundreds upon hundreds of user created maps both made by hand and created with the game's random map maker so the game is not bereft of content at any point.\n\nOn the matter of patches the game is still supported often and has undeniable gotten better with time. Since release there's been three new nations released for free, with at least one more coming soon. Other nations have been reworked to be made more competitive and flavorful as well; each and every one of these updates coming with a brand new batch of sprites, events and spells. Tons of bugs have been fixed, quality of life UI improvements have been added and even the AI is slowly being reworked to be more competitive as well. Since the development team is quite small, it is hard to tell for how long or not they might support the game but at this point in time we've come close to two years and with not a drop of paid DLC rearing its head. The price tag might seem a bit hefty mostly because of the graphics, but considering this game and its content can stand toe to toe with any AAA strategy game, it is more than reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion I think there's really no reason to skip this game. As long as you are not  in a rush to immediately go into a game and fail to give the manual and ingame menus even the slightlest little check, you will avoid 90% of the problems that the game is supposed to have.", "timestamp_created": 1397229075, "timestamp_updated": 1430773910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9778476": {"recommendationid": "9778476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008065508", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 9340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506168252}, "language": "english", "review": "Fight the good fight.\nBelieve what is right\nCrusader, the Lord of the realm\nFight the good fight,\nWith all your might\nCrusader, Lord of the realm", "timestamp_created": 1397136235, "timestamp_updated": 1397136235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9770476": {"recommendationid": "9770476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061860931", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501583670}, "language": "english", "review": "Perhaps the number of hours I\u2019ve been playing deceives you? Hmm? Well, let me put it bluntly. This game is pretty awesome. It is a strategy game at its core. And in the purest sense, a classical war game involving fantastical creatures and beasts. I refer to it as a war game due to the nature of game play. It is hard-core and classical in that, there is no diplomacy. Pure tactics and strategy is needed to succeed. You make your own diplomacy and essentially create your own story. \n\nA word of warning, this game is far better when played online or with other people. Don't get me wrong. There is a single player aspect but in my personal opinion. The single player aspect against the AI is probably best used as a way of testing your builds, possible tactics and army composition. Yes, there is a very in depth combat system in the game, very much akin to Total war. For better or for worse, you have no control over these clashes (represented by crude graphics combating it out, looks pretty appealing in my opinion), and instead you can script what your troops would do. This makes for a more intense session and allows you to experiment possible tactics. By making battles less hands on (like total war), it enables you to feel more like a proper general :) Each unit has a hand drawn sprite and there are over a dozen nations to pick from (from a selection of three ages). Then there is the pretender creation. That is the best part of the game. To create a pretender \u2018god\u2019 that represents you. The number of possibilities that come to creating a god is endless.  You can make a combat oriented super god, or perhaps a more spell oriented support god. Maybe even an immobile stone god that confers perks to your troops. The choice is yours! \nI admire the game. Not just because it is a pure grounded classical war game involving fantasy creatures, gods and what not, but more-so due to the amount of detail put into the game. That is a feat that no game can accomplish (well at least with higher graphics anyway). \n\nPerks\n-Really in depth combat system with a multitude of troop types and nations to pick from.\n-Formation system\n-Pretender Creation\n-Randomised map generation\n-Excellent multiplayer game\n-Mod capabilities\n\nCons\n-Graphics can be a major turn off for a lot of players (especially those who look to graphics as the main factor for enjoying a game)\n-Though battles are very detailed (modelling each individual soldiers move and attack), they are very heavily scripted and despite it following orders. There can be tendencies where some of your units won\u2019t follow orders properly (I understand orders cannot be followed to a point but in some cases, it can be pretty extreme). \n\nSo to conclude, my highlight of the game would have to be the combat mechanics and the pretender system. Some people may dislike not having direct control over battles, but I personally think it makes for a far more strategic game. Not to mention, back in the day, generals would not be able to control their infantry or cavalry directly anyway. Even now, there is a margin of error when it comes to following orders from a higher up. I think that is very well simulated in this game. By letting players script orders, you are almost planning your move from a war room. Not knowing exactly what is going to happen.

Be warned though, this is a game for folks who really enjoy turn-based strategy games (TBS), especially multi-player TBS (Disclaimer:  I have not tried Dominions 4 MP yet, but Dominions 3 MP was tremendous).  But if you are looking for high-end graphics, a gentle learning curve, hand-holding tutorials or a casual strategy gaming experience, you may want to look elsewhere. \n\nHowever, if you are a fan of TBS games, Dominions 4 has tremendous depth, content and attention to detail.  From the ability to customize your god to each race with unique abilities, there are many variables to make each game unique.  Gameplay can be a bit daunting initially, but rewards players who carefully plan and execute those strategies.\n\nMy only negative at this time regarding Dominions 4 is it appears to be a bit too similar to Dominions 3 which I played heavily in the pre-Steam days.

You could play this game a lifetime long and probably still not exhaust the combinations of viable and fun strategies for conquering the world.\n\nSo with that totally unqualified and exuberant approval out of the way, it must also be said that this is one of the most maddening games around, in terms of interface, AI and certain functions. Despite substantial interface improvements in Dominions 4 over the previous version, there remains far too much micromanagement. A few additional tools would greatly assist - like automatic pooling of blood slaves (as happens with gems), automated forwarding of recruits from rear areas, multiple turn path-setting for armies, automated setting of research priorities (ie, research Conjuration 3, than Evocation 4, then Thaumaturgy 1 - without me having to manually adjust each turn). And one thing about movement routines frustrates me constantly - once an enemy army is \"behind your lines\", so to speak, actually pinning it down to a battle is nearly impossible. You move into the province the enemy army is in, but simultaneously the enemy army moves to a different province, and you're caught in a never-ending game of musical chairs. Even if your army is \"faster\", or should be faster. I'd love it if there were some more sophisticated move mechanics or orders, like \"move to block any enemy army that moves to any adjacent province\". And I'd also love more stats.

Otherwise...it probably isn't.\n\nThe game has three ages, each with its own set of nations to play as, making the total something like 60. Some rise, some fall, and some change over the course of the timeline, so each Age has its own feel and mechanics. Each also has its own set of units. Some are generic, but there are literally thousands of unique units and monsters in the game.\n\nAlso spells; I've seen RPG's with less involved magic systems. There are a hair over 800 castable spells and a fair number (200 or so at a guess) magical items to craft.\n\nThe tactical combat is also quite deep. The player doesn't control it, but the player does organize their armies into formations and give them general orders. Which feels a bit more reasonable given the sheer scope the game can reach on larger maps.\n\nAlso worth noting is that instead of a generic fantasy setting, the factions and races here are based mostly on different historical mythologies, so there's that to keep it interesting as well.\n\nTL;DR:\nAre you going to cry about having to read, a slightly unintuitive GUI, poor graphics, or lack of tactical control?

I have to say it must have been serendipity because this game is fantastic! It plays like a very complicated board game, which is why the graphics are not necessarily state of the art - but they don't need to be. What this game lacks in graphical horsepower it makes up for with brilliant game mechanics. The level of detail the designers put into each of the game mechanics and how they made a tremendous effort to ensure they each fit with the lore and setting of the game is amazing. For instance, a unit equipped with a spear can deflect incoming melee attacks from enemies equipped with a shorter melee weapon, such as a sword. Archers' arrows don't just hit or miss an enemy unit - they actually take into account the spread of the arrows over a target area.\n\nThe lore setting is also extremely unique. You are a pretender god vying to be the ONLY god. You can choose from a large number of deities each with their own special characteristics. Add on top of that about two dozen different civilizations you can match you deity up with...and on top of that there are three separate ages you can start from each with different environmental settings - you get the picture for the level of depth in this game. \n\nOthers have mentioned the user manual being a critical part of this game. It is. And yes it's long at about 400 pages, but about 300 pages of that are just reference tables for all the different units, spells, items, etc. I have to give the designers credit again here, because not only is this the most comprehensive user manual I have ever seen in a video game, but it's actually easy and fun to read! I've played other board games where the rulebook was a tenth the size but incredibly hard to read (I'm looking at you Republic of Rome!).\n\nI definitely recommend this game for anyone that enjoys master strategy games like Europa Universalis and perhaps the Total War series. Probably the best way to describe this game is a healthy mixture of Civilization, Europa Universalis, Heroes of Might and Magic and Total War.

Single player doesn't really offer much of a challenge either, once you understand the basics of the game. As a single player game, I would rate Dominions series as one of the worst I've ever played.\n\nWhere Dominions 4 shines though, is multiplayer. Despite the simplistic basics, it's easily one of the most complex MP games out there. The variety of nations is quite large, each era plays differently due to different units and varying access to magic paths and while there are obviously \"generally accepted strategies\" for each nation, each of them can be played in very varied ways depending on scales and pretender choice.\n\nThe game has very steep learning curve, but there is a wealth of information to be found quite easily - google is your friend here.

While the process of reading this manual was a bit oppressive and a rather large time investment just to start playing, from what I can see is there is a game with an incredible amount of depth and replayability. \n\nJust from the start you get random worlds and the ability to craft your own \"pretender\" (basically a demigod) and then explore with the aim of conquering. There is espionage, assassinations, and management of your territories.

But it definitely has weak points. And I'm not meaning poor graphics and sound.\n\n1) It's too long, for either single-player or for PBEM.\n\nYes, unlike Civilization here every single turn means much more so I would expect it should be played very well in PBEM. Still the game takes even much more turns than Civilization. In single-player that means that you become tired long till the end. While for PBEM expect years to play a single game. (This is not true for small maps only).\n\n2) It's too complex, but lacks control.\n\nThere are too many races and pretenders, too many spells etc. So you could play well with your own customized race... but when it comes to enemy - what do you know about your enemy? Almost nothing. You have no idea about his race strategy and so you do not understand his possible decisions. You could try researchng other races, but isn't that overhelming? That depends, may be one likes that. \n\nThere are too many spells, but you can't control (mostly) what your units use in the battle. What if one decides to cast kind of Armageddon? Or would you like that every battle you general casts something what teleports him out of battle? Actually even when you are researching spells you do that even for spells you don't need, even while you don't want to know what they do. There are simply too many spells and most of inventions are not well suited for your race. Still you research them all.\n\n3) So it is too complicated, with little control, again.\n\nAnd finally about battles. You know, you can't control the battles. What you can is to give some (very restricted) orders before the battle. Actually I would like that.. if it was done different way. Imagine your army standing on the border of you kingdom, you spies saying about pretty weak defences on a neutral province while you are giving orders like: heavy infantry wait and charge in center, heavy cavalry wait and charge on the left, your mages cast armor, strength and whatever. Then you click End Turn button.\n\nThen first a random event occurs killing one of you generals, so your heavy infantry will not move then with the rest of your army. Then your army goes to the province and has to battle an army of Necromancer kingdom who has just conquered the province. Your army will follow the initial orders with the heavy cavalry on the left, no one in the middle, with mages casting armor and strength instead of slaying undeads or something else.\n\nThat being said, it's not a bad game.

Why? There's 75+ different NATIONS to play with over 3 different eras.  Each nation has their own interesting history based on the dominions world and aren't just a fantasy ripoff of orcs, elves, etc.  There's an incredibly deep magic system with over 800 spells, 300 forgeable magic items and over 2000 units!  You can play single player, hotseat, play by email or multiplayer with up to 28 players including team games.  The game is also easily moddable and there's a big mod community.    With this many nations, spells, and units, this game is very complex and impossible to fully master.  It's an old school style game where you should actually read the manual (infact dominions 3 came with a 400 page manual).  This game is an acquired taste for the patient who enjoy gameplay over good graphics.  If you're a tabletop wargamer or enjoy the civ series you might like this. The graphics are sprite based but functional and the music is good. If you're on the fence about this game, Dominions 3 (which is similiar) has a free demo available for download. If you're a serious strategy gamer who cares about deep tactics and likes lots of possiblities instead of just rock, paper, scissors style of today's RTS games, you'll love Dominions.

The plotline for the game is fairly basic; Essentially each player is a godlike being called a Pretender, each controls a loyal nation and is battling to become the Pantokrator, or supreme god. To do this a pretender can either do it one of three ways; The first way is to conquer your enemies with vast armies which can take a long time depending on some of the maps, spreading your religion to the point it extinguishes the power of your rivals religion or the new victory condition for this installment, capturing the required number of Thrones of Ascension. Each throne grants you a special perk so to speak and also adds strategy to what provinces you conquer and when. Each nation exists in either one of three ages, sometimes all three. The sheer amount of units in this game is astounded and every single nation in the game is based on history, mythology or fantasy tropes (Although there are no stereotypical Elves or Dwarves at all really.)

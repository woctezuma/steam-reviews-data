FC was a bit slower to get into.  You could start with this one technically, and I bet you'd understand the plot eventually, but you wouldn't get as attached to the characters.  I played on Hard mode, which I'd recommend for more challenging battles.  If you do try Hard, the prologue is quite difficult, and not indicative of the rest of the game.  Use up any one-shot consumables in the Prologue, you'll need them, and can get more later.  The rest of the game up until the  battle just before the end,  is not as hard.  Most of the fights you can beat on Hard with the proper strategy, only a few (Prologue end, and the one just before the end boss) you'll also need some luck.  It's easy to restart if you get unlucky on those few fights, loading is fast.\n\nThere is a sequal to this  (Third Chapter (TC)) that completes this trilogy.

On tourne dans les m\u00eames zones, avec les boss aux m\u00eame endroits quasiment, \u00e0 se taper des qu\u00eates secondaires tr\u00e8s proches (si ce n'est totalement similaires) de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le premier et ce dans les m\u00eames zones. Sans compter que dans cet opus, faute de repasser toutes les zones du premier chapitre, vous allez aussi y revenir plusieurs fois dans ce chapitre m\u00eame, et faire beaucoup d'allers/retours (toujours pas de 'voyage rapide').\nHeureusement, derni\u00e8rement une nouvelle fonction a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e pour faire aller le jeu plus vite en maintenant la g\u00e2chette enfonc\u00e9e, mais m\u00eame avec \u00e7a, le jeu reste beaucoup trop long. Car non, plus c'est long, plus c'est chiant, du moins ici, j'ai parl\u00e9 des aller retour, mais je peux aussi parler d'un d\u00e9faut du 1 qui accentu\u00e9 ici aussi\u00a0: les zones immens\u00e9ment vides...  Vers la fin c'est encore le pire, c'est vaste mais y'a rien, quelques ennemis, mais peu ou pas d'interaction, c'est totalement vide... Sans compter que beaucoup de niveaux sont labyrinthiques, et vastes, ce qui rend l'exploration tr\u00e8s... \u00ab\u00a0meh\u00a0\u00bb. Bref, cet opus est beaucoup plus long, et ce m\u00eame avec l'option pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le jeu, mais c'est globalement du vide, du d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu et des allers/retours incessants.\nPour finir sur le n\u00e9gatif je parlerais aussi des teams obligatoires qui changent un peu trop fr\u00e9quemment, vous pouvez avoir jusqu'\u00e0 4 compagnons dans votre groupe, mais tr\u00e8s souvent vous serez oblig\u00e9 d'en prendre qui sont impos\u00e9s. En soit ce n'est pas forc\u00e9ment probl\u00e9matique, et c'est assez fr\u00e9quent dans les j-rpg, cependant ici c'est fr\u00e9quents,  les items restent sur vos personnages qu'ils soient du groupe ou non (genre vous aviez une orbe sp\u00e9ciale sur un personnage ou un item tr\u00e8s puissant mais vous pouvez pas l'avoir avec vous, alors vous ne pourrez pas forc\u00e9ment les transf\u00e9rer non plus) et en plus ils n'xp pas quand ils ne sont pas avec vous. Ce qui fait que tr\u00e8s souvent on part \u00e0 l'aventure avec des personnages que l'on aime pas forc\u00e9ment, et qu'on aime encore moins quand on voit qu'ils ont 10 voir 20 level de retard sur le reste de votre groupe\u00a0! Mention sp\u00e9ciale vers la fin, quand en plus de \u00e7a j'ai du me taper deux fois de suite un aller retour assez long pour chercher \u00e0 chaque fois un autre perso obligatoire pour l'avanc\u00e9e de la qu\u00eate principale, et qui plombe totalement la strat\u00e9gie que vous aviez avec vos 4 autres...  Sans compter que \u00e7a foutait un peu en l'air la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la sc\u00e8ne, litt\u00e9ralement \u00e7a donnait \u00e7a\u00a0:\n\u00ab\u00a0hey les gars, les fr\u00e8res de 'machin' sont prisonniers juste devant nous et les boss ne sont pas l\u00e0, qu'est ce qu'on fait\u00a0?\n1- on traverse les 10km de la base pour revenir en arri\u00e8re prendre avec nous 'machin' unstuff et absolument pas au niveau en esp\u00e9rant que les ennemis ne reviennent pas \n2- on y va nous m\u00eame blind\u00e9 d'\u00e9quipement et OP.\u00a0\u00bb\n\nJe vous laisse deviner la r\u00e9ponse....\n\nAutrement, l'histoire est sympa, quelques r\u00e9v\u00e9lations, du suspense, des qu\u00eates assez sympa et un gameplay qui n'a pas trop chang\u00e9 mais reste plut\u00f4t efficace. De nouveaux personnages haut en couleur, des anciens toujours charismatiques...\nEn gros, les m\u00eames points positifs que le premier chapitre que je ne vais pas r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ici, ce qui fait qu'en tant que tel le jeu est recommandable, mais il faut faire fi des d\u00e9fauts du premiers ou ceux cit\u00e9s au dessus....\n\nBref, vous avez aim\u00e9 le 1, vous devriez aimer le 2, apr\u00e8s tout c'est +/- la m\u00eame chose.\n\nLes +\u00a0:\n- Nombreux personnages charismatiques\n- la narration, l'histoire en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l'univers\n- un bon syst\u00e8me de combat\n- une difficult\u00e9 mieux dos\u00e9e que le premier\n\nLes  -\n- Inutilement long via des zones tr\u00e8s vides et trop de labyrinthes (et toujours pas de voyage rapide)\n- Trop d'allers-retours, souvent dans des zones en plus d\u00e9j\u00e0 explor\u00e9es dans le 1\n- Qu\u00eates secondaires totalement re-pomp\u00e9es du premier opus\n- Peu d'\u00e9volution dans le gameplay (pas forc\u00e9ment important ici, mais \u00e7a accentue cet aspect ersatz du premier)\n- Personnages impos\u00e9s fr\u00e9quents, qui plombent la team avec leur sous-level.\n-------------------------------------\n\n12/20 pour ma part", "timestamp_created": 1506773096, "timestamp_updated": 1506773096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35220880": {"recommendationid": "35220880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208884248", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2880, "last_played": 1514581341}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece!", "timestamp_created": 1506428788, "timestamp_updated": 1506428788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35210198": {"recommendationid": "35210198", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992485832", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497327564}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice JRPG, great follow-up to the first chapter.

In this sequal alot of background story about your companions will be told in a very long-winded game. Also, typical for a trilogy, this is the main part which will answer most of you question in a big climax. Sadly though, you\u00b4d have to play for a very long time to get to this point. This game\u00b4s athmosphere is exactly the same as in it\u00b4s prequal, due to same graphics, same (sometimes realy overdone) dramatic situation and same polished combat system. Also, you\u00b4ll walk on the exact same map as in the prequal and will have to read tons of dozens of text. At this point I can tell, without spoiling, that the story feels finished after you completed the game although there\u00b4s a third part. \n\nTo sum in up in a pro/con comparision:\n\nPRO:\n\n- 150h of pure playtime with main- and sitequests\n- fans get exactly what they wanted\n- overall a polished \"Trails in the sky first chapter\"\n- great soundtrack with old and new tracks\n- a credibly told story with authentic characters\n\nBonus: The story\u00b4s main plot is surprisingly close to our modern worlds problem \n            with digitalization and KI invading our life. \n\nCON:\n\n- you\u00b4ll face a wall of text, young padawan\n- some characters act realy flat, like your main character (Estelle)\n- a dramatically told story about \"staying together and we can reach everything\" which is not for everyone\n- very long-winded story, which need some serious time to evolve\n- combat system that needs some time to understand (putting quarz in the right orders)\n\nNOTE: If you havent played \"Trails in the sky first chapter\" you are missing some serious \n            background knowledge to understand what\u00b4s even going on.

Because of this i'll review both the First Chapter (FC) and Second Chapter (SC) briefly. Having taken a chance on The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky FC, I couldnt wait to continue the story in this follow up chapter. SC was definetly not a disapointment!! The journey was emotional, brutal and intricate. The Characters were so well written and thought out to me that I loved every little piece of dialogue - from the main cast to the random NPCs. The battle system was incredibly fun and although there was a learning curve at the beginning it eventually became second nature. The puzzels and main quests were so much fun. The side quests were for me a mix bag. Some side quests were unique others were repetitive in the FC. However, by the SC the quests feel much more important to the plot. \n\nOverall I give the: \nFC an 8/10. It was a slow burn that heated up towards its climax end. \nSC an 9/10.

The exciting and engaging story continues! Prepare to fall more in love with the characters. If you haven't played the first game, you will be confused because this is simply a continuation of the first, as in, exactly where it leaves off. There is some new music in this one, and a few updates to the orbment system.  You can transfer your completed game data from the first game, which I recommend.

There is no option to speed things up like let's say you want just want to do regular attacks without having to manually pressing enter and left click. No assignment to do auto cast of magic spells. You'll end up scrolling to look for the \"same spell\" that you want to use. This gets tedious when you have multiple magic on a character. The sepith and orbment is complex and the high-end spells are difficult to get since you'll need to mix-up different quartz to make sure you hit the required elemental requirement.\n- Sidequests: Repeatitive.

It was a wonderful experience, and I'm almost sorry it had to end. If you want a traditional JRPG with a metric ton of world-building, then this is your game. The battle system is straightforward and simple, but is constructed such that there can be a lot of different ways to approach battles and construct a strategy to win them. The magic system, which consists of an orbment device that you place pieces of 'quartz' into slots in order to mix and match spells, is unique and fun. I got excited every time I was able to upgrade to a few new spells. Especially near the end when Kloe becomes an absolute powerhouse.\n\nSpeaking of the characters, you will fall in love with them in this game. It's why I played almost 90 hours (not including the 45 I put into the First Chapter). This has to be one of the longest JRPG's I've ever played, and there is a ton to do in-game. The sidequests almost always build character growth (except for the monster-extermination quests), but you don't have to do them. I recommend it though if you want to be strong enough at the end of the game. Back to the characters: they are charming, varied, and you will love following their journey.

But eh, knowing ol' Bokxie here, he isn't satisfied with just that.\n\nActually, I am, but allow me to elaborate. There are few games out there that to world building and character development as well as this game (and the first game of course). This game does take it's time for that, but look past that and you have a masterpiece on your hand. Likewise, I also took my time because I wanted to see and know everything the world of Trails has to offer. Half of the game's dialogue is just optional world building, but I wanted to read them because it's done so well. And even though you revisit Liberl again in this game, it is not a repetitive and boring return. The sequel does enough to make Liberl a lively place yet again. And yeah, the characters in the first game return, and become even better in this game with more story behind them. Also a few new faces I definitely welcome.\n\nThat is not to say the gameplay is lacking either. The gameplay is well done for a JRPG. Nothing that stands out from other JRPGs, but it is very engaging, and some of the boss battles in this game were some of the most intense I had in any JRPG out there. The OST also helped with that, setting the mood perfectly in whatever situation it demanded.\n\nI mean, I could go on and on, but I think I made my point clear. The only negatives I could come up with relate to personal preferences, like the game being long and taking it's time. If you do mind that, then maybe this isn't the game for you, and that's exactly what Trails in the Sky is: a masterpiece if you can appreciate it taking it's time to develop itself. If not well.. then I can't guarantee you'll like it. You can play the first game, which is also very good and while the games are directly related to each other, the first game's still has an ending for that game, though with a cliffhanger for the second game. If you enjoyed that game, you can always come back here and see if you want to play the game.\n\nI mean, I have played tons of JRPGs, and for over a decade Final Fantasy VI was my favourite game. And then suddenly this game comes along and aims to rob that place, with the both of them sharing the honour of being my favourite game now.

The gameplay is fun, the artwork and music are absolutely beautiful and the characters and story are well fleshed out and fun. Some if the dialogue in the game had me laughing quite literally out loud (for the right reasons). Even though there are 3 Trails in the sky games, This one ties up a lot and doesn't leave the story in a cliff hanger, so the game feels very complete, but there's definitely a bit of groundwork put down for the next game.\n\nIf you played Trails FC first (which you really should do) then you can expect the same battle system and many of the same locations. There are bracer guild missions and main story as in the last game. The main difference is that you get to choose party members from quite an early stage in the game.\n\nThe battles in the field don't seem as challenging as in the FC. I remember having to be quite careful Ina all of the early fights in FC, but in this game the battle strategy was no so important. Boss battles were a different matter, and some took a couple of goes to work out how to approach them. If you read the forums, many talk about a particularly difficult boss near the end of the game, which some say took a lot of luck and levelling up. It took me three tries and no grinding, just had to explore its weaknesses, change my magic set up a tiny bit  and devise the right strategy. I'd say the battles are fair, and  some are intended to make you feel like they are much harder, until you get the correct strategy.\n\nAs with FC, the characters, the artwork and the music are what I really love about this game, and most of falcoms games.

In my opinion, that this game is about equal to its predecessor. I can't really think about signfiicant differences between the two (this game might actually be a little harder), but this is a very accessible game with tons of things to do. My favorite part? If you have both games downloaded, and the first game cleared, you can migrate certain rewards over to this game. You get rewarded for playing the events of the first game. That is so dope i can't even explain. It really touches on the old era of having a game saved on your memory card, playing the sequel, and getting rewarded for that. That's delightful.\n\nMoving onto plot: it's a little weaker. it introduces a lot of questions and dones't give enough answers. It's also one of those \"Game of Thrones\" ways of telling the story because there are quite a few different stories going on all at the same time. Furthermore, because there are so many characters involved, it's hard to develop the characters in the right way, the ones important that is, and have a strong, coherant story.\n\nAll in all. great game.

I'm unquestionably a fan.\nBut there are things that make me terribly conflicted about how this sequel goes forward from its predecessor; something I'll save towards the conclusion so I can give what's praiseworthy its due time, because there is PLENTY to remark on that shouldn't turn you away from this experiencing this gem, regardless of my thoughts.\n\nSC brings much deeper combat and more of a challenge. Even normal enemies aren't pushovers anymore and the boss battles are large-scale and take retries. What I appreciated the most was how much the magic system opens up to let you reach those fancy arts hinted in the back of the in-game guide, which I didn't know how to reach in the past game. Once all the tools are in the box, the customability that results is super fun. Party members who switched in and out during the length of FC are now usable for much longer, something that made me glad to rely on my favorites and feel a little guilty for letting some fall to the wayside (Sorry, Tita).\n\nThe presentation is immensely stepped up, with a handful of lovely cutscenes paired up with what is still one of the best soundtracks I've heard in gaming (Do yourself a favor and search the OST for 'The Whereabouts of Hope').\n\nI praised the level of detail present in the first game and definitely found it again here, with NPCs continuing their personal stories. There's still enough depth to cause me to miss some quests and collectables since the world is just as vast and complex, even though it is being explored a second time - and perhaps therein lies the root of the problem.\n\nSC does the right thing and changes up the formula a bit, choosing to detach itself from the previous story built by the two main characters and spends much of the time traversing the world over again. The other party members flesh out their backstories in the meantime, which is a fine trade-off to me. But over time it starts to feel like padding, almost. How can this happen if SC's playtime is even longer than the first?\n\nSC becomes less and less spectacular as it shifts its focus on \"the next big battle ahead\" rather than \"the next big adventure to be had\", if that makes sense. You're released onto the world with more freedom but much of it has already been seen, learned about, and drank in for all its initial worth. Towards the concluding chapters, to put it rather bluntly and spoiler-free, it entrenches itself in a typical RPG gauntlet of fight after fight. Some storytelling in between connects the dots and wraps up narratives and it manages to deliver a sweet ending, yet it ends so [b]abruptly[/b] - without much fanfare - still memorable, but still proving that it could forget so much of the world I initially fell in love with. It basically left me feeling like I hadn't actually saved it because I was off somewhere else. The characters had practically outgrown the setting and turned their attentions elsewhere. It's a minor qualm, honestly, but it's a strange symptom of wonderfully-written characters shedding their skins to stop being people and more like gods. It's a problem that any other typical JRPG might stumble into whereas I feel Trails in the Sky should be setting itself apart.\n\nThis sophomore slump won't shake my faith in playing the third portion of the trilogy when it releases this May. In fact, I can't wait to see if it carries on with renewed energy now that the supervillians I spent chasing for nearly the entirety of this edition are (perhaps?) no more. I want to keep seeing new places and meeting new people, basically getting back to the journey and seeing the focus on character growth take place.

Moreover, some side quests even add more depth to not only main character but to normal npcs as well. \n\nHowever, there is also a negative side:\nGame structure overall is great, but some are repetitive. Lack of modern appeal may be an issues.\n\nOverall, it is a fantastic games that focus on world building and story more than any other JRPGs. Please give it a try. ALSO WARNING: Please finish FC first because it is a sequel.\nMoreover, Trail in the Sky the 3rd is coming too, as well as Trail of Cold Steel.

I have been waiting to play this game ever since i played the first one on psp back in 2011.I must say it is definitly worth the wait. \n\nThe story is really well written with the relationships between the characters as strong as ever. Even the relationships between the npc are good you can get sucked in to find out whats going on between each one. It takes a lot of hard work to get every npc in a game to be different in one way or another a lot of care was put in to the writting. \n\nThis game will probebly run me another 60+ hours currently which is ok because the story keeps you engaged and always wondering whats going to happen next. \n\nNow let's talk the about the battle system. They added a new element called chain and this puts another layer of stradegy in play. you could save up your cp for your specail attack or if its worth doing you can combine normal attacks with other party members and hit either multiple enemies or a single target depending on the range. \n\nIf you played the first game then other then what i mentioned the battle system plays very much the same.There is a wide variety of new spells you can use so managing your orbment better this time around will be well worth it to use those screen filling attacks. \n\nThis part of the legend of heroes games made me a huge fan now with the third game on the way and the cold steel series on the way i can play \"most\" of the saga I would very much like it if the older games could be ported as well but i guess there has to be demand for that to happen. \n\n\nAs for the sound track it adds a few new tunes to the game but since you are playing in the same world you will reconize some familer tracks from the first game. I would have liked some more new music but from what i heard so far the current sound track is still good. \n\n\nThis game is definitly bigger then the first game adding more plot twists because naturally and a lot more oliver because everyone loves him aparently and yes he is just as sarcastic as ever. so basically if you like a well written plot with unforgettable characters and an excellent battle system then buy this game. \n\n$34.99 is more then worth it. But if your one of those people that get games on sale then i won't judge you. \n\n...\nI've been waiting to leave one bad part till last because i just hate saying something bad about a well loved game.The frames do drop randomly. I have played the game on both capped frame rate and uncapped frame rate and for some reason in certain areas the game does chug alittle under 20 fps But keep in mind it is still perfectly playable and it's normally just on the field.", "timestamp_created": 1491606405, "timestamp_updated": 1491606405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515306", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30909800": {"recommendationid": "30909800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046508836", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 6083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452983710}, "language": "english", "review": "This is literally the greatest masterpiece ever created.", "timestamp_created": 1491164793, "timestamp_updated": 1491164793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30893898": {"recommendationid": "30893898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174310546", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489396372}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u7cfb\u5217\u6545\u4e8b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5df2\u7ecf\u4e0d\u9700\u591a\u8a00\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0cSC\u76ee\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u80fd\u7528\u6c49\u5316\uff0c8.1\u5c0f\u65f6\u6253\u5b8c\u5e8f\u7ae0\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u7b49\u4e00\u4e2a\u6c49\u5316\u597d\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1491113703, "timestamp_updated": 1491113703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30881689": {"recommendationid": "30881689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013620895", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491054425}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would cast earth wall again.\n\nThis is one of the best JRPGs I've had the pleasure of playing.

The game plays basically the same, and the positives from the previous game are still seen here (good story, memorable characters, excellent writing and dialogues, and entertaining gameplay), so I will only touch on the difference here, and that is: female protagonist. This game is much more of a story of Estelle than the previous one was. And the game has a habbit of repeatedly making it known to you. In each chapter you'll hear the line, \"Estelle, you have grown\" or one of its variations (\"Estelle, there is a new steel in you\", \"Estelle, you seem more mature\", etc.) thrown at you at least ten times. \n\nProblem is she has not really grown at all, so one is left wondering what the protagonist has done to deserve this constant praise. It also has a lot of illogical moments where said protagonist takes charge and commands action from those much senior to her. This considering the fact that Estelle is not meant to be smart in any way whatsoever as a character leaves us scratching our heads a little bit. \n\nI'm also not at all into sibling romance bullsh*t. Okay they aren't blood related, but they've been living in the same house for 5 years+ and are calling the same person their dad, and now suddenly get feelings for each other? Urgh. In that way this game is pretty restricting. You cannot make any important choices and are pretty much stuck watching a linear storyline unfold. \n\nThese are just my opinions though, and if you like the character of Estelle, and have no problem with the whole Estelle x Joshua shipping, you'll enjoy this game just as much as the first.", "timestamp_created": 1491037896, "timestamp_updated": 1491037896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30865374": {"recommendationid": "30865374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170719755", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498609907}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has the best story ever", "timestamp_created": 1491010031, "timestamp_updated": 1491010031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606743", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30770745": {"recommendationid": "30770745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056024163", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 280, "last_played": 1514237887}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game i loved all the text the storyline was great i just can't wait till the 3rd comes out", "timestamp_created": 1490615614, "timestamp_updated": 1490615614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30770595": {"recommendationid": "30770595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227341416", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490509268}, "language": "english", "review": "The only J/RPG that I really enjoy.

It is quite lengthy, between this game and its prequel, I spent about 110 hours completing the main story (fyi if you're reading this and haven't played the first game somehow, you absolutely MUST play the first before SC, as SC literally picks up immediately after the events of the original) and it was worth every second.  While the main overarching story isn't particularly amazing, it's really the characters and interactions with the world that make the game so special.  All the character personalities bounce off each other naturally in every piece of dialogue and make it a joy to read through, even when there's a lot (and believe me there is a LOT) of exposition going on.  While SC does reuse a lot of the first game's assets for obvious reasons, it never really felt like a boring retread, there's plenty of new story events going on and new dungeons within previously explored areas that I never really found myself faulting the game for this design decision.  The detail crammed into the world is immense, down to even some NPCs having their own side stories you can follow if you decide to talk to them as you progress through the game and run into them.  XSeed also went one extra step with the localization by adding humourous messages when you try to inspect a previously opened chest, and SC has a much larger variety of them too, it took me until probably the last 15 hours or so in the game before I started noticing repeated messages; its a fun touch that also shows the care the localization team took.  \n\nBasically, this game and its prequel are now definitely up there among my top JRPGs of all time, and are well worth your money, even at full price.

Gorgeous soundtrack, an aesthetic that has resisted aging, and a plotline that stays engaging throughout, along with a basically grind-free gameplay arc and some really interesting mechanics - these things are all well and good, but it's the writing (and localisation!) that take the crown. For a jRPG villain to monologue usually means switching off your brain for five minutes while they babble some incoherent Babby's First Negative Utilitarianism half-baked philosophy, and conversely the heroes' response is typically pretty vacuous as well. Not so here, to say the least. And in every scene, there'll be some character saying something that's just *phrased right*, in some hard to define way, and it makes you smile or laugh or cry along with them. \n\nThis game takes the jRPG genre's flaws - edgy protagonists with dark pasts, settings that seem confused about whether to be sci-fi or fantasy, daft plotlines that take forever to get anywhere - and doesn't so much refute them as forgive them, accepting that they're going to do those things and then showing how they can be done right and more than right. Given that this is also in a sense a large part of what happens in-game, I think it's safe to call this one of the great reconstructions. \n\nIt's not often you see a game this good.

Once again the characters steal the show, as they expand on everyone's characteristics, background, everything really.  The amount of detail put into characters like Agate, Kloe, Tita, Olivier, Schera, Zane, etc is something I wish more games did because it helps get you invested into the game and the story.  They are very easy to relate to since everybody has their strengths and their flaws, like we all do irl.  Of course the game revolves around Estelle and Joshua, both of which really get expanded roles since they are away from each other for an extended time, and helps the player really get to know who they are, almost like you're walking alongside them.  And that reunion, my God, that reunion I had such high hopes for and it did not disappoint at all.  Very powerful moment.  That whole Estelle-Joshua relationship really felt special to me.  With characters like these, it makes the game so rewarding to play, because you want to learn more and you want to experience more, just for the sake of the characters alone.  \n\nBut the reason I praise the characters so highly, is because the game fell short in a couple of ways.  First the story, while good, felt forced near the end, sometimes lost focus, and was at times not paced very well.  At the end I basically willed my way through the final dungeon without paying much attention.  When I played the first game, I tried to complete as much as possible, and it took me 50 hours, but the story gripped me.  This time, same approach, and the hours jumped to 73 hours, and I felt the game could have kept the story untouched but still shaved 15-20 hours of extra stuff that didnt need to be there.  I didnt change anything  I did from the first game; I didnt really grind, I did as many sidequests as I found.  I also thought that the final boss was a little generic for this game's standards.\n\nFinally, I have to give a tip of the cap for the treasure chests.  Its not only clever, I was rolling on a few of them.  The Monty Python references made me die laughing.  Just watch the sketch that got referenced by the one German speaking chest.  Its a little touch, but it shows me that they take the time to really care about making sure every part of the game was up to par.  And as a gamer, I appreciate that effort.\n\nIf you're prepared to put time in, play this game.  The character work alone makes it rewarding.", "timestamp_created": 1485388741, "timestamp_updated": 1485564916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29454728": {"recommendationid": "29454728", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960588951", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 3008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485238805}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't out-right say the game is good or bad.

Why haven't you bought this game already??\n\nTrails in the Sky is an AMAZING rpg with soooo many unique and fun bits to it.

If you're looking for a game with those 3 things then this game is perfect! You've got many diverse characters, lots of side-quests and secrets to find, fun & flexible fighting, AAAAAAAAND you can gamble all your money away in a casino in one of the towns! :3\n\n9.8/10\nOverall - If you have 80-120 hours to spare, and want a fun game to get attatched to, THIS game is perfect! Also, the game includes a lot of dialog, so if you dont like that kind of stuff then leave now, but otherwise, PLAY IT.

All of them. Including NPCs. And even the cat that only says \"meow\" \n+ Story is a bit cheesy and predictable, however it is still very charming \n+ Great music!\n\nI've had so much fun playing this game that I had to limit myself to prevent myself from finishing too early. I've spent hours fine tuning which characters joined my party, their roles within the party and what orbments they recieve. \n\nThe turn based gameplay itself is very well done, arts ('spells') are not cast on the same turn you select them which adds a very interesting dynamic to the battles, where you have to plan ahead if you use arts based characters. In this game, positioning really matters and that ups a level of the game. I can't explain how fluid everything feels, it's something you just have to experience.\n\nNow the crux of why I think this game is amazing: It's characters all have some sort of depth. When you play this game, the world you play in breathes and lives. Every character has their own lives independent of the main character and they don't all completely rely on the protagonist like most games do. They solve their own problems, have their own personalities and you can see storylines completely separate from the main story unfold just by talking to various NPC's and piecing together what they say to you. At least half the game was me running around talking to every single character in game because I actually care about their struggles, even if I can't help them because I want to know what's going on in their lives. S+ for characterisation.\n\nThe music has also improved from FC. New soundtracks sound amazing, and the remixes of the main theme are awesome. The music really does set the mood for the scene.\n\nWhat also stood out to me were the themes of female independence, of course there are bits where they reinforce old stereotypes of women but it's to be expected for the age it's set in. It doesn't go over the top with GIRL POWA but as the main protagonist is a girl, they do a very good job with her character. Her strength doesn't come just with her fighting power. Would make little girls play/10\n\nNow as for the actual plot, it follow a very typical RPG plot of saving the world but it's still incredibly charming in it's own way. It's incredibly linear, but the characters flesh it out into something interesting. PLAY IT\n\nThe bad:\n+ Trope heavy. Characters can fall for commonly used tropes\n+ Cheesey writing \n+ Not much to look at \n\nIf you can look past that, and enjoy turn based rpgs and a decent story line with bomb characters I would

Not only is it a direct sequel, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not playing the first game (typically called \"FC\") in the series. Story is the main draw of this series and you'll be lost if you play this one first. It's also worth noting that it's hard to discuss this game without spoiling the first to some degree. With that out of the way, how does it stack up?\n\nFC introduced us to the region of Liberl, its host of characters, its technology, and the geopolitical landscape of the series as a whole. Its gameplay was a bit lackluster and simplistic, but boy did it have a fantastic story. If Final Fantasy is dominated by artists, Trails in the Sky is dominated by writers all the same. Every character, every city, every country, and every extranational organization is chock full of detailed backstory and the characters are brimming with personality. The pacing is slow, but the payoff is far greater than one would expect from a game.\n\nSC continues that tradition and gives us a bigger picture of Liberl Kingdom, its neighbors, and the organization known as Ouroboros which is undermining its stability. As in FC, you will be greeted with walls of text wherever you visit. Hour long story breaks are commonplace but they tell it so well. The localization is impeccable and remarkably witty, characters are deep and intelligent, and character interactions are fantastic and surprisingly detailed. If the game weren't so ridiculously long, you could see any number of interactions by going back and choosing different character combinations for your party. Even the sidequests that aren't basic monster hunts(common) or fetch quests(rare) are story rich -- for sidequests anyway. If you're a \"story in games\" junkie like I am, you'll absorb every last detail of the world they've created and still be itching for more.\n\nSC also vastly improves the battle system. It has a wider variety of arts (spells), crafts (skills), orbments (augment/spellcraft), and status ailments which make gameplay far more interesting than the original. Battles require more intricate strategy than the original, and a number of optional (sidequest) bosses offer interesting challenges as well. As with FC, the gameplay is not grindy. Experience scales down with level which makes catching up pretty simple -- a mere 10 minutes of grinding is the most you'd ever need, and that's only if you usually run past monsters to begin with. You also get an orbment early on that allows you to avoid monsters entirely. To avoid frustration, you can save anywhere and retry battles upon game over.\n\nThe one major downside is that a large amount of the game's content is recycled from the original game. A lot of the SC's music is from FC. Maybe 3/5th of the maps are straight from FC, albeit with new events and quests. Character sprites aside from Estelle and Joshua are exactly the same. It comes with the territory, being a direct sequel, but some might find it disappointing. On the bright side, if you completed FC and carried over your save, you can get a lot of new dialogue (and even some items) based on sidequests you completed in FC.\n\nSpeaking of graphics and sound, the sound effects are solid and the voices are clear. The music is catchy but somewhat lacking in variety seeing how FC and SC are a combined 140 or so hours if you do all the sidequests and don't skip cutscenes. The graphics are...graphics. They probably won't wow you, and there haven't been any fixes put in for widescreen, but the sprites are cute.\n\nThe final chapter (aka \"The 3rd\") has been announced for 2017, so it's definitely worth grabbing FC and this game.

play it, complete it 100%, and THEN get this game and carry it over. It's worth it in more ways than one, believe me, and you won't feel totally lost here!\n\nThis is one of my highly recommended JRPG series for a good reason - excellent gameplay mechanics, great in-depth and compelling storyline carried straight over from the first game without missing a beat, and of course the characters - of which you get to control some new characters you didn't in the first game.\n\nYou will probably spend a lot of time exploring and talking to NPCs just like in the first game, but that's the beauty of it - the game world is so beautifully done it makes you WANT to explore every nook and cranny of it, it makes you WANT to actually do those side quests. Sure, the graphics are a bit dated, but the level of detail is still overwhelmingly good for a game like this. Oh and there are a few places outside of battle where the environment itself does damage to you/your party, which is new to SC.\n\nI also have to give high marks for the music. A lot of the music was carried over from FC (and hey the music in that game was great too!), but many new tracks were added in as well, especially for the various combat themes.\n\nThe combat system is the same as it was in FC, with some nice enhancements to it - the least of which I'll mention is the addition of new crafts (including the Chain Craft system) and new orbal arts thanks to enhanced Orbments. Oh. And attack food. You heard me right. Nothing more satisfying than to chuck a cookie at an enemy and watch it do the damage.\n\nAnd of course the witty treasure chests are back! I will make a note here that initially when I first played through, they weren't all that unique at first, you had to play through a bit before you saw much in that. It may have changed in the meantime, but just keep that in mind.\n\nThe fishing minigame has been enhanced (you can now fish in many more spots and there's more challenge to it), and there's also gambling minigames now - you can play poker, blackjack, roulette. You even have a side quest involving gambling now. I spent a fair amount of time in the gambling minigames because like the real deal they were ADDICTING!\n\nEnough of me rambling on about the game. IF you've played the first game, then hurry up and get this game and continue the story! If you don't have the first game, GET IT FIRST, play it through, then get SC and carry over your completed FC save over!

It is beyond the point of clich\u00e9 here, everyone has a sad story which made them turn evil and everyone has a connection of some sort to someone in the party, what are the odds and why does it have to be so awkward :D But whatever, that doesnt really matter when you look at the near masterpiece that is Trails in the sky SC. \nI simply adore the world, the characters, the interactions, lore, explorations and even the combat. I was so praying for a happy ending for Joshua and Estelle, their relationship is so real and understandable that it made me smile so widely when they met up again. For the first time ever, I think, I did not dislike the brooding main hero who left the girl to \"protect her\", because Joshua actually had a reason, and Estelle, being the exact opposite of a damsel in distress, kicked his ass till he straightened up and brout everything to a happy ending. They honestly are among my most favorite gaming couple's of all times, if not at the top of the list.\nI honestly lack the words to describe the great ride you will have with this game if you enjoy story heavy rpg's. All the small details and funny conversations simply put this above a generic rpg's of this age, it is original and inventive and all the expected clich\u00e9's aside the character's motivations and actins are relatable and understandable.

Otherwise, if you can get past a bit of rust you can enjoy a very well explored, lengthy setting with good customization and competent combat that has related titles still releasing as of 2016.  There isn't much in the genre that can compete with this series in terms of scope, interconnectivity and character development.  This game also taught me that force-feeding your angriest friend tomato sandwiches will allow them to kill anything.\n\nLong version of the review: This recommendation comes with a few caveats: First, play the first chapter first.  If you didn't make it through that, you definitely won't make it through this.  In a more general sense for the series, Trails in the Sky is a very long trilogy with a sort of plodding pace to it and antiquated system- if you even have to ask if that's your thing, it probably isn't.  This is a game that nearly made the localizer nearly kill himself, it's got more text than more books and if you want to do more than scratch the surface you can expect a playtime approaching mine.\n\nSC continues on almost exactly where the first chapter left off- both plotwise and mechanics-wise.  They quickly update you on what's changed in what is actually one of the more cut-throat tutorials I've ever seen.  I don't recommend starting on hard like I did, and I strongly urge no one to start on nightmare- you will be stuck a long while grinding and possibly crying in the prologue if you do.\n\nThe game eventually expands into a partially de-lineated JRPG wherein the sidequests and talking multiple times to everyone is the focus.  Completing the sidequests is for the most part worth your time, as it gives much needed money and equips which random encounters do not provide, a great deal of dialogue and sometimes insight into the setting.  Some of the objectives to maximize quest rewards are pretty obtuse, and even missing talking to a single person between important plot points can be a serious frustration.\n\nTrails in the sky is fairly well seperated into ten chapters with either a different focus on geographical location or situation.  While there is a lot of re-used assets from the first game, part of the appeal is the familiarity mixed with some of the new stuff, and continuing relationships with the characters your character strives to protect.  Given the sheer volume of quests, lack of auto-travel and length of the game, however, you may be inspired to take breaks.  I certainly did.\n\nThe combat in this game was fairly novel for its time way back in 2003, but runs into limitations when being pushed.  Eschewing turn-based combat for delay-based actions makes speed and numbers relevant, but also hyper-relevant.  When the game robs you of party members or ambushes you or surrounds you, your options are very limited and generally you're going to be relying on luck.  While this can be nice and tense and result in memorable fights, once you get down a character or two you're probably just waiting to die.  On the harder difficulties, cheese is kind of mandatory, especially since grinding isn't really an option.  There's a bit of depth in how one, say, spams the equivlent of limit breaks known as S-Crafts, since they generate a lot of delay, but once your game plan is set you generally stick to it.\n\nOrbments (Basically a fancy magic pocketwatch with replaceable magic stones), equipment and character selection do allow for some interesting customization, but a lot of the more interesting options are only provided if you keep up religiously with sidequests.  Towards the end of the game however, it's easy to realize that most of the gems fall into certain colours and that due to the action economy there's a few must-haves for act time that you can't really live without that your options almost become more limited.  Customization is also fraught with complications like leaving your good gems with characters that leave temporarily or just the fact that you can't unequip everyone at once (or equip them if you get them during a cutscene/fight).  Being able to save anywhere and the sheer number of slots available help alleviate this, however.\n\nThe closest thing to a crafting component to the game is the cooking system.  Food is obnoxiously powerful and generally much more economical than any equivelent items once you fork out an initial investment.  I personally love incongruous attack item spam in these sorts of games, so being able to defeat many early and difficult encounters by throwing stale cookies and meatballs at them was very enjoyable for me.  For a long time there are logistical concerns about what food you bring and cook, but towards the end of the game it's fairly trivial to make a few dozen tomato sandwiches and shove them down your character's gullets until everything is dead.  Even the rather terrifying optional battle was won through liberal use of tomato sandwiches with a side of cheese.\n\nOn the subject of cheese, the villainous elements of the game tend to fall on the cartoonish side.  This isn't exactly strange for the genre, and it's called out by the much more well-rounded player character cast to some degree, but some of the dialogue is so flamboyant it'll make you roll your eyes around and around.  There's plenty of other goofiness and sort of misplaced levity at times, but given that the main characters are teenagers and the localization is pretty well done I'd say it's not really out of place.  There's some good dialogue, a tremendous number of characters and unique lines, consistent characterization including growth and reaction to different events over time... when you build a comparable relationship to any given airship engineer that you'd expect to build with the Yarl of Whiterun in Skyrim, you know they've got something a bit special.  It's on a level that isn't easily matched in terms of concurrent narratives that you can explore, and that's pretty rad.  It just takes a lot of time, is all.\n\nGraphics are dated but serviceable.  Lack of camera rotation and re-used tiling in certain places can be a pain, and it's part of the generation of JRPGs that loaded in long-ass spells and special moves to show off that particle effects were a thing.  Very little looks outright bad or indistinct, and some of the monster animations and designs are so bizarre they manage to come off as horrifying.  The cutscenes are pretty good for their time however, and have excellent detail and fairly good length the odd time they show up.  The final cutscene in particular is very elaborate, and I appreciated how it conveyed the scope of the aftermath of the conflict.\n\nThe music is incredible as always- it's Falcom.  Problems arise from the fact that the number of tracks don't really match the game length- as much as I love the combat theme, they needed a bit more variety, especially since a lot of themes are variants of \"The Whereabouts of Light\" or \"Golden eyes, Silver Will\"- while I love variants and leitmotifs, more was needed.\n\nIn summary, there aren't a lot of games that can match the scope of this duology and its continuation beyond simply because of breadth of content, depth of optional storylines and relationships with characters and customization options.  The tone is a bit juvenile and anime, but if you want something heartwarming and intricate it certainly has its moments.  If you wanted to sink a hundred hours plus into an old-fashioned JRPG series, I'd probably point you here first, and for that this game and its predecessor has my approval.

Avec les quartz, il est soit possible d'augmenter les caract\u00e9ristiques des personnages (force, points de vie, etc.), soit possible de donner des statuts n\u00e9gatifs aux attaques physiques (sommeil, p\u00e9trification, etc.).\n- La difficult\u00e9 est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement bien dos\u00e9e si on fait suffisamment de batailles, qu'on porte attention aux statuts n\u00e9gatifs inflig\u00e9s par les ennemis et qu'on fait la plupart des qu\u00eates.\n- Il est possible d'\u00e9viter et de fuir et d'\u00e9viter des combats facilement, ce qui est pratique quand on est trop fort dans une zone ou quand on veut simplement faire des qu\u00eates sans avoir un combat aux cinq secondes.\n- \u00c0 certains moments de l'histoire, les personnages sont mandat\u00e9s \u00e0 faire des petites enqu\u00eates, ce qui est int\u00e9ressant.\n- Le but du jeu n'est pas de sauver le monde, contrairement \u00e0 ce que l'on voit dans bien d'autres jeux du genre. L'action du jeu se limite dans un royaume et dans ses environs. Les enjeux deviennent importants, mais jamais plan\u00e9taires. \n- Les villes et villages sont diff\u00e9rents de ce que l'on retrouve dans les autres RPG. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, ce qui distingue les villages dans les RPG est la zone g\u00e9ographique (d\u00e9serts, eau, froid, for\u00eat, etc.). Dans ce jeu, ce qui distingue les villes et villages peut \u00eatre un ar\u00e9na, une zone portuaire plus importante, une zone de boutiques, etc.  \n\nPoint n\u00e9gatifs :\n\n- Les dialogues sont long et r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs, surtout vers la fin quand on est impatient de terminer le jeu.\n- La dur\u00e9e pour faire les qu\u00eates avant qu'elles \u00e9chouent n'est pas pr\u00e9cise et est souvent trop courte. J'aurais aim\u00e9 pouvoir faire un bout d'histoire, une qu\u00eate, un bout d'histoire, une qu\u00eate, mais parce que j'avais \u00e9chou\u00e9 des qu\u00eates \u00e0 cause d'un d\u00e9lai arbitraire, je me sentais oblig\u00e9 de les faire d\u00e8s qu'elles apparaissaient, ce qui \u00e9tait une vraie corv\u00e9e.  \n- Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments cach\u00e9s sont trop faciles \u00e0 rater. Pour avoir une arme ultime, il faut quelque chose comme 14 objets et certains objets sont faciles \u00e0 rater, car on les a quand on parle \u00e0 un personnage X apr\u00e8s un \u00e9v\u00e9nement Y, ce qui est impossible \u00e0 deviner sans guide. \n- Dans les combats, la magie ne sert pas beaucoup, compte tenu qu'il y a un d\u00e9lai entre le moment o\u00f9 on lance le sort et o\u00f9 le sort prend effet, ce qui d\u00e9savantage la magie par rapport aux autres types d'attaques.

I really look forward to seeing Falcom and Xseed and what not put more and more JRPGs on PC regardless of age or original platform, although new ones would be great also since we don't see a lot in the US at all especially on PC.\n\nI do recommend this game, however it is a direct as in RIGHT AFTER sequel to Trails in the Sky, so do not play this one until you've played the previous one it's less of a sequel and more of a second half.\n\nWhile I will say I think I'd highly rate the former game a tad higher because the content was completely fresh, while this one is fresh on story, much of the world is directly recycled from the former game (same game engine and all) also almost all the same characters are playable except a little more choice than before.\n\nRegardless of the repeated content it's also sometimes interesting to go revisit places you've saved or whatnot before and see what's going on there, as well as having a familiarity with the existing world already so when people talk about something half way across the map you get the gist of what that is. Also, the map is a little more free roaming than before, in the first title you end up linearly stuck in areas a lot more often than you see in this part of the story.\n\nIf you already played the previous one, expect more of the great well written dialog though that really builds characters well. Expect a few more faces in your party, Expect a lot more moving around the world, but mostly to places you've been to before. Expect revisiting old characters you've met in the past and seeing what they're up to now which is great. Expect the same battle system but with a few more characters involved and a lot more powerful magic. Oh yeah, and the orbament configuration system is totally different. Also, while I enjoyed the game I think the battles were a bit less difficult actually especially the final boss in comparison, but no matter it's a great game either way, if you enjoy JRPGs this is a great buy but play the previous one first or you probably won't enjoy the story at all because you won't know what's going on!", "timestamp_created": 1480272119, "timestamp_updated": 1480272119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27851288": {"recommendationid": "27851288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081397531", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503701221}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best JRPG experience you can get on steam, play it asap.* :feena:\n*: please play Trails in the Sky FC before this\n", "timestamp_created": 1480263888, "timestamp_updated": 1480263888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504294", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27835803": {"recommendationid": "27835803", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987087540", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492127409}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely incredible game and follow up to FC.\nThe biggest positives to the Trails games without a doubt has to be the wonderfully written characters.

And will another 100 hours of the same still be fun at the end?\"\n\nWell, expectations were blown away. Admittedly, I didn't really use the new chain craft system so there wasn't a ton of improvement in the battle system in my book. And unlike with Trails of Cold Steel 2 which felt the need to present ever-more-powerful arts and S breaks that eventually bordered on the absurd and resulted in a largely broken system where pretty much every boss but the final boss could be one or two-shotted, SC kept its balance which I appreciate - Even if it doesn't make much sense that Estelle has smacked a guy directly in the face 50 times with a metal staff and he's still standing. Hey, need to have some suspension of disbleief.\n\nAnyways, the story is where the game stepped up to the plate, and it hit it out of the park. Where it could have been sappy it was serious, while not taking away from the obvious emotional themes running through our protagonist's head. It did a lot to expand the world, and make you constantly want to know more about the world and other countries -which thankfully you get to explore more in Cold Steel, and if it's ever localized, the Crossbell arc.\n\nOverall, a truly masterful game that's stood the test of time that was expertly localized.

The characters are so charming, lovable, well-written, and so well-developed, including even the villains, which honestly feel more like well-intentioned extremists at times rather than outright villainous. The OST is simply marvelous, whether it be boss battle themes (like the one down here) or emotional tracks, it all fits so well and sounds amazing. Sure, the game looks outdated at first glance, but it sure as heck doesn't feel that way, and the battle system is quite easy to grasp, especially if you're not used to turn-based games. \n\nOverall, Trails in the Sky was one of the best video games I've experienced in quite a while, and it was worth every minute and so worth buying.

Better plot, more character development, better twists, updated combat, vastly superior music.\n\nOnce again, I found myself much invested in the travails of our heroes, as they try to stop a countrywide scheme with much more at stake than the previous game. The main and supporting characters get noticeably more mature in their mannerisms and actions as they develop organically through the plot. Certainly there are anime cliches here and there (but to be honest, I don't watch much anime aside from say DBZ so I can't really comment on this), but the characters are so well fleshed out and human that you can easily overlook them.\n\nNOTE: I forgot to mention in the previous review that in order to enjoy the game you have to be comfortable reading text. There is no voice-over, so expect a good amount of reading (not remotely close to crpg levels of reading, but definitely not for call of duty players). But then again, most of the conversations are thoroughly entertaining and do make sense.\n\nI am keenly looking forward to Trails in the Sky TC english version coming to steam early next year.

It told the story of Estelle Bright and her adopted borther Joshua, as the two sought to become full time bracers as well as uncovering a mysterious conspiracy that would send their kingdom into chaos. The sequel to Trails in The Sky, SC(Second Chapter), after years of waiting and an additional year long delay, had had many fans hungry for a continuation of the story; a burning desire to return to its immersive world,  and the incredibly charming old-school RPG gameplay surrounding it. SC finally arrived in 2015 of October for PSP, Vita, and PC for digital download. It is a awesome and satisfying sequel to the first chapter. One thing I was disappointed about SC was that it takes place mostly in Liberl (again), and it felt repetitive to revissit the same places over again, just with replaced dialogue and cutscenes. But it didnt worry me too much, as the game does the most with what recycled resources there are. \n\nSpeaking of dialogue, this is perhaps my favorite part of the game: XSEED's awesome localization of the script. I dont know if the characters actually spoke like this in the original Japanese, but the way they speak in English is chock full of personality, quirkiness, and humor. The English version does a fantastic job of making each character's personality distinct. Just through their dialogue alone you could tell which character is which without looking at their portrait. Credit goes to both Andrew Dice and Jessica Chavez (and other people probably whose names arent mentioned), for pouring hundreds of hours translating the massive gigantic story. Trust me, this game is GIGANTIC.\n\n To go off on a short tangent here, XSEED is a small but passionate Japanese localization company that does its best to bring awesome but not very well known franchises outside Japan to overshore. Because of the low sales of the games they localize, they are financially shaky. Not to mention they are translating the Legend of Heroes series' giant amounts of dialogue with little financial benefit in the end. I can not say this enough. PLEASE support the official releases of these titles in North America or elsewhere. We want XSEED to get credit where it's due. They are a tiny company but passionate about what they do, and they deserve whatever rewards they can muster. It's because of them we get to play this gorgeous series in English, with awesome personality-filled dialogue.\n\nTrails in the Sky SC has an awesome story. Though a little on the cliche side, you will fall in love with almost every character. Gameplay allows for very personal customization options suited to your preferred playstyle for each character. It's fun immerse yourself in the world and go exploring. It's everything the traiditonal RPG purist or casual player will have fun with. Would I reccomend this game?

Ich rate dringend dazu zuerst den Vorg\u00e4nger zu spielen. Das Spiel handelt von Estelle, welche sich auf die Suche nach Joshua begiebt und dabei und dabei vielfach in Konfrontationen mit einer geheimnisvollen Organisation ger\u00e4t.\n\nWas mir gef\u00e4llt / Positiv:\n- Die St\u00e4rke des Spiels ist wie der Vorg\u00e4nger die Geschichte \u00fcber Estelle. Wie eh und je mit tollen Dialogen mit Estelle, Olivier und vielen anderen Characteren. \n- Der Soundtrack wird an manchen Stellen mit neuen Songs erweitert und gef\u00e4llt mir noch etwas besser als im Vorg\u00e4nger (mit Ausnahme des Standard-Battle-Themes).\n- Fordernde K\u00e4mpfe sowie mehr Abwechslung und Variation in Sachen K\u00e4mpfe und Ausr\u00fcstung verglichen mit First Chapter.\n- Man kann sich recht fr\u00fch am Spiel zwischen 2 Characteren als Begleiter entscheiden. Jeder hat individuelle Dialoge. Sp\u00e4ter hat man freie Wahl.\n- Epischer, mehrstufiger und kniffliger Endboss-Kampf & Endboss-Theme\n- Es gibt ein episches abschlie\u00dfendes Ende, keinen Cliffh\u00e4nger wie zuvor.\n- Gewohnt gut funktionierende PC-Fassung.\n\nWas mir weniger gef\u00e4llt / Negativ:\n- Wie im Vorg\u00e4nger kann man einige Bonusziele sehr leicht verpassen.\n- Kapitel 2 - 4 sind in Ihrem Ablauf, ohne hier n\u00e4her in die Details zu gehen,  recht vorhersehbar.\n- Gegen Ende des Prologs ist der Schwierigkeitsgrad wirklich unfair. Die Auffassung ist gewiss nicht untertrieben, vgl. \u00fcbern\u00e4chster Absatz.\n\nNeutral:\n- Die Spielwelt und Musik des Vorg\u00e4ngers wird fast vollst\u00e4ndig wiederverwertet. Das muss zwar nicht unbedingt etwas Negatives sein, aber man hat einen gewissen Teil der Spielwelt eben schon gesehen oder geh\u00f6rt.\n- Sehr lange Spielzeit von etwa 90-140 Stunden (Doppelt so lang wie der Vorg\u00e4nger), mehr Kapitel und zus\u00e4tzliche Nebenbesch\u00e4ftigungen (Fischen, Casino). Dies erkl\u00e4rt auch den h\u00f6heren Preis im Vergleich zu Teil 1.\n\nWarnung:\n- Erneut empfehle ich den Schwierigkeitsgrad Schwer muss jedoch zugleich davor warnen. Der \"Prolog\" hat einen der schwersten Endgegner der Spielgeschichte. Auf Schwer braucht man Gl\u00fcck, Tatik und Vorbereitung (am besten Komplettl\u00f6sung f\u00fcr den Prolog zu Rate ziehen). Der Rest des Spiels ist anspruchsvoller als der Vorg\u00e4nger, jedoch noch fair.\n\nFazit:\nWem den Vorg\u00e4nger gefallen hat der muss dieses Spiel einfach spielen.

Both villain and comrade alike.\n- A little bit of romance that is WELL DONE and feels REAL.\n- One of the best female protagonists in gaming.\n- A world that is truly alive. NPCs have their own unique personas, dreams, goals and lives. They frequently recieve updated dialogue, and that helps make the world a unique entity I have never experienced before in gaming.\n- Characters are deep and multi-faceted (almost as if they were real people)!\n- That old school JRPG gameplay that has aged well.\n- There is a sequel coming out in the US in 2017! I'm so excited :)!\n- Very long, so there is much to enjoy.\n- Many sidequests without any hand-holding.\n- A decent level of difficulty on normal, bordering on insanity at higher difficulties for those who love a challenge.\n\nOf course, there were a few cons as well, but I consider them minor:\n- A slow, but juicy, start.\n- Dated graphics.\n- Lack of voice acting (however, knowing modern jrpgs that fine with me)!\n\nI'd leave a little summary of the plot, but the game does it so much better than I can ever do.

Case in point: Novels like 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors and Danganronpa 2, while they're not JRPG's definitely fulfill the crazy story criteria, and I love them.\n\nEvery now and then, I enjoy indulging in some generic \"tropey\" storytelling, as long as the execution is interesting enough for me to care. This is Trails in the Sky. This is also the moment that I'm telling you to start with the first game in case you're interested, simply because First Chapter and Second Chapter are one story, the Estelle & Joshua arc. Also, in case you played the first game and you didn't liked the story, you shouldn't really bother with the second. Contrary to the fans' belief, while the story does get better it doesn't get less generic and tropey, so if those points were your turn-off for the first game they will be your turn-off for the second one too.\n\nGameplay-wise here's what you'll expect: Turn-based combat, a magic system kinda similar to how FF7 materia work (you link Quartz together to use spells and you slot them in a certain way on an Orbment - the device where you place Quartz on - to use spells you couldn't use before), no random encounters but you can see the enemy roaming and choose to approach from behind (preemptive attack) or avoid him altogether, grinding is possible but really unecessary and discouraged. The game is OK challenging in normal mode, hard as steel in Hard mode and \"you gotta be batshit insane to play this\" in Nightmare (it's what I'm currently doing). \n\nAlthough I already mentioned story elements, it's worth noting that the game is text-heavy. I mean REALLY text-heavy. Here's a [url=http://i.imgur.com/TIqUNcJ.jpg]picture[/url] to understand. Now, I'm not saying that more means that you'll like it. I'm saying that reading dialogues in JRPG games shouldn't be an issue for you.\n\nLast, but not least, the music. Fans complained that the first chapter lacked in the music department, which I have to agree given the kind of soundtrack people in Falcom are [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHtkHlLcxQ]capable[/url] of [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3VSYWmbJFg]composing[/url]. And oh they did, the absolute madmen.\n\nAll in all, a solid game if you don't mind generic stories (I don't believe that generic is inherently bad but that's just me) and turn-based combat, coupled with \"Falcom-tier\" soundtrack. I'm giving it 2 thumbs up because I got exactly what I expected and 200 hours and 2 playthroughs later I'm still enjoying it.\n\nTrails in the Sky the 3rd is scheduled to be released in the West for the first time around spring 2017.

I feel like I just ran a marathon.\n\nI had a lot of acclaim for the first game in this series. Overall it was a pretty good game, a few flaws but overall pretty good.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say the second installment is good, which is a pain because parts of this game are really good.\n\n+ The characters are still gernerally pretty great. You find yourself really wanting to root for the characters.\n\n+ Some of the villans are pretty cool.\n\n+ Oliver. Never change Oliver. For peace and love baby. You da real MVP.\n\n+ Parts of the story are amazing and reminds me why I like the first game. There are a few twists and turns and love triangles too.\n\n+ The ending is a bit of a tear jerker and sets up a sequel perfectly.\n\n+ Combat is more or less the same, so parts of it are good but...\n\n+ There is some good new content you did not see in the game before.\n\n+ Some cool cinematics that give the game some much needed depth.\n\n+ Some really interesting side quests, like the quest that reveals the backstory of Lila, Mayor Maybelle\u2019s maid.\n\nHowever when you look at the game as a whole, you can only think, what the heck where the devs thinking?\n\n- The pacing is aweful. There feels like a neverending bunch of crap between major story points.\n\n- The asset reuse for a new 60+ hour game is a bit much. I pretty much felt like I played litterly the entire first game before really getting to new content. It\u2019s very stale to have to basically go everywhere you did in the first game and tirelessly run around the world. For a game that takes place a few years in to the future nothing has changed.\n\n- Combat is just bad overall.  The combat system is just really imballanced, and the only way they seem to be able to cause a real challenge is by making your skills and abilities not work, or simply turn fights in to a grind fest. You can almost be assured that when you are in any kind of harder monster or boss fight none of you crowd control and generally things like speed down do not work. Also some bosses have bull skills like being able to kill your or phase you out of existance even if you have full guard. Also just like the first game if you accidently activate an S-Skill there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to deactive it, you have to use it.\n\n-There are times where things go way too long between being able to save.\n\n- If you thought the ending of the first game was tough, you ain\u2019t seen nothing. I\u2019m not sure who thought several hours of grinding boss fights at the end was going to be fun. If I hadn\u2019t put like 120 hours in to the two games combined I would have bailed a long time ago, and almost did.\n\n- The game is just anti fun. Rather than provide a good vehicle to tell a story instead you are stuck in a time sucking grindfest. If they had cut out like half the game, it could have been amazing.\n\nTLDR;\nI love parts of this game just like the first. It has a lot of the same flare, humor, good writing and great characters. \n\nToo much asset reuse, boring bad quests, bad pacing, and crazy design dessisons just make the game anti-fun.

The story is more focused on the couple's relationship and how they impact the people around them. Characters from the previous game return and the living world that the first game was built on continues to flourish in the second game. We return to the towns and places we visited in the first game and see their story progress. The story jumps straight into [spoiler] Estelle's awakening from Joshua's departure [/spoiler] and doesn't skip a beat. \n\nThe progression of quests and combat remain the same.  There are the hunting contracts, collecting items, fishing and solving disputes in towns. The customization of the orbments from the previous game has been changed slightly with the introduction of a next tier of upgrades. There are more spells and different combinations to explore. If you were not a fan of the game's backtracking, it does return. \n\nThe music's OST does return with some new tracks and still impresses me. When the music picks up when your team is in critical danger, it means it is go time! And after a long trek of battling monsters in caves, returning to a town with it's nostalgia soundtrack really brings it home.\n\nTitS SC completes Estelle's and Joshua's story.

If you haven't played the first, go find that one. It's excellent. You'll need the pair, btw. \n\nAs for SC, it's an overall improvement and a great closer of the story (as it is the second half). \n\nThe whole game system of the previous game is similar, but many improvements were made to the combat and a few expansions. Combat was made a bit faster due to shorter animations and enter/exits, some complexity was added here and there. One major improvement I loved was a lot of equipment has downsides so you have to debate over certain pieces for certain builds. Not just constant upgrades like the last game. The whole orb mechanic was overhauled and feels much better. \n\n(SPOILER FREE) Story, for the most part, is very fulfilling and ties up well as a large part of the overall LoH larger series. If you enjoyed the First Chapter, you won't be dissapointed. Still a bit slow and sluggish in some areas (especially if you're going for all the side-quests and chests and such), but doesn't get too dull and pays off in the end. \n\nOverall, the duo is an amazing set of JRPG games. Just amazing. If the combat (for the time) wasn't a bit dull and the story was a bit quicker, I wouldn't think for a second this wouldn't be considered a masterpiece of the RPG genre. As for now, it's close. Really close. \n\nSide note: There's a small bug to watch out for if you're using a gamepad. Some menus in the final chapter couldn't be used with a gamepad, and it took me forever to find out via Steam forums that the mouse can be used to click on menu items when this happens. Duh, right? Stupid me. If this happens, remember the mouse!\n\nSecond side note: I had quite a few problems running the previous chapter, nothing game-breaking, but a few jolts. Many of those problems don't exist in the SC. I still get frame-stuttering in certain areas, but not as bad. Outside of that there's the final chapter menu/mouse problem. That's all.

The 2nd entry didn't disappoint!  This entry is really a coming of age story for Estelle and Co. as we follow there stories to becoming elite Bracers.  Each character is developed whole in the sequel opposed to just focusing on Estelle.  I really enjoyed this and feel like it made the Universe that much richer.  The down side to this was I felt it tripped up the pacing a bit as I feel like the 1st one flowed a bit better and didn't care much for the new character Father Kevin.  He's not bad per se but didn't really add anything of real value to the crew IMO but it looks like we'll learn more about him in the 3rd entry!\n\nIf you enjoyed the 1st one I think you'll really enjoy this game as well.  As they both stand on their own feet and add value while both having great stories.  If you plan on playing this game and haven't played the 1st... I'd advise going back and playing the 1st entry before this.

FC made me want to keep going the whole way through, while SC you see the old dungeons revisited and repurposed.

But still the story in SC takes a long time to really pick up steam. \n\nAt about half way into SC I wanted to just finish.

Despu\u00e9s de que nos quedara el alma en un hilo por c\u00f3mo termin\u00f3 la primera parte, ahora Estelle inicia su viaje ella sola. Luego van apareciendo los personajes entra\u00f1ables de la primera parte, y algunos nuevos. La sociedad Ouroboros es realmente malefica y es un enemigo formidable contra la party que formes, requiere muchisima estrategia y pensar muy bien c\u00f3mo los vas a enfrentar. La m\u00fasica cumple, aunque para mi gusto le agregaron algunas melodias que son realmente sobresalientes. El sistema de juego lo mejoraron un poco con el sistema de Chain Combos. Se puede invertir muchisimas horas de juego no solo en la historia principal, sino tambi\u00e9n en las side quests, hidden quests, cocinando, jugando al poker, jugando a la ruleta, pescando, etc. Todo es muy divertido.\n\nTambi\u00e9n el estilo visual, no es nada del otro mundo, isometrico con sprites y algunas cosas en 3D, le da un adorable toque estilo 16 bits muy bonito para mi gusto.\n\nLos personajes, aqui quiero detenerme un poco. Son entra\u00f1ables todos, pero es en esta segunda parte donde todos tienen un desarrollo \u00fanico. Las historias individuales de cada uno de ellos son realmente notables. Desde las dudas, miedos e incertidumbres de Kloe Rinz en decidirse si ser o no la princesa heredera, para luego tomar una desici\u00f3n muy valiente y convertirse en un personaje importantisimo de la trama, por otro lado tambien el pasado triste de Scherazard, la ni\u00f1ez que tuvo y como sufri\u00f3 la desiluci\u00f3n de verse enfrentada a una amiga de la infancia. La historia detr\u00e1s del tri\u00e1ngulo entre Zane, Kilika y Walter es realmente conmovedora. Y el sufrimiento que ha estado ocultando Agate desde las pasadas Guerras contra Erebonia, y c\u00f3mo Tita descubre el lado humano del salvaje Agate, tambien es para que se caigan las lagrimas. Y por supuesto, como evoluciona Estelle a lo largo de su busqueda por Joshua... y adem\u00e1s, la historia que se revela respecto de Joshua y su relaci\u00f3n con Leonhardt y todo lo que ocurrio en la aldea de Hamel, es para que dar WTF!!!!\n\nAdem\u00e1s la historia tiene ribetes politicos, vientos de guerra con otros paises, golpes de estado, etc. Todo se corona con un lindo final para los protagonistas, los malvados tienen el final que se merecian, todo parece concluir ahi.... pero he aqui que aparece el misterioso Padre Kevin Graham, revelandose una faceta desconocida durante todo el juego sino hasta el final.... y deja la mesa servida para la tercera parte.\n\nGrandioso juego, me encanto!!", "timestamp_created": 1467070939, "timestamp_updated": 1467070939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511600", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23863510": {"recommendationid": "23863510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090805958", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467033665}, "language": "english", "review": "So before I actually give my opinion on this game, it took me over 120 hours to beat it (and I was playing it on only hard difficulty - also my first try) with almost over 200 save datas of trying hard not to mess up and experiencing mostly failure throughout my time playing the game I finally beaten it!

It's basically a continuation but you see more of what's going on and you meet some new and interesting characters, Then beat the hell out of them.\n\nThe environment is the same. Some might find this predictable but it makes sense.\n\nThe mechanics are much the same with a few additions. Again, slightly predictable but this matters if you play it on harder difficultiies. Knowing what's what will help. Having said that it's not all good.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nIt's so hard it's not funny. Later on in particular you need to arrive at the boss fights in good shape or you may as well not bother. This can be harder than it sounds.\n\nThere's a fair number of maze/wayfinding puzzle type missions. I'm not a fan. You might be. There's enough of them that I found it unimaginative/lazy. One in particular made no sense at all. \n\nThe gear and purchase options are just more of the same. Nothing really stands out or gives you a noticeable edge. The addition of food as a combat item is so you can survive rather than prosper. This is fine if you've got what you need. If you can't find or buy ingredient x it's just another frustration as you've then got to ID the monster and head back to wherever it is. Again, if you're not in good shape for whatever reason this can be a chore.\n\n\nOverall I can't recommend this game. The effort vs. reward just doesn't stack up. Sure it's a decent story but you just don't feel any sense of progression as you work through it. The next wandering monster can maul you just as much if not more than the first. You know for certain that the next boss will have the upper hand and there's nothing you can do to counter it that makes much if any difference. In short, It's a slog and I want more than that from a game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1465231303, "timestamp_updated": 1465231303, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.358386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23376049": {"recommendationid": "23376049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047657974", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496074889}, "language": "german", "review": "Das Spiel ist ein riesiges Recycling von Karten, Monstern, Skills und allem was sonst noch anf\u00e4llt.\nDas einzige was wirklich neu ist, sind die Dialoge.\n\nDie sind soweit gut, wenn auch teils ewig geschw\u00e4tzig ohne gro\u00dfen Inhalt.

I was full of praise as to how this game differs from any other JRPG I had played prior to the games in the Legend of Heroes series. As result, I purchased Trails in the Sky Second Chapter (SC) almost immediately after it was released on steam. In terms of gameplay and the overall mechanics in SC, they remain largely identical to FC and therefore there is no need to dwell on them in this review. I recognise that this review probably will not mean much to those who loved FC as it is likely they have already bought and finished SC. Likewise if you did not like FC, then I would be surprised if you are considering buying SC. \nI can confidently say right off the bat that FC and SC together are among the best games I have ever played, with SC expanding on the greatness that was FC.\nThe consequence of playing and adoring FC is that I had extremely high expectations going into SC. Whilst those expectations were entirely met, this time around my review cannot be so clear cut as it was for FC. In order to review this game fairly and without bias, I intend to mention a noticeable flaw I identified because it would be ignorant to ignore it.\n\n*No spoilers* \n\n[h1] Story [/h1] \nThe story in SC is definitely a step up from FC, with enough plot twists to make you run around the room in excitement... I know I did. Every main character is developed from the first game in a meaningful way. Even Estelle develops from a largely clumsy, hilarious and enthusiastic person to a more mature... clumsy, hilarious and enthusiastic person.  \n\nLike FC, the story is split into a series of well-structured chapters, however in SC the game is separated into 9 different chapters rather than the 4 main chapters in FC. As expected the story neatly follows from FC. My main criticism of the game is based on the first 4 chapters. The problem with these chapters is that by chapter 2, the story gets largely predictable with the similar kind of occurrence happening in each chapter (I'll spare the details). Of course the predictability ends soon after the 4th chapter. This may not necessarily be a problem for many who have played SC, but it did get a tad repetitive, especially in conjunction with the side quests which do not vary that much. However, this is largely where my noticeable criticisms end and I appreciate this is largely a subjective criticism. \n\nTo this day, the 5th and 6th chapters of SC were... Some of the best segments of a game I have played in my entire life... And I have played a lot of games! \nAlthough I will not describe the contents of those chapters, they were the most deeply engaging, emotional and thrilling parts of a game I have ever played, galvanizing anyone into adoring the game. I wish I could describe the details.\nThe ending of the game is satisfying. That is my greatest hope for any sequel of a JRPG. It is far too easy for games to conclude having left more questions than answers. Although there is a cliff-hanger which sets up the Third Chapter (TC), it is not the kind of cliff-hanger which leaves a lack of fulfilment and a taste of disappointment. As I mentioned to a friend, I would not mind if the Third Chapter is never localized... That\u2019s not to say that when it is finished being localized I won't play it. I will buy it on the day it is released! Hell I will stay up all night with a countdown clock till its release! Nevertheless, what I am concluding is that the Second Chapter had a satisfying ending; it felt like the hours I had put into the game actually meant something significant in the end, rather than leaving a lingering anticipation for what happens next. \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThere is very little which can be said about gameplay other than it is almost identical to the First Chapter. In my review of FC, I mentioned the way in which gameplay differs from other JRPG's I am familiar with such as games in the Final Fantasy franchise. This difference remains the same in SC. The main new mechanic in SC is the ability to combine attacks with different characters (Chain attacks). They were a nice new addition to the game, but nothing revolutionary. If you loved the gameplay and the battle system in FC, then it follows that you should feel the same about SC. \n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nThe first thing I wanted to know when I bought the game is how the music would differ from FC. I have invested hours into listening to the music of FC outside of the game and I will probably spend many hours more listening to FC's OST. I can gladly say, the soundtrack in SC is a masterpiece - my favourites being: 'The Dream Continues,' 'Silver Will' and 'I Swear.' I do not recommend listening to any of the soundtrack before playing the game, solely because of the emotional effect they have within the game. None of the pieces are overused or underused. The first thing I did after finishing the game was search for the pieces on YouTube. \n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nFC and SC felt like a dream. I say this as the two games felt like perfect games with very few flaws. Although I stated my noticeable criticism of SC, it is insignificant when looking at the overall standard of the game. The characters remain as funny as they were in FC, the story is brilliant, the music is sensational and the localization is without flaws. Only Aidios knows why this game is not as popular as it should be. I have always felt that it is the most well-made games which receive the least credit. I am now in the process of playing Trails of Cold Steel.

That being said, I don't regret a single hour of this beautiful sequel.\n\nAlthough the gameplay hasn't significantly changed much from the original, the magic (orbment) and skills (crafts) system has been expanded upon tremendously. The original three pages of magic has been expanded to five; introducing newer strategies to the abundant amount of character choices. The new skill, chains, finds itself to be useful in some scenarios. These additions made the gameplay always refreshing, seeing that I've played more than 100 hours fighting shiny pom poms.\n\nThe team system has significantly improved since the first chapter. This shouldn't be a surprise since the entire game revolves around changing teammates and parties, but first let me explain the difference. (Minor Spoilers) In the original game, two characters (Joshua and Estelle) would always be playable characters while each chapter offers two other characters that make up the rest of your party. Each chapter changed the party and thus your team strategy. The game struck a nice balance of difficulty and adaptation except for the last chapter. The chapter which allowed you to make your own team with all the characters you've met along the way wasn't very balanced. The enemy encounters grew extremely repetitive and boring, and [spoiler]the final boss could be described in the same manner.[/spoiler]\n\nHowever, the second chapter struck a good balance while letting the player create a team themselves. Although the first chapter was pretty repetitive since your options were limited, I found difficult monsters and interesting monster attacks that kept the combat intriguing. In general, bosses were more interesting and carried a 'mood' about them. Again (minor spoilers), but the last chapter's boss fights were beyond amazing. By far the bosses and 'road monsters' are the best thing about Trails in the Sky SC's gameplay.\n\nNow a small paragraph about the OST. I read on a forum somewhere that the OST for SC was supposed to better than FC. For the majority of the game, I questioned this opinion since it reused alot of songs from the first game. But all of a sudden near the end of the game, the soundtrack dramatically improved with new songs. The credits song gave me chills. Good job music writers, although I'd appreciate if the same songs weren't used every single time in the first few chapters.\n\nRetrospectively, I should've talked about the graphics/textures of the game in the first paragraph. If you've gotten used to the graphics in Trails in the Sky FC, then this game should be no problem. Although walking through the same landscape as Trails in the Sky FC is a bit boring, some of the new landscapes introduced are beautiful and well worth it.\n\nStory and characters. Amazing. Marvelous. Hella GOOD JOB Nihon Falcom. Pretty much every character gets their back stories introduced and expanded upon. Some scenes are so fantastic that they definitely should've made a scene select option in the menu. The hidden nature of the Society and some of the plot twists make the game so much more interesting and hooks you back in the next day even after you've spent one entire day playing the game. Afterall, story and character development feels like such a lovely reward after defeating bosses with a sliver of health remaining. By far, Estelle's character development was done beautifully well. My only complaint is that you have to switch around characters in your party to obtain extra dialogue which sometimes can't be done without grinding character levels (looking at you, last area last chapter). Otherwise, the story is great if you enjoy anime stories with a touch of the shounen genre.\n\nHonestly if you enjoyed Trails in the Sky FC, then this game is a must buy. As anyone does, I EXTREMELY HIGHLY recommend playing through the first game first. This game assumes you've already played through FC, so there are many spoilers and the difficulty curve is quite steep in the beginning. If you haven't tried either, I'd recommend buying the FC on sale and testing the waters before you delve deep into this trilogy.\n\nI'm writing this review as I just finished this game and it feels great. However, I can see in the future I'll be impatient and sad waiting for the third chapter.

A lot of people do that ...\"\nBevor ich hier erkl\u00e4ren m\u00f6chte, wieso ich dieses Spiel f\u00fcr eines der besten Spiele aller Zeiten halte (Zusammen mit First Chapter), m\u00f6chte ich hier auf Spoiler hinweisen. Mit 40 - 60 Stunden Spielzeit und einer Menge an Storytwists und Charakteretablierung, ist es f\u00fcr mich leider unvermeidlich. \nZuallererst: Wer First Chapter bereits nicht mochte, wird auch dieses Spiel hier nicht m\u00f6gen. Im Grunde sind beide Spiele eine Geschichte im ziemlich fiesen Cliffhanger. Jeder, der First Chapter gespielt hat, sollte ich allerdings auch den zweiten Teil zulegen.\n\nZuerst m\u00f6chte ich klarstellen, das es genau die gleichen Positivpunkte wie Chapter 1 enth\u00e4lt, obwohl beide Stories relativ verschieden aufgebaut sind. W\u00e4hrend First Chapter noch damit bem\u00fcht war, die Charaktere und die Welt, in der sie sich befinden, zu etablieren, sind wir hier schon etwas weiter. Im Gegensatz zum ersten Teil ist die Story hier mehr Plotgetrieben. Das ist nichts schlechtes, nur eben anders. \n\nDie Grafik und Welt sind gro\u00dfteils noch immer diesselben wie im ersten Teil, allerdings mit kleinen Verbesserungen und Anpassungen. Man kommt nochmals dazu, alle in First Chapter bekannten Gebiete und Orte zu besuchen. Die Kapitel 1-6 sind ziemlich \u00e4hnlich, und auch das Pacing ist \u00e4hnlich (langsam). Hat mich jetzt nicht besonders gest\u00f6rt, einigen Leuten k\u00f6nnte das aber langweilig werden. In diesen Kapiteln wird auch langsam die Antagonisten-Organisation, ihre Werte und Motive, vorgestellt. Die Protagonisten sind (mit einer Ausnahme) noch immer dieselben wie im ersten Teil. Im Verlauf der oben bereits erw\u00e4hnten, ersten 5 Kapitel wird immer ein Antagonist vorgestellt, welcher als direkter Rivale f\u00fcr einen der Protagonisten zu sehen ist. In der Welt kann man sich noch immer verlieren, Landschaften und St\u00e4dte sind f\u00fcr ein PSP-Spiel einfach wundersch\u00f6n und glaubw\u00fcrdig gestaltet.\n\nDas allerwichtigste ist nat\u00fcrlich nicht die Story (wer h\u00e4tte damit gerechnet), sondern die Interaktion der Charaktere miteinander und der f\u00fcr sie aufgesetzten Welt. Toll ist, wie es das Spiel schafft, \u00fcber einen Zeitraum von knapp 100 Stunden (Erster und Zweiter Teil) jeden Charakter Tiefe zu verleihen. Jede noch so kleine Nebenperson bekommt ihre Zeit, ihren Antrieb zu ihren Taten, Vorlieben und Interessen zu zeigen und sich selbst weiterzuentwickeln. Man hat einfach das Gef\u00fchl, es nicht mit blo\u00dfen Anime-Stereotypen, sondern mit echten Menschen zu tun zu haben, die verletzlich sind, eigene Gef\u00fchle und Interessen haben, und auch ihre eigene H\u00fcrden im Verlauf der Geschichte \u00fcberkommen zu haben. Sie treffen eigene Entscheidungen, und jede Entscheidung hilft mehr und mehr, den Charakter zu verstehen. Einfach toll gemacht!\n\nSoundtechnisch hat sich nicht viel ver\u00e4ndert. Es gibt einige aus dem ersten Teil bekannte Tracks, aber auch neue, auch gibt es eigene Themen f\u00fcr die jeweiligen Antagonisten. Vorallem die Kampf-Musik bleibt im Ohr und l\u00e4sst sich auch super au\u00dferhalb des Spiels h\u00f6ren. \n\nUmfang: Das Spiel ist gigantisch. Als erstes PSP-Spiel, welches zwei UMDs ben\u00f6tigte, da auf einer einfach zu wenig Platz war, und mehr Text besitzt als ein Herr-der-Ringe Buch, kann ich nur sagen: Falcom, Hut ab! Vorallem, da das Spiel in gerademal zwei Jahren entstand.\n\nAbschlie\u00dfend m\u00f6chte ich sagen, wer bereits First Chapter gro\u00dfartig fand, hat gewisserma\u00dfen eine Obligation, auch den zweiten Teil zu spielen, da er  nicht nur die Hauptarc  um Estelle und Joshua zu einer sehr sch\u00f6nen Konklusion bringt, sondern auch den weniger wichtigen Charakteren Tiefe und Zeit gibt, sich zu entwickeln.

You will be hopelessly lost without prior knowledge of characters and locations from the first game, and wiki summaries are simply not enough to bridge the gap.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky Second Chapter (or Eiyuu Densetsu: Sora no Kiseki SC in weebspeak) is quite simply one of the best games I've ever been sucked into. It's not perfect, but it comes close in pretty much every area.\n\nThe gameplay is as refreshing as ever; the battles are still on a tactical grid, where you and your enemies take turns to attack each other (and depending on how fast you are, you can potentially take multiple turns before your opponent even moves your way). However, there were several features added to the Trails in the Sky battle system. \n[list]\n[*]The addition of combo crafts, where you and your whole party can gang up and wreak havoc on enemies is a fun feature, though outclassed towards the end of the game. \n[*]New spells are also available for use; if you detested Lt. Lorence spamming Silver Thorn on your ass, you can now do the same to those annoying monsters blocking your path, among other great spells.\n[/list]\nThe overworld has a few minigames to help melt the time away, such as a casino and fishing. Fishing's especially something to note, since there's an achievement tied to it, if that's your thing.\nAdditionally, XSEED's even taken some PSP-exclusive content and backported it to the PC version. One of those features won't be seen until the end of the game, but it's worth the wait.\n\nHowever, the overall story lacks a bit, especially when compared to FC's gradual but well-tempered buildup. Excluding the Prologue, every chapter from Chapter 1 up to and including Chapter 5 is rather formulaic in nature; strange happenings in a province lead to Estelle and friends investigating them, only to find out that an Ouroboros Enforcer is behind it all. \nThe game picks up pace during Chapters 6 and 7, but leaves you at a pretty bad drop during Chapter 8 (which I can honestly say was my least favorite chapter in all the Trails games I've played, gameplay-wise). The Final Chapter more than makes up for the tedium of Chapter 8, however, and wraps up Estelle and Joshua's story very cleanly.\n\nSpeaking of which, the characters and dialogue in SC are top notch; while the plot may be  predictable at times, the characters more than make up for the lacking moments. \nParty members receive actual character development, and characters you may have despised in FC have a chance at redemption; Agate comes to mind easily. \nAdditionally, new characters enter the fray, and they're just as good as the established characters; Kevin Graham, for one, is absolutely phenomenal in all the right ways.\nAgain, the dialogue flows naturally, and outside of one very, very small encounter in Zeiss, I couldn't help but eagerly read every line of dialogue that popped up. Even NPCs are relatively lively, which you might not expect from JRPGs; I've seen others where town NPCs get a single flavor line at best.\n\nLastly, the quality of the game is just perfect; I haven't encountered any technical issues at all, despite the somewhat troubled localization process.

I can no longer recommend this game. The more I think about it, the more frustrated it makes me. It's the biggest let-down I have experienced in gaming, because the first game was SO awesome, such an amazing JRPG that anyone even remotely into the genre should play. This game, despite being a direct sequel, despite working off of the same system, is not. I will give 2 basic reasons.\n\n1) The game is frustrating. They wanted to continue this game off of the old one, they didn't want to invent an all new system or start you off at level 1 from scratch. Okay. But their attempt to \"extend\" everything, the leveling, the magic, your equipment, resulted in imbalance. It's too easy now to have an entire party dropping nukes on the battlefield. So their solution to this problem was frustration; simply make it hard to obtain money, magic \"orbments\", equipment, and constantly force-change your party with new characters who have different elemental restrictions, forcing different play styles (and sometimes, everything that was on the character you lost goes with them, if you didn't know to unequip them ahead of time). This game really requires multiple saves, in case they stick you with someone you have few options for and can hardly use. Fights themselves are now against bullet sponges who spam status effects, have random immunities, and heal themselves. Sometimes it's fun, but more often it just feels annoying, especially if, again, you \"messed up\" by not already having alot of a certain element so you could exploit weaknesses, even though you had no way of knowing that's what you needed. And good luck getting more, it takes HOURS. \n\n2) While I still like the characters, the banter, the moral dilemmas, the actual story is TERRIBLE. It's like The Empire Strikes Back, but if you had to watch Luke Skywalker getting completely owned by Vader over and over at the end of every act. Your enemy is, I don't know, Cobra, or Hydra, but not incompetent. Global reach, endless mooks, the most advanced technology, infinite money, full-scale mass production capabilities, unparalleled scientific and historical knowledge, all led by demi-gods, every one of which is able to backhand you into a coma without a thought. Why? I have no idea. Why does the second-in-command of this group have mind-control powers? I don't know. No one even asks. It's just accepted as perfectly fine to introduce a character with comic book powers with no origin story, no known limitations, he just can. It's laughable. There's no tension here; you CAN'T win. Just, lose, lose, lose. Every act is the same; something happens, you track down one of these humans of mythical power, you barely survive a fight and then they leave you alive out of pity. You stop nothing, you accomplish nothing, they could have simply removed most of the boss fights because they are a waste of time. \n\nA JRPG is really a combination of a few factors, mostly story and combat, and both fail. While I like many secondary aspects, like the world and characters (although alot of that we already know and is not as engaging the second time around), the important parts are just bad. The game is frustrating, it screws you over, it makes even scrub fights longer and more expensive than they have any need to be, and there is never any pay off for any of it, you're always losing. the equipment system, which was fun and mostly balanced before, is now horribly skewed in one direction and it really feels like tying a weight to your leg when the game gives you one of the other characters who can't exploit that imbalance. Finally, I didn't finish the game; the main story right before you reach the point of no return requires you to deliberately gimp yourself. I did so, only afterwards realizing that this was also the last chance to do about 50 sidequests, which I physically could not do now that I had weakened myself. I had no way of knowing this, and now I had no way of doing any of this optional content. I rage-quit. Maybe the last 3 hours of the story are awesome, but I really, really doubt it.

Trails in the Sky FC was pretty much the appetizer of the trilogy, but here is the real meat of the story. The game starts right after that heartbreaking cliffhanger from the first game, so obviously it's absolutely required you play FC before SC, otherwise nothing will make sense to you.\n\nI think Trails in the Sky SC's biggest strength is definitely the writing. It's a surprisingly well thoughtout world, richly developed and lovable cast of characters, and memorable story that will reward you with a satisfying JRPG experience. I would even go as far as saying it's better than any of the Final Fantasy or Tales of franchise I played. Although the characters are pretty much your standard anime or Japanese game character archetypes, each one is fleshed out and executed well. The interactions between characters are gold, especially anything involving Estelle and Oliver since they add comedic value. While I can't say much about SC's storyline due to avoiding spoilers, if you thought FC's story was great, well you're in for one hell of a ride. FC took me around 20 hours to beat, SC took me 60 hours. Just let that sink in. Yes, the story has a few extra layers added but it's not overly complicated as long as you pay attention.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as FC but with some improvements to the turn based battle system. I really liked the addition of chained special attacks which let's you use multiple characters attack at once. More artes have been added and crafts upgraded for stronger effects. Other than that, just expect FC's gameplay.\n\nI would describe the visual to be modernized retro style graphics you see in playstation rpg games, except a lot sharper. You can tell the production values just by looking at it and the presentation. Let's not forget the wonderful soundtrack. It adds a perfect level of immersiveness invoking a spectrum of emotions on certain scenes of events.\n\nLastly, I really have to give props to XSEED for their amazing efforts in localizing SC. They released the game not out of business/profit priority, but labor of love. And double props to them for announcing the final game of the trilogy that's currently in the works. While SC can be seen as the finale story, there are some loose ends that will be resolved in the 3rd chapter (I hope). So once the 3rd chapter is up for pre-order, I'll immediately snatch that up paying full price showing my support just like how I did with FC and SC. Thank you XSEED for letting me experience such a magnificent game. \n\nNormally, I don't replay JRPGs as much, but this is worth going through the 2nd time.

Cry as long as you want.\nAnd I'll... just hold you like this.[/i]\n\nFans of the original Trails in the Sky have long awaited this almost ill-fated sequel, not only is the painfully long wait over, but it is exactly what we all wanted to see and more. Trails SC continues the story of the first game and far exceeds expectations in terms of story.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially identical to the first game with the addition of Chain Crafts, which allow multiple characters to attack in the same turn at the expense of some of their CP, and a new Orbment system which balances the magic system a bit and allows for more and better magic. The new Orbment system requires slots to be upgraded after unlocked in order to use more powerful Quartz, some of this better Quartz is either improvements of older ones, combination of two effects or brand new ones. The Orbment menu is now thankfully color-coded to know which line you're putting Quartz in and aids to better visualize the Sephith sums of each line. Other than that the game also adds a fishing minigame and some gambling minigames at the casino in Ruan for your leisure. The Bracer Guild quests are back and the game still follows the same chapter structure but allows you to edit your party as long as the plot dictates that they can be in your party. The battles have improved slightly with shorter attack animations, improved Crafts, new S-Crafts and encounters that force you to devise new strategies.\n\nGraphically the game is exactly the same as its predecessor. HD assets and almost every PSP exclusive feature are available from the beginning. In the sound department we have new songs in combination with older ones that add up to a really expansive soundtrack. The new music exclusive to SC is fantastic and probably far better than its predecessor, with more rocking tunes and even the relaxing new ones have a better feel more suited to the current plotline and a final boss theme that might as well be one of the best in the series.\nUnfortunately, updating a 2006 game to new standards has also included a slew of bugs. While there are workarounds for every bug I\u2019ve managed to get stuck in some places and in the worst case I accidentally did a sequence break and skipped a major boss fight altogether. The translation also feels spotty at times but with the huge amount of text there is I\u2019m willing to let it pass. Treasure chest jokes are unfortunately missing for the most part.\n\nJust like its predecessor, the plot takes the spotlight in this game and I\u2019d even say outright steals the entire show. Right from the beginning stakes are higher as the story continues right after where FC left off, we join Estelle as she looks for Joshua and tries to become a stronger and better Bracer while getting an insight on the mysterious group \u201cOuroboros\u201d. Even though the pace remains rather slow, in every chapter our heroes face bigger threats compared to those of the first game and a lot of conflicts that were subtly hinted in the first game unfold. Even the sidequests are a step-up since they no longer involve such menial tasks since now the world is in danger and quite a few involve subplots essential to the world-building of the game. Trails SC is a lengthier affair than the first game, clocking at around 40-60 hours in an average play, with a New Game+ available and various difficulty modes if you ever want to replay it.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a lot to say about Trails SC that hasn\u2019t been said in reviews of the previous game other than \u201cit\u2019s bigger and better\u201d. If you enjoyed the first game then SC is a must play, if you didn\u2019t then you probably are missing out on a truly exceptional traditional RPG, one that took a long time to arrive and is worth every second and penny invested into it.", "timestamp_created": 1460052955, "timestamp_updated": 1460053018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22229025": {"recommendationid": "22229025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080292414", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 13036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493865609}, "language": "english", "review": "Too much Olivier\n\nDon't send help, I prefer it this way.\n\n69/10 would lute again.", "timestamp_created": 1459731552, "timestamp_updated": 1459731552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22226120": {"recommendationid": "22226120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122357055", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457148305}, "language": "english", "review": "Thoroughly enjoyed this game, particularly as a follow-up to Trails FC.

I found myself being engrossed in the problems the characters faced as I traveled around the kingdom of Liberl. If you are a fan of JRPGs consider going back and buying the first game( this one won't make sense unless you played the first), but if you are not a JRPG fan you might want to go elsewhere to get your feet wet first. Check out the several old Final Fantasy games first, or the recently Steam re-release of Disgaea( I want that at some point)   \n\nThat being said both games have a slow first 1/3,  the 2nd 1/3 builds up, and both the first and second game's last 1/3 had me on the edge of my seat.  The first game involves a sister and (adapted...) brother, Estelle and Josha, traveling around the kingdom and doing odd jobs in the various regions, but as you progress it becomes clear a sinster conspiricy is afoot that threatens the kingdom of Librel( this becomes why the final 1/3 had me on the edge of my seat).  The second game picks up after the first and it becomes clearer why the Society mentioned in the game description did what they did in the first game. I can understand the slow first 1/3 to an extent since we get to invest in the characters and meet people around the kingdom giving us a sense of investment when the games' climaxes occur.\n\nIn general making something longer doesn't make it better, and I feel like there just isn't enough art assets to cover both the 1st and 2nd game and keep it fresh throughout.  Even though the designers clearly tried to rearange the buildings in various towns and such I can't shake the nagging feeling that despite it LOOKING different, the envirnments just don't FEEL different.  Could just be me though.  Ah yeah,  dungeons don't give you an overhead map so it makes navigating them frustraiting if they are in a forest or underground cave due to their irregular layout so do not rotate the camera while in those dungeons.  It helps keep your bearings.\n\nCombat I feel misses a few marks. Granted at the same time of playing through Trails in the Sky SC I am also playing XCOM 2 so that may be coloring my expectaitions of a turn based combat system. It is a standard square based grid you move around. You can attack, special attack or do orbal arts( ie magic).  The game makes a big deal about building your magic circuit up with various kinds of gems in order to get the best stat upgrades and by experimenting withlinking the correct gems together to unlock new magic spell.  Unfortunitly the game also makes them somewhat expensive, so I feel like the game isn't giving me the room to experiment.  I found the characters special attacks and basic attacks more effective most of the time since magic requires a turn to charge up.  Granted I was playing the 2nd game on easy so that made the combat a bit dull, mainly becasue normal diffculty on the first game had a difficulty curve that was flat for the first 1/2 then spiked during boss fights, which was just frustraiting.  So in the end I felt combat could have used a once over in the development of the game, and a more consistently rising difficulty curve so I don't instictly pick easy.  One last thing, prioritize upgrading Estelle and Joshua since the other characters come in and out of use depending on the needs of the plot.\n\nWhich leads me to the plot, while engaging, does interfere with the game progression on occasion. Why should I spend resources to upgrade these other characters if they won't be around to help in a fight?  Also the frequent traveling to and around the various hub towns is begging for some kind of fast travel option to warp back to the nearest town to complete a quest. This could probably have cut a lot of unecesary faffing about, and ultimatly removed less interesting game time with minimal cost to the overall experience.\n\nLast but not least the soundtrack of the first game is decent, and the second game is excellent.  Every track works well in the situations they are played and as I'm updating this review I am listening to the 2nd game's OST \n\nSo in the end the 2 Trails in the Sky games are worth your time if you want a somewhat classic JRPG with a solid story  and characters.  The gameplay, while flawed,  never gets near ragequit territory.", "timestamp_created": 1457404141, "timestamp_updated": 1457418896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534485", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21670895": {"recommendationid": "21670895", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995581863", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457286517}, "language": "english", "review": "Jrpg saga!", "timestamp_created": 1457288708, "timestamp_updated": 1457288708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21664710": {"recommendationid": "21664710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063512996", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459081457}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so good omg, especially if you like games with lots of character building.

This is a amazing direct continuation of the prior game, together they make a pair.\n\nOthers have already hit on what makes this game so great. If you're looking for a short version, I'm going to  write mine below:\n\n* Everything about the prequel is about twice as good here. Liked the first? You'll love the second. There's twice as much content here (literally, my play time is just about double) and I still missed quite a bit (~10 hours worth). The price tag is worth it -- between the two games you get about ~140 hours of game. This is fully scripted, text rich, game-play. How many games will give you an epic game of this length for $50 USD total? Even at full price, buy this. It's a no brainer.\n\n* The character development is absolutely outstanding and should not be underplayed. Since this is a LONG game, it's not unreasonable to say you become attached to the cast of characters and many of them are on their way back in this game. Of course, there a few noteworthy additions.\n\n* The amount of depth that goes into what you have done in Liberl and how it makes subtle changes is a joy. Sure, we have games like Skyrim where micro-changes in the world state causes all sorts of different behavior. However, Trails takes this one step further and gives each character unique reactions to situations and the ability to further expression their personality during events. For example, during key battle events each character may have their own commentary they provide based on their history or what had happened tens of hours ago.\n\n* This point is debatable -- the battle system is dated but I think it is still a joy to play, just not on normal for RPG veterans. Hard-mode is too top heavy, that is more difficult towards the beginning. For most players, I would suggest hard mode but you have to have patience to get past the first ten or so hours... and that is disappointing. Luckily, this is a sequel so you'd be consider buying this if you fell in love with the first.\n\nThat being said, play Hard or Nightmare, Normal is too simple. However, that ALSO being said, this game can absolutely stand on its own without the battle system... so play on Normal if you just want the cinematic feel, I guess!\n", "timestamp_created": 1455590614, "timestamp_updated": 1455590614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21187426": {"recommendationid": "21187426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105510856", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 4148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494356865}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished the game.

But, the lore of the game and everything happening around the protagonist(s) are overwhelming. I personally think you can write a whole novels series based on this one game alone.\nThe plot of Trails is one of the best in its genre. The battle system is unique and fun. The soundtracks are somewhat nostalgic, I don't know why. The NPC's have their own relations to each and every other character in the game. Yes, EVERY NPC.\n\nEven after beating the game, I am still curious about the rest of the plot around the game, hoping XSEED will quickly release the translated Trails in the Sky TC.\n\nIf you are an avid player of JRPG's, I definitely recommend Trails in the Sky FC and SC.

Throughout ALL the game on hard difficulty, physical attacks deal extremely low (very often: 0) damage to enemies, especially bosses. Some enemies are immune to arts forcing you to have to use physical attacks even though there is next to no point to level up a physical attacker.\n\n- Bosses are long and tedious, once you survive the first 10-20 actions, you've pretty much won, but you have to spend a 100 more turns repeating the same moves over and over and over again.\n\n- When starting the game, loading my save file from first chapter REDUCED my level just because I did not overlevel my characters in the first chapter.\n\n- On high difficulties, boss battles were you have to protect npcs are ridiculous. In the final chapter, there is a boss fight where you have 5 enemies attack before you can cast a heal or a shield.

Expect to drop at least 200 hours on the current trio of games if you are as into the series as I am.\n\nHowever, there are currently 8 games with a ninth on the way, and only 3 of them are translated. With how long it has taken them to.. (The first game was Translated/released in the uS 2011..), expect to wait quite some time before finishing them all.\n\nStory: 10/10 \n \nSimple, yet deep customization makes this game enjoyable by all types. You can autopilot through on an easier difficulty by mashing attack and default arts.. or take the game to the next level with complex orbment setups.  Plus, turn based JRPG? Who said there isn't a market for them anymore..\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nThe difficulty is the games largest shortcoming in my opinion. Playing Trails SC on anything other than Normal during a new game is very...very hard. They'll show you that too, right out the gate with the third boss. You'll spend hours and hours grinding and are still reliant on RNG to win. Since a lot of the games difficulty is RNG, I would go as far as saying that higher difficulty play is really only artifically difficult and luck based. \n\nPlaying the game on Nightmare on NG+ was very enjoyable however. I started over level wise but retained my gear from the previous playthrough, and the difficulty felt right. The challenge was evident, and I felt my choices led me to victory, rather than RNG.\n\nFor your first playthrough, I highly suggest normal difficulty. It is still somewhat challenging but is nowhere near frustrating.\n\n\nDifficulty: 7/10\n\nI absolutely love the music in this series, however I'm the kind of person with an addicting personality. Short tracks on repeat for a long time are a staple for me, especially as someone who grew up playing so many JRPGs. No different here. I do however recognize that some people get annoyed hearing the same thing over and over for hours on end.\n\nMusic: 10/10\n\nI infinitely recommend this game to any and all who have played a JRPG. Also, every purchase gives Xseed more reason to consider translating the rest, so..if for no other reason I'm going to slefishly tell you to buy this game!", "timestamp_created": 1454294975, "timestamp_updated": 1454294975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20882752": {"recommendationid": "20882752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100856137", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 14210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459826045}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: If you played the first game and liked it, this game is worth your time and money. Buy it when you have the finances for it. If you didn't like the first game for certain elements, you most likely won't like this one either since it retains basically all of them on top of all the new stuff.[h1]Here's my review of the first game:[/h1]http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198100856137/recommended/251150/\n\n[Story - good]: It picks up mere hours after the first game's ending. The heavy dialogue is still there, be prepared for a lot of reading. The atmosphere changes however. Instead of being about a fledgling bracer learning the ropes and introducing elements of the world, it shifts to a more mythical and politically charged setting with a lot more at stake. There is also no huge cliffhangar ending like the first game. You will be mostly satisfied with how it ends but it still manages to leave some loose ends open for The Third.\n\n[Characters - excellent]: Without trying to spoil much, I can say that if you didn't like Estelle's treatment in the first game, it's like night and day in the second. She does nothing but improve as a character. As for other characters that didn't get much development or explanations, that all changes too. Aside from a couple of new characters introduced to tie SC together into the Third, everyone gets some sort of character progression.\n\n[Graphics - depends]: I already mentioned that I love these graphics in the first game's review. SC also reuses a lot of the same areas from the first game but manages to make them feel different from when you visited them the first time through. It deserves to be noted that there's some very awesome in-game graphics cutscenes AND some epic feeling animated cinematics in SC.\n\n[Music - excellent]: Like the graphics, SC reuses some of the music of the first game. However there's still a lot more variety than what the first game had which I think was a good move on Falcom's part. Overall it feels a lot more epic to fit with the change of atmosphere of the story.\n\n[Combat - good]: There was a lack of variety with the first game's combat ultimately. SC does manage to add more though. Chain Crafts for combo attacks, new Quartz allows for more spell options, a slew of new equipment and accessories allows for more freedom with how you set your group up. You can also choose your party setup more frequently with more options on who can accompany you and with the rebalancing of character's Crafts, you should have a tougher time deciding who you want to take with you.\n\n[Length - good]: As it has been mentioned so many times already, let me reiterate, the first game can take 40-50 hours to beat the first time through... SC is at least 80 hours or more depending on how thourough you are, so at least twice as long as the first. No matter how much I like the story, I feel it's important to mention that the pacing can really slow down, to the point that you may feel like stopping. It is worth trudging through the slow points though because when it picks up, it really picks up!\n\n[Replayability - average]: I haven't actually been able to play a new game+ yet but I'm willing to bet that some people may not want to play through a second time or more due to the pacing and length. However, the upside of playing the Trails games multiple times is that you may miss things (item, story or character-wise) the first time through because you're focused on reaching the end. One of the greatest stregths Falcom games have is the details they add to characters or the environment that makes them feel more worth exploring, this doesn't matter to everyone who plays RPGs but to some, it makes a difference.\n\n[Bugs - average]: I haven't kept up as much with SC on what's broken or fixed because I haven't had as much time to dedicate to it. But I'm confident XSEED is still hard at work trying to smash the problems littering SC. At the very least there was one potentially game-breaking bug late in the game but has an in-game workaround to avoid it entirely... plus the game has only been out for a few months and the team dedicated to Trails is rather small, patience is a virtue.\n\nMy big negative from the first game still exists in SC, not being able to skip animations during combat. At least with more spell variations now, I can cast more than just White Gehenna spam though. :)", "timestamp_created": 1454278898, "timestamp_updated": 1470777322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.993345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20877734": {"recommendationid": "20877734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057953038", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 7676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503515681}, "language": "english", "review": "Totally worth the wait.", "timestamp_created": 1454263320, "timestamp_updated": 1454263320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20857661": {"recommendationid": "20857661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156793861", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454380721}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent second chapter to this series.

It's somewhat odd to be saying that, considering a month ago I didn't own SC, and had had Trails in the SKY: FC sitting on my hard drive for a year.  I started playing FC in late 2014, but the story is a bit of a slow burn.  10 or so hours in and not much had happened, and so I ended up shelving it for awhile.  In December of last year, I decided I needed to start playing it again and finish it.  It's interesting what happens sometimes when you take a break from a game you're not into at the time - after only a few hours back into FC, the character and plot needles had moved enough to keep me going, and before long I had become well and truly sucked in.\n\nI played FC religiously at that point, fully-invested in the detailed characters, the growth they displayed throughout the game, and the ever-growing story.  That game, as you may have heard, has a real doozy of a cliffhanger, one with a lot of emotional punch.  So, there was only one thing for it - immediately purchase Trails in the Sky: SC and plunge headlong back into the world of Liberl.  Was it worth it?  Damn straight it was.\n\nThe character and world-building elements of SC are every bit as great as in FC, to which game it is a direct sequel.  I loved the characters, loved the story and loved that you could tell a lot of care was put into this game.  One of the things that's especially nice is that there's a true sense of humor on display at points, as well.  The anime-style character portraits do a wonderful and often-humorous job of conveying the characters' emotions, and, as in FC, there are treasure chests that, if you interact with them post-looting will give you a sarcastic message about doing so.\n\nSo emotion and humor and character and all of those nice RPG elements are present.  What about the gameplay?  I tend to be a fan of JRPGs that show you the monsters onscreen instead of having random battles (not that I don't love a number of those, as well), and if you're careful or have the right equipment you can always decide if you want to stop and fight or are in too much of a hurry to be bothered with it at the time.  You shouldn't need to grind in either FC or SC - the game rewards experience based on comparing your level with the enemy defeated, so underleveled characters play catch up fairly quickly.\n\nThe areas are generally well-laid out, although there are a few dungeons late game you might find yourself getting lost in if you aren't paying attention.  Design is good, and there is attention to detail everywhere.  The graphics are somewhat dated but plenty serviceable and there are options for things like anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering and HD fonts and features that make the game more presentable on a modern system.  You'll notice that its technology is older, but unless you're really invested in that aspect, you won't care.\n\n\"Regular\" battles can be somewhat tedious, though if you set yourself up right you can usually eliminate normal opponents pretty quickly.  The orbment system is interesting and versatile, and for those who played FC there are a number of further upgrades and changes that enhance battle and the number of arts(spells) you have available.  My understanding is that originally FC and SC were one game that had to be split into parts, and you can definitely see that here, as SC builds and expands upon what was already laid out in FC in a very natural way.\n\nMost of the music is good, some of it great (although I miss the battle music from FC).  I still hate the music that plays in the city of Bose.  I think if Bose had catchier music I would not have put down FC for so long, and it returns in SC.  Oh well, you can't have everything. \n\nThere are a couple of gripes - in the back third of the game, you do some retreading over prior ground and have a section where it's \"go here, fight X enemy\" followed immediately by \"go here now, and fight Y enemy\" that is kind of a grind, but there's still more than enough story to carry you through.  The final area is lovely, well-designed and feels like the climactic finale that you probably were hoping to finally get after the pain of FC's cliffhanger.  As for how much you get to have a certain character in your party...you'll just have to play the game.\n\nSo, in short, if you have FC then I recommend SC, even if you haven't finished FC yet, as you will inevitably have to know what happens next (and you will, even if you currently have FC on standby like I did).  And if you have neither, but the above sounds appealing and you can deal with the few flaws I mentioned, and are willing to invest the time in a story that starts slow only to keep building in power through the two games, why not buy both?", "timestamp_created": 1454032692, "timestamp_updated": 1454032692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500144", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20812413": {"recommendationid": "20812413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099493088", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481648403}, "language": "english", "review": "the story is right after first chapter and this one is way longer than the first chapter, with much more orbal combination and skill\n\npros:\none of the best JRPG out there, good story, skill (trust me you will spend at least an hour just to adjust the orbal combination and see the book a few times), alot of craft skill and S-Break for each character and good music\n\ncons:\nsome bug still there, sometimes the game even crash, some side quest got strange clue especially on blueblanc quest and you need to go around every single house and every corner of the city just to find a clue. \nand the worst part, almost every single boss and his minions on could resist almost all status effects (mute,petrify,slow,poison,etc) which means all kind of debuffs are useless because on normal battles you can just wipe out all monsters with AoE damage skill, getting worse when the OP joshua is coming back with his highest time orb skill (abyss fall,etc) can wipe stray monster with 1 hit skill AoE, so basically, the battle is mostly on attack art, healing, and buff (shield, speedup,etc)\n\nneed the 3rd chapter~", "timestamp_created": 1454013532, "timestamp_updated": 1480170336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20799058": {"recommendationid": "20799058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056264254", "num_games_owned": 554, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 3611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455043599}, "language": "english", "review": "in the sequel to the good jrpg, the story continues as estelle continues to prove why she is cool and awesome, and then she and her friends all high-five each other and they throw a party and then go on an adventure to fight Big Fire", "timestamp_created": 1453958061, "timestamp_updated": 1453958061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20797512": {"recommendationid": "20797512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066153187", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453864158}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved this game.

The plot is well placed, if a bit meandering at the start.  What really pulls the whole game together is the interactions of the charming and varied cast, as well as the phenomenal localization.  The dialouge never feels stilted or clunky, which is important because this game is verbose. The earlier book comparison is accurate: expect to do a lot of reading.\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, the combat is incredibly similar to the first which is both a strong reason to play this game as well as a bit of a knock against it. There was very little innovation in the implementation of battles. Fortunately, the base was already very solid and it is hard to find fault with the system.\nAll in all, I would strongly reccomend this game to anyone in search of an emotional, character-driven, intrigue-filled adventure; however, lacking an understanding of the story from the first game will really inhibt one's ability to follow what is happening in the early portions of this game.

It was obviously a lot darker than the first game with its introduction of new villains working from the shadows and narrowing down most characters` individual pasts and stories. The game felt so intense with each new chapter and was really exciting at times but always introduces time for a little laughter. Even the NPCs were quite lively and had their own tales which intersected between chapters and made them more lively. The overall length was very satisfying and did make ends meet with most characters but still left a few lingering questions and mysteries that are yet to be known. \n\nI`ll admit that some parts of it were definitely very predictable like being saved at the last minute in most scenarios. The game does over-use that trope and breaks the mood but it is nice to see other characters jumping in the spotlight. I personally felt that the choice to freely pick any party member was nice but it also does limit what we get out of having all characters shine. In the first game you had a select party for each chapter and could really get a feel for what makes them unique and also how you can really adapt to their abilities in battle. So in the SC its more like you can choose to experiment with different members while also trying to be aware of what abilites may be effective or not with others. The dialogue scenes can be lengthy but they are also touching at times which complements that along with its lovely soundtrack.\n\nUltimately this has been one of the best JRPGs I`ve played in a while and I would definitely recommend it to others since it is rather unknown but is an amazing game nonetheless.", "timestamp_created": 1453207120, "timestamp_updated": 1453207120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20613352": {"recommendationid": "20613352", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975817535", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453153892}, "language": "english", "review": "That game is an absolute masterpiece. \n\nI was scared after First Chapter that SC would have trouble beeing better or even equal but waow.

It is deep, very deep, but it does not lose its way in its own complexity, everything has a meaning and a purpose. It is so well written and paced, I can't even imagine what TC will be like. The characters are a big part to the game's success, Estelle's journey from an annoying teenager to such a strong willed young woman was amazing to follow.

Trails in the Sky SC has brilliant storyline but in terms of gameplay, it's not different from FC at all. If you play SC straight after finishing FC, it will just feel like you are playing a very long ONE game. I highly recommend using Speed Hack of some sort to adjust your game speed. I loved the story, I hated playing the same game as FC with 0 additions to the gameplay.\n\nI clicked 'no, I don't recommend this game' but there are some things I need to mention. It's a game that you should finish if you have cleared and enjoyed FC. I purely clicked 'Don't recommend' because SC doesn't provide anything new apart from the storyline.\n\nSince the storyline continues, you must have played and finished the Trails in the Sky FC before playing this game in order to understand what is going on.  If you have liked the FC, you will likely to want to play SC. The storyline from FC is great so you will likely to want to know what happens afterwards. \n\nSC storyline is just absorbing as FC (maybe little bit less). The storyline in FC focuses on character development so you begin developing a form of 'relationship' with your characters. And, in SC - you spend time to understand them as their personal history gets unveiled. There were some fuzzy hearty moments, good twists and what not..  The problem begins here, I loved the storyline but I got sick of the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is exactly the same - it's not different from FC at ALL, apart from more Arts you can use. The save file carries on from FC so you still get to have all your abilities (which is pretty cool). But, you don't get new Crafts (character's dinstict skills) in SC - your old crafts just get upgraded to 'true' form which would have been totally fine if they had a different animation. Sure, you get Chain Crafts.. but you still don't get new animations. \"TRUE\" form that looks exactly like the \"Old\" form, seems like they focused on the storyline too much.\n\nIn SC, you have to rely on your Arts quite a bit as physical attacks become less effective and monsters are stronger. Considering how I have avoided using Arts in FC, purely because physical attack animations are much shorter - this was a big pain. Aerial is one of the most used Arts in the game, you get to choose a large area where you are going to summon tornade.. and the animation goes for like 10 seconds.. I started playing SC straight after FC so all the battles just felt very 'boring' after already spending 35 hours in the FC. Surely, it wouldn't have been hard at all to put an option to adjust your animation speed. I have played The Legend of Heroes 4, same developers - and that game was from 90s and was a DOS game - even that had animation speed options!\n\nThe game takes a lot longer to finish than FC so you definitely still get your money/time worth. It's still very text heavy which I don't mind at all - but I had to download Speed Gear to adjust my game speed. And, I seriously recommend EVERYONE doing that - even adjusting it to 1.5x made the game experience very pleasurable. Though at the end, I set the speed on 2x.\n\nThey have added some cool anime cut scenes which is good. Some of the sound tracks have been rearranged which is also positive, considering how good the soundtrack is from FC - I didn't mind that they have recycled the same music from FC.\n\nSo there it is - I have finished both FC and SC - and I am exhausted. I have stated in FC review that it felt like reading a novel and SC still provides that experience except that you can't enjoy the storyline at your own enjoyable pace that you'd like because battles take up quite a bit of your gametime unlike FC.

Once you get sucked into this story, you'll only want more and more. I rarely write reviews but I'll do it for this one. Let's get into the meat of it.\n\nTrails on the Sky: SC starts immediately after the conclusion of the First Chapter and concludes the story of Estelle. Just so I don't spoil anything accidentally, I'll just say the identity of your enemy is revealed to you from the beginning, which is a nice change of pace compared to most JRPGs, which throw evil guy after evil guy at you only to reveal there's an even bigger evil guy pulling the strings from behind.\n\nThis doesn't make the journey to beat that enemy boring, though. The lengths said enemy will go in order to fulfill their evil plot will make you shudder every step of the way. And there resides one of the strongest selling points of the game. You will FEEL what's happening in that beautifully crafted pixel world. The anger, the joy, the fear... every character is so well written and developed that their emotions can touch you quite deeply. We should thank the localization team for that, too, thank you based XSEED and Carpe Fulgur for a job well done.\n\nThe attention to detail gets a honorable mention here too. There are TONS of dialogue lines which you will never see in a single playthrough, but only because every possible choice (mainly party configuration choice) you make is covered. Special dialogues if certain characters are present, interaction between characters even in the most menial of sidequests, a lot of NPCs reacting to a particular teammate because they know each other... Detail, detail everywhere, and everything adds up to the feeling that those characters have ties to people and places, that they live in cities and know half the neighbourhood, that they're not just personality clich\u00e9s detached from the world and designed just to fill a particular role in your party.\n\nThat's about it for the story and immersion parts. The graphics are... well, Trails graphics. If you're interested enough in the game to look at the reviews, you don't give a damn about the graphics. The only particularly ugly thing I've noticed is that certain characters are introduced by showing a full screen image of them against the background, and the borders are BADLY pixelated. This could be easily patched, so pls fix. Slight framedrops/stutter occur in certain areas, I'm almost 100% certain it's a game issue, since it always happens in the same places (Grancel entrance, for example) and my computer runs it at 120 FPS with zero problems the rest of the time.\n\nThe soundtrack is so exquisite I have a playlist of jdk songs saved on youtube so I can listen to it whenever I'm just fooling around in my computer. A friend of mine described it like this: \"I'm feeling nostalgia listening to songs of a game genre I've never played\".\n\nFinally, the only downside I can think about: the game abuses the mechanic of having someone appear juuuust a little too late and save the day for our heroes. It happens a number of times and it's pretty well explained so it always makes sense but... how about appearing five minutes earlier and saving me the trouble of going through that boss fight?", "timestamp_created": 1451902049, "timestamp_updated": 1451902049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20262028": {"recommendationid": "20262028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017949857", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494171669}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes me cry like a little girl.", "timestamp_created": 1451840321, "timestamp_updated": 1451840321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20261800": {"recommendationid": "20261800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070529033", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451765533}, "language": "english", "review": "This game and its predecessor First Chapter belong to a rare breed that's all the more rare these days: The turn-based, character-driven JRPG with great storytelling and music, but less emphasis on impressive graphics.

There might be mild spoilers in this review.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of all of the story threads this game introduced. The first game had a cunning and scary villain who puts together a grand conspiracy, and even though it doesn't give you all the answers up front it gave you enough motivation to want to stop him. In SC, there are too many bad guys and their characterization is hit and miss. They are just doing Bad Stuff that seems mostly isolated in each chapter and you have to stop them. And even when you do stop them it was just \"part of their plan\", which is a common thing on both moral sides in this game. It's really silly how many times something happens that seems like a pro for your party but turns out it was just part of the bad dude's plans, or part of Estelle's dad's plan, the game overuses this trope so hard. It also overuses the whole \"bad guy is about to [actually kill] someone but then someone shows up and saves them at the last minute\" trope. Maybe the first game had these issues as well, I don't remember being so annoyed by it. Overall the chapters are hit and miss, as are the villains, and the overarching story doesn't really come together in a very satisfying way like the first game does.\n\nWhat the game does have is a really great arc for most of its main characters. Estelle and Joshua shine throughout, there's some great sisterly conversations between Estelle, Kloe, and Scharz, and overall the game does a great job of giving you a lot of party members you care about. It's actually kinda disappointing you can only pick 4 of them at a time,  as the game is really good about giving your optional party members dialog and you miss out on a lot of it. That's a good problem to have, honestly, given how rote a lot of RPG party members can be. Even when the overarching narrative gets drab at times, the main characters really carry this story and ultimately make it worthwhile.\n\nThe combat remains strong...though the more powerful nature of the quartz you get in SC compared to the first means that it is much easier to trivialize the combat by the end of the game. The whole experience could have been about 15 hours shorter, there's so much combat for the sake of combat towards the end. Chapter 7 has a bunch of boss battles that seem ultimately pointless (and are indeed lampshaded as such by the characters). The world of Liberl is still an amazingly detailed place to run around in, which is good because you will sure be doing a lot of backtracking in the main story. What makes the backtracking more bareable is that the game is really good about changing the NPC dialog based on stuff that has happened in the world, which makes it nice to just walk around talking to random people. Graphically the game is of course fairly primitive, but it's still very good at making each environment unique, and the final area of the game is amazing.\n\nThis game doesn't make good on all of the promise of FC's amazing cliffhanger ending, but it's still a stunningly crafted RPG world with great main characters.

At the time of this review I just got finished playing this game and this was one hell of a ride. I played the first game which was spectactular and eagerly awaited the second game, and it did not dissapoint....mostly. But I want to get this out while It's still fresh in my head, and to keep myself from rambleing I will have it divided into sections(Gameplay, Story, Characters,Setting and Music)\n\nGameplay:The gameplay imo is the weakest aspect of the game, but only for the fact that a lot of the battles have a tendency to be dragged out and nothing else, aside from that the combat in this game was VERY engaging and this is coming from someone who perfers Action-Based RPG's over turnbased ones. Make no mistake this game is tough and it will kick your ass if you aren't prepared, even against normal encounters, but boss battles Oooooh man.....(First one that comes to mind is a certain boss at the end of chapter 7) it might not be hard for some people but you will get a decent amount of game overs regardless. Overall while not my perfered combat style for games, it's engaging enough to keep from being boring.\n\nStory: The story picks up directly from the last game, and starts of with main character Estelle going off to train in order to find joshua who went awol at the end of the last game after reclaiming his memories, a lot of which has to do with joshuas prior relationship with the society of oroboros. The story itself is very simple, but has multiple twists and turns and is very well written. You always want to know what happens next, it never leaves you wanting and has plenty of humor to offset some of the more....dark elements that show up in the game(and I mean DARK seriously some of the stuff you find out goes on behind the scenes in this seemingly innocent world is baffleing and almost ALWAYS involves erebonia in some way, I can say with a straight face that by the end of the game I was very satisfied.\n\nCharacters: Oh the characters are all Gems(Except Gilbert, Fuck Gilbert) Oh everyone of the main cast is likeable. From Girly Tomboy Estelle, Prim and Proper Kloe, Hot Headed Agate, Bizzare Oliver, Sultry Schera and of course the Mysterious Joshua. And the antagonists, while yes evil are never obnoxious or spurnful except for the final boss....that guys an jerk. Oh the list just goes on and on, and I could go on for days. But to make a long story short, the cast is incredibly memorable and adds a lot of flavor to the story, and every single one of them develops massively as the game goes on.\n\nSetting: What they did for this game was exceptionally clever. The game takes place in the kingdom of Liberl, a small independent nation with highly advanced technology on the western side of the continent Zumeria.However that is not the important part, what is note worthy is that it is but one of 4 we know so far on the Zumerian continent. There is the Aforementioned Kingdom of Liberl, The Erbonian Empire, The Republic of Calvard and the autonomous state of Crossbell. What they have done is left a world so open that it could be used to make multiple story arks within the same setting which is to say the least impressive, leading to a potentially massive expanding world, that i cant WAIT to explore more of. Hinted by Trails of Zero, Trails of Azure and the Trails of Cold steel Trilogy.\n\nMusic: Music's Good Nuff said. But seriously This games music has many well orchestrated tracks. While some tracks would be considered memorable, most are just used to set the tone and mood, and they do so very well. From happy and chipper to crazy serious, there are few tracks you would put on your MP3 Player, but every track in this game provides excellent ambiance and for a game like this, that's all you really need.\n\nFinal Notes:I'm really glad they decided to port this game over and seem to be planning to bring more of this series over, it's one that has been LONG over due and any lover of well crafted story telling owes it to themselves to play this game. No it's not perfect, nothing is. But it IS a turn-based, tactics style JRPG with a HEAVY Emphasis on Story telling, and it performs it beautifully. \n\nHonestly the only complaints I could possibly have is the somewhat repetitve gameplay, The fact that the game likes to spike up the difficulty to ridiculous levels (Especially if you plan to do the monster hunting quests) and that theres no word on when they will translate Final chapter while they are working on trails of cold steel. But since Final Chapter is more like an Epilouge/Afterstory anyway, there really is no rush.\n\nThere is one character in particular I REALLY want to learn more about since she arguably has a more fucked up past than even Joshua, though considering that translating this game alone was basically the equivilent of all 7 harry potter books and the lord of the rings trilogy COMBINED, I'm willing to wait and let them have their rest.\n\nAnd XSEED while you may never read this, I still wish to say. On behalf of all JRPG lovers everywhere, I thank you for translating this Masterpiece of a game, and hope that you will translate more of this series as quickly as you are able, and for everyone else if you haven't played this game yet, do so as soon as you are able.

I played most of the game in offline mode so my playtime is lower than it should be. The story is great, it's really long and they sure put a lot of effort into it. All the characters seemed to be quintessence of a JRPG character stereotype but I didn't mind that cause they interacted so well together due to the dialogue so watching each characters interact with eachother which is dependent on who you bring into your party was very enjoyable.

Each town is also heaps different from eachother so finishing up one place is fun cause the next place is a new experience I guess.

I have worked hard since i left school at 17 and in the past 2 years i grinded my way into a nice promotion at a job where a lot of people hate or see as a dead end career wise. I'm going through the toughest time of my life right now with personal issues and the troubles that come along with being unemployed during a crisis in your life is weighing heavy on me. Don't worry this is not a sob story, everything ties in with the game.\n\nSo, being depressed and unable to get out of bed and generally live my life ( no exaggeration i swear ) i found myself reading up on old video games that i loved as a kid, in an attempt to try and feel happy again. Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VIII were my favorite games growing up. In recent years i haven't been that much into games as i was as teenager. Work commitments and adulthood takes a hold of you and gaming kind of took a back seat.\n\nAnyway, i stumbled upon Trails In The Sky FC whilst reading up on good JRPGS on Steam ( JRPG's were my thing as a kid ). I saw one review that described Trails as better than Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VII, and it was going so cheap on Steam, i had to see what the fuss was about. Thank god i did.\n\nAs i played FC and SC consecutively i'll count this as a combined review but as i mentioned above. I haven't played games much in recent years and an in depth review is something i wouldn't be good at so i'll keep it short and sweet.\n\nFirst things first, the storyline in this game is absolutely fantastic, So many good characters and interactions, a lot of text to read through but i love that. A game without good text/dialogue will struggle to be a good game. Trails has the best storyline i have ever came across in a game. It's very long but well worth it, look at it this way. Would The Lord Of The Rings be the story it was if it were not a gigantic beast of a novel? This kind of is the same with Trails. It's a slow burner at the the start but about 20 hours into FC it picks up and does not stop. It grips you in and will have you laughing, crying and screaming before you know it.\n\nThe characters and character relations are amazing. Sometime the highlights for me weren't beating a tough boss or finishing long quests/chapters it was the small moments when the full team are together and each individual character shines through in the dialogue. Simply fantastic.\n\nI had mentioned before playing SC that the only thing i could say that was keeping it from being the complete game was the music, although the music is great i did say that it wasn't comparable to say a Nobou Uematsu score ( but what is eh? ). I'm going to backtrack on this now, after playing SC ( Which is considerably longer than FC ) i can say that the music is absolutely fantastic. It's up there with Nobou's Chrono Trigger soundtrack for me now.\n\nWell, that's about as much as i can say without tangling myself up in knots over a game review. The reasons i wanted to write this wasn't to critique the game but to get the message out there that games ( no matter what your preference is ) are magical. I'm now in better spirits and feeling more optimisitc about life after finishing this game. Yes, that may sound sad to some people but the joy this game brought to me will be something i will forever cherish. Given the impact this game has had on me, it will now be my \" Greatest Game Of All Time \". Sometimes you need somthing in your life to pick you up and Trails was my shoulder to cry on. Thanks Falcom and Xseed, you basically saved my life.\n\nIf you like long JRPG's with amazing storytelling, characters, combat systems and addictive side quests. You need to get this game.

On the other hand, there are gamers craving the old-school appeal of the likes of Chrono Trigger or The World Ends with you, where the games are more focused on the dialogue, character interactions and world exploration.\nThe game I'm mentioning in this review is an old-school game that emerged in an age where people are leaning to the former rather than the latter, though story-based games aren't without their fair share of fans.\n\nLegend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a game with a rather strange history. The game is easily among the biggest JRPG franchises in Japan, yet has cult classic status elsewhere; for those unaware, a cult classic is something that has a small following, yet the fans of whatever it is absolutely adore and may go so far as to hold it as one of the best in its genre for whatever reason. Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (from this point onward referred to as just Trails in the Sky) is one such game.\n\nThe game was originally released in 2004, and was eventually translated in 2011. A sequel to the game, referred to as Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC (short for second chapter) was originally released in 2006, and translated in 2015.\n\nThe game follows two characters, Estelle (a tomboy who has an obsession with sneakers) and her adopted brother Joshua (whose past is a complete mystery). They become bracers at the beginning of the story, and face various challenges along the way.\n\nWhile the premise will undeniably turn some people off, the storyline is a lot more than what it seems. The game deals with a wide variety of themes, whether its war and the effect it has on various people, the effect using a particular resource has on people, how much are people willing to sacrifice for peace and much, much more. The story is also epic in scale, and by the end of the first game the player will wonder if there is a resolution to the dozens of subplots going on (small spoiler: yes for the most part, though I still want the third chapter over).\n\nThe characters are among the most lively I've ever seen in any work of fiction of general, with some of the funniest dialogue I've ever read (the game has practically no voice acting) as well as being extremely developed with a great deal of care and subtlety. A lot of effort was put to make the characters follow conventional tropes only on a superficial level and make them very multi-layered and complex, making them come off as (and this isn't easy to do) human. \n\nIn fact, the game's greatest strength is how natural and human everything feels. The character interactions, story events and dialogue never feel forced or unnatural, making it easier for the player to be immersed in everything that happens.\nAnother massive positive that connects with my opening point that games can tell stories no other medium can tell is how lively the world is. There are literally hundreds of NPCs, each with their own personality, motivations and backstories, and interacting with them from the first game to the second game can vary wildly (especially if you maintain save files from the first chapter to the second). This is extremely rare among video games, which almost never give any semblance of a personality to NPCs, much less continuous development or any interesting interactions.\n\nThe gameplay is turn-based, mainly revolving around managing and upgrading orbments, and within battle paying attention to benefits as well as casting arts. The game is relatively easy, but has massive difficulty spikes while fighting bosses, making it challenging yet extremely strategic since there are also various benefits depending on the turn a character is fighting. These benefits can be received by foe and ally alike, and a large portion of the gameplay is dedicated to making sure your allies receive those benefits.\n\nThe graphics are extremely dated by modern standards, but also rather fitting for the game, matching its retro feeling. \nThe soundtrack is easily among the best in any video game period, and manages to never feel out of place or unfitting the scene or battles it plays in. Seriously, look up a few tracks on YouTube and try to tell me its bad music, I dare you.\nI cannot recommend this game highly enough, especially if you are fond of engaging storylines and want something more old-school. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1450018275, "timestamp_updated": 1450018275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19675882": {"recommendationid": "19675882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006804460", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 5586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450125306}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you Falcom for making this legendary game, thanks XSEED for bringing it to the western world and the amount of effort put into translating it.\n\nThis is must play if you're a JRPG/Final Fantasy fan like myself, SC keeps you gripped to the main story with many MANY! twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat making you want to play for a few more hours (even if it's 3am in the morning), for the next action packed piece of drama.

The main reason is because the story is very good with some great twists, and the games do a very good job of world building and fleshing out and developing the (largely likeable) cast of characters.\n\nHowever, as a result of the world building focus, the game tends to be very slow paced, and both games are fairly long.  It took me around 150 hours between the two games to complete the story, and surely not everyone would want to put that time in.  It can be considered either a bug or a feature, depending on what you are looking for.  I personally think that the generally slow paced and more laid back nature of the game makes a good contrast for when the story kicks things up several notches, as compared to other games which may try to be over-the-top at all times.  There is also a LOT of hidden side stuff and missions that you can choose whether or not to try to find.\n\nThe battle system is similar to Grandia with a lot of interrupts and cancels, and can be fairly deep and enjoyable.  Also, the soundtracks for both games are fantastic and great at setting the tone for what is going on.\n\nIf you are interested in an rpg that does a lot of character and world building, and are okay with a generally slower pace to the story, I can highly recommend Trails in the Sky.

Now for everyone who doesn't know me, you're probably not aware of the gravity that statement has... Let's just say that I've played a LOT of great JRPGs in my time, from the popular Final Fantasy series, to the hidden gems like Anachronox, Piers Solar and Septerra Core.\n\nI would easily rank The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC in my top five JRPGs of all time.\n\nLet me make a quick summarised review on whether this is your type of game or not;\n[list]\n[*]Turn based battles\n[*]Story intensive\n[*]Difficulty ranging from low, to intense\n[*]Over 75 hours of gameplay\n[/list]\nIf you don't have the patience to read the text in this game, then you will be missing out on the thing that really sets it apart from the competition. The story itself could be called JRPG standard fare I suppose, but what really sets this game (and the prequel) apart from the competition is amount of world building that is done. Every NPC has a name, and every NPC has a story. There are weapon shop owners who I actually went to speak to after every single event. I spent time getting to know the people of Liberl and I had a fantastic time doing it. The playable characters all have their goals and motivations, and aren't just there for the ride. They feel almost real, you grow to actually care about them as you play through the game. As a long time JRPG player, this blew my mind quite frankly.\n\nThe battle system is completely turn based and pretty tactical. Some of the bosses in the game can be tough, especially if you're playing on the harder difficulties, making it feel all the more satisfying when you pull off a clutch victory or manage to outwit an opponent. The development system is pretty unique too, borrowing elements similar to Materia and rewarding clever placement of Quartz. The equipment system gives you five slots to work with, meaning you can make all rounded characters or specialised roles depending on your personal preference.\n\nThe visuals are colourful and vibrant, and I enjoyed the isometric view. The big attacks and magicks feel cool to use, and you definitely get a sense of awe with the larger ones, this always gives you a feeling of being powerful when you're fighting enemies. The music is absolutely fantastic, and does a really great job of remixing in the main theme, which gives every song a sense of nostalgia in a way. The sound design in general is really good, and having enemies pop when  they die sounds incredibly satisfying.\n\nOne of the few negative things I can say about this game is the performance wasn't too great for me. I have a machine that should be able to knock this out easily, but I still got occasional stuttering which was a bit disappointing. In battle it ran fine though, even in the most intense scenes, so it could be a driver issue or something on my side. The controls are fine, with complete control over remaps. Using a controller or M&KB really is down to personal preference, and you won't find yourself hampered using either.\n\nAnother negative point that is more down to personal preference rather than something objectively bad is the fact that if you want to get all the books (some of which allow you to get the ultimate weapons) you need to be very careful of going past points of no return. I'd suggest following a book guide and a BP guide, if you're bothered by missables at all. ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=544768316] Here [/url])\n\nI don't know what else I can say to make you consider this game. It's fantastic and you should definitely play it if you love JRPGs or just like great stories. Please be sure to play the first game though, seeing as this one is a direct sequel, and actually gives you bonuses for carrying over save data.\n\nRight, that's too much writing, I must now collapse.\n\n[i]Blorf[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1449823303, "timestamp_updated": 1511707463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19603332": {"recommendationid": "19603332", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998380079", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490097519}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]TLDR:[/h1]\nThe storyline will grab you by the balls/ovaries and will not let you go.

So, if you're just going to overlook the rest of the review, you probably should just turn away right now because you may not have the mental stamina to endure this game. It would be a massive mistake to ignore the story in this game.\n\nI'm going to put my grievances with this game FIRST so you know if you want to commit to this series.\n[list]\n[*]You _NEED_ to have played the first chapter before you tackle this game. The game is balanced such that you apply your knowledge from the first game into this one; no tutorials on how to attack or anything that was already present.\n[*]You fucking better dare not even try hard or nightmare difficulty. There's no additional reward except artificially inflating your playtime by granting every single enemy in the game a monstrous stat increase across the board. The community will not judge you for playing on easy. Even normal difficulty will fuck you up at some points.\n[*]If you're an achievement hunter, a lot of them are glitched and unfinishable no matter how detailed a guide you use. A glance at the global achievement stats will give you enough hints as to which ones are flat out broken.\n[*]A large resolution makes this game a little rough around the edges; you can start seeing into the nether space the devs didn't want you to see.\n[*]There are a couple of glitches regarding missing sprites, and in one case, a sequence break that you may not even notice happening.\n[*]There's a third chapter that may not get translated for a few years.\n[*]As mentioned before this game is INCREDIBLY text heavy and if you're the kind of person that usually mashes the 'skip cutscene button', well too bad, because you cannot skip any cutscene in this game. You can flip through text fast by holding down control, but that's only text; and some cutscenes can go on for at least ten minutes straight when you're reading.\n[*]The developers are cruel fuckers when it comes to missables; essentially everything in the game is missable. This is what you call a gamefaqs game. They're also going to be testing your patience quite frequently with some tasks being monumentally tedious and/or obscure. There is no fast travelling of any kind unless the story demands you to.\n[*]On the theme of missables, getting the full amount of Bracer Points is impossible without a guide. It is simply im-fucking-possible to have the intuition to do every quest, every sidequest, every HIDDEN sidequest, answer every dialogue branch correctly, and meet criteria during quests for extra Bracer Points on your own. If you want the achievement for getting all the Bracer Points, you better crack open that walkthrough and bookmark that shit. Make sure you make a separate save every single time you decide to save, so that if you do end up missing something you have plenty of points in the game to load to. At the end of the game I had about 135 save files, and that still wasn't quite enough. Don't worry, they give you 999 save files to work with, and 10 autosaves that happen with each map transition or battle.\n[*]Mouse controls are the best way to play this game, but you will need to get used to the fact that every time a menu appears, the mouse will instantly teleport to the first option of the menu as this game originates from the PSP. That can get annoying, but you get used to it. You can play the entire game with the mouse and Z/X to spin the camera.\n[/list]\n\nIf none of the above is enough to make you turn away, then you'll be able to enjoy what follows. If it is, I'm afraid it may be too much of a problem and will get in the way of you soaking in the story.\n\nNever before have I gotten so invested in a RPG's storyline. The combined 95 hours it took me to finish both games had me by the balls the entire time. Almost every single playable character and the villains have their own backstories, that at some point during either game get a portion of screen time. You feel for everyone at some point. Select NPCs have their own mini-stories which still feel integral to the plot, and often make you think \"shit, what if I didn't do this sidequest?\". If you import a complete save file from the first chapter (and you will because you absolutely must play the first game to even care about what's going on in this game), depending on your performance you'll get some neat little goodies, plus some little mentions here and there about what you did. Even the little things like keeping your notebook from the first game to flick through.\n\nIf you pay attention to the story (as a byproduct of it being amazingly enticing), you'll often be able to figure out what's coming next and feel like a badass when you predict the next plot twist. You feel like you're actually immersed in this world because you can tie things together without them being explicitly told to you point-blank. You get an idea of the world, its mythos, and you become part of it to an extent. \n\nThe arts system allows you to bend any party member into whatever role you see fit. That's important because there are many points where you're stuck with a certain character with no ability to get rid of them; but that's fine, you can just equip them and you're good to go. While it's true that some characters are better suited as a caster or a melee, nobody really feels useless. \n\nSpeaking of combat, it takes place on a Final Fantasy Tactics style grid adding some strategy as to where to position party members, predicting enemy movement so they'll fit in your AoE spells, and positioning to get as many enemies in a line for line spells. Unlike some more traditional JRPGs you actually have the means to avoid damage by simply moving out before an enemy finishes casting, by spreading your party out wide enough, by interrupting their casts, or hijacking enemy turns to eke out that last bit of health; so battles don't necessarily always end up as trying to keep an ever-leaking bucket from emptying as the boss spams spells that hit all party members with naught you can do to stop it except constant healing. \n\nParty members falling behind on levels get to reap the benefits of the relative EXP gains from defeating higher level monsters (e.g. you have 3 party members at level 55, you dig up your level 45 character; ordinarily you'd spend hours grinding just for them, but instead a level 57 monster can potentially give them at least four levels). I was worried I was going to be saying \"I wish I could use you, but I'd have to grind experience with you for about five hours just so I can use you\" quite a lot with how often party members switch in and out because of the storyline, and was relieved that never happened.\n\nDEAR GOD THE MUSIC WILL STICK WITH YOU FOREVER. By the time you finish the first chapter and load up the second chapter, you're going to have some feels hit you with the first chapter's most recent events fresh in your mind as soon as you hear that title screen music. You'll appreciate _all_ the music too, from the calm field map music to the myriad of evocative battle themes.\n\nThis game is responsible for any lowering in grades I may suffer in the coming weeks.

This action does not change the course of the main story or unlock additional sidequests or equipment. It provides absolutely no benefit other than a couple of lines of dialogue.\n\nIt is the little details like these, put into the game with the hearts of the developers, that are what makes Trails in the Sky SC amazing.\n\nTrails in the Sky is not an open world sandbox game, but the amount of effort put into the world and characters of the story is simply astounding. Your party members are a vibrant, well-developed cast of some of the most memorable characters you will meet, and a great deal of thought was put into each and every line of dialogue as the characters interact with each other, bringing their personalities to life. The NPCs which inhabit the cities and villages of Liberl are also lavished upon the same treatment, with almost all the NPCs having unique names and distinct personalities, down to even the airship crew and shop owners. And given that all of the NPC dialogue changes after each segment of the main story, you'll also be able to follow the little happenings in their daily lives. Yes that's right---most NPCs in the game have their own mini-storylines, a few which will tie into your Bracer Guild sidequests, but most which are just their to simply add life to the world. \n\nMy favourite of these even spans multiple regions and games, involving the grandma of Rinon, your Rolent General Store owner, who wants to find a wife for her son. She eventually gives up on Rolent and travels to Grancel at the end of FC, to no success. On the airship back though, she meets Kitty, a tea seller girl from Edel Department store, who is on the way to Bose, and gets along quite well with her (while her sister rejoices at being able to take over as #1 tea seller). Well, thanks to the airships being grounded, Kitty ends up working at the store in Rolent, and Rinon while suspicious of his grandma, can't help but admire the girl's enthusiasm and hard work. Later, in Chapter 8 the wedding of a couple (whose story began in FC, and whose ring you retrieve on a sidequest in Chapter 4) takes place, and well, no points for guessing who catches the bridal bouquet. \n\nTo anyone who loves a sprawling world with many secrets and lifelike characters, I can't recommend Trails in the Sky more.", "timestamp_created": 1449408552, "timestamp_updated": 1480079650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818880", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19517273": {"recommendationid": "19517273", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960416683", "num_games_owned": 616, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 4585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493785444}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was so good that I now have to seriously consider learning Japanese so I can play the remaining untranslated games in the series.\n\nI don't know whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.", "timestamp_created": 1449375540, "timestamp_updated": 1449375540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500114", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19512672": {"recommendationid": "19512672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018066796", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449485138}, "language": "english", "review": "I was on a JRPG kick, and it was on sale. And from those humble beginnings, my journey with the greatest RPG in a decade began.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky feels more like a novel than a video game. This is somewhat true in a literal sense: there's a lot of text! But where it really shows up is in the intentional design decision to have the story be the central focus. And what a story it is. It starts out small. You play as a teenager cutting her teeth at her newfound vocation, with the stakes to match: a lost cat, a maintenance kit for a lighthouse, unreturned library books. Nothing life-changing. Certainly nothing world-changing. But these seemingly trivial tasks allow the world and the characters to establish themselves and breathe, allowing them to become more than nameless faces. A dizzying amount of random townsfolk NPCs have their own storylines going on, and the game lets you watch these threads unfold. The main plot is slowly building in the background, but the game unapologetically focuses on letting the player slowly absorb the country of Liberl for the first thirty hours or so and watching the slow growth of Estelle. And it's the better for it, because when the plot gets into gear, all that time spent with her starts to really pay off. The game mechanics are decent, but they're obviously secondary: like a novel, the real meat of the game is the characterization and worldbuilding.\n\nThat's what happened in the prequel. Which you have to play before this one, because this one is where that characterization and worldbuilding established in the first one starts to pay incredible dividends.\n\nIn SC, the stakes are increased from the very start, but again, the game lets the central plot take the back seat for a while and focuses on worldbuilding and character development. You go back through the same towns as the first game, with the same NPCs and even the same dungeon layouts. And it's like visiting an old friend. You see how the NPCs handle the ongoing crises, how they've adapted, how they've soldiered on, how they've gone about the business of living their lives. It gives a richness and depth to the setting that is matched by few other games, and almost no other JRPGs. I can't stress this enough: the focus on world-building isn't a seasoning trying to add depth to the main course, it's part of the main course itself. I could spend the entire game running errands and talking to NPCs (and listening to the fantastic soundtrack!), and it'd be worth it. That's how good this element is.\n\nOf course, like in the first game, the main plot is always slowly building up in the background. And like in the first game, it starts to take center stage around 30 hours in. And like in the first game, the hours upon hours spent with following Estelle and her growth add a depth to the narrative that causes it to shine. Trails in the Sky is a story about Liberl, but it's primarily a story about Estelle, and the game does a beautiful job of linking the world-changing events happening to the personal growth of Estelle and her companions. It's a complete masterclass in writing, and if the country of Liberl is the soul of the game, then the journey of Estelle is unquestionably the heart. There are some improvements to the battle system, but again, this game isn't about the battle system. It's the story of a country and the story of a girl, masterfully weaved together into a single must-play experience.\n\nThere's been much written elsewhere about the long, hard, probably cursed journey this game took to Western shores, so I won't repeat the story here. But I would be remiss to not offer my gratitude to Falcom, to Carpe Fulgar, and to Xseed. Blood and tears were given to bring me this game, and my thanks and money seem woefully inadequate a recompense. But it's all I can offer for now, so it will have to do.

For those of you who have already played the first chapter and enjoyed the experience, you're in for a treat. Get the second chapter--no discussion. If you're a big fan of story-heavy JRPGS with the classic Japanese battle system playstyle but haven't played the first or the second chapter and want to enjoy one of the best if not THE best JRPG series of the decade, then look no further. \n\nThe story is deep, rich, and full of surprising plot twists that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster. The characters are unique and interesting, each with their own quirks and way of speaking. EVERY single individual in this game has a personality to them. Even the seemingly unimportant NPCs like farmers, shop keepers, inn managers, etc. Also, a lot of times the music of some games may seem underwhelming when placed in context of a great story. But this is not the case with Trails in the Sky. Falcom did a great job in composing and implementing masterful pieces of music into the game. Each scene, boss bottle, environment,  and conversation have different feelings. And of course, the battle system is what the player is responsible for in the game. Although the thought of another turn-based JRPG may turn you off, don't be fooled. It's not your typical JRPG. Crafts, arts, random buff generator on the side, teamwork, and strategic placement of your squad is essential to ensuring your success in the battles. Overall, the game is extremely well-done in terms of XSEED bringing Trails in the Sky to the international stage. Little to no bugs, English translations that are not only grammatically correct but have life to them. It's truly a masterpiece. \n\nThe worst part of my experience playing this game was getting to the end and realizing that it will take another several years before the next game is localized for the English-speaking market.

After playing SC, I can see why FC and SC are split into two parts, and that both are worth getting. I've been following XSEED on their development on translating SC and they weren't kidding about the script size. It's huge and plays a huge factor on why this game is so good.\n\nSC (Second Chapter) is significantly darker than FC (First Chapter) in many respects, but still maintained a light tone throughout. I mean, it goes deeper into the overarching group Ouroboros and explains a lot of the things which FC doesn't.\n\nComparing with other JRPGs, the most unique thing about Legend of Heroes is the parallel storylines that takes place throughout the entire series. Most of the NPCs have their own storyline that runs in parallel with the main story, and sometimes they overlap and change the scripting around based on the actions our heroes take throughout the game. So, while the game can technically be rushed, the full magnitude of the world of Liberal can be appreciated simply by talking to each NPC after completing each milestone. It's a tedius process but it's very very worth it. It brings so much life to the game, it's actually really impressive with the amount of detail they went into the scripting. I can go on and on with examples, lets just say pretty much nearly every NPC with a name has a story one way or another! I would get this game just because of that! And after starting a new game+, not only does all of the main characters have this nostalgic feeling to them, even the NPCs have a nostalgic feeling... something I do not normally get from other games. \n\nWhile SC was significantly darker than FC, both FC and SC stayed very true to oldschool JRPGs. The style, the character development and the unravelling of the main antagonists and twists. The progression and the fact that there's already a diverging storyline early on in the game makes the game have replay value. I honestly did not expect the game to be this thorough, something that I find to be lacking in more modern rpgs. Most playable characters have so many ties to the world and from it there is a great deal of character development throughout the series. Every character was unique and enjoyable. The plot turns in the story was also very good, the cutscenes are great and there were a lot of funny moments. Olivier is my favourite character in the series =P.\n\nThere are also side quirks in the game, like gambling, fishing, and cooking which all ties with how the scripting is handled in the world at various times. They also help you in same way as well so there is incentive to work on them. There are also bracer points to maximize, which gives you reward items and scripting changes as well. There are some puzzles in the game, however they are not an integral part of the game.\n\nThe music is fantastic. The battle system is great, with some battles being very difficult, especially near the end! The customization with the orbments gives some unique tactics throughout the game. Every character also has their own unique S crafts and weapons, which brings additional flavour to how each battle is played out. One major difference between SC and FC are that there are interchangeable characters throughout most of the story, meaning that you can pick, from a group of characters, 4 to take with you to progress the story. This changes the scripting based on what characters you choose, and adds to the replay value to the game.\n\nWhile the graphics is a bit lacking compared with modernized RPGs, I must say it adds to the nostalgic touch to the game. However some might enjoy this because it allows room for the imagination to fill in the gaps. The cutscenes/fight scenes are still very good.  And honestly, albeit the lack of graphics, how Falcom made use of it still captivated me throughout. \n\nWhat can I say, I banked a good 110 hours on this game and that's just online. Looking at some other recommendations some of them banked 200 hours even! As far as the bang for the buck for an RPG is concerned, this game is pretty much worth it, as currently I am paying ~30 cents per hour for the game, and I suspect this number to decrease after this review is published. Most other JRPGs I would expect aronud 50-70 hour play time.\n\nBuy this game, not only because it's good, but also if you also want to support more JPRGs that focuses more on the storyline/character development itself!

Position is important for optimal plays, buffing allies actually makes a difference rather than being a minor nusiance and the same goes for debuffing. And lastly, its customization option makes anyone and everyone a fun and viable character. Everyone has a place in the party, in terms of both the story and party composition.

I spent 87 hours on this game and this was all for the story, doing sidequests, and exploring every nook and cranny for all of the possible secrets in the game. All of those hours spent was pure fun and not because I was grinding my characters up, getting lost in a dungeon, or retrying difficult boss fights over and over again. But that's just me being crazy in love with this game, anyone else can beat it in probably even half the time if you really wanted to. \n\nLike I said, this is one of the best jRPGs of all time. It shares a lot of good traits as Xenoblade Chronicles so if you've played that, then you'd love the Trails duo.

SC is the second game of the series set in Liberl, so play the First Chapter first. You play as Estelle (yes, a female protagonist, and most definitely best one I have ever seen) just like in FC.\n\nThis game paints one of the most developed fantasy worlds ever. Unique geopolitcs, history, resource production areas, pop culture, underground groups, etc all bundled into one game.\n\nThe character interaction is stellar. I love watching the characters go through their struggles together, and learn from their interactions with one another. The NPCs all have their own story. They don't seem like just NPCs, but people that actually have a life and don't rely on the player characters so much to do everything. They travel around and react to different situations in the game. The villians have their own reasons to be the villian and not just \"because lel\"\n\nIn other words, people actually act like people instead of random anime tropes.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good. The battle screen uses a grid based system, where positioning matters. Staying close together increases your chances of taking AOE damage, but makes healing and buffing easier. The orbment system allows you to customize what your characters do... especially people like Estelle who have balanced orbment slot setup. Art casters (magic casters) became more balanced vs taking physical attackers than in FC, which were generally less powerful than art casters. Sidequests don't seem repetitive (except a very certain thief), and can range from monster hunting to helping a guy impress a girl by keeping sober while drinking lots of alcohol... (don't ask.) The most important part of the sidequests is not the content, but that the sidequests [b]actually develop the characters, the people who gave the quest, and the world around them,[/b] instead of silly fetch quests and \"Save my family!\"\n\nThe music brings it all together. Falcom Sound Team jdk really does do an amazing job at creating music that fits into the themes and feeling of what is going on. \n\nAnd of course, we can't forget the localization team that brought this game to the West. Hats off to XSEED for pushing through a project that was cursed by Murphy's Law, and delivering an amazing localization.\n\n[b]Buy this game right now.[/b] It is absolutely worth it at $30. The game will probably take 80-120 hours depending on how much extra stuff you do and difficulty level.

That should explain my playtime\n\n\nThis game is what I call a proper sequel, it jumps straight to where the last game ended and spares no second to throw you in it's plot. You visit the same places and talk to the same people, however, the circumstances are different. The game gives off the feeling of continuity that a lot of sequels fail to live up to, an environment that progresses along with the player.\n\nHaving just recently finished LoH TitS FC, the intro of SC was gratifying for me in the sense that I immediately get to jump to exactly where I left off, no vague introductions, direct to the point I've been craving for. After the rush of familiarity settles, you quickly become oriented to the world that you've already explored. You're confident that you know every nook and canny, you're ready to sprint and blaze through the game...but not so fast Mr. Sonic the Hedgehog. Although the map is still technically the same, the quests will push you in places that were inaccessible before. This gives the Liberl the aura of authentic reality, just because you can't go somewhere doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it's a world that you happened to explore not a world that happened because you're exploring it.\n\n\nPlot-wise, a lot foreshadowing pays off and more of those questions are answered although not all. This game may fall short in novelty in terms of the \"first time\" adventure experience (since you've already been here) but it doubles your vision, letting you see the bigger picture as your role increases in relevance to the events you couldn't affect before, hence giving you the satisfaction from all your hard work in the previous title.\n\n\n\nThe battles are harder but you and your friends are stronger. Having more skills, orbment patterns, and party members really gives you the creative freedom to develop your own fighting style. Thanks to these upgrades, you can try multiple \"builds\" to tackle bosses using your own personal style. It also gives you more reason to leave no chest unturned and no monster unslayed. \n\n\n\nCharacters are as lovable as ever, though not all get the equal amount of spotlight they had during the FC, but they don't fade into the background either. Your choices on whom your party is made up of greatly affects the important and minor dialogues, this really increases the game's replay value as well as giving the player a personal touch on how to influence the flow of the story. You can really explore each character's personality in-depth in this game compared to FC. Their uniqueness really shines as their responses to different situations vary greatly (depending on who's on your party) PLUS, they don't just randomly speak up they actually interact with the rest of your party which leads to some of the funniest moments in RPG I've ever witnessed, all the more reason to replay and mix up your party.\n\n\nThe game feels faster than the first for me, maybe because of the sense of urgency in the plot that doesn't give a lot of room to breathe, but don't let that fool you, though there may be less \"official\" grace periods, you still have plenty of time to finish every quest and simply explore the world. Personally I was just so engulfed by the story that I really felt it was a rush against time and blazed my way through the game because I wanted a happy resolution ASAP. Eagerly looking forward for my replay as I'll surely take it slow next time around. I hope XSEED works on the Third Chapter, having things end here might just give me blue-rpg-balls.\n\nIf you need any more opinions about the game, just ask the NPCS, I'm sure they'll give you a piece of their individual minds.", "timestamp_created": 1448421152, "timestamp_updated": 1448530994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663710", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19259773": {"recommendationid": "19259773", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996725300", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446185704}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally, after all of the wait had come to fruition, the continuation of the story for Trails in the sky is here, packed with new great characters and the best music (in my opinion) from Trails in the sky (silver will is love, silver will is life). \n\nThe story is one of the best I have had in recent years, and I am glad that I bought both the first chapter and this, the difficulty is no joke either as nightmare mode had wiped out my characters more often than not when I made mistakes.

I recommend this game to every JRPG fan....unless you REALLY hate text. This game has a lot of dialogues, it always flow exceptionally well but If you don't like text, go see some gameplay footage before buying the game. The dialogues are always good to read, they're never meaningless and are very well written. They make you laugh and sometimes you feel the need to shed a tear. \n\nThis game focus heavily on story and character development but even if you're not interested in theses you may find Trails in the sky sc to be one of your favorite games thanks to it's gameplay. I think the trails's series gameplay is awesome. This game use the same battle system than the first chapter and makes it even better. The heavier emphasis on crafts (rather than arts) makes regular battles faster. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Trails in the sky's battle system, it's a turn by turn battle system that takes place on a field in which you can move your characters. You have to consider both you positioning and the time bar that indicates when comes your turn to succeed. It's a solid system that requires the use of careful planning. Don't worry tough, the game's difficulty is well balanced and if you found it too hard or too easy, you can always change the game's difficulty settings. \n\nI recommend anyone who haven't played the first game to play it before playing this one as sc's story begin the day after fc's ending. I won't spoil the first game just in case. I don't think anyone ever disliked Trails in the sky's story. It is at worst good. I personally think the story is amazing. Far better than theses confusing and complicated stories that makes no sense. If you're expecting a revolutionary story, you're at the wrong place. Trails in the sky's story is simple yet excellent and it's better that way. The game have some really good plot twists and the way the story is presented to you makes it even better. If you're a fan of good stories, this is a must have and I'm sure the story will please you and you'll end up thinking like me that this story could only be surpassed by the trails games to come.\n\nStory and gameplay are top-notch but sometimes, you need you take a break from all that non-stop greatness. It's at theses time that you can fish, take a look at the casino or take on some sides quests and there are a LOT of side quests. If you're tired of side quests, you can read the in-game news or read an in-game novel. Yes there are in-game novels and they are very good. What you'd expect from Trails in the sky. There are three sets of books in sc (don't forget to check out the embassies). One of theses sets is only obtainable by talking to npcs. What!! Talking to npcs? That's boring! may be what you're thinking right now but worry not. Talking to npcs IS fun in this game. They each have their own stories. Not always relevant to the main plot and the writing in this game make dialogues flow very well. This game should serve as a model for JRPGs to come. Hopefully, it will sell well and the future installments will be localized. There is one thing that I forgot to mention higher and this may be what will make you like the game the most, The soundtrack. It's a Falcom game! Do I need to say anymore? In case I do, In my opinion, this game has one of the best soundtracks ever created. I particularly like fateful confrontation and silver will which sound greater than ever when they play in-game. This game is a masterpiece that will keep you occupied for at least 60 hours and there's a new game plus option. In case you were wondering about replayability. You can choose between numerous characters to make a party of four. Each of them having different dialogue. You also have a choice to make early on between two characters that will accompany you during half the game.    \n\nIf you haven't played the first game, I urge you to go play it. If you have played the first game and still aren't sure whether or not to buy this one then you should know that this game practically take everything FC did and makes it better. If you liked this game than you should try to play the other game of the series At the date I'm writing this, the only games available to us non-Japanese speakers are The Trails in the sky duology(Yes, I did say duology. The 3rd chapter is more like a bridge to future games and isn't needed to finish the trails in the sky duology).

I agree with the other reviews, this is likely one of the better JRPG's on Steam, if not the absolute best right now. \n\nPros:\nThe plot totally delivers. \nThe soundtrack is reminiscent of the first game, but there's enough variety and nostalgia that you'll still feel right at home. \nThe game picks up basically right where the first game left off. \n\nCons: \n Uhh...the third one's not out yet? \n\nTips since I just finished the game (no spoilers, I promise)\n1. Play the first game first. (Come on, do I really have to say this?)\n2. Some characters are better at some 'roles' than others. Be sure to check the color of the lines on the orbal screen to get a better idea. \n3.  Be thorough, talk to everyone -twice- if you're looking for a complete experience. XSEED did a heck of a job with all the dialogue, i'm baffled by the amount of text and time put in this game's development. \n4. You will never ever ever have enough Sepith. \n5. Beware of secret quests. Like the first game, these exist too. \n6. Anything you have to spare, will be all you can spare if you're looking for a repeat experience. Depending on how it's done, at least. \n\nBest of luck out there, fellow bracers.", "timestamp_created": 1447392431, "timestamp_updated": 1447392431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0,

shadows cast by the staff\u2014when the staff disappears with its light, what becomes of these shadows? Trails in the Sky Second Chapter completes this metaphor absolutely. Trails in the Sky 3rd, a bridge installment in the series, answers lingering questions for details/characters from FC and SC, but the most important conflicts and holes resolve by the end of SC, a massive Japanese adventure wargame. It's no coincidence that, going by interpretations of the Japanese name for this franchise (\"Kiseki\"), Trails in the Sky also means Miracle in the Sky. Falcom, back in the mid-2000s when they were juggling games like Ys Origin, Gurumin, and Xanadu Next within a tight schedule, released SC to finish a JRPG epic of local scale, one they needed to make when FC proved too little. XSEED's localization of this game, meanwhile,  approaches the miraculous, augmenting it with PC-exclusive improvements even long-time Kiseki fans in East Asia have been wanting. The only caution I must offer to series neophytes: try playing through FC before tackling SC (at worst you can read/watch an LP for the story). Much of SC's hidden story depth depends on you making connections with events and characters revealed in the prequel, and playing FC makes the process of learning all this more satisfying.\n\nI'll be direct about SC's flaws: accessibility + quality-of-life features are in limited supply, and new, non-East Asian players accustomed to refined menu systems could have a rough time playing SC (and FC to a lesser extent). Sara, the programmer for the Steam/GOG PC version, did a great job making SC's launch smoother compared with FC's, but perhaps it would have taken much too long to fix how you switch playable characters' equipment when in Camp mode. At every point in SC where you have too many characters to fit into your 4-member battle set-up, you need to manually reset party formation just so you can access non-party-mandatory characters' items and Orbments (personal instruments needed for casting magic/having stat bonuses during battle). This becomes tedious later on when your full party reaches 10 members and beyond. Falcom could have let you switch between every character instantaneously when at HQ areas! Then comparing equipment between characters and specializing your immediate party would be easier and faster, something that feels protracted in the final chapter but also earlier. I'll say the same for SC not giving you an Orbment Quartz to increase your in-game running speed. The reasons Falcom gives in-game for you not having fast travel are fine, but not providing a means of fast-ish travel when you want it is disappointing. Also, few if any of the in-game animations can be skipped, which drags out playtime more than necessary.\n\nThe writing style in this game is predominantly like that of a play, where telling, not showing per se, is critical. I personally love the dialogue in FC and SC, as there's plenty of nuance to conversations and internal monologue for main characters. But more than a few characters wait around during the story for the right time and place to reveal more about themselves, which can seem evasive on the scenario writers' part. The gambit here is that Liberl is so multi-faceted that much of the kingdom and its characters needs description, then mystery. At no point did I ever LOL at the story Falcom's written here\u2014I laughed with it for most of my playthrough, rarely feeling coddled. Other JRPGs would handle MCs and non-player characters like Joshua and Mirano in a ham-fisted manner. The level of emotional contrast and development of character relationships in SC is complex, yet never for complexity's sake. When death finally comes, it's only after you've gotten to know these characters so well, almost as if you were there in person alongside Estelle. All the while comedy in Trails in the Sky has both levity that stands out and implications of despair, landmines which bomb you into thinking deeply about what you've read. Those expecting darkness akin to stories like Berserk or Watchmen aren't going to find that here, but SC, within its trope and genre confines, runs a roller-coaster spectrum of introspection and plot twists bound to entertain and affirm its central theme of mutual redemption under powerful skies.\n\nDungeons in this game aren't strong, though I can't say they're awful. Chapter 7 illustrates this by having a few new dungeons, half of which smartly adapt their region's characteristics into cool areas to explore, the other half being easy dull corridors. What is clever, though, is the final chapter remixing FC's last dungeon's concept, and that's not the only standout. There's generally a sense of history to dungeons both old and new in this game, which is essential.\n\nSC isn't a hard game, though unlike FC it's not easy-ish. Having a battle system where you can view, then manipulate turn order using stat buffs/de-buffs, the Move command, and effects like Faint and AT Delay makes for dynamic fights even against mob enemies in dungeons and on the overworld. There's more than a few challenging monsters to exterminate as a member of the Bracer Guild, and many ways you can beat the game using different party members. On top of the non-linearity found here, you're still a licensed vigilante after everything that happened in FC, so fulfilling side-quests is a helpful duty. You're encouraged to get as many Bracer Points in each chapter so you can earn items from the Guild, and the side-quests in this game are genuinely fun, developing many NPCs in detail other genre examples reserve only for plot-relevant individuals. Such a mix of battling mobs in new areas, doing exterminations for the Guild, fighting off members of the Society and their peons, and ultimately making a huge difference in the lives of Liberl's citizens helps you embody the game's heroes and their struggles. Chapter 8 has all of the above, in fact, yet still manages to avoid being formulaic due to things I cannot spoil. Formulas definitely persist throughout SC, particularly the monster-of-the-week plot structure defining the chapters between the prologue and your return to the Bose region\u2014I don't think being a little predictable in that sense hurts SC, making but a mere nick.\n\nThose ragging on graphics might be ignoring Falcom's great art-style and world design here; same goes for elevating SC's music at FC's expense when both clearly play to strengths needed for their stories. SC's OST introduces many new context themes for cinema scenes, dialogues, and boss fights which heighten the adrenaline and gravity of so many plot and exploration sequences. Once again the series leitmotifs are in play, constantly renewing in the face of complacency just like the dramatis personae. I won't hesitate to proclaim the game's score as era-defining for the developers, though Ys Origin's music is more familiar over here. The graphics have aged, especially whenever you visits areas where backgrounds are large 2D backdrops meant to evoke space without crushing (presumably) under-powered PCs Japanese players used in 2006, but the Tetracyclic Towers and other places still impress. Monster designs here are underrated, ranging from benign to alien often even in earlier parts of the game; Art and Craft animations, though slow (and which can't be skipped, argh), are superb to watch, especially when you've just decimated an entire battle's worth of foes. Bugs aside, the optimized performance and engine scaling means anyone can enjoy SC the way they wish on most PCs, even toasters. Falcom, using their limited resources, did their best to invest reused content from FC with new dungeons/areas and even a few dramatic changes to centers like Rolent and Grancel. You'll be investigating every nook and cranny of Liberl in SC, such that each vista's implanted in memory.\n\nSC is honest, reverent Japanese-made video gaming, deserving its place in the limelight.", "timestamp_created": 1447322444, "timestamp_updated": 1447322660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683216", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19022240": {"recommendationid": "19022240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051804975", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449635380}, "language": "english", "review": "It's quite simple.\n\nIf (LegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSkyFC.played){\n if(LegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSkyFC.enjoyed){\n   LegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSkySC.buy();\n }\n}else LegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSkyFC.lookInto()\n\nEDIT: fixed code to look nicer", "timestamp_created": 1447281347, "timestamp_updated": 1459797954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 48, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485604", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19017349": {"recommendationid": "19017349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030754758", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459533738}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a masterpiece. If you played the first chapter of the series and liked it, then be assured that this sequel fulfills all expectations you could have and most likely even surpasses them. If you did not play the first chapter, then I strongly recommend you to try it out. Otherwise you might miss one of the greatest JRPGs ever, rivaling the best titles of the Final Fantasy series. And that is a statement I do not make lightly.\n\nStrong Points:\n- captivating story and well-crafted characters\n- effective and highly strategic turn-based combat system\n- beautiful soundtrack\n- good mix between the typical linear progression for JRPGs and a multitude of sidequests at almost every stage in the story\n- flawless localisation that succeeds in preserving a lot of the humour in dialogue and character interaction\n- the 'hard' difficulty is actually hard but not frustrating (though I can very much imagine that the 'nightmare' difficulty might be) \n\nWeak Points:\n- dated graphics (although I think they are used effectively and do not take away from the experience)\n- very formulaic in its execution of the JRPG genre; many things feel like one has seen them before which makes the game sometimes rather predictable (however, there are some quite well-executed plot twists)\n- the world itself is reused in many places from the first chapter; while it is nice to meet places and people again I could understand if this aspect would bore some players\n\nSo all in all, while the Second Chapter of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky does not reinvent the genre and mostly walks along familiar paths, it does so astonishingly well.

It's hard to review something you like as opposed to something you dislike, so I'm going to do my best to not sound biased.\n\nI'm gonna start with the bad:\n\nFirst off, the Heaven's Eye Quartz is bugged.  It does not have it's secondary 'radar' function, which can be irritating until you get a Quartz that can replicate the second function.\n\nSecond,  this game has some fairly easily done exploits that make mass enemy destruction easy, removing from the intended tactical portion of combat.  And even then, some of the pre-existing encounters can feel sloppy at times, requiring these exploits to survive.\n\n\nWith that out of the way....\n\nSecond Chapter is a lot better than first chapter was, and it gets started a lot faster.  I refuse to spoil first chapter here, but Estelle's goal isn't to save the world or anything lofty like that (at first), but a more personal goal, which helps make the plot something that can be related to.  And as the story develops, the world around you (That is, the Kingdom of Liberl and it's neighboring countries) get ever moreso fleshed out, with every NPC having something unique to say, sometimes changing what they say midway through a chapter.  While the plot is very trope-y, it's how it is written that makes it such a joy to play through.  The player characters, while having their defining traits, have multiple layers to their personalities that prevent them from being one-note characters, a problem that is alarmingly frequent in most games released these days.\n\nMoving onto the actual gameplay, there's a ton of sidequests to do, involving tasks ranging from slaying monsters that block roads, to finding missing people and stolen items.  Some of these sidequests help flesh characters out and help build the world around the player characters, while some are just for money.  100% Completion can be quite a task, and it'll take more than one playthrough without a guide to achieve it.  As for the combat, discounting the flaws above, is fun and tactical, requiring the player to understand and manipulate enemy positioning and turn order to eke out a victory.\n\nAdding a layer of depth to the system is the Arts system, requiring the player to slot quartz into one of seven slots on their character's Orbment, which can be best described as a device that creates magic from technology.  Now, while this might sound like FFVII's Materia System, it is in fact it's own beast.  The initial placement of quartz provides stat boosts and penalties, but creating a certain combination across the same line gives you increasingly better spells based on the total Elemental Value of the different quartz on the same line.  There's an in game list of spells and EV requirements, so you will not need a guide.  Fortunately, the lines are easier to read than they were in first chapter, with them being more easily marked on your orbment.\n\nNow, the real star of the show (for me at least) is the music, which is leaps and bounds above the already impressive first chapter, with songs like Silver Will and it's arrangements especially standing out, with special mention to the calming world map theme.  The new battle theme is also more fiting than Sophisticated Fight in the first game, and the mid boss theme and boss theme's feeling more fitting and more pleasing to the ears as well.  The soundtrack is actually available on Amazon, and I reccomend picking it up sometime.  I also hope XSEED gets permission to sell it on Steam as well.\n\nIn closing, Trails in the Sky SC is a wonderful experience so far, and I am looking forward to the ending of this beautiful dualogy.

The land of Liberl is still a living, breathing thing, and Estelle's is not the only story that unfolds. Keeping up with NPCs and their travels and experiences keeps being fun, and there are many mentions of past exploits, and if you did extremely well in the first game, a carry-over save bonus is going to be rather neat.\n\nNow, it's not wrong to say that SC is \"more of the same\" compared to FC, but that's not a bad thing, oh not at all - in fact, they were supposed to be a single game in the first place...but then the project kind of got too big to handle. Just for reference, playing through both, I put 150+ hours into it (maybe minus 5-10 thanks to reloads and distractions). Thanks to that, however, many things I would say about SC are already covered in my aforementioned review of FC. Go read that for more info.\n\nThe protagonist dynamic, however, has changed. While the first game had us guide both Estelle and Joshua through a story that was bigger than themselves, this one is Estelle's show, this time it's personal, and her growth as a character is simply wonderful to follow. And yet even so, things happen on a larger scale, many other characters could be heroes of this same story if it was told from their perspective. \n\nA nice refresher from the common JRPG problem of static and homogenous world being driven purely by the actions of the protagonist - quite the opposite, a huge national crisis in the kingdom of Liberl has the population, both civilian and uniformed, act realistically (as in, there sure are *some* people who talk of doom and gloom, while others ponder more immediate practical concerns), and even an international response to the affair will occur. Estelle herself also brings a nice refresher with a protagonist that's not a cynical, brooding bishonen type with lots of emotional baggage - even managing to help snap Joshua out of it somehow.\n\nThe battle system is pretty much the same as in First, arts and crafts and all; with the addition of \"chain crafts\" that lets you have several characters attack together. Limit break interrupts are still a thing, and managing the initiative order to steal turn bonuses from the enemy is still what will mean the difference between life and death (or at least \"life and a distinctly more battered and bloodied life\"). Good luck beating the later bosses without a sound tactical plan.\n\nThe Nihon Falcom musical team brings back some awesome tracks from FC and adds some awesome new tracks (my favorite being a certain very dynamic boss theme), but Falcom games having good music is nothing new. Even so, \"Silver Will\" must be one of the best soundtracks ever created.\n\nFinal judgment: Highly recommended, but whatever you do, *don't* start playing this one before you finish the first game.\n\nPS: Oh, there's also a fishing minigame now.\n\nPPS: Sieg is one seriously overpowered bird.\n\nPPPS: Thanks to the story, I had to nominate this for \"Whoaaaaa, dude\"", "timestamp_created": 1447089607, "timestamp_updated": 1479941050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18970590": {"recommendationid": "18970590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147801248", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447857439}, "language": "english", "review": "Four and a half years is a long time to wait for a game, I think, but it seems I haven't outgrown this game yet, despite I've outgrown most jRPGs (and most games) in general in this time period.

The last game's ending still impacted me even now, and Joshua and Estelle's love story is one of the few that I adore coming from a video game. But I also enjoyed as much, in this one, of Estelle finding Joshua, but more importantly, finding her own. She grew up a lot, I think, and she became one of the best female protag I've seen in a jRPG, period. She's funny, she's witty, she's sarcastic, she's strong yet vulnerable. I've never adored another female protag the way I adore her. The way Estelle grew up throughout the game is incredible.\n\nThe country of Liberl remains just as immersive, and despite exploring the same cities over again, it does not feel old. If anything, I feel a little relief, because the first time playing FC I had felt a little - overwhelmed - at certain towns where it almost feels too real - too many NPCs who are genuine interesting.

Every aspect of this game is incredibly well-executed: the story is one of the most memorable I have come across, the battle system is fine-tuned and engaging, and the music is immaculate, correctly setting the appropriate tone for each situation in the game.\n\nHowever, most JRPGs (and games in general) have the qualities previously stated. What really makes this game stand out from the others is its attention to detail on the more minor aspects of the game. For one, most characters (including non-playable characters) have their own backstory. Even though these may be unrelated to the game\u2019s main plot, it is always interesting, and sometimes shocking, to hear about these and what shaped these characters\u2019 identities in the time setting of the game.\n\nAs this game is a direct sequel from the its predecessor, [i]The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky[/i], many features and mechanics were carried over into this game with some small adjustments made here and there. Chain Crafts were introduced to provide a new option to players deciding on the best way to take on an engagement. Orbments and Arts have been slightly \u201crebalanced\u201d in such a way that the player really has to think about whether they want better attributes or new Arts to use in battle. Additionally, there is a decent amount of choice between what equipment to choose for each character. In the first game, newly discovered equipment generally offered better overall attributes. However, this game allows you to choose between improved defense, attributes to make your character better at Arts, or attributes to make your character more agile. Though this detail is rather moderate, it goes a long way to provide the player with more character customization.\n\nAll of this is what makes [i]The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC[/i] such a wonderful game to play through as well as a better game than its predecessor. I thank you XSEED for taking their precious time localizing this and cannot wait to play the next localized installment in [i]The Legend of Heroes[/i] series which, at the time of writing this review, would be [i]The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1447044123, "timestamp_updated": 1447044187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18963794": {"recommendationid": "18963794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098412849", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476146250}, "language": "english", "review": "Super arrange version of Gin no Ishi (Silver WIll) worth the price of admission alone.\n\nSecond chapter (SC) is a great continuation from the first one, starts hours after the events of the first game and goes with it.

It feels more like the \"do it yourself RPG Kit\" ... it\u00b4s nothing you\u00b4ve never seen before, but nevetheless - Falcom and XSeed with their localization still manage it to make you play further on - you\u00b4ll still want to know how the story will develop any further and how the individual paths of your (possible) party members will turn out. In my case, thats something no game since DAO has archieved.\n\nThe gameplay is rock solid and fun to play - combat is strategic and deep enough, to keep you busy with various Quartz / Magic combinations but at the same time it\u00b4s easy and understandable enough for not to overburden you - in my opinion it\u00b4s simply almost the perfect mix.\n\nOne last point: in this game you\u00b4ll read. You\u00b4ll read LOTS. I\u00b4d probably even say, this game (as well as FC) is almost as much a VN as it is an RPG. XSeed managed it to localize and write it in a way, which is easy-going and fun to read (at least for me, as an vivid reader) and at the same time, it won\u00b4t overburden people not native in the english language, as myself, for example. So, once more, i\u00b4d like to tip my hat to XSeed for granting us a game which must have been one hell-of-a-struggle to translate and localize. Please keep going like that, your work on these two games as well on the others you\u00b4ve published, is very very appreciated.\n\nOkay - last but not least - Recommendation or not ?\n\nWell ... for people like myself, who already \"devoured\" FC I don\u00b4t think I have to recommend it, do I ? But what about other players, perhaps even those never to have laid hands on a JRPG ? If you like classical RPGs, like Baldurs Gate or Albion ...

There is no grind in this game to speak of, basically.

If you played FC and you're wondering if SC is any better, let me tell you: it is, in every way you can imagine. Trails in the Sky: The 3rd, the next game in this series, has its own story and Estelle and Joshua aren't even the main characters in it. The 3rd will likely be localized in the future, but even if it isn't, rest assured that SC delivers a satisfying conclusion.\n\nIf you haven't played any Trails games before, here's an overview of why you should direct your attention to FC and SC.\n\nAs most fans of Trails in the Sky will tell you, these games do an excellent job of world building. You'll learn plenty about the Zemurian continent and its regions and citizens just by following the story. What really sets this series apart from most JRPGs is that if you like the fictional setting and want to learn more about it, there is a lot of optional reading that you can indulge in at your own leisure. There are over 500 portraitless NPCs, each with their own side-story, and their dialogue will change after every story event. There's also a plethora of optional but entertaining side quests that further flesh out characters and locations, and even short novels that you can read. NPCs that you helped in the first game will remember you if you carry over your save file, which I thought was a nice touch. The in-game universe feels well built and ever-changing, and the result is a story that flows logically. With everything being so well planned, there is no room for deus ex machinas, and plenty of room for masterful foreshadowing.\n\nThese games have a lot of text so sometimes you'll feel like you're reading a book rather than playing a game. Luckily, the English translation is wonderful. The dialogue is brimming with personality, helping to make even the least important characters feel somewhat memorable. The visuals, as you've probably seen, are dated but not awful by any means. What the series lacks in eye candy, it makes up for in other areas. In terms of music, FC's soundtrack is good, but SC's soundtrack is amazing, greeting you with one of the best piano pieces right at the title screen, and sending you off with one of the best final boss themes ever composed. The battle system isn't groundbreaking but it is refreshing. Each character can be equipped with \"quartz\"; different quartz combinations will grant you different magic, which the game refers to as \"arts\", and they consume (EP - energy points). There are also \"crafts\", which are skills unique to each character, and they use craft points (CP). Whenever you attack or receive damage, you will recover CP, and filling the CP gauge grants you access powerful turn-interrupting moves called S-crafts (which are also unique for each character) at the click of a mouse. SC differs adds new arts and crafts (heh), as well as chain crafts: combo attacks that can deal serious damage when abused. The turn order and turn bonuses are displayed on the left side of the screen, and unlike the usual turn-based game, manipulation of delay to take the turn bonuses for yourself adds an extra layer of strategy to the combat.\n\nTrails in the Sky isn't the most original series, and its story isn't full of plot twists, so you shouldn't come into it expecting a mind blowing story. What this series offers is something that I feel a lot of JRPGs today lack: a coherent plot with a few well placed plot twists and excellent use of foreshadowing + layered, realistic, and developed characters, all wrapped up in a cozy setting that's rich with lore. Depending on how fast you read, FC takes about 30-45 hours to beat and SC takes about 50-70 hours. Double that if you're going to talk to everyone and do all the side quests (which you will need a guide for, since this series is notorious for missables). With the NG+ feature and difficulty settings, these games are designed to be replayed and you have no obligation to be a completionist the first time around. You also get 999 save slots in FC and SC, which you can take advantage of to revisit pretty much any point in the story.\n\nThese games makes me feel like a kid again while somehow meeting and even surpassing the high standards I've developed from 18 or so years of video gaming.

I finished the game today and loved it enough to immediately want to write a review, but... frankly, I can't find the words. Let's start with the ending, perhaps: this is by far the best JRPG on Steam, and one of the best of all time.\n\nWith that aside, let's gets down to business: this game is a direct sequel to another game on Steam entitled simply \"The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky\". You should absolutely not play this game if you haven't played the previous title first, because this game is an incredibly direct sequel to it. That game, henceforth \"FC\" (for \"First Chapter\"), should prove to be a pretty decisive litmus test determining whether or not you'll like this game -- and if you're on the fence, know that SC has everything FC did well and more.\n\nAs you should know from FC, there are a few things that will either make or break the game for a lot of people:\n-This is a turn-based game\n-This is a game from the mid-2000s\n-This game heavily involves anime-like aesthetics in its character and world design\n\nAnd if any of those things turned you off, SC won't really change them. If you're fine with all three of those things, though, then you're in for a real treat. SC is basically the perfect sequel to FC, expertly answering many questions FC asked and resolving a great number of personal conflicts, taking great pain to give character even to those who previously had little. The orbment system is drastically refined for the better, and while combat is largely the same, the greater focus on crafts makes it feel significantly more strategic. The game as a whole feels more challenging than FC even from the outset, but never to the point where it feels unfair -- at least, on Normal mode -- so that extra bit of strategy is necessary. Even the artwork is nicer and crisper than anything from FC, and the soundtrack is just as excellent as you'd expect from Nihon Falcom. And, of course, the localization -- the part that took four years, you might remember -- is just as high-quality as the excellence that was this game's predecessor, worth every second of effort XSEED and others put into it.\n\nTo those who find no issue with the three points above, this game might well be one of the best things you ever play. In all my hours of playing the game (66, and not even on a completionist run), I only had two trivial issues: a somewhat slow prologue and enemies that feel a touch too bulky at two specific points in the game. Both of these things are fairly transient and do little to diminish the game's overall quality, which shines through at almost every other point.\n\nThis game's predecessor released in English over four years ago. Ever since then, I've been waiting patiently for this title. Four years of hype, four years of expectations... and I'm the sort of person too prone to disappointment to ever get hyped for anything anymore. And with this game finished, it would be an understatement to say that I'm not disappointed. Every expectation I had was met, every bit of hype I had was exceeded, and this game will likely end up being one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had. If you're reading this, you had the luxury of not waiting that long -- and you'll likely find the game even better for it.\n\nI give this game no less than the highest recommendation I possibly can. This game is the culmination of practically a decade of work between Nihon Falcom's development and XSEED's localization; I thank both of them, from the bottom of my heart, for the many wonderful hours I spent playing the game.

The game goes on a much grander scale in both story and battles, and does it well. You're expected to have have played First Chapter in many places and are rewarded for remembering small details.\n\nLike the first game SC has a bit of a slow start as it builds the world and backstory but really picks up and gets crazy later on.\n\nThere's some small changes to the combat system with 'chain crafts', new spells and crafts but it's still very much the same. It's sort of like a grid-based strategy RPG battle system but simplified. However there is a lot of customizability to your characters and party and many ways to approach each battle. For environments the dungeon design is good and varied, especially later on.\nUnlike a lot of JRPGs there is almost no reason to grind enemies for experience. The experience gained from battles scales massively with your level so if you bring an underleveled character to a boss it might actually gain enough XP to go above the others.\n\nA big part of what made FC great for me was that the characters had a lot of personality and the dialogue was well written. In SC a lot of characters remain effectively the same and there aren't a ton of new ones you learn to know. But especially Estelle and Joshua have a lot of character growth as you might expect. At the same time you certainly get a lot of backstory on everyone as the story progresses.\n\nThe music throughout the game is superb. Especially in the final areas of the game I was really awed by this. In my opinion it's a big part of what makes the game so good, as it's effectively switched around to set the mood.\n\nIn general the game builds on all of the things I liked about the first chapter. As for a few (mostly minor) dislikes:\n\nI expected Second Chapter to be darker toned than the first. The 'secret society' tends to follow anime tropes and hide behind mystery rather than truly seem evil or do horrible things (with some exceptions). This is a matter of taste of course. I sort of preferred the political plotting of the first game and how the society appeared very sinister there. Speaking of anime tropes, the 'saved at the last second' thing is used so many times in SC that it gets pretty silly.\n\nI think the game could've had a little less of the same kind of content as First Chapter. Things like fetch quests walking around Liberl to progress the story. A playthrough of SC can easily take 70 hours. I wouldn't have minded it being some hours shorter and having less of the same from FC.\nIn a way because of recycling many areas SC obsoletes FC content wise, which isn't necessarily a good thing. They're two halves of the same story, and the first half should still be fun to revisit after playing SC.\n\nThe battle system is fun, but like First Chapter normal difficulty doesn't have many challenging encounters if you use all the tools at your disposal. While it's easy to make your own challenges by setting limitations you can't be expected to know which ones work well on your first playthrough.\nThis is personal preference but being able to mindlessly beat certain bosses by repeating the same strategy draws me out of the story, so better difficulty options could make it more fun. \nHard and Nightmare difficulty don't appear balanced without a New Game+ save file. Most people seem to agree that the final prologue boss is impossible to beat without getting a lucky pattern when starting a new save. Difficulties apart from normal were unlocked after beating the game once in the PSP version so it's not intentional but still unfortunate.\n\nJust like in First Chapter all animations in battles are still unskippable and watching them makes up a lot of time in a playthrough. I didn't mind the slow pace caused by this because the game is so good overall. But I'm sure it could get annoying, especially on repeat playthroughs.\n\nIn short, if you enjoyed the first chapter this is a must buy. It's a bigger game that expands on the world and directly continues the same story bringing it to a satisfying end. The game is well paced without much filler and has an impressive endgame. The combat system is fun and tactical but on normal difficulty will not be particularly challenging for veterans of the first game. A great soundtrack brings the story and combat together nicely.\nFor people new to the series I would still recommend starting with First Chapter, since SC assumes you remember what happens there without recapping it.", "timestamp_created": 1446643528, "timestamp_updated": 1446657813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18871383": {"recommendationid": "18871383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002485084", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493872428}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the kind of game I wish I could have played as a kid, though if I did it likely would have spoiled most other JRPGs for me.

And isn't that the truth - Trails is BACK. The atmosphere hasn't changed much from the first game, and honestly, that's a great thing to see. The characters are very lighthearted & happy go lucky, despite their being a lot of bad stuff going on. It's a refreshing break from other RPGs, where cracking so much as a smile is a rarity. Trails' approach to storytelling, combined with the quality of writing and attention to detail, put it above most JRPG franchises out there. \n\nThe Bracer quests are also back, and while the ol' familiar \"X Monster needs to be eliminated\" request, there's also plenty of new & unique sidequests to go on. It's pretty amazing how varied the dozens upon dozens of quests are, but if you see one you don't like, you needn't worry about missing out on the rewards because the game is generous enough to give you what's required to get by well with just picking the ones you fancy (personally, I try to do them all).\n\nA lot of music from the original game has popped back up without so much as an alternate mix, which is somewhat disappointing, honestly. I do like the soundtrack to the original game, and while I do like the new additions made in SC, I feel the original pieces could've done with a bit of oomph to help them stand out, y'know?\n\nOne thing I will say though is that you definitely want to play FC before jumping into SC. Not only will EVERYTHING make a lot more sense, but you can effortlessly carry over some of your choices & interactions from the first game into SC, which will make the experience both more personal & enjoyable.\n\nJust like FC before it, I recommend Trails in the Sky SC 110%.

Only a awesome, homely and delicious cookie. Maybe not the best cookie ever made, but good enough that you made another 10 and ate them all in the weekend whilst the galaxy bar is still in your chocolate stash.\n\nMain Review:\nIf you loved first chapter, then you will probably love this game. Playing FC is recommended, especially if your a completionist however I played FC years ago on a psp and so I went into this without a max BP cleared FC save and the bonuses you miss are really non-consequential (you miss a item drop increase quartz, a heal/haze combine quartz and a rare accessory) and you miss the continuation of certain miniquests). \n\nPros: \nThe new combined attacks and the upgraded quartz system really make both preparing for battles and playing battles more interesting. I always felt that FC felt skimp on the number of artes and abilities. SC doesn't have this problem, as with plenty of new characters and the upgraded quartz slots give you a huge amount of customization. \nI have always loved the music from this series. It is nostalgic but has a touch of sutble change, as it is a new OST compared to FC. Obviously you will recognise versions of silver will etc... but there are also some fantastic new themes as well. Go check out the Super Arranges of many of the theme tunes on youtube, they are superb. \nThis game is absolutely charming. I've played 4 final fantasies, 2 tales of, radiant historia and more (you get the gist), but the game that sticks close to my heart is this series. Why? The script is just overflowing with personality. All the characters in the game mature and develop, even if it takes its bloody time. Even though I hate cliches, somehow I never get annoyed or bored of the cliches or the characters that occur in this game. It has some great and memorable scenes, and doesn't pull plot devices out of its \u2665\u2665\u2665. \nYou can only have a party of 4, yet every single character has unique dialogue for every single event. It is quite an achievement. Additionally you can really feel the world the developers were trying to create. As events occur, the NPCs in the game react LIKE REAL PEOPLE. Earthquake? All the towns people are concerned about it. Mayor elections? All the NPCs are talking about it, telling you who they support. There are even NPCs advertising the candidates. After almost every single major plot progression you can walk through the whole town and find that the scripts for NPCs has changed in practically all the towns to reflect the change in events. All the NPCs remember your aultristic acts and respond in kind. It is apparent that this game was made with love and a crazy amount of attention to detail. \n\nMixed (i.e. can be a pro or a con depending on what you are like):\nThis game is a completionist nightmare (or haven). Tons of optional sidequests with pretty narrow completion time limits. Tons of choices that if you chose wrong you will not get the full BP. Lots of treasure and secret rewards. Personally I loved it. \nMight be too much story. Its like reading a visual novel, which is a plus to some and a negative to others. To put it into perspective the lord of the rings trilogy has 455,125 words. This one game has 716,401 words. That's over 3 million characters. This is a long game. \nAdditional difficulties and new game+ add an element of replay value, but once you complete it you probably aren't going to play it again (unless you have another 80 hours to spare...)\n\nCons: \nIt is a dated game, which is evident by its graphics. Personally I think the graphics are charming though. \nBattle system can get a bit dry sometimes. This is a problem with all rpgs though, not just specific to SC. \nGame needs a scene skip function, particularly for the early game. \nThe start of the game when you REALLY want to know what happened to Joshua etc is really slow... it actually takes a huge amount of time to get the plot properly rolling and you will go through a huge amount of sideplot.\nA decent amount of backtracking occurs in this game as the events take place in the same areas as FC. So if you have played FC then you might find that annoying.\n\nTips: talk to everyone, sometimes more than once, unequip your side characters before main events (often you are forced to used other characters and then realize all of you good equipment was equiped on a character that has disappeared. For example, before the chapter 3 boss fight because I forgot to unequip all my characters, I went through 3 boss battles with suboptimal gear and quartz. It really made a difference, and I was forced to use a ton of items. \n\nOverall review: if you are a hot headed gamer who just likes to blow things up... this might not be the game for you. If you are patient, do not need instant gratification, appreciate character development, a good plot and needing to think for your fights then this game is one of the most rewarding games you will ever play.

Before playing FC my favorite RPG series was Fire Emblem. I love the Fire Emblem series for the huge amount of character interaction, the great gameplay, great music, great stories, extremely charming graphics/animations/art styles, and amazing replay value. In my opinon those features are what make RPGs the best video game genre. \n\nTrails in the sky FC alone bests Fire Emblem in most of those aspects and is equal in art style and gameplay. Obviously two very different games but speaking in over all RPG experience. Add the Second Chapter (which picks up mere hours after FC's story making it basically the same game) and there is no longer any room for comparison. There is just too much (good meaty) content in Trails in the sky for any other RPG to compare. There are 13 games in the Fire emblem series and I believe there is more content in just these 2 games.\n\nIf you plan on trying out FC just prepare to sit back and read for hours on end. These games are mostly reading, they are RPGs after all. Don't go in expecting action packed gameplay or amazing AAA graphics. You are going to read, explore, talk to 100s of unique NPCs who all have something to say, read, do sidequests that have their own little storylines, read, and sometimes play through some satisfying turnbased combat (which in my opinon is on par with the fire emblem games)\n\nAlso Hard mode in SC is very challenging and really forces you to utilize the items/skills at your disposal immediately after the tutorial. If you are looking for a challenge then SC delivers. You can also choose Hard for FC as well although I haven't tried FC on hard.", "timestamp_created": 1446385602, "timestamp_updated": 1446588328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572941", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18811615": {"recommendationid": "18811615", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987112572", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497109889}, "language": "english", "review": "putin loves dildo", "timestamp_created": 1446371404, "timestamp_updated": 1446371404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482759", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18810147": {"recommendationid": "18810147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050537674", "num_games_owned": 1783, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 9205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486336206}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been waiting on this patiently.

Yes, you can technically buy it on its own, but the game picks up right where Trails FC left off and you're gunna be pretty damn lost if you jump into this right away.\n\nThis game is VERY TEXT HEAVY.  VERY.  Try to find the picture of the scripts for the Trails in the Sky trilogy sometime; Trails SC is longer than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (so says Kotaku) in terms of raw text.  This means lots of cutscenes, lots of sidequests with lengthy chats, and NPCs with walls of text unto themselves.  Technically this is a selling point, but for some it's a killer.\n\n2006.  The original release date for this game was in flipping 2006.  At a time when Japan barely cared about PC gaming.  If you can't stand old games, or indies that style themselves after old games, you're gunna have a bad time.  Also, Anime asethetic, but the promo art should've made that clear already.\n\nThe interface is kinda clunky.  It's either arrow keys + ZXCV + Enter, or you can do it entirely with your mouse; you can also use a gamepad, but that produces the same result as arrows + ZXCV (I've played the PSP version on a Vita).  You should probably remember to use ESC for any KBM control set, too.\n\nThe problem with arrows + hotkeys is that, even with the PSP version, navigating the menus you inevitably have to handle requires a ton of keystrokes for simple things, especially equipment and consumable usage (so many flipping consumables).  In larger fights this can sometimes mean cycling through every unit to pick the right target.  If you're a programmer, leme put it this way: your single-action algorithm is O(n^2).\n\nThe problem with using mouse controls is that a lot of things like to move around.  Your cursor frequently warps when you open menus, and the combat camera repeatedly zooms in and out, constantly altering your cursor position and making it hard to play with speed and precision.  The cursor warping can be convenient for some things, like quickly moving through the Save/Load menus, but at other times it'll arbitrarily close menus because you didn't move your mouse at a perfect horizontal.\n\nCombat is actually a pretty significant debate among Trails fans, with most opinions ranging from \"rather bad\" to \"pretty decent.\"  I haven't personally found anyone who thinks the combat is \"actually good/great,\" and if they exist they're fairly few in number.  All I'm going to say here is this: turn-based, initiative system, tile movement, plain flat boxes for combat arenas.\n\nTL:DR\n\nOld game with clunky controls and walls of text.  If you're looking for the reasons why you SHOULD buy this game, there are a billion other reviews for that.  I'm just here to provide the counterpoints.\n\nEDIT:\n\nYes, this is a heavily unbalanced review.  Thing is, going through the \"most useful\" reviews, they're ALL heavily unbalanced in FAVOUR of the game, with no consideration given to people who aren't in the target audience for Trails.\n\nTrails is not a perfect game.  Don't try to pretend it is.  I'll suck this game's shlong any day of the week if you want me to, but people need to be informed about the things that they won't enjoy, and the current \"front page\" as it were completely fails at that.", "timestamp_created": 1446335660, "timestamp_updated": 1446513485, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 108, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.369221", "comment_count": "17", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18804032": {"recommendationid": "18804032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040272739", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495409343}, "language": "english", "review": "The long awaited sequel to Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky FC, SC succeeds in upping the ante in almost all forms over its predecessor. More party members, new battle actions, spells and S-Crafts (limit breaks), new quests that utilize new item systems, and of course a continuation from the jaw dropping finale of the first game. Containing new content brought over from the PSP version, as well as HD portraits and assets from the Japanese Playstation 3 version, this is arguably the most definitive version of the game next to the PS3 version which never made it out of Japan (PS3 portaits look ugly anyway, but they do get full voice acting whereas this version only has battle voices). \n\nFor those just learning about this series, Trails in the Sky is a Japanese Role Playing game series with a heavy focus on Story, characters and exploration. For this reason, it is HIGHLY advised that FC (short for First Chapter) is played before this one. Sc does not feature a catch up feature that reminds you of the events of the first game, so new players will be fairly lost, in addition to having key parts of the final act of FC spoiled for them.\n\nIf you are looking for a JRPG series with a lot of heart, a LOT of dailogue, great characters and great story, Trails in the Sky is where its at.

There's even a SC achievement for talking to a specific NPC multiple times! \n\nEven aside from the frankly remarkable amount of effort that went into integrating the two games (enough I was grateful I replayed FC a few weeks before SC's launch), the story itself is compelling, the character interactions are great, and I spent pretty much every cut scene going \"why am I not fraps'ing this????\" Even more, there's enough variation to make replay worth it as there's a choice early on if you want to travel with Schera or Agate as your primary companion (basically filling the space Joshua did in FC); I understand the main jist of the quests, main, side, and hidden, aren't changed but the interactions and dialogue do have some differences depending on your choice (for the record, the Agate path which I'm playing is great and every single interaction between Agate and Olivier is basically magic).\n\nAs far as game play, there's a lot less bugs than I would expect from a freshly launched game; especially since I remember some of the gamebreaking bugs of FC's launch. Basically the only thing that actually effects gameplay is the lack of chest phases (which I read on the forums that will be fixed in a later patch?). There's about five or six different chest phrases that seem to be on rotation, rather than individual phases of the first game. Something that's a minor disappointment but ultimately I'd rather have the game than the return of Chairman Meow.", "timestamp_created": 1446249545, "timestamp_updated": 1446377939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532847", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18779554": {"recommendationid": "18779554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081733825", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497836856}, "language": "english", "review": "Story as good as the first one\nCharacters as memorable\nFighting mechanic is actually improved on, with new moves\nWhen you hear the music, you smile\nIt recognizes your save from the first game\n\nYes, play the first chapter before this one.\nNo spoilers here, you're wondering if it's worth the price?

I used the 'moving' in my first 12h more than in the 52h of playing the first one. Somehow it felt more useful and the delay until the next attack not so huge. \nAt certain points 'moving' is the only logical move to make - to dodge an enemy's attack, get into the healing range of an AoE-heal or position yourself for your own AoE attack.\nI still have a slight problem with the mechanic of it, but then again I found it more useful.\n[*]Secondly, the introduction of a brand new - fresh out of the Central Factory - Orbment, (check back my review of FC for explanations) which enables you to use more quartz resulting in higher stats and, more importantly, more arts to play with, turns diversity in combat up a notch.\n[*]Last but not least due to your extensive training as a 'Senior Bracer' you acquire the ability to utilize a new, so-called 'Chain-Craft' which lets your party members join in an attack that grows stronger in range and damage the more combatants take part in it.\nNaturally you will also gain access to new 'normal' crafts for each bracer you get to add to your fellowship, as their levels increase.\n[*]Additionally, as I already mentioned above - you can now use certain kinds of food to hit your foes with, with different damage and varying 'target systems' (if anyone knows a better word, tell me please), meaning if it will effect a circle around your enemy, a line outgoing from the point you are standing at, etc.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Mini-Games[/h1]\nOh boy, I love minigames and they added some in this game, namely gambling and fishing.\nOf my first about 8h or so, about 1.5h were spend doing these activities.\n[list]\n[*]While gambling you can choose from a slot-machine, poker, black-jack and roulette.\nAfter exchanging some of your mira for medals, you can start in the fun of losing it to the bank again. Personally, I enjoyed poker the most (as I did not lose as hard there).\n[*]For fishing, you will need a fishing rod, bait and obviously - a place to dip your pole into. Different combinations of all these factors will result in a different game (mostly location and bait, but without the right rod and line you can't utilize higher level bait), but stay focused not to let those slippery suckers get away.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Thanks[/h1]\nOn the one hand to Nihon Falcom who developed this series and on the other one, even more so to XSeed and Carpe Fulgur for putting in all the localization work including all the extras they made for us to enjoy and the great translation.\nAlso, remember that it cost these companies a lot of blood, tears, sweat and the tiny thing that some people tend to forget - money. Well, we can't help much with all those body liquids but the latter one is something we can help them with.\nSo don't be a cheapskate, get this game - full price - so that we all may enjoy wonderful localizations of this series to come.\n\n[h1]Bugs[/h1]\nQuite a few bugs already got fixed, for those still in the game read this [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/251290/discussions/0/490124466458901304/]thread[/url] to see how bad it still is and how to fix problems if you encountered some yourself.\nPersonally, I didn't have any problems whatsoever.\n\n[h1]Note[/h1]\nAs this is a pre-review you might as well not do anything yet, since I will change the whole thing over but otherwise --\nI hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.", "timestamp_created": 1446147498, "timestamp_updated": 1511628501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810203", "comment_count": "16", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18745921": {"recommendationid": "18745921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035294703", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483076768}, "language": "english", "review": "Best JRPG on steam Sequal now has blackjack and hookers... what u waiting for buy it now", "timestamp_created": 1446140899, "timestamp_updated": 1446183439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383926", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18745492": {"recommendationid": "18745492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014851054", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452863005}, "language": "english", "review": "XSEED finally bring us the second chapter to the best JRPG on Steam.

Still, a few serious problems bear mentioning. First, the difficulty scaling is lazy. If you play on Hard or above, you come across enemies with astronomical defense who force you into tedious wars of attrition. Rather than balancing the game for each difficulty, the developers just made enemies take less damage. As a result, most boss fights last way too long and drain any excitement out of the combat. Even the tutorial fights are ridiculously stacked against the player. Another flaw is the game's apparent hatred for completionists. If you want full credit for every mission, I've got bad news: many have lame, esoteric conditions for earning the max reward. One mission, for example, deducts bracer points (BP) unless you have a certain party member who only becomes available later. If you beat the mission early (which any logical person would do to ensure it doesn't expire), you can't 100% the game. Period. There's no indication of this anywhere, so good luck playing without a FAQ handy. I could forgive a single BS mission like this, but I've already dealt with several. Talk to this random, out-of-the-way NPC to get a special item. Select the correct multiple-choice answer to a question that no player would know without a Google search. Et cetera. I understand that playing for completion is a choice, but the game shouldn't constantly screw you over for the smallest oversight. Since completionists are often those who appreciate the game most, I really can't comprehend why Falcom decided to shaft them. All in all, SC feels a lot less enjoyable than FC. I've omitted a few complaints, like recycled areas and party micro-management, because I don't know if they'll carry over to the second half.

You can feel that developers and writers put their hearts into this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1515150460, "timestamp_updated": 1515150460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593960", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39080018": {"recommendationid": "39080018", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974835387", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2136, "last_played": 1515441611}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the first one.

I'm not into writing essay reviews, so all I'll say is, after playing the first game (which is great) you should also definitely play this one, and see how the gameplay improves and see the story continue. I knew I wanted to dive into this game after the first one almost as soon as I finished it, and now that I've played it, it really is one of my most favourite JRPG's I've ever played it.

It is a direct sequel to The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky so playing that game first is a must if you wish to fully appreciate the story and not be confused as to what's going on.\n\nBoth this game and it's predecessor were at one point intended to be one single game, but seeing how insanely long the game would have been had the developers followed through with the idea it was decided that they should be split up into two chapters. As a result both are very similar when it comes to their features, namely gameplay, graphics and sound.\n\n[h1]Story & Characters[/h1]\nBeing a direct sequel Trails in the Sky SC continues the storyline of the previous game. Whereas the first game took its time presenting its world and characters to the player, the second game assumes he/she is already familiar with them and expands upon them greatly, particularly the characters, many of whom recieve some great character development over the course of the story. Although an epic story to begin with, Trails in the Sky SC goes even further than its predecessor, with the story in this game being almost twice as long as the previous one. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAs stated above the gameplay is rather similar to that of the first game. You explore many of the same locales from the previous game as well as some new areas. Quests are also handled in the same manner as before with most of them being presented to the player through the Bracer Guild notice boards, although there are quite a few more hidden quests this time. \n\nBattles are mostly the same, although you can now perform chain attacks by linking two or more characters together provided you have enough CP for the level of chain attack you wish to execute. Fishing is another new feature and allows you to catch fish in certain spots throughout the game. Not only are the different types of fish good for certain ingredients, many of them provide you with sepith, items and even some rare accessories.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThe game features the same soundtrack as its predecessor although it also includes many new tracks, most of which are great, particularly most of the new battle and boss themes. Unfortunately the main battle theme (\"Strepitoso Fight\") isn't quite as memorable as the one featured in the first game, though it's still quite catchy.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nIn my review of the first game I mentioned that I played it on Hard difficulty and that that difficulty setting added some nice challenge to the game, requiring some real thought and strategy when it came to battles (especially boss fights). In this game however I can't really recommend playing onn Hard difficulty. Trails in the Sky SC is a harder game than its predecessor, and whilst playing on Hard difficulty made battles against common enemies quite fun, I found myself retrying most of the boss fights in the game due to how cheap they were. Often I'd find the bosses to have ridiculous stats and I'd have to use the retry offset to lower the difficulty of a fight until they were no longer cheap. I still had fun playing the game, but I'd resigned myself to having to retry mostly every boss at least once or twice.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIn short The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC is the second half of the Trails in the Sky story. It looks, plays and feels like its predecessor, but is an even richer experience. It ends the story set up from first game on a great note, all the while hinting and foreshadowing some very interesting plot developments for future games in the Trails saga. Fans of the first game shouldn't miss out on it!", "timestamp_created": 1516218746, "timestamp_updated": 1516218746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

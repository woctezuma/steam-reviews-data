actually a lot of fun and for its time, was a unique twsit on the puzzle genre, correct me if I'm wrong, but this game brought the whole \"drag entire rows\" into the puzzle genre, and other popcap games or puzzle games in general (Huniepop as another example) took note of this games particular attribute\n\nThe game itself might feel a bit outdated, but for someone who grew up on these games off his brother's computer and his sisters laptop, I can tell you, these game's are not the most deep in terms of story, nore are their gameplay elements groundbreaking, but what they are is simple, unadulturated fun, basic games that are fun time wasters, easy to pick up for only 5 bucks, and awesome throwbacks to the 90s and early 2000s without purchases being completely clouded by nostalgia and suprisingly holding up well\n\n\nThese games aren't groundbreaking or revolutional, but what they did do (and still manage to do) is provide fun, that can be played in binges, or short bursts,

only way I could play the game.\nNOTE: If you can find it on mobile, I think it is probably more comfortable playing it there, but this is also good with a mouse\n\nANYWAYS:\n- It is a very relaxing matching game, but it has some twists :)\n- There are a good amount of different modes\n- Zen mode is good to play when you are bored with other games (while you think of what to do)\n- Tons of super hard IN-GAME (not Steam) achievements / trophies.\n- Love the music :)\n- NO MICROTRANSACTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1504827568, "timestamp_updated": 1504827568,

However, in the company's greed and arrogance, they neglected the needs of these modified organisms. As a result, they live a life of unending agony and suffering. The government attempted to halt the lab's twisted experiment, but the CEO refused, even going as far as hiring an elite private forces to guard the company's assets.\nPushed to its limit, the national guard sieged the biotics company's headquarters as well as the lab in which the organisms were being grown. In it's rage, the government slaughtered everyone involved; scientists, businessmen, secretaries.\nWith the company no more, the government found itself in a rough spot; who would be left to take care of the tortured mutants? In an act of mercy, many volunteers have stepped forward to help mercifully put the tormented creatures to sleep.\n\nChuzzle's main story liberally shares similar themes from classics such as Frankenstein and Jurassic Park, in regards to the costs and risks of unfettered scientiffic progress. There's also a minor sub-plot involving one of the protagonist's struggles with accepting their newfound gender identity, but I am no expert on LGBTQ+ stuff so I'll leave analysis of that specific part of the story. What I can say is that the side-plot does help in tastefully preventing the game from coming across as some kind of unnuanced \"Anti-Science\" propaganda film.\n\nAnother major theme that comes up in the story is the moral dilemma that the general popuace faces when confronted with an irredeemable evil. The two logical extremes of this dilemma are embodied by two central characters; the senate at the beginning of the story, who turn a blind eye to the dilemma for fear of getting their hands dirty and losing the much-coveted \"moral high-ground,\" and the National Guard who remorselessly murder the hundreds of people involved with the experiments.\n\nOverall, Chuzzle's story is a beautifully-written tragedy that asks the audience to truely critically think about the themes presented, which is a daring feat considering how most modern videogames aren't willing to take that kind of risk on an actually meaningful level (Except maybe Mafia III or Deus Ex, but I haven't played those games yet give me time damnit).

Version of the game you're gonna get on Steam is 1.0, however, 1.01 could be easily find on the different sources and it doesn't have same problem.

I recently searched up on Steam as to whether it offers this little bundle of joy. And well, it did.\n\nA classic drag-and-match puzzle game. There are many out there like this. But I would have to say that this one is the grandmother of them all, as far as I'm concerned. The little cute, fuzzy, multi-coloured alien-ey things just help add to the appeal. The sound effects are incredibly adorable as well. You can easily spend around an hour completing classic mode on the hardest difficulty - possibly more. So, don't try and play for a quick 5 minutes or so. It's a trap; don't do it!\n\nThere are a pretty decent amout of achievements available in game - which will make a fun time trying to get them all. I, myself don't have all of them yet. However, it could prove quite frustrating trying to get them all. One of them is to complete a whole game without ONE wrong move. Surely, that's next to impossible, unless you strategically plan your moves beforehand. Which just adds to the beauty of this game. \n\nIt is extremely challenging at times, which is what we all look for in a puzzle game. Why else would we want the puzzle genre?\n\nOverall, cute graphics, amazing sound effects, challenging gameplay with around 4 or so different modes and achievements to get that fire in your heart going just that bit more.

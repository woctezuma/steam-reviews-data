Thankfully, the game eschews referential meta jokes about that era of gaming and instead uses the conventions and tropes of the genre to deliver a fun, charming (but short) experience. Retro-inspired games can often feel exploitative of nostalgia, but this is a straight revival and that appealed to me as a fan of the genre.\n\nThe game is really nice to look at. The \"big pixel\" art style used for the character sprites is reminiscent of the scaling artefacts seen in ScummVM or Sierra games, but remains expressive throughout. The sprites' idle animations and fancy shader effects help the world look alive and engaging.\n\nSpeaking of, this is a fully voiced game and the voice acting really adds a layer of cohesion to the game. It's possibly the single strongest element in YG. It's really good and a pleasure to listen to.\n\nStory-wise, the game's episodes work well as self-contained units of silliness. There's the expected item retrieval quests and character distraction subplots, but there is no overarching plot or dramatic tension. This makes sense considering the game's two episodes and tutorial can be completed in one sitting but it might frustrate some players.\n\nOne aspect of Yorskhire Gubbins that feels limiting is the fact that all objects and characters are present on the same plane of depth. On the one hand, it means there's no pixel-hunting, but on the other it makes the world look flat and takes away from the sense of exploration. The game works around that limitation to deliver a fun experience, but it might become a problem for longer and more ambitious future episodes.\n\nBut really, the reason I'm writing this review is the setting. I didn't have the grace and foresight to be born an Englishman and, for that reason, I have no great familiarity with either Yorkshire itself or how it's depicted in British media.\nI was a bit apprehensive that the game would rely heavily on regional stereotypes and tropes to get its laughs and that these would woosh over my head.\n\nHaving played the game, I'm very pleased to report that this isn't the case. Yorkshire is to the game what the fantasy genre and sci-fi are to Simon the Sorcerer and the Space Quest games, respectively. It's the substrate on which the game's humour grows - but it's not itself the joke.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[*] Stellar voice acting\n[*] Pure 90s-style point-and-click adventure silliness\n[*] Humour is situational, not referential\n[*] Unique English regional setting, yet remains accessible to the rest of us\n[*] Looks good, runs well\n[*] Fun achievements\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[*] Music is unobtrusive but meh\n\n[b]Protip[/b]\nPlay the [i]Holy Molluscamony[/i] bonus episode before [i]Humble Pie[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1514121874, "timestamp_updated": 1514121874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38601159": {"recommendationid": "38601159", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983507042", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514078280}, "language": "english", "review": "'ave a pint at 'ome instead of at t' pub and spend t' money you save on this crackin game.

In the introductory episode a robot introduces both you and Steggy to the workings of the game's interface in Verb School, and at the bargain price of only 20p, too!\n\nThe game proper begins after that, with the episode called Humble Pie. This sees Steggy foiled in the last stages of preparing her entry for the Yorkshire Pie Competition when she finds a serious problem with a key pie ingredient: her Special Meat is in fact only normal meat in a Special Meat wrapper.\n\nPixelated point-and-click hilarity ensues as you guide Steggy through various encounters and simple inventory puzzles in search of some real Special Meat, and a chance at pie greatness.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\nThe graphics in Yorkshire Gubbins are chunky pixel graphics. They're really chunky: too chunky to really enjoy in full-screen at HD resolutions, and much more chunky even than something like Lucasarts' The Secret of Monkey Island (the original), from the 1990s.\n\nThe game only includes a small number of characters and locations. Locations are somewhat bland -- but then again, the game is set in a town in Yorkshire! -- but the characters have all been infused with some personality. Each character has an idle animation, and in-game objects are drawn well enough to at least be recognisable.\n\nThe interface is extremely simple and SCUMM-like: a series of nine verbs, each of which can be applied to selectable objects on the screen. The cursor is a set of large white crosshairs and interactive objects or characters are indicated by partially formed sentences at the bottom of the screen, using the currently selected verb.\n\nThe game has minimal music, but what is included fits the game and setting perfectly and is well produced: simple ditties using only a couple of instruments. I don't recall any sound effects, but there may have been some.\n\nThe big appeal to the game's audio is the fully voiced dialogue, mostly consisting of Yorkshire accents. (I admit, I'm not familiar enough with Yorkshire accents to know if these are real, but they sound pretty convincing to me.) Every line of text in the game is spoken and the voices mostly sound professional and work extremely well. I did hear a few places where it sounded a little muddy, and a couple of voices that didn't sound quite as convincing as the rest, but overall it was well done.\n\nSubtitles are optional. I kept them turned on and noticed a few places where the spoken text was different to the written words, which I always find a bit jarring. The grammar was mostly excellent; I only noticed a couple of errors across all three current episodes.\n\nThere are limited options: three volume levels each for music and sound, fullscreen / windowed mode toggle for graphics, and a single special effect filter: \"Steggyvision', which appears to be a sort of bright blur lighting effect for characters and interface elements. I can't imagine any modern PCs experiencing performance issues with the game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYorkshire Gubbins is a traditional point-and-click adventure game. The game takes place in the top three quarters of the screen, with the bottom quarter being reserved for the simple interface: nine verbs, selectable by word, and a small inventory area. As with any point-and-click adventure, your goal is to find your way to the end of the story by solving verb- and inventory- based puzzles. The gameplay offers nothing revolutionary; indeed, it is obviously heavily influenced by the classics of the genre, such as the SCUMM-based Lucasarts games of the 1990s, and it does a good job.\n\nThe core of every good point-and-click adventure is its puzzles, and Yorkshire Gubbins follows the rulebook here, too. There's nothing outlandishly difficult and, so far at least, you shouldn't need to resort to a walkthrough. I did find one puzzle that was a bit fiddly and required a bit of the old \"use everything on everything in the scene\" tactic; though I knew what I wanted to do I just couldn't work out how the game wanted me to do it.\n\nThe game is divided into episodes. Currently there's a short tutorial of about 10-15 minutes' length, a single episode of somewhere between 60-90 minutes, and a 'bonus' prequel episode with a play time somewhere between the other two. Even though the game is not marked as Early Access, the developers are being generous and planning to offer a few more episodes free to owners of the game over the next year. So while the game as it is now only provides about two hours of play, you can expect more over the coming months.\n\nThe script is well written and the game's main drawcard is its humour, which I found entertaining; it didn't fall flat like many other comedy games and it even made me laugh out loud a few times.\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\nPros:\n+ Sense of humour\n+ Great accents\n+ Steam Achievements\n\nCons:\n- Pixel graphics are a bit too low resolution for modern displays\n- Variable voice acting quality\n- Very short (so far; more is coming)\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nYorkshire Gubbins is a very welcome addition to the point-and-click adventure genre, with comedy that's light-hearted and fun. At the moment there's not much here, but what there is is well written and funny. The promise of up to another four long episodes over the next year adds to the appeal. Yorkshire Gubbins made me laugh out loud more than once, which is quite rare in this age of memes and in-your-face slapstick.\n\nIf you like point-and-click adventure games and you appreciate good humour, then pick it up and take a look.\n\nHumans love buttons!\n\n[h1]Save[/h1]\n\n[code]For more game reviews, visit [url=http://saveorquit.com/]Save or Quit[/url].[/code]\n", "timestamp_created": 1513858942, "timestamp_updated": 1513858942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38443333": {"recommendationid": "38443333", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997420021", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513735904}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic, if you're an Anglophile with a taste for absurdity.", "timestamp_created": 1513735981, "timestamp_updated": 1513735981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38251764": {"recommendationid": "38251764", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962734200", "num_games_owned": 1105, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511444300}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoyed playing this.

I miss a decent pointy clicky thing to be honest so I loaded up t'online game shop and bought this. I can honestly say on the life of my whippet* this is the pointiest and clickiest game I've played all year.\n\nThe Yorkshire setting may terrify you if you are a British southerner or from 'not the UK' but it's ok. The game is written with simplified Yorkshire voiceovers and if you struggle with that there are subtitles. As a southerner myself I found this game highly accessible and I feel I learned much about the rich Yorkshire culture, particularly their plight against other-worldly creatures and a liking for pie.\n\nThe game is beautifully drawn and *fully pixelated* such that if you squint and engage your imagination, you start to experience what the real Yorkshire looks like. Kinda like the real point and click adventures from the 80s and 90s. Do not squint for long as you may feel like you have left your life behind and now run a pub in the peak district.\n\nI found the episodes to date amusing if a little short, but if you're after a quick diversion from life and fancy a visit to deepest, muddiest Yorkshire where the beer costs 20p, then this game may be to your liking, especially as it is cheaper than a bus ticket to Burnley.\n\n*DISCLAIMER: I don't actually have a whippet\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1508773305, "timestamp_updated": 1508773305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35942785": {"recommendationid": "35942785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048962306", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511528922}, "language": "english", "review": "A solid, funny, little point and click adventure game.\n\nThe sense of humour is right up my alley (or ginnel, as the case may be), and it's definitely worth the price of admission.\n\nWhile Yorkshire Gubbins certainly isn't as, ah, reflective on the morality of genre norms as Undertale (you do some reasonably terrible things, in traditional adventure game fashion), the humour is broadly similar if you were a fan of that. It's a bit more British though.\n\nIt also isn't too hard, and certainly if you're someone who's offended at the notion of games not lasting for 100 hours this might not necessarily be for you, but for less than the price of a cinema ticket it's definitely worth it for what's in the game right now, and I can't see that changing when subsequent episodes come out (even if the price goes up a bit*).\n\n* It'll actually also probably still be less than a cinema ticket. Cinema tickets are *really* expensive, having just looked up what cinemas actually charge nowadays. The non-sale price (\u00a34 as of writing) of Yorkshire Gubbins could double and still be cheaper than buying a ticket from Odeon (\u00a39.75 for an adult, not including booking fee if you're getting it online, also as of writing).

The graphics are vintage with a modern twist thanks to the SteggyVision filter, and you can even fluidly resize the window - great for sneaking in a quick bit of Yorkshire at work, but you didn't hear that from me.\n\nWhile it's admittedly a short adventure, it's a fun one - and with the promise of more to come in the future I'm confident my sub-\u00a35 investment will prove wise.\n\nHuzzah for Yorkshire| Huzzah for Slugkin| Huzzah for Yorkshire Gubbins!", "timestamp_created": 1508590159, "timestamp_updated": 1508654134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680567", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35888893": {"recommendationid": "35888893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004800077", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512680797}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game made all the better if you're from Yorkshire!", "timestamp_created": 1508586442, "timestamp_updated": 1508586442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35872691": {"recommendationid": "35872691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093716477", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508449009}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved it!!

The only time enemies are a problem is when there is water involved, since it makes you both loud and slow.   \n\nAlso, nothing is ever really explained. I was hoping that when I completed the game I would learn something more about who I was, who the enemies were, why I was doing what I was doing or even, ultimately, what I was doing at all.

It's visually simple, but the color scheme is enough to make you feel like you're actually in a dark room. The screams when you die and the weird sounds enemies make are enough to create a little bit of tension on us.\n\nThe game is cheap and it can be a distraction when you have nothing else to do. It also has achievements and trading cards, so completionists (like me) might enjoy it.\n\n[h1]Reasons why I can't say I like it[/h1]\nI found its premise to be deceiving. I have read, on both store page and news, that the game turned sound into gameplay, which is not true. Playing on mute or without headphones makes absolutely no difference. I was expecting something where I could play with my eyes closed and be guided by my ears, but all I had to do was look at the lines on the ground.\n\nIts puzzles aren't exactly puzzles.

That, along side the sound design creates an immersive experience, unfortunately that experience is not very exciting, nor interesting.\n\nA game like this really has a great opportunity to slowly introduce new and more interesting/challenging gaming mechanics, but this one just does more of the same, over and over.

game can be more unnearving then the simplistic design may lead you to believe. Its not a horror that will make you jump out of your skin, its more a feeling of dread. We are visual creatures, so not being able to see whats around you properly, not knowing whats around you until its (potentially) too late. It also leaves what these demonic sounds following you up to interpritation. \n\nThe sound design is excellent, as it should be with a game based around it. You can tell when you're stepping through water, through blood, when there is death near you, the crumbling walls and the shifting stones, its all told through sound and what the sound waves shown tell you about your world. \n\nIts a sort of stealth adventure game with the puzzle ellements getting stronger as you go along. By the end of the game you are sort of able to lead and manipulate the creatures which is what really drives it away from its initial stealthy feel. However this does not put the game on easy mode and no matter where you are in the game, the crunching of bones and death scream of your character is always jarring when you get something wrong. \n\nAll in all, if this sounds remotely appealing to you, especially with the low cost, I would say take the chance on it.

One of the best aspects is that it remembers about being a game first, while being complimented by everything else. The idea is unique and something I\u2019ve personally have not seen before, and is not pretentious about it.\n\nThe visuals are an excellent style choice and leave plenty for imagination, which makes for a unique and terrifying experience. You don\u2019t know what is going on around you or where you are, sometimes you don\u2019t know what is going to happen next, but that\u2019s part of what makes this game great and tense. It\u2019s pretty to see all those visuals slowly change in front of you by your actions, although you won\u2019t always be able to appreciate them for too long because you\u2019ll be in danger constantly. But they can make for pretty screenshots and wallpapers if you experiment enough.\n\nThere is no music, only small ambient sounds and the sounds made by your character and other entities. However it doesn't need any music to begin with, for it would detract from the focus, but I assure you the sound design will end up stuck in your head and you'll be remembering the sounds for quite a while. Some sounds were a little too hauting for me I must admit.\n\nOverall is not a complicated game, in fact is not a hard game either, it can be a little frustrating at times, however I appreciate its focus on simplicity, especially because simplicity well done is a rarity. The mechanics are not hard to understand and it\u2019s very well designed from start to finish. And really, there is not much to say; it is what it is and does a fine job, but I enjoy it for what it is and for delivering an unerving experience. It might be short, but for the small price is absolutely worth it and one of the most unique games I've seen in a while.

I just bought it, and played for 2.5 hours straight. I love it! (And it's certainly much longer than I expected it to be \u2014 2.5 hours and I'm not even halfway done!)\n\nIf you really think about it, Dark Echo is actually a fairly standard puzzle/escape/psychological thriller game: You navigate, you evade monsters, you avoid death traps, and sometimes you have to activate switches (represented by yellow patches). But the sound mechanic, in which you navigate by visualized sound waves, changes everything. Instead of giving you a puzzle to solve in each level, it makes navigation a puzzle in itself. And it's a puzzle that gets progressively more complicated and challenging as new elements and mechanics are introduced and combined with each other, requiring increasing amounts of cleverness to overcome.\n\nA bonus: The fact that you are effectively walking around in pitch darkness, and often threatened by monsters and traps, makes this something of a horror game as well. Your blindness makes the experience tense and constantly charged with the threat of the unknown. And the inscrutability of your environment presents an ontological mystery: You don't know who you are, where you are, how you got there, or what the world wants from you. (I doubt any of these questions will be answered by the game, but a sense of mystery always makes horror/thriller games even more fun.)\n\nEdit: I just played for another half an hour. When I first wrote this, I was at level 37 or 38. At Level 40, I made an important discovery, which is that the next 40 levels are a \"mirror\" of the first 40. Your player character finally escapes the darkness he was trapped in, stepping out into the light, where you can hear birds chirping. And then you're taken to a level select screen that's the same as the first one, except that black and white are inverted. I've played a few of these \"light\" levels so far, and they are largely the same as their \"dark\" counterparts (including their names), except that black and white are inverted, in some ways they seem to be tougher, I'm pretty sure there are more monsters, and it seems that the monsters can now move through walls. I had to stop playing only a few levels in because I was mentally drained. I'm a bit disappointed that the last half of the game seems to be just a \"tougher\" mirror of the first \u2014 especially since I'm not sure that it's tougher in a good way.

Learning how to use sound to both navigate and avoid the monsters is fun while not excessively challenging. Then however you get to the later levels.\n\nMoving platforms, that you cannot see. Sudden forced movement that you can't explain. Almost impossibly fast reactions required to avoid death many times when you don't know what to expect, and when the game manipulates what you think you've learned by making that same behavior kill you.\n\nTo a certain extent this could define any particularly challenging game, but I feel Dark Echo crosses the line from challenging to just down right frustrating because the game seems to require you to play through the level and die several times to learn exactly how to move because there is no way to know what you should do on your first, second, or even third try. But after that you've seen all the traps, and know exactly what to do to avoid them because you've DIED to each of them before.\n\nI have been enjoying this game, and I will finish it, but I was forced to rage quit when a level seemed clearly designed to require several attempts to learn the exact pattern of the traps so you could navigate them, which seems like a poor design choice.

It takes one core mechanic - in this case, echolocation - and builds everything off of that, which is something I honestly wish more games did. It makes for a very tightly-woven experience where the gameplay, environment and story (what little story there is, at least) are all woven together seamlessly in one immersive experience. Granted, this game lacks visuals entirely, outside of the visual representation of echolocation, but that's also part of the genius of it. The echolocation system is intuitive and grows on you quickly to the point of feeling second-nature, plus it makes the player use the mechanics given to them to not only solve the puzzles and beat the levels, but also explore the levels and make sense of their environment. Not only that, but it has the players doing these things simultaneously. The game gives you no context as to where you are, what you're doing or why you're doing it (I guess you could say you're going into the experience \"blind\" . . . I'm sorry), so you just have to use context clues to figure things out. These are usually things that would be completely mundane in a game with visuals, but figuring out what things are purely based on your sound-wave-line-things and the sound effects in the game makes even the simplest environmental details intriguing. And as you play the game, you will get much better at \"seeing\" with the echolocation mechanic. Like I said earlier, the single mechanic which the entire game is based on works perfectly, is extremely intuitive and most importantly, is a lot of fun to use. It's also really fun to look at in its own weird way, which is good considering it's the only thing you can see throughout the entire game. \nI also want to touch on the \"horror\" aspect of this game, since that's one of the tags for the game. This game is very tense purely based on its mechanic, making it one of the purest tension-fueled experiences there is. The focus on making the game feel tense and atmospheric was a good choice, seeing as the fear of the unknown works perfectly with the \"blindness\" of the player.\" The horror elements are not at all elaborate (as this game is built on simplicity) and won't provide a traditional horror game experience by any means, so I'm not sure I'd call this a \"scary\" game, but it is surprisingly thrilling. You will be running from monsters and avoiding deadly traps as you traverse mazes, and the death sounds are a bit gruesome. Still, this game is not for the horror audience. If you don't like scary games, I'd still give this game a try, although be warned it is tense. If you're okay with scary games, there's no reason not to try it. If you're looking specifically for a scary game, this is not the one for you.\nOverall, this is a great game. I wrote this review mostly to commend it on its tight and simple game design. This game knows what it does, and it does it extremely well. This is something I wish more games developers would think about more when making games. \"What's the core of this game, and how can we tie everything in the game to that core?\" Doing this 100% with every game simply wouldn't be possible, but keeping this idea in mind when designing a game I think could help create a tighter, more immersive experience.", "timestamp_created": 1466125233, "timestamp_updated": 1466125233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23591314": {"recommendationid": "23591314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146645159", "num_games_owned": 5368, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470931411}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e4b\u524d\u770b\u8fc7\u4e00\u7247\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u8bf4\u6e38\u620f\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6781\u5177\u521b\u610f\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5f70\u663e\u4e86\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6050\u6016\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u6211\u6bd4\u8f83\u8d5e\u540c\u3002\n\n\u8d77\u521d\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u81ea\u5df1\u5e76\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6015\u4ec0\u4e48\u6050\u6016\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u90fd\u662f\u4e9b\u7ebf\u6761\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u561b\uff0c\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u597d\u6015\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u5f00\u59cb\u73a9\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5730\u56fe\u6269\u5927\u3001\u654c\u4eba\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u97f3\u6548\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u9010\u6b65\u5347\u7ea7\u3002\u5728\u601d\u8003\u5982\u4f55\u8fc7\u5173\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u5145\u6ee1\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u4ee4\u4eba\u4ea7\u751f\u6d88\u6781\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4ec0\u4e48\u6700\u53ef\u6015\uff1f\u672a\u77e5\u6700\u53ef\u6015\uff01\n\n\u5173\u5361\u4e2d\u4ec5\u80fd\u9760\u58f0\u97f3\u6765\u8fa8\u8bc6\u5468\u56f4\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0a\u5c31\u597d\u50cf\u4e3b\u89d2\u6210\u4e86\u542c\u89c9\u53d1\u8fbe\u7684\u5931\u660e\u8005\u3002\n\n\u597d\u5728\u7b2c\u4e09\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u5468\u56f4\uff0c\u8bd5\u60f3\u5982\u679c\u73a9\u5bb6\u81ea\u5df1\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u89d2\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u4f1a\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u6837\u6781\u7aef\u7684\u72b6\u51b5\u5462\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1466054560, "timestamp_updated": 1466054560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707175", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23471444": {"recommendationid": "23471444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198229215408", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488584791}, "language": "spanish", "review": "me encanto el juego tiene una bonita historia pero es muy entretenido y este juego te ense\u00f1a como es que alguien ciego ve atraves de las ondas que provoca el mismo", "timestamp_created": 1465494047, "timestamp_updated": 1465494047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23456262": {"recommendationid": "23456262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120620919", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473274858}, "language": "italian", "review": "Molti hanno definito Dark Echo un ottimo \"Gioco da mobile\"; estendendo questo concetto al gaming su pc, possiamo dire che questo gioco \u00e8 un ottimo \"concetto\", che semplicemente non sviluppa pi\u00f9 di tanto, facendolo restare quello per tutto il gioco.

I would recommend that you buy it, play it, and get a refund, for reasons you'll see later.\n  First, though, the game is mostly an excellent experience. Suspense is created very effectively, as well as some mild horror. The game's mechanics are very polished and nice, with it's slightly randomized sound wave direction, so that no walk will be exactly the same; the sneak mechanice's effectiveness in water could be adjusted for more realism, but i understand that it's wave length is so expansive for the sake of the suspense and challenge; the enemies' speed is just enough to provide great suspense, and the large enemy is certainly a great fear that the game always gives you a chance to avoid (or rather, run from). The simple style of the game provides a nice ambiance, so that if you stop making sound for even a few seconds, you will be lost until you make sound again, likely putting you in danger.\n  Now on to negative points. First off, the game is NOT worth $2.99, since there is simply not enought content, in my opinion, to be priced that high. $1.49 maximum. The game is inconsistent in the later levels(30-40 mainly),in that it \"throw's away\" the machanics it has taught you from the beginning. one level leaves you stranded in a widely expansive empty map, following sounds of dripping water just beyond your view. no other place in the game [i]requires[/i] you to listen for direction or guidance. another level leaves you in a room where you must obeserve the pattern of moving landscape to find an opening to stop the motion at a specific time which will allow you to progress (harder than it sounds). My biggest point, though, is level 37: \"lost\", in which you are placed in a large landscape of rough-walled caves where you must [i]walk around blindly until you randomly find the exit, with other paths leading you to dead ends with enemies[/i].\n  The game also has a \"light mode\", which is simply a negative print of the game with enemies added to nearly every room, faster enemy movement, turned rooms, or some rooms' layout changed. The game's achievements also consist of \"beat normal mode\", \"beat hard mode\", and \"collect every secret\". The game is good, but mostly due to the extravagant price and lack of both general content and replay value, i'll put it this way:\n  I should have my refund soon.", "timestamp_created": 1464889255, "timestamp_updated": 1464889255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476522", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23347291": {"recommendationid": "23347291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079943494", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471205078}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant conceptual exploration and adequate theming.

Unfortunately, it does not fulfill its promise. I liked the beginning a lot, but becomes boring and tedious later on. I played the dark levels on Android and some of the white levels on PC, so I can compare both versions.\n\nThere are 3 main mechanics in the game (tapping, sneaking, throwing rocks). They are interesting early on, but no other concept is introduced later on, and there are no new mechanics introduced in the later levels (maybe except moving objects). The game seems to be a half-finished, with so many interested things that could have been introduced in the game, but weren't.\n\nThe number of levels is low. There are 40 dark levels, which you can finished in a couple of hours, and 40 white levels, which are the same levels with many more (and bigger and faster) enemies, and a very uncomfortable full-white background. There's not much motivation to play the white levels. Also, one wonders why there aren't more unique levels than 40. Given that designing new levels seems extremely easy, their current number feels more like a demo than a regular game.\n\nThe controls are unfortunately very poorly implemented. On touch devices, it's very hard to sneak, and sometimes you perform a regular step instead of sneaking, which means instadeath in later (white) levels. Imprecise controls on touch devices was a reason why I switched to PC version for later levels. On the other hand, on touch devices you can very easily throw rocks into arbitrary direction, and it's very easy to precisely position your enemy. Mind-bogglingly, you can't do that on PC. Even though it would be very obvious to use mouse cursor to throw rocks, you can't, and you can only throw to 8 basic directions using the keyboard. Also, you always need to face the direction you're throwing into, so you can't distract an enemy by throwing a rock to the side when running away, as it would be natural. With gamepad, you can throw to arbitrary directions, but as is usual with a gamepad stick, aiming is hard. So while PC version makes it easier to move, it makes it harder to aim compared to touch devices. In none of the versions you can control your character [b]well[/b]. Controls were my number 1 frustration when playing later levels. The ideal controls seem so obvious - left mouse click to walk, shift to sneak, space to tap, right mouse click to throw to the exact direction. Yet it is not there.\n\nHopefully someone will use this concept and make a great with it, with more interesting levels, more enemy types, more interactive and environment objects (I can imagine e.g. terrain elevation changing sound waves reflection), better controls, more fun.", "timestamp_created": 1455144193, "timestamp_updated": 1455181015, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21094911": {"recommendationid": "21094911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003970062", "num_games_owned": 1154, "num_reviews": 213, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455081815}, "language": "english", "review": "Dark Echo is a minimalistic exploration game. You are shrouded in darkness (or, for the second half of the game, in blinding light), and the only way for you to navigate through the levels is the echos of your footsteps (represented by colored lines which radiate out from where you\u2019re standing). You have the ability to stomp your foot (making louder echoes), walk silently (to avoid alerting enemies to your presence), and throw stones (to make echoes in a remote location to lure enemies away).\n\nThe game is very simple; there are only a handful of mechanics. There are red enemies who move towards the last sound they were in range of earing, there are pits of water which slow you down and which make a lot of sound to move through, there are red areas that killed you if you moved into them, there were walls that would collapse when you made a loud sound (opening an area but also attracting enemies), and there were moving blocks which pushed you around.\n\nMostly, the game worked fairly decently; you are introduced to all the games\u2019 mechanics gradually over the first half of the game, and navigate through a series of increasingly-difficult levels which force you to combine the mechanics in increasingly interesting ways.\n\nWhile the game was mostly fairly solid, the moving blocks mechanic was probably the most frustrating; while it only appears in a handful of levels, the fact that the pushes are so difficult to see ahead of time is kind of frustrating. Eventually you figure out how they work (for a while, I just thought they were sloped areas that I was skidding down), but at times it felt like the game broke its own rules, such as one level where you had to navigate up little ramps that felt like they actually were sloped areas on the sides of the room.\n\nMostly, though, the game played very fairly, and even the frustrating levels were mostly quite short. After beating the game, you could hunt back through for treasures, or play through the \u201clight\u201d versions of the levels, where additional enemies were added in to make you play more carefully (as well as the layouts of some of the levels being changed to make them more difficult).\n\nThat said, the game is nothing super special; the gameplay isn\u2019t really amazing, but it is decent enough. Ultimately, this is a sort of time-waster game \u2013 the sort of thing you\u2019d play while chatting to someone or doing something else, sporadically playing it. It was originally a mobile game, and I suspect it is better suited to that platform simply because of its \u201cplay in short bursts\u201d nature.\n\nStill, it is okay, and if you\u2019re looking for something to do between doing other things, it isn\u2019t a bad choice, and goes to show that just because you don\u2019t spend a whole lot on graphics doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make a visually striking game.

In actuality, the game is a top-down casual adventure game with sound built into the graphics. Yes, it's unique, but the game quickly runs out of material and becomes irritating to finish. The low price helps, but it's not a game I'll likely remember.\n\nThe core gameplay is to reach the exit, avoiding red traps and pushing yellow plates to open walls. Detecting objects requires sounds, so most of the time you will be sending out foot pings to map out rooms. The real gameplay opens up when enemies are introduced, and sounds become a risk of detection. In the best moments, Dark Echo is about outmaneuvering enemies and feeling smart about your moves.\n\nIn the worst moments, Dark Echo is about trial & error memorization of traps and enemies, since the optimal playstyle is to make no noise. Issues come up when the game throws in more enemies and more water, forcing you to drag groups further out of the way so you'll have more time to move. Enemy detection also shows issues, as detection is dependent on sound lines hitting enemies. Sound lines may be pretty consistent, but it would make more sense to be doppler waves for consistency. Rock tosses will generally miss at medium range, unless the rock hits a wall to amplify. Too much time is spent spamming rocks to move enemies just right, and waiting on the slow death animation.\n\nAlthough the game has 80 levels, half of them are repeats with added difficulty. The survival horror concepts are lost with the flood of identical enemies and repeated deaths. The puzzle elements are minimal switches, and no real mental challenge outside memorization. The lack of tension and challenges leave the game feeling like a grind to finish, despite being short. It would take closer to 5+ hours to complete, and I left the game idle overnight. I suppose the game isn't too expensive, but I wasn't impressed or pleased by the second half. Sadly it's another artsy game that says nothing and puts style over substance.", "timestamp_created": 1454880273, "timestamp_updated": 1454880273, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574612", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21033606": {"recommendationid": "21033606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040680943", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454871523}, "language": "english", "review": "Sweet Game.

long time.  Most indie games these days seem to try to take an existing game as an archetype, strip out all the fluff, and leave the core mechanic, whatever that may be.  By and large, this makes for a great game, because it's hard to invent something truly new, but slightly easier to see a AAA game fail, read the reviews, and then re-hash it taking all the negative comments into consideration.   \n\nDark Echo, on the other hand, creates a whole new mechanic, and makes a wonderful game out of it.\n\nIn a funny way (and bear with me here), Dark Echo's \"special sauce\" (that genre-holotype-defining quality of the first game in a string of variants) reminds me a little of Amnesia, Dark Descent... The main mechanic of that game was that if you can see the monster, it can see you, so you have to tiptoe about and hide away in corners, turning your back to monsters so they can't see you.  If you loved that juxaposition, you'll love Dark Echo.   In this game, rather than light (sight), it's sound that allows you to see the monsters, but as soon as you 'see' them via your echoes, they 'see' you too!  So it's a constant game of making just enough noise to 'see' by, but not too much!   A lovely little balancing act that can take a few deaths to get right!\n\nIn another funny way, it reminds me a little of Ico (again, bear with me).  After all, I hear you say \"Whereas Ico was a visual extravaganza, this is a minimalist line drawing!\".   I'm referring to the atmosphere, really.  The wonderful sounds, the echoes, the vastness of some of the 'spaces', the lack of explanations, the constantly running away from stuff.  It's got a great little mythos going for it.  I wouldn't be surprised if someone didn't write a little fan fiction for it...  \n\nSo, what is it?  In it's essence, it's a puzzler where you have to navigate a top-down 'level' full of tricks, traps and 'monsters', to reach the 'safe zone'.   So far, so simple.  The hard part is the aforementioned visibility mechanic and managing it so that you can navigate around without being caught.\n\nThe game comes in two flavours: Dark and Light.  The light levels are (by and large) the same as the dark levels, but with a few added monsters and/or water.   In a funny way, the light levels feel like the 'completion' of the dark levels, or possibly that the dark levels were a 'trial run' of the light levels.   Often water is placed at critical places to slow you down, and make lots of splashes for the bad guys to hear...  Sometimes the level's structure is adjusted ever-so-slightly to make you change your tactic on the second run-through.   Some of the levels are identical, but with a monster or two thrown in.  For most of the second half of the game, I felt that things were new-enough to merit finishing the game.  \n\nSo, as someone who doesn't have a lot of time any more to play games, I'm happy to say that Dark Echo ticked all my boxes: It's new, it's amusing, it's inventive, it's minimalist, and doesn't break its own rules all the time.

I started with \"You Have to Win the Game\", and I suppose I might as well continue with Dark Echo.\n\nNow, I'm not recommending Dark Echo because I think it's a bad game. Dark Echo is an incredibly unique game with a stealth system all-it's-own. I just personally don't like it. But if you think the points I bring up won't bother you, then by all means buy this game.\n\nDark Echo is a stealth/horror game built around the idea that you're blind and have to rely on sound to guide your way through what I think is a castle with a ton of enigmatic monsters living inside it. The mechanics are very unique. If you choose to move quietly to not disturb the monsters, you won't be able to see far ahead and predict incoming obstacles. However, if you choose to be loud and find out what's ahead, you might attract monsters who will eat you. But all this challenge and fright is pretty much diminished by the rocks. Once you get those all the levels that follow are an absolute piece of cake. \n\nDark Echo is certainly a horror game. It plays well with what you see as well as what you don't see, and uses sound to amp up the atmosphere and tension. But without a story, context, or building challenge to the monsters I didn't find myself sweating with terror at the end. I felt relieved, sure, but I know if the game put a little more oomph! into it, Dark Echo could be so much better, and so much scarier. \n\nAgain, if this sounds appealing to you, go nuts. Dark Echo is still an incredibly unique experience. But beyond the sometimes blandly simple levels and lack of story to really put things into context (and the added on padding where you simply play through all 40 levels again, but in the light), it just wasn't a game for me.

I found this game to be a somewhat unique and atmospheric in-the-dark visualized-sound puzzle type of game.\n\nThe first few levels are easy enough (which I guess they are more like introductory or tutorial type of levels), but a few levels in I soon discovered that there were lurking dangers in the dark (some which would chase me) and the game suddenly became a lot more challenging (and even a bit scary at times). \n\nThe graphics are simplistic, but suit this type of game well as what you see is \"sound feedback\" from your surroundings. It's suggested to wear headphones to be more immersed in the atmosphere and better hear the sounds or in what direction something might be at. \n\nOverall I do like what I've played of this game so far and I could recommend it to anyone who may be considering getting it.

gives is a tense and foreboding experience. although there are occasionally things like the sound of water droplets to help give a better picture of your environment, most of the time you can only rely on your footsteps to see what is around you, not knowing if there's something deadly silently lurking around the corner waiting to pounce.\n\nof course, since i actually like to mess around in horror games, one of my favorite things to do is lure baddies with a large stomp and then tiptoe a few feet away and watch them give up as soon as they reach the source. they lose interest immediately and it's kind of hilarious.\n\nanother little detail i enjoy is that there are different footstep noises; you might be walking on stone for a while but one corridor later you'll be walking on dirt or grass. it really adds a nice touch to each area, since you can kind of infer what your surroundings are even though you never actually see them.\n\noverall this game is \"Outta Sight\" and if you

And while you were running through a prolonged and almost infinite hill, pushing the jump button you realized that now Mario could fly. And then, you were amazed with this magic sense of discovery while you explore a vastness sea of pixelated clouds. Creating the magic illusion of exploring a new world in which every single element is full of novelty, an explosion of the senses.\n\nOur gaming memories are full of this accomplished moments of realization. Like the first enemy that you glitch in [i]Axiom Verge[/i]. The first kiss you give in Yoshirou Kimura\u2019s cult classic [i]Chulip[/i]. Or when you rewinded the time in [i]Braid[/i] to reach an unattainable floating plattform for the first time.\n\n[i]Dark Echo[/i] has one of these memorable and most captivating single moments experienced in recent videogames. In the form of the first time that you keep pushed the action button, and releasing it you can see how an explosion of visible and corporeal sound waves helps to materialize a previously occult and cryptic hidden dimension. With a plethora of abstract and evocative geometrical forms dazzling our eyes with pure joy. An intense array of emotions are concentrated in this mere act of pushing a single button. As an expression of why the videogames are considered art.\n\nIn its first hours, this magic sense of realization never ceases. An absorbing sensation that creates an oppressive feeling in the player, while he\u2019s surrounded by invisible menaces laying in the shadows. An universe where the most feared ghosts plaguing our subconscious are waiting for us surrounded by darkness. Waiting to become corporeal with the mere stimulus of a sound.\n\nWe can only figure the world that lies beneath [i]Dark Echo[/i] via the materialization of sounds, this fragmented instant of time when a a wave elongates making tangible a mysterious and almost cryptic alternative reality that lives isolated in a corner of our memories, close to our childhood traumas. Playing [i]Dark Echo[/i] is like doing a unconscious journey through our fears and hopes, only using our imagination in a synesthetic way, associating sounds and its geometrical effects with inner terrors. And all of these sound elements are augmented by one of the most cohesive artistic designs seen in a videogame, clearly influenced by the paintings of Rothko in its constant use of the black and red colors.\n\nIts level structure is not so distant of a stealth game, where we need to generate geometrical forms thorough sounds to confuse our captors. With a perfect difficulty curve that adds new elements and functions at a very slow pace. The 20 first levels serves as a tutorial, and from 20 onwards, you should prepare to die a lot. It\u2019s like an even more minimalist approach to the VR missions seen in the first [i]Metal Gear Solid[/i]. Also, [i]Dark Echo[/i] shows its smart design nature by using the name of each level as an evocative clue to resolve its main obstacle. A demonstration of the love and care that its creators have put in the development process. \n\nMaybe [i]Dark Echo[/i] can be seen as a small game. But it\u2019s a game in which every single element has been created with an ambitious and creative approach. A short but extremely polished experience that tries to not saturate the player with irrelevant content. Over the years and with the consequent saturation of the gaming market, I appreciate games that really try to be small but memorable journeys. Significative creations in gaming history that we will never forget.\n\nNote that [i]Dark Echo[/i] isn\u2019t the first experiment created in the videogame medium to recreate the experience of being a blind person. Previously, the japanese punk videogame designer idol Kenji Eno created [i]Real Sound: Kaze no Regret[/i] for Sega Saturn. A game that was designed with blind people in mind, using only sounds and with not a single image. In his next game, Kenji Eno will use the sound as a design fundamental again, with the release of [i]Enemy Zero[/i]. A survival horror with invisible enemies, that only can be detected by using a sound radar. \n\nSadly, Kenji Eno passed away in 2013. But I\u2019m sure that if he lived today, he would become fascinated with [i]Dark Echo[/i].\n\n\n[i]( The writer of this review is not an English native.

The sounds you create ricochet around you in the form of coloured lines. You goal, naturally, is to escape the darkness, and escape whatever the hell is in it with you.\n\nI found the gameplay enjoyable overall. The difficulty curve is just right - with a bit of persistence and some careful planning, navigating the darkness can be fun, sometimes scary, but achieveable for everyone. Controls consist of basic movement, throwing stones for decoys, clapping your hands (with various degrees of strength, depending how long you hold the button down for), and stealth. And you'll probably be using stealth quite a bit.\n\nYou have your white, regular soundwaves for normal surfaces, yellow for switches. But the real fun starts with blue and red soundwaves. Blue is for water, which is something you'll want to avoid on account of it being so noisy, and red you'll also want to avoid, on account of it being able to kill you at a touch. \n\nAnd oh my god, if you die. The first time I died I almost leapt a full metre out of my chair. The death scream is perfect. In fact, most all the sounds are done to perfection. From your echoing footsteps to the sound your hands clapping together, it is very well done. \n\nDark Echo really is a worthy addition to any gamer's library. While it lacks a story of any sort, it does do everything else right, giving us a new take on fear, exploration and stealth. Even if it doesn't sound like fun to you (I don't imagine how this could be) get this game and give it a try.

However, conceptually, it is pretty cool, and in practice, the game mechanics work well. \n\nBasically, it is pitch black with the only light coming from sound, which bounces off the walls and objects, thus illuminating your path briefly. Also, your footprints leave a trail. Sadly, the sound also serves to attract an all consuming evil, in the form of red lights. Normal sound is represented by white light, doors (and I guess treaure although I'm not exactly certain how that works) is represented by yellow, and water (the bane of your existence in this game, lol) is blue. Somewhere around level 20, you find rocks which you can throw to distract the all consuming evil, which is especially handy when you also have to cross water (which also slows your movement). Each level basically ends by finding the exit \"doorway\" which explodes with white light when you step into it.  Oh...and you can also move with stealth, which reduces your sound radius and helps you to sneak through that pesky all consuming evil.\n\nThere are some other nuances so far, such as needing to use rocks to break through walls, and certain levels where you cant hide from the all consuming evil and simply have to run for it. The level I am on currently, you have to cross waterways which actually push you into the awaiting evil (I guess this is the waters current). \n\nThe game does have full controller support, which is how I play it.\n\nAnyway, I actually think this is a stellar game, and minimalistic perfection in what is essentially a unique puzzle game.\n\nI give this game 8 muffled footsteps out of 10 with the remaining 2 betraying you to the all consuming evil, which I will simply dub as Shoggoth.", "timestamp_created": 1439347568, "timestamp_updated": 1439347568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680121", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17401374": {"recommendationid": "17401374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076763286", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513171251}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool Game But the only thing that annoy me is how many fucking levels are there im at stage 30 and when is it gonna end XD but overall i love the game so imma keep playing 6/10 would recommened.", "timestamp_created": 1438792737, "timestamp_updated": 1438792737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17393926": {"recommendationid": "17393926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170177399", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432425280}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun game with a cool idea for the gameplay. 8.2/10", "timestamp_created": 1438747330, "timestamp_updated": 1438747330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17381273": {"recommendationid": "17381273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162686351", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474567902}, "language": "polish", "review": "Bardzo fajna gra na d\u0142ugie wieczory.Poziomy s\u0105 raczej kr\u00f3tkie, i nie zbyt trudne wi\u0119c mo\u017cna si\u0119 troche oderwa\u0107 od \"powa\u017cniejszych\" tytu\u0142\u00f3w.A dzwi\u0119ki w tej grze potrafi\u0105 wywo\u0142a\u0107 g\u0119si\u0105 sk\u00f3rk\u0119.....\nPrzy okazji mo\u017cna jedynie snu\u0107 domys\u0142y co si\u0119 tak naprawd\u0119 dzieje w tej grze, ca\u0142o\u015b\u0107 jest pozostawiona wyobra\u017ani gracza.", "timestamp_created": 1438686335, "timestamp_updated": 1438686335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17359886": {"recommendationid": "17359886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094458545", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467899289}, "language": "german", "review": "[h1]Dark Echo[/h1]\n\n[b]also das ist ein klasse zeitvertreib aber f\u00fcr 2,99 doch zu viel aber das spiel ist nicht schlecht![/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]Klasse Zeitvertreib\n[*]Beruhigt + ein Wenig Aktion\n[*]Sch\u00f6ner Sound", "timestamp_created": 1438565695, "timestamp_updated": 1449152540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17296672": {"recommendationid": "17296672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129453918", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440491192}, "language": "english", "review": "Dark Echo is an interesting puzzle solving game that utalizes the creativity of your mind as you wander through multiple levels attempting to understand just what it is you're overcoming.

Playing it in a darkened room on a dreary night is a must to get the full experience but even without that it's still a neat little puzzle game. \n\nI've had a fair few butt-clenching moments and only two instances where I got frustrated with the game. And that frustration limits itself to a couple of levels with moving walls. They're over quickly enough to not be an issue.\n\nThe game is short, so it doesn't overstay its welcome. To be honest, it could just as easily have been a free flash game; but I'm glad it isn't. The developer made a small piece of art here, and fully deserves whatever income the game generates.

I think that at some point I will go back through and do the light levels, because I'm sure that there's something I might have missed. \n\n\n[h1]Meat of the review[/h1]\nI don't necessarily go by a rating system whenever I review games. I consider: Is it reasonably priced for the level of enjoyment I got out of the gameplay? Does it have a unique quality about it that other games don't have? Will I ever be able to go back and replay the game? \n\nThose are three questions that I consider whenever I'm playing a game. Those are three fairly important questions to me as well. \n\nFirst question: With a price tag of $2.99, it is very affordable. Not only that, but I was riveted to the game and I was determined on finishing all of the levels, I won't spoil how many. If you want to know here's the number: [spoiler] 30 [/spoiler] Which I thought was a great amount of levels, and the variability of the levels was incredible. Not only is the game innovative, but the level design is complex and dynamic. The levels challenged my awareness and problem solving.  Of course, I think it is very reasonably priced for the level of enjoyment I got out of it. \n\nSecond question: Dark Echo is a game where [spoiler] you are blind [/spoiler] and the object of the game is to find the exit using [spoiler] your sense of hearing.[/spoiler]  I found the game fascinating for this reason. This quality of the game gave the title of the game some depth. I thought that the nature of the game stuck to its title. The game is definitely unique in the respect of bringing gameplay to the table that hasn't been recycled over and over again. \n\nThird question: As far as replayability is concerned, I'm going with that I'm not sure if it does have replayability. For me I didn't necessarily play this game for very long, but for the amount of time I played it I think it justified the price tag. But the light levels are something that are worth looking into for people who are potentially looking at this game and aren't necessarily sure about it. \n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nOverall I think that the game is worth at least looking into. In all of my reviews, I tell everyone who gets this far to have a look at it. Don't take what I have to say and just go out and buy it. You should go look up videos, or look up other reviews. You and I might not have the same tastes as far as games are concerned.

The following 7 hours of gameplay left my heart beating a little faster as I snuck, tricked, and bolted my way for the exit. I found all the levels to be interesting and fun except that one level at the end with too many moving parts where I died a lot and if you've played you know what I'm talking about. My biggest complaint about the game was just that your character is limited to only facing 8 different directions which makes creating effective distractions at the right place a little difficult sometimes.

Katakomben?) und versucht, den Ausgang zu erreichen, ohne dass man auf rote .... ich sag jetzt mal Stacheln, tritt, oder von einem Verfolger erwischt wird. Wenn man L\u00e4rm macht, kann man sich besser orientieren, die Gegner finden einen daf\u00fcr aber auch leichter bzw. schneller bzw. verdammt schnell. Zus\u00e4tzlich gibt es noch gelbe Fl\u00e4chen, Schalter, und blaue Fl\u00e4chen, Wasser, das einem durch Unmengen an L\u00e4rm, wenn man darin schwimmt, das Leben schwer macht. \n\nAbgesehen von der etwas beschr\u00e4nkten Anzahl an Gegnern (Verfolger, \"Todesringe\", t\u00f6dliche Fl\u00e4chen) hab ich nicht allzu viel zu kritisieren, da es trotzdem abwechslungsreich genug ist. Kein Spiel, das man in einem Satz durchspielt, eher was f\u00fcr zwischendurch. Es ist haupts\u00e4chlich ein Puzzle-Game, mit leichtem Horror-Feeling, Klaustrophobie und \"Hilflosigkeit\" als Bonus. Gut, die Level sind (relativ) kurz, das ist hier auch h\u00e4ufig kritisiert worden. Aber da ein Fehler das virtuelle Ende bedeutet, w\u00e4re es eher frustrierend, wenn sie l\u00e4nger w\u00e4ren. 40 dunkle und 40 helle Level (plus Geheimnisse) f\u00fcr 3\u20ac bzw. (dank eines Sales) 2\u20ac finde ich fair, es ist immerhin ein Casual-Game. Letztendlich kann ich es eigentlich jedem, der auf Puzzler steht, empfehlen. Fans von klassischem 3D-Horror eher weniger, ist eher was f\u00fcr Puristen. Ach ja, etwas hab ich noch vergessen, den Schwierigkeitsgrad: Die ersten 40 Level sind, abgesehen von vielleicht 2 bis 3 Ausnahmen eher leicht. In der zweiten H\u00e4lfte zieht der Schwierigkeitsgrad merklich an, wirklich schwierig sind aber \"nur\" die letzten 10 der 80 Level.

This type of game is somewhat unique but isn't an original idea. It has been done before but not in this atmospheric horror fashion. Frankly I didn't feel the atmosphere that everyone talked about in the reviews. It was more annoying than anything. The game is trying to challenge you with certain aspects but it just ends up being boring (when you get to the stealth portions of the game you'll see what I mean).\n   The horror factor isn't all that great either. The reason other indie horror games (Take FNAF for example) are actually scary is because they always keep you on your toes. You always know that there's a monster right outside your door and you have .25 seconds to react. In this game you only feel annoyed by the enemies; like their purpose is just to distract you from your goal, rather than trying to eat you.\n   This game was a nice concept, the sound of footsteps to show paths combined with atmospheric horror, but it just didn't seem to live up to its potential.

Dark Echo is a brilliant mobile game that managed it's way to Steam. The game is minimalistic at best and was created in a short 48 hours for Ludum Dare's Minimalism Contest eventually placing second place. Out of 1600 entries. This is a much more refined and improved version.\n\nThis game creates horror and suspense, being one of the most creepy games I've played so far, all while retaining it's simplicity.\n\nThe game starts  out by placing you in the footsteps of a blind person alone in the dark. It doesn't give you a clue where you are, what do you encounter and who are you. It is all up to your imagination.\n\nSee those red lines chasing you? You don't know who they are. Could be a monster, a zombie or maybe even a serial killer.

Dark Echo vient de Vancouver (la Colombie Britannique). Il est le fruit du travail de 2 d\u00e9veloppeurs ayant une petite exp\u00e9rience tourn\u00e9e sur le mobile. \n\nDark Echo offre un concept original que l'on manipule rarement : le son et sa propagation, bien s\u00fbr (ou malheureusement) vous n'interagissez pas au travers de l'acoustique mais de la repr\u00e9sentation visuelle des \u00ab ondes \u00bb. Ondes qui ne se propagent pas comme une vaguelette \u00e0 la surface de l'eau, mais comme des segments rectilignes tangent \u00e0 leur source. \n\nDark Echo est sympathique, la difficult\u00e9 est longue \u00e0 se mettre en train mais elle finit par d\u00e9bouler. Les obstacles sont assez vari\u00e9s : [list][*]trouver le chemin vers la sortie (c'est simple); [*]ouvrir l'\u0153il et ne pas se prendre les pi\u00e8ges qui ne se r\u00e9v\u00e8lent qu'au dernier moment;[*]Ne pas attirer les entit\u00e9s qui r\u00e9agissent aux bruits;[*]utiliser les m\u00e9canismes d'ouvertures de passages (qui \u00e9mettent toujours du son); [*]se mouvoir \u00e0 la bonne vitesse et emprunter les bonne trajectoire pour esquiver les dangers.[/list]\nVous pouvez marcher ou courir, l'un \u00e9met juste un peu moins de bruit que l'autre, il y a \u00e9galement des surfaces qui propagent le son diff\u00e9remment, ou encore passer sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui \u00e9mettent un bruit d'une nature diff\u00e9rente (de l'eau).\n\nC'est une exp\u00e9rience que je recommande, simple et novatrice. Cependant, il offre certaines imperfections forts tristes. Malgr\u00e9 sa brievt\u00e9, il flirt un peu trop avec la rep\u00e9titivit\u00e9. Le design est typ\u00e9 mais trop peu vari\u00e9 (FOTONICA est un bel exemple de style minimaliste et peu vari\u00e9 qui pourtant domine tr\u00e8s bien ce probl\u00e8me).  Sur mobile, \u00e7a doit \u00eatre du plus bel effet, mais apr\u00e8s plusieurs minutes a t\u00e2tonner pour trouver sa voie, la r\u00e9ussite d'un niveau se solde par un violent flash blanc sur la totalit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9cran. Ce qui br\u00fble votre r\u00e9tine habitu\u00e9e \u00e0 une clart\u00e9 moindre...\nLes bruits de pas bouclent sur un seul son (ou pas beaucoup plus)...\n\nFinalement, je pense qu'avec un tel concept les d\u00e9veloppeurs auraient du aller plus loin (mais il n'est pas trop tard), une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration proc\u00e9durale serait parfaite \u2014 vous ne verrez jamais tout une carte mais apr\u00e8s \u00eatre mort 3 fois vous savez comment \u00e9viter les difficult\u00e9s. Cr\u00e9er ses propres niveaux via un Workshop, se concentrer un peu plus sur l'aspect labyrinthique et sur les pi\u00e8ges naturels...\n\nAvec Dark Echo, j'ai envie de penser : \u00ab Ce n'est qu'un aurevoir ? \u00bb[quote][h1]N'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 r\u00e9agir, que ce soit pour une question ou pour signaler une erreur[/h1][/quote] [table][tr][th]-

BOY! I HAD TO GET IT!\n\nIt's the exact same game as the original, but with VR support and crisper textures, the game also has kept the silky smooth framerate of the original and some of the 2D enemies have been replaced with 3D models which look nice, but an option to choose between the 3D versions or the classic 2D ones would have been nice, although I'm not too fussed.\n\nThe Katamari Hospital DLC is also included here, so if you loved that? well you'll be happy with this. Overall there is not much more I can say about the HD version since it's essentially the same game, but it definitely looks nicer, and the VR support is always welcomed!", "timestamp_created": 1521474617, "timestamp_updated": 1521474617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40909344": {"recommendationid": "40909344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015890349", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 720, "last_played": 1521651038}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is really creepy and cute at most aspects. Compare to the original version, this renewed version actually worth to buy. Mostly all Specimen become high detailed, get fixes for their most bugs and unintended mechanics, the dev also provides some of the unknown ones with brand new introduction rooms in endless mode of the game. Karamari Hospital DLC is included in the game just as all the monsters there which can be encountered in endless mode as well. The health regeneration after taking damage is significantly high. All the Specimen got their righteous balance changes unlike the ones in the original game. The atmosphere in both the original story and in Karamari Hospital are very similar. The game has got rich with additional rooms with tricky dead ends, especially if the player is chased by an illusionist or manipulative kind of Specimen. Sometimes when you encounter a Specimen after the first time, the music does not play. This way you can be attacked without warning. I don't know if it's a bug, but it actually gives you a hard time to be aware from any Specimen. All types of Specimen monsters require a unique strategy to escape. If some of those are chasing you at once, you really need to improvise and keep them in bay by react enough fast to their movement and behavior. Later on, this game is going to be updated with a brand new map editor and Specimen creator which just sounds as promising as how awesome the updates were this far.

I originally found this game on gamejolt back before it was finished and decided to give it a go. I then completed the 1.0 version of the game when it was released. When this came out I immediately picked it up.\nFirst off this is not the original game, you can still play that one for free on steam if you'd like to try the game on its old engine. This game however is a complete remaster of the game done in Unity which makes it look a lot less like DOOM and more like a proper 3D game. It also added multiple improvements to the core game as well.\nThis game starts out rather lighthearted but over time grows more and more frightening. While all of the different monsters in the game are rather predictable and easy to figure out that doesn't mean it's not terrifying to meet each one for your first playthrough.\nThe game's story is rather bland but the descriptions and info based around the spooky inhabitants you'll meet are quite well written. Each one was awesome to discover and go up against in their own charming way. Not to mention that there is some truly terrifying moments in this game, and I usually don't get spooked by stuff even with all the horror games I play.\nI highly recommend this game to all people who love horror and I can easily give it an 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1518401055, "timestamp_updated": 1518401055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39974547": {"recommendationid": "39974547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396352822", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519940073}, "language": "english", "review": "While I like the original, I also like the HD renovation. \nI really liked this and I am hoping for the Create Your Own Mansion mode to come out!\nPros: Health recovers a lot quicker, some of the worthy specimens got nerfed abit (such as Lisa, White Face, etc), and Endless Mode lets you have the sword!\nI also somewhat like the fact two specimens can chase you at once in EM.

All in all, I consider [i]HD Renovation[/i] to be the definitive edition of [i]Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion[/i]. \n\nWhile you can still (as of this writing) play the original version for free here on Steam (or even on sites like Game Jolt), if you liked the original game, I'd recommend getting this version for the reasons stated above and also to support the developers.

The title is ironic.[/b]\n\nNow that I have that out of my system, let's actually start talking about the game.\n\nSpooky's Jump Scare Mansion was originally a free to play game titled Spooky's House of Jump Scares.  Due to some legal drama, they decided to change names.  As the HD Renovation implies, this game is an improved version of that free game.  [b]If you are unsure about buying this game, go ahead and try out the original.  Just be aware that there are a lot of problems that have been fixed in the Renovated version.[/b]  What are some of the changes?  Glad you asked.  The entire game was rebuilt in Unity, meaning it looks and runs smoother.  Controllers have improved support (although remapping on my PS4 controller doesn't seem to work.  Worked around this with Big Picture Mode).  The original game's DLC is provided at no extra cost.  Most importantly, you no longer get stuck trying to turn around corners.\n\nThe main gameplay has you wandering a procedurally generated maze, while learning to survive against a variety of monsters.  Along the way, you will pick up notes from previous victims of the mansion, that serve to create a narrative.  About every 50 to 100 rooms, you will find unique rooms that look like they've been pulled from other games or creepy pasta.  For example, you find a room that is textured like Majora's Mask on the N64, and need to deal with a monster that looks like he would be at home in that game.\n\nAnd about those monsters.  The most fun aspect of the game is learning the patterns of each monster.  Every one of them feels threatening, and some feature unique and disturbing game over screens.  Some monsters will require you to maintain a specific distance from them, while another might require constant eye contact.  While you initially meet each monster in a unique location, they will begin to show up randomly as you progress.  Every monster also has some lore that can be found in game.  It's a nice touch.\n\nVisually, this game is hard to describe.  It blends cute with horrific.  The textures aren't always the best to look at, but it lends character to the setting.  The unique rooms where monsters are introduced are the highlights of the game.  When it comes to audio, this game does things pretty good.  It sets the mood with your typical horror sounds while having some neat tunes for the monsters.  It would have been nice if the soundtrack were included in Renovation, but you can purchase as dlc for the free game.\n\nWhile I've mainly spoken positively, there are a few complaints I have.  The game can go far too long without anything interesting.  Especially early on, when the game doesn't want to chase you as frequently, but the new monsters are spaced out pretty far apart.  It can get boring when the game generates the same rooms several times in a short amout of time, in particular, when they are long rooms with only one exit.  Going along with repetition, sometimes you'll encounter some monsters a little too frequently.  Also, the game kills you for standing still too long, which is fine, but it's annoying when you die while trying to adjust your settings.\n\nIs this game worth ten dollars?  I don't think it is for everyone.  However, I was willing to pay full price, because I saw how the developers responded to their playerbase.  [b]Albino Moose Games may be the most open and courteous developers I've ever seen.[/b]  I've never seen them speak down to players, and they respond to many of the comments they get.  They have put a ton of work and love into both versions of this game, and I have no problem supporting that.  They are always adding new things, and fixing what breaks.  I really appreciate them.\n\n[b]So, here's the 'skinny:' if you are looking for a game where you learn an increasing number of monster's behaviors, and you don't mind some repetition along the way, this is the game for you![/b]\n\nPS: The Karamari Hospitol DLC is a bit more of a straightforward survival horror experience, featuring it's own set of monsters, if that's what you're looking for.", "timestamp_created": 1511393352, "timestamp_updated": 1511393352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36845040": {"recommendationid": "36845040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008597087", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511391264}, "language": "english", "review": "1000 rooms of excuses I could make to not do this for the badge.", "timestamp_created": 1511391175, "timestamp_updated": 1511391175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36830647": {"recommendationid": "36830647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170170591", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 83, "last_played": 1520914459}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a game worth 10$.

Overall the redundancy it relies on for jumpscares hurts the fun overall.\n\nI recommend it, but at a price closer to $2, rather than a full $10; and I also feel like 3-4 hours could be spent better elsewhere.  There's a lot of great games, and this is an alright experience.\n\n*Note : haven't played DLC, but played the entirety of the base game.*", "timestamp_created": 1509785615, "timestamp_updated": 1509785615, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427745", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36243588": {"recommendationid": "36243588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048200235", "num_games_owned": 1015, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510588217}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, 10 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0437 1000 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442.\n\nHD \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0438.\n\u0413\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442 - \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 1000 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0422\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0441 \u0444\u0435\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438.\n\nP.S. \u041a\u0443\u043a\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043c \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c, \u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e", "timestamp_created": 1509719992, "timestamp_updated": 1509719992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592031", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36230539": {"recommendationid": "36230539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345581483", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509800681}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is way better than it looks!", "timestamp_created": 1509670680, "timestamp_updated": 1509670680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36210831": {"recommendationid": "36210831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290607660", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520032529}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played this game for less than an hour and am already at 300 rooms.

With twenty-three unique monsters spread across three different modes, each offering a different taste of both horror and exploration, the game has quite a bit of longevity given that Endless Mode may very well give you the same monster over and over again. While such a quality is rather irritating, it is offset by the encounters lasting shorter amounts of time (or at the very least, it seems like it) and the mandatory addition of a new monster every 100~ rooms.

Anyways, here's my review of Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion!\n\nThis game (originally called Spooky's House of Jumpscares) is a fun, challenging, and scary game set in a mansion. I won't spoil anything in this review so I'll just list my pros and cons below!\n\nPros:\n-The game does an amazing job of doing what it describes in the title!\n-There are a total of 1000 rooms with different types of \"scares\"\n-Save points included!\n-A completely diferent area of the mansion is accessible through another gamemode\n-Endless mode with a leaderboard so you can show off how far you've gotten (my favorite!)\n-We got achievements! {Which means I have to beat the game again to get a few...)\n-It has VR support\n-Multiple different \"specimens\" to meet!\n\nCons:\n-Not sure if this is intended, but the wooden cardboard cutouts come out of non-existing walls (even in the other version on Steam), like rails. It does however help with the jumpscaring!\n-Endless mode can sometimes be a drag with certain rooms\n\nOverall, it's one of my most favorite \"horror\" games that I enjoy playing. I'll defintely be trying to get a perfect game with this one!\n\n10/10 would get scared by a wooden donut again", "timestamp_created": 1509006135, "timestamp_updated": 1509006308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725778", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35990280": {"recommendationid": "35990280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298882680", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514907956}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game that was made by 2 people", "timestamp_created": 1508942711, "timestamp_updated": 1508942711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484523", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35926324": {"recommendationid": "35926324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036751542", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509817289}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a cute and horrifying game.", "timestamp_created": 1508691799, "timestamp_updated": 1508691799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524687", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35752277": {"recommendationid": "35752277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165603610", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516935516}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely good game, especially if you haven't played the free version!", "timestamp_created": 1508084925, "timestamp_updated": 1508084925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577864", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35483996": {"recommendationid": "35483996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000797544", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509024634}, "language": "koreana", "review": "[h1]\ubb34\ub8cc\ud310\uc758 \uc7ac\ud0d5, \uc544\uae30\uc790\uae30\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uace8\ub54c\ub9ac\ub294 \uac8c\uc784;[/h1]\n\n\uc774\ub7f0 \ubd84\ub4e4\uaed8 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \"\uae34\uc7a5\uac10\uc774 \uc2ec\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc2eb\ub2e4\", \"\uacf5\ud3ec\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc740\ub370 \ub108\ubb34 \ubb34\uc11c\uc6b4\uac74 \uc2eb\ub2e4\".. \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\uba54\uc774\ucee4\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc800\uc6a9\ub7c9 \uacf5\ud3ec \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

It has humor, cheesy characters and yet a good story at the same time. Theres not much bad about this game. So, If what i just said is true, why am i downvoting it? Because its not the one thing I expected: An improvement.\nSure the graphics are a step up but they themselves arnet that big of a change. The only new feature was 3D models for some stuff that you dont pay much attention to. I mean I didnt expect the graphics to be like EA's graphics but the developers didnt change the look of the enviroment at all. Maybe a few new rooms but other than that its the same thing as the completely free version. (Also the trailer has worse editing in comparison to the old games trailer, where this one was morew focused on the sligtly improved enemies but the old trailer was focused on overal gameplay.)\n\nOverall, If your new to this game and havent played the old free version, Get this game and have fun. Im sure you will. But If you played the old version, just click off. Theres no new content other than the mansion builder which isnt even out yet.\n\nEDIT: After playing the game I noticed that textures were modified but it wasnt very noticable. Its bacically a small graphics update from the old free game with a few small non graphical features.", "timestamp_created": 1499031144, "timestamp_updated": 1521408502, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33140428": {"recommendationid": "33140428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267702373", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518123154}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the original game and I must say that I am disappointed that it took me so long to buy this version of it.  This game in its nature has more beauty in its animations then its predecessor to the point where I had to stare at my pursuers even as I ran away.  \n\nSpecimen 2 alone shocked me with its new animation rising from its puddle.  Specimen 3 got the jump on me as for the first time I saw it fall from the ceiling in front of me (however failing to corner me).  Specimen 4's new school confused me at first, as I expected the rooms to be the same.  Specimen 5's animation alone had me staring for a while.  And so on, and so on.  \n\nI never thought the changes would amaze me so.  Even the note mechanics have changed, allowing for a more realistic and comforting view.  Overall, I would say the changes I witnessed so far make the game generally more difficult.  For example, I used to find comfort in that I would only see Specimen 3 once, as I rarely saw him later in the game.  Now I see all the specimens in a nice even mix that always surprises me.  Even Specimen 2's ink stains nearly caught me off guard before I learned you were slightly faster when you sprinted in them, and Specimens 3 has cornered me at a locked door.\n\nBut at the same time, it feels like little has changed, in a good way.  It still has that soft child feel walking in before the fun starts and notes are written word for word.  It feels like the same game, but the next step up.  For example, Calamari Hospital has changed very little overall due to the models already having true animations and 3D builds, but at the same time there are new rooms in the main game which can catch players off guard, such as labs, observation chambers, and what would this house of horrors be without it's occasional door into a wall?\n\nThis isn't even a finished game.  If the developers continue as they have, who knows what could be in store for this game?  There are few games I could come back to repeatedly such as this one's predecessor.

It's better in every way possible, except for the death screens, which are not nearly as smooth. Hopefully that'll get fixed soon but anyhow, I have a message I want to direct to some of you people.\n\nYes, this game is harder than the original. The specimen have actually been balanced, where-as the original was more just a bunch of concepts tossed into a really bad sandbox. Especially Endless Mode, it's been severely revamped to the point of posing an actual, genuine challenge. Don't be that idiot who goes \"WOW THE DEVS SUCK WTF MAN THIS GAME IS JUST BAD U RUINED IT\" because you suck at a game. You need to re-learn some of the specimen and you need to actually get good, a concept some people seem to have trouble wrapping their head around.\n\nIs this a perfect game? Absolutely not, I love it and all but it's certainly nothing to start wars over. It's just a cute and fun little game that's really nice to play, especially given the current state of gaming. Worth the price? It could honestly be charged for more and I'd be fine with it.

I've been with SJSM since the beginning, the good old days when it had a correct title (Spooky's House of Jump Scares) and had not fallen prey to a group of ignorant German developers who make unoriginal mobile games. Man, that was awful.\n\nBut anyway, onto the review. Now I already said I love this game, but for God's sake, don't make me pay $10 just to play it again with slightly better lighting and 3D models! When the remake was first announced, I was super excited, and all of the pre-release footage looked great.\n\nAnd then came the waiting. The game was supposed to be released on December 25, 2016. It got pushed to February 17, 2017, which I was okay with. If the game needs improvements, let it have its improvements. But when February 17 came around, it got delayed AGAIN to February 24. I was disappointed, but waited patiently. And then it happened AGAIN, delayed to March 1. At this point I was at my limit, but I was happy to see it was finally released on March 1st.\n\nI installed it, eagerly pressed play, and expected miracles. Here's where the REAL review begins.\n\nFirst of all, the main menu is a HUGE step up from what it previously was. In the old version, you could only use arrow keys to select things on menus, but now mouse support has been added, along with the main menu's background being completely recreated in 3D, which I personally found awesome.\n\nBut then, (sigh), I actually started playing the game itself. My first disappointment came from the fact that Spooky didn't have her own 3D model. I guess they said that SPECIMEN would get 3D models, and never mentioned Spooky, but come on. She's practically the game's mascot, for crying out loud. So I pushed that thought aside and began running through the 1000 rooms. After about 100 rooms through, it hit me.\n\n[i]It's exactly the same as the old version.[/i]\n\nWell, not EXACTLY. For example, there are new rooms, the Specimen have 3D models, lighting has been drastically improved on, but it just didn't satisfy me! As I sped through the rooms, I ranted on and on about stupid little details the *awesome* devs could have added. Color interpolation between pixels! How the sprinting speed had been slightly slowed! And the only other thing in the game that's even REMOTELY close to something you couldn't create with GameObjects in Unity is the Brain Room (which is the kind of quality I expected from the rest of the game). tl;dr, the game was too simple for Unity.\n\nThere are some really good-looking games that run on Unity. The Forest, Stranded Deep, Cities: Skylines... but all I see in the SJSM: HD Renovation is cubes and an occasional cylinder. I know there's one more DLC coming for the game, and I really hope it's as good (if not better, and somewhat longer) than Karamari Hospital. Oh, and for everyone's sakes, make use of more 3D models, like in KH. The ones in KH were lowpoly, sure, but they were clearly not cubes.\n\nBut I suppose I've said enough bad stuff about a game I sincerely love. Specimen 6 is a little more challenging than before. I like that. The 3D models for the specimen are great, Specimen 2 looks awesome (if not a bit taller than it originally was) Specimen 3 is the perfect balance between scary and hilarious, Specimen 4 takes on a revamped look, 5 fits with the area's theme perfectly, 6 looks perfect... I could carry on for a long time.\n\nSo basically, what I'm saying is this: if you're interested in the game and want to try it out, get the free version and buy Karamari Hospital. You're getting pretty much the same game with an astounding DLC that the HD Renovation doesn't currently support. If you end up really liking the game, than go ahead and buy the HD Renovation--just don't expect many new things at all besides a new DLC that should be arriving some time in the next 100 years (that's the best estimate I can make \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af ).\n\nAnd before I go, let me just state again that I really, truly admire this game in all ways possible--its story, art style, gameplay, etc. It's just that this version didn't quite deliver what I had in mind, but from reading all of their posts and updates, I can see that they went through some serious crap to get this version up and going. So many kudos to them for that.\n\nJust remember, you two... that next DLC. It BETTER be good.\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S. Next time you guys make an amazing game, don't cram 2 billion files into one asset package.

It seems curiosity got the better of you, that and being a history enthusiast, to see what it has in store.\n\nThe rest is about the mansion, told by various notes, Spooky herself, or by other means. Other than knowing others have ventured in before, you get information on the monsters called Specimens with their respected number. If you are going to encounter it, there will be a note from someone who came into contact with it. Every once in a while a computer will show up, CAT_DOS, that has files on the specimens. Whether if they are active, the method they use to kill, fatalities they caused, and a brief history on them.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nSpooky's Jump Scare Mansion no doubt has a slow build-up. Going through around 100 rooms picking up the occasional note or Specimen 1, the cutout, popping out. Essentially bringing in the sense of the mansion not being as dangerous as it seems...until the dangerous specimens come out and play. Specimen 2 is used as a way to show how the Specimens will generally work. You do have an option to turn off jumpscares and Specimens if you are too scares or just want to go through the story without Specimens getting in the way.\n\nTo put it simply, running through rooms is most of the gameplay, it is simplistic but charming the way it was worked in. The main rooms you will see is jumbled up and randomly selected with some being exceptions. These exceptions being Specimen specific rooms, save rooms, or a variety based on whether or not you are being chased. Of course, deep in you will be speeding through these rooms but it is nice to see a lot of variety they put into the rooms, especially with the new designed ones in this HD version.\n\nEvery Specimen will be encountered at least once in their respective room than a chance to show up later. Each having their own queue of music, having a 50% chance of activating, and static with some Specimens. Once they become aware of you, Specimens will show what they are made of with the gimmicks they have. Most somewhat having some way of inhibiting your movement while others wastes no time to show you their own death screen. Such as Specimen 2 (Ink Boy) leaving Ink that slows you down and Specimen 6 (Happy Puppet Salesman) only attacking when you are not looking at him but he can certainly leave and appear behind you. Only two is area specific, so rest easy as only 10 will follow. Along with Specimens are minor enemies. While these are far and few between, these do play a part in the lore.\n\nEach Specimen is inspired by something, whether it is something broad or narrowed down to one game or source. The most recognizable being Specimen 4 (Ringu),  inspired by Japanese horror and RPGs like Corpse Party or Ju-on: The Grudge, and Specimen 6, inspired by The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask sharing expressions of the Mask Salesman and referencing Ben Drowned in it's backstory.\n\nLastly, the minigames have appeared in the mansion! These minigames appear as three arcade machines featuring Spooky. One similar to Pac-Man (Mrs. Spook), one similar to Mario Kart (Spooky Kart), and is just killing as many people you want to before a meter runs out (Mall of Spook). The last one? That's a secret you have to figure out.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThe soundtrack is great. There is about three distinguishable tracks when not being chased and they fit ambience of the mansion very well. Cycling them in a way that makes you suspicious of your surroundings as you go deeper. The Specimen soundtracks can be forgettable, especially when you do not encounter them for the remainder of the game or till way later. There are some that stick in your head such as Specimen 8's (Deer God) and Specimen 4's but you will generally know a Specimen is after you based on the music change or getting hit.\n\nThe sound effects do seem to go on the realistic side. From doors opening to being attacked sounds, or close to, what it would probably sound like. Especially the clicks of Specimen 3 creeping on you.\n\n[h1]Art Style[/h1]\nWith switching from Gamemaker 8 to Unity more creativity can flow into the game. We have some new rooms and new lighting to work. I do find weird the bones are the same 2d graphics, but the Specimens are the main attraction. While some still have a 2d feel, they have been improved by the colors. The already 3d Specimens do have more of that feel in this version. More body to work with. One of the most noticeable is Specimen 11 (Burger Demon) that seems to have a crown of fire since we last saw it.\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\nSpooky's Jump Scare Mansion: HD Renovation performs quite well despite the change of game engines. There is only one thing, the sensitivity for controllers does not change despite changing the settings for it.\n\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\nRight now, replayability is dependent on how much the player wants to see. If you want to see all the endings, see all the death screens, or find all the secrets you can easy get close or to there with passwords. These passwords certainly encourages you to replay which is greatly appreciated with how many floors there are to go through.\n\nKaramari Hospital, Endless Mode, and Build Your Own Mansion is planned to be implemented sometime in the near future to add more replayability. I'm sure I am not the only one waiting anxiously to see it in the renovation.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n+ Soundtrack\n+ Specimen creativity\n+ Charming gameplay\n\n+/- Has that feel of being in Early Access (partly due to features available in the original not being available at first such as the minigames)\n\nWhether it be the HD Renovation or the original, Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion is a great game. When I heard it was going to be remade, I was enthusiastic as I loved the original but never got around playing the dlc or added content. If you are on the rope for the renovation, you can always play the original and can wait for the additional content to be added, one being dlc. The dev team is wonderful as they work to fix bugs as soon as they can, most being solved by the time I started playing, and interact with their fanbase. I highly recommend Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion: HD Renovation and go through all 1,000 floors yourself.\n\nLet's just hope Specimen 6 shows up only once in a playthrough...\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1490123682, "timestamp_updated": 1490123682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30624845": {"recommendationid": "30624845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072421557", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488643377}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u89c9\u5f97\u633a\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6162\u6162\u6709\u70b9\u6050\u6016\u4e86\uff0cB\u7ad9\u4e0a\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u4f53\u9a8c\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u77ac\u95f4\u5c31\u8fc7\u4e07\u4e86\u3002http://www.bilibili.com/video/av8986643/", "timestamp_created": 1489959264, "timestamp_updated": 1489959264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.414201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30560822": {"recommendationid": "30560822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153386078", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513799222}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite the fact that the original is usually better.

Things you can interact with in the rooms are fairly obvious, and I never felt like I was lost or stuck. There always seems to be a way forward just nearby, and the game just flows in a satisfying way without becoming monotonous.\n\nThe checkpoint system is such that you will sometimes, though not excessively, have to play through a large area repeatedly. The specimens (enemies) can sometimes be tricky to avoid, and I got frustrated a few times when I thought I was doing it right. There are hints scattered around the rooms on how to handle each one.\n\nThe music is excellent but not intrusive. Music transitions from room to room, and is not merely atmospheric. There are intermittent ambient noises. Each specimen has a musical theme, and one in particular utters threatening taunts. Jumpscares are accompanied by scary, bizarre or funny sounds.\n\nI played with a controller. There are annoyances when trying to select menu items. I had to tap the stick back and forth to highlight something. Moving, turning, and strafing in first-person is very fluid, and you will be doing a lot of all three.\n\nThe game actually is scary, though somehow also relaxing and hypnotic. There are nods to games like Silent Hill, Amnesia, Alien, and probably others I didn't catch.\n\nJust as I began to think I'd seen all the game had to offer, it offered a surprise or joke that piqued my interest again. I thought the ending was okay. It's not exactly memorable, but the journey was worth it.\n\nIs it worth $10 when you can play a free version? I think so.

The devs also seems very motivated and they have fixed a number of bugs in the few days Spooky was out.\n\nUnfortunatly I cannot recommend this game. You are in a randomized maze of a thousands rooms and you must get to the end, all while sometime being chased by monsters. Some rooms are fixed, such as the checkpoints or the place where you encounter new creatures. Those rooms where you encounter new creatures are pretty well done and deliciously creepy.\n\nHowever, the game randomizations work against it and it end up being a 1000-door rush toward the exit. There's absolutly no reason not to run toward the room's exit as soon as you enter, even without a monster behind you. As for the creatures themselves most are just humanoid entity running toward you and hurting you when close enought. There is some escalations in the power of the monster which make you fear what the next part of the maze hold. But after the puppet, you realize that no monsters even come close to being as dangerous and that the new gimmicks are just filters over the screen or are just massively slowing you down. For exemple, there's some creature which you have to stay close to, or else it go insane and start to go extremly fast. It could be interessing if this monster was moving erratically and you had to pay attention to its movement, or if he was paired with another monster, but since it keep moving at the same slugish speed, this just make the whole thing tedious instead of scary. \n\nThe story was nothing amazing either.\n\nMaybe the hospital and future update will change my opinion about this game but I doubt it.", "timestamp_created": 1488983867, "timestamp_updated": 1488983867, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30388892": {"recommendationid": "30388892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123548616", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488970569}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0417\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443, \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b \u043f\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c, \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0439, \u0441\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0447\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b \u0438\u043d\u0444\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u0447\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0435\u043c, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0441 \u0434\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u044b, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0447\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0436\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044e\u0434\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u044f \u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 3 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0438 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044b\u043c \u0448\u0443\u043c\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0433\u043b\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u043a\u043e \u0432\u044b\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0447\u0442\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0443, \u043c\u043e\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0438 \u044f \u0441 \u0434\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0432\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043c \u0443\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0438 \u0432\u044b\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0443\u043b \u043d\u043e\u0443\u0442\u0431\u0443\u043a. \n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440, \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044c! \n10 \u043e\u0431\u0433\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0448\u0435\u043a \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1488970966, "timestamp_updated": 1488970966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30388677": {"recommendationid": "30388677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338773226", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509268442}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, guys, it's very cool ... and scary!

I loved the original and was blown away by how good the Karamari Hospital DLC is.\nBut... this left me disappointed.\nI support the developer on Patreon, and so have received regular updates about this \"HD remake\", and this led me to have much higher hopes.\nIt honestly just feels like a mod. A good mod, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't feel like it's changed enough to warrant repackaging & selling.\nIt honestly feels like the same deal as Overwatch - paying for an incomplete, early-access game branded as complete.\nSpooky's is one of my all-time favourite horror games that still scares me even today, but the problem with this \"HD remake\" is that while it does add some new things, it also breaks other things and leaves them incomplete, and what it does well has the unfortunate side-effect of making those screwups all the more glaring.\n\nOnly a few specimens have been updated with new models, but this doesn't exactly matter as the chases are still repetitive and give you next to no reason to ever turn around and look at what's chasing you, and they pretty much all kill you in the same way - a few scratches popping up on the screen to indicate damage. Just run, and you're fine. You could go a whole playthrough never looking at more than one or two specimens.\nA good way to solve this would be to make 3D models for EVERY specimen, then add some form of puzzles or even just key-hunting, to give an element of panic. Also, make all the specimens move faster. They don't have to all move as fast as Specimen 3, but they should all at least have varying speeds higher than that of the player's walking speed. It makes no sense that you can outwalk them; you could get a good feeling of pressure by forcing us to ration our stamina for sprinting away.\nThe Amnesia puzzle? Figuring out hiding spots and getting the keys in Specimen 12? Those were great; do more of that! Especially in the school, where you clearly put in effort making larger rooms.\nAlso, Specimen 10's 2nd form moves TOO fast. Slow him down just a little bit.\nThe specimens in general need to have a reason for us to be afraid, not just because \"the sprite / model is sliding toward you and will scratch you to death\". We have to be in more of a panic to get away from them, but simply sprinting through room after room and never looking at them gets very old very fast.\n\nThe rooms have been updated, and some - especially the new ones - look very nice. However, this also doesn't matter as there is still no point to looking at anything. You can just run through a room and click any door, and it won't make a difference. My suggestion to fix this would be to have more interactivity or puzzles, or to have every door in a room be slightly different to give you a rough idea of what to expect in the next room. For example, either a specimen chase or a puzzle to solve, or a completely random room like what every door currently does.\n\nSeveral elements of the game have also been either removed or broken entirely.\nFor example: When in the Silent Hill area, there's a room with an unexplained sperm-like sprite. In the original game, this thing would thrash around with the demonic sound of a shrieking baby. It was VERY disturbing. But in this version of the game, the sprite just sits there not doing anything.\nAlso when Specimen 12 is patrolling the rooms, you used to be able to tell via an audio cue when he had entered & left, so you knew when it was safe to leave. That's no longer the case. When you're hiding in the tunnels, he used to have a fairly audible whisper that was quite haunting. That's gone. When he chases you toward the end, he also used to have a terrifying wail before the chase began. That's also gone.\n\nIn its current form, I cannot recommend this HD version of Spooky's.\nWhen it's seen some updates, if the problems have been fixed, I'll replay it and perhaps update my review to recommend it, but as it is, can't recommend.\nBUT - I do want the developer to be supported, so my advice to players would be to get the original free version on Steam, then buy the Karamari Hospital DLC.

Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion. The new features that are added bring the experience of actually not having to use a mouse and keyboard and being able to run the game on a Intel laptop. (For me that is.)\nI'm really impressed with the controls for the gamepad.\nAnd what I love about HD Renovation is how it still feels and plays the same as before, why fix what isn't broken right?\n\nHowever, there are a few things I need to mention which may contain spoilers.\n\n\n\nI have a feeling that this game isn't really \"HD\" because the textures mostly look the same as before but blurrier.\nAlso some things in this game feel lazy to me, some of the specimens don't have their movement animations and come off weird to me. And in some rooms, there's no animation at all and they stick out.\nMy last few nitpicks is the options menu, I feel that it may throw people off balance because of how confusing it is but then again I'm happy to have these options. Also is it just me or does the fact that there's an option of taking away the jumpscares and specimen completely ruin the experience for me?\n\n\nBut enough of my complaints.\nTDLR; This is a worthy purchase if you love the game and want a good ride of nostalgia.", "timestamp_created": 1488569666, "timestamp_updated": 1488569666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30298346": {"recommendationid": "30298346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098037910", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519059527}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435?\n\u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430,\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c 3\u0434 \u043d\u044f\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c!!!!\n\u0427\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e? \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u044f\u043a\n\u0412\u0435\u0434\u044c \u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0412\u0421\u0415 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441 3-\u0445 \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432(\u0438 \u0438\u043c \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446 \u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0438)\n\u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043b\u0438 \u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e:\u041d\u0443 \u0445\u0437 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0442\u043e \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0442\u043e \u0430\u0448\u0434\u0438\n\u041e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430:10/10 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442! \u0438 \u0441 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0443 \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432", "timestamp_created": 1488561890, "timestamp_updated": 1488611640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699160", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30297578": {"recommendationid": "30297578", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989962777", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508544551}, "language": "english", "review": "My pinkie hurts simulator", "timestamp_created": 1488558874, "timestamp_updated": 1488558874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455867", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30297557": {"recommendationid": "30297557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066353481", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490354605}, "language": "english", "review": "A mind shattering experience..\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hqipZGZsdKw", "timestamp_created": 1488558760, "timestamp_updated": 1488558760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409991", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30295970": {"recommendationid": "30295970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078120255", "num_games_owned": 911, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495046699}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember being the one of the first people to play theoriginal Spooky's House of jumpscares way back when it was a demo on Gamejolt and loving it even then and this HD Renovation has not dissapointed.

First of all, anyone that is a fan of the original Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion already knows that the game plays exactly the same. \n\nSpecimen Changes:\n\nSpecimen 1: When the player chops one of the cardboard cutouts, it gently falls to the ground.\nSpecimen 2: Specimen 2 now emerges from the pool of goop instead of spawning from the opposite door. In addition, Specimen 2 also seems to go faster, and the pool of goop slows the player down considerably. \nSpecimen 3: Specimen 3 has a graphical update and is now extremely fast. When it attacks the player it recedes a few feet back before resuming the chase. In addition, it can spawn from any hole in the ceiling. Immune to the axe.\nSpecimen 4: Specimen 4's scripted room has been extended to include more lockers. more (locked) rooms and is now two stories. Specimen 4 is notably transparent with black lines and has a noticeable shadow around her figure.\nSpecimen 5: Specimen 5 plays pretty much the same, although it moves slightly faster and it actually busts down the doors instead of opening it. The fog effect has been removed.\nSpecimen 6: Specimen 6 plays pretty much the same, although it seeingly spawns faster if the player isn't looking backwards. In addition, if Specimen 6 spawns in the room and stays there for a short period of time the strings attached to it will launch it up in the air and randomly land on the player. Immune to the axe.\nSpecimen 7: Specimen 7's rooms are now a much darker red. \nSpecimen 8: Very slow (you can outwalk it).\nSpecimen 9: No noticeable changes.\nSpecimen 10: Graphical updates and moves slightly faster.\nSpecimen 11: Graphical updates and moves slightly slower.

I'm super excited.\nSo far, so good.]\n\n[I will post a full review once my playthrough of the 1000 rooms is complete. It could take up to a week, as I want to scrutinise every little detail]\n\nUPDATE: On the verge of room 400. I would like to say well done with specimen 5(? puppet enemy) and specimen 3. 3 is very intimidating and is at the perfect speed to be almost inescapable. As an arachniphobe, it is very unsettling. However, I have 2 issues. In the update yesterday TOASTMASTER commented on the dark rooms. Sometimes they are too dark, to the level where you can't see anything. Also, the jumpscares are not as well done. This is probably because of the 3D sound. I recommend reverting the audio from the jumpscares back into 2D.\n\nUPDATE [AGAIN]: At room 750. Have started to experience a few bugs,most importantly:\n1. When specimen 10 spawns, his old self [larger worm] spawned with him\n2. When specimen 10 changes into his quick form, his doesn't change back when he attacks you OR when you ener a new room.\n3. The bug where you fell through the floor [recently patched]\nI'm liking the new Health+Stamina bar though, and also enjoyed humanoid spec 10's animation (while it lasted).", "timestamp_created": 1488400922, "timestamp_updated": 1488908969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634096", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30266908": {"recommendationid": "30266908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319570346", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "last_played": 1520980786}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games is in HD now.

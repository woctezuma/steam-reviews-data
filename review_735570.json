The game sports difficulties ranging from \"Easy-Normal-Hard\" with an overall goal to reach 60 seconds minimum in each state to unlock the hardest difficulty, \"Expert\".\n\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe visuals are very minimal, with stages consisting of 2-3 colors that have very strong contrast to each other, enhancing the minimalistic aspect of the game. There is also a strobing background during gamplay that may be disabled in the options if you find yourself experiencing any symptoms or complications while playing.\n\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nThe music is all electronic/house, with each stage containing 2-3 tracks per stage. The Easy songs are limited to the Easy stage, Normal to Normal, etc., resulting in repeating of the same songs if you're stuck on a stage.

You can unlock the higher levels once you survive for a minute in the levels before them, the game isn't that hard to understand and get into in a short amount of time, mainly just for 60 seconds on each level to \"Beat\" the levels, but if you do make these changes (Origonal music by the team, level system/campaign, levels progressivly get harder and harder in campaign, Unlock levels every 60 seconds in previous level in campaign). It would sell great and I would reccomend a price around $5.00 - $8.00 per sale, Another future update is the ability to create levels and publish for other people, the more online levels you beat with ratings make you level up through charactors which would bring players back to hit the leaderboards or something, but for a free game as of now it is pretty good for possibly up to and hour but because there isn't really any goal it gets old fast.

Especially when playing hard, the BPM of music itself is fast, and it's hard to judge the sequence of each note in a short time. It's hard to play. It's also the place where the game can be played, and the music is very pleasant.

Al\u00e9m dos cen\u00e1rios que possuem paletas de cores que combinam com o ritmo - certamente um ponto que chama a aten\u00e7\u00e3o de muitos jogadores - a presen\u00e7a de indicadores interativos foi uma das melhores sacadas para o t\u00edtulo.\nOutra coisa que vai agradar os jogadores \u00e9 sua curva de aprendizado, os primeiros 10 minutos d\u00e3o uma grande imers\u00e3o e satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o com o game.\nOutro ponto que chama aten\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a aleatoriedade nas notas a serem seguidas conforme a batida acontece, essa obriga\u00e7\u00e3o com a improvisa\u00e7\u00e3o prende jogadores ao fazer com que jogar uma m\u00fasica seja uma experi\u00eancia \u00fanica sempre.\nNo entanto, nem tudo na vida s\u00e3o flores e Project Rhombus peca ao deixar dispon\u00edveis somente 4 m\u00fasicas.\nPara ir al\u00e9m com o jogo, uma sugest\u00e3o aos desenvolvedores seria a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de efeitos visuais conforme o andamento das m\u00fasicas para assim recompensar os adeptos ao jogo. Mas talvez, por este se tratar de uma homenagem a uma passagem do jogo [i] Undertale\t[/i] acabaria perdendo um pouco de sua ess\u00eancia.\nNo final das contas, a produtora nos oferece um t\u00edtulo  que vale a pena conferir devido a divers\u00e3o que este pode proporcionar, isso tanto para os casuais quanto para os veteranos.

I cried when I played expert mode because it is so fantastic. It stunned me. I also was able to react faster than I thought possible.

Since it's just as well playable when muted, the rhythm of the music is insignificant for playing efficiently. Only the beat has a determined impact, albeit a very negligible one, and that can be quickly assessed even without listening to the music.\n\nFeaturing four energetic music tracks and clean animations, the game instantly stimulates a motivation to play well to experience the gameplay flow as long as possible. It requires a bit of training at first, since the player needs to react not to the beat but at least shortly before the beat hits. Even though the gameplay is initially misleading, adapting to the slightly off-beat controls happens faster and easier than expected.

The only thing left out is that you use arrow keys to control where you point, but I was able to figure that out from the video itself as most gamers are used to either arrow keys or WASD, so at most it should take people 2 to 3 tries to figure out how to play, maybe add one or two if they have never touched a computer before.\n\nIf you think you're going to beat this game no problem, leave. Just leave. It's a challenge. I laugh at myself when the game tricks me not with just the blue arrows that switch sides when they reach the half way point, but also the speed of the normal arrows being changed so that you miscalculate the order in which they get to you. You will be tricked over and over and over by this game.\n\nGames like this is where there isn't too too much to say about the game. You face the arrow when it hits you and if you get blindsighted, game over, try to last for 60 seconds. This is one of those games where you can't say much about it, other than it's good.

The hit box for your character is too large. If I tap when the arrows hit, it will be too late because they will have already gotten to the hit box. The screen is also way too zoomed in. I can't see the arrows in time. I understand it's part of the challenge, but normal and easy mode are too easy. I have a good sense of rythym as well as hand eye coordination. There should at least be an option to have the screen zoom out. The music is awful... in my opinion. I don't like fake music. (No offense. I just don't know what to call it.) There should be options.

The more precise you are, the more points you get. In this game, you only have the first x miliseconds to orientate the arrow before it hit.

Not saying I don't like that.\n\nAlthough plain, it is visually appealing, and me being a fan and creator of electronic music and dubstep (and the fact I like Hinkik), I love the soundtrack. The art style of the game is minimalistic but vibrant and colourful, and very sleek. It's optimized very well, and runs at 1080p60, which (unless you have a desktop or laptop that doesn't support it) should be the same for almost any PC, as it is easy to run.\n\nThe only real flaw is that the game hasn't much to offer right now, only having 4 levels of difficulty with 1 level and song each. The extreme difficulty is locked until you have achieved more than 60 seconds on each difficulty, and while fair, there is one big flaw with this game currently which affects that.\n\nWhilst only really affecting the hard difficulty, but sometimes affecting easy and normal, the beats seem almost randomly placed. The hard difficulty song doesn't even have that much higher of a BPM compared to the others, and because of this, almost desperately tries to be hard by spamming untimed notes at you to make it hard. This kind of ruins hard difficulty, and makes extreme harder to unlock as a result.\n\nBut, this game is not long released, and most flaws will (hopefully) be fixed in time. Overall, a good game with sleek and colourful art, easy to pick up and play because of simple controls, although still hard, but can get very repetitive and boring within an hour because of the lack of content. The timing is good for easy and medium, although could be better, but hard difficulty seems like a jumbled mess of notes being chucked at you in quick succession to make it hard, and a fairly average song compared to the others. I would still recommend you try this out, though, and as I said, this game has not long come out, so it should be tweaked and fixed soon enough.", "timestamp_created": 1513100361, "timestamp_updated": 1513100361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38261428": {"recommendationid": "38261428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036686092", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513099412}, "language": "koreana", "review": "'\uc775\ud788\uae30 \uc27d\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130\ud558\uae30\ub294 \uc880 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.' \uc18c\uac1c\ubb38 \ub300\ub85c\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.\n\ub098\uc5d0\uac90 10\ubd84 \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \uc7a1\uae30 \ud798\ub4e0 \uc21c\ubc1c\ub825 \uac8c\uc784. \uacc4\uc18d \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub3c4 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294\uac74 \uc544\uc27d\ub2e4.\n\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc\uc740 \uc88b\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\uac74 \ub9c8\uce58 \ub77c\uadf8\ub098\ub85c\ud06c \ud074\ub9ac\ucee4 \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uc2a4\ud300\uc5d0 \uc62c\ub77c\uc654\uc5c8\uc744\ub54c\uc640 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \ub290\ub08c..", "timestamp_created": 1513099565, "timestamp_updated": 1513099565, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38261413": {"recommendationid": "38261413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218235655", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518541058}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442)))", "timestamp_created": 1513099527, "timestamp_updated": 1513099527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38260118": {"recommendationid": "38260118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138965295", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515778884}, "language": "french", "review": "Dur mais super cool\n", "timestamp_created": 1513095712, "timestamp_updated": 1513095712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38259350": {"recommendationid": "38259350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312884496", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513958838}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game .. but you for the first try is so hardd \ngood game", "timestamp_created": 1513093390, "timestamp_updated": 1513093390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38258996": {"recommendationid": "38258996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345763863", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517325707}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "JOGO MUITO BOM\n\nMAIS TA FALTANDO MAIS NIVEIS\n\nJOGO MUITO BOM", "timestamp_created": 1513092349, "timestamp_updated": 1513092349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38258865": {"recommendationid": "38258865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153806071", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513794886}, "language": "english", "review": "Steam crashes as soon as I try to start the shit.

But while the aesthetics are quite colourful, it gets pretty bland fast as you'll realise it's pretty minimalistic, content-wise. But that shouldn't be surprising considering the game is barely above 100MB in size.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nProject Rhombus pits you in the middle of a diamond / rhombus as you try to block arrows from reaching the middle and making you fail. The arrows have variable approach rates and some can jump to the side opposite it originally came from, to add to difficulty. As a rhythm game, such concept is unique (at least for me) as I never seen it executed before. But that is just about it for the variability of gameplay as you seemingly block arrows to no end. The lack of progress / stat-tracking bar the timer gives little incentive to keep retrying.\n\n[h1] Content & Miscellaneous [/h1]\n\nAs mentioned before, Project Rhombus is very minimalistic in its current state when it comes to content as there are only 3 available levels with 1 harder one locked behind some time dedication. Since there is a lack of progress-stat related features except the timer, there is little incentive to get to it. (I did it anyway, but I personally believe this would ward away casual players)\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n- Minimalistic design that's pretty aesthetic; pleasing on the eye except for the epileptic ones\n- (A bit of a con) incredibly simple gameplay means no need for a tutorial\n- (A bit of a con) highly variable arrows allows gameplay to be based on skills. Their random appearances throughtout the song COMPLETELY demolishes the thought of memorising the song to beat it, which is sort of nice.\n- Music sounds pretty nice, needs more variety though.\n\n[h1] Gray zone: [/h1]\n- Since there was no tutorial, gameplay was initially confusing. Despite the incredibly simple gaming, a well-highlighted tutorial with maybe slow-motion and / or a simple page describing the game with gameplay gifs would have new players, since all games ought to have some sort of a tutorial\n-The variability of the arrows means that not only you can't memorise the level, but you also can't play-match the arrows to the beat in your head when it does appear. Some sections are loaded with arrows while others are also bare, sometimes in the part of song when you expect it to be \"heavy\". That can sometimes throw you off.\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n- Except for yesterday (11/12/17) update, the game has literally no configuration ability which can block enjoyment of users who likes to customise their game experience. The option should be revised in the future again in accordance with new changes.\n-Lack of progress tracking: Project Rhombus has only one way to track highscore and that's via a timer; how long you have survived into the song. The lack of scoring - points, checkpoints, leaderboards gives little incentive to retry, except for the expert level. Even then it's almost not enough. \n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\n\nProject Rhombus is a neat, indie rhythmic game that is worth a try as there is literally no \"risk\" even among F2P games, as it is only ~110 MB as of now. However when compared to other popular mainstream entries like Cytus, Osu, or even Geometry Dash, it is pretty \"stale\". I suggest trying it and adopt a \"wait-n-see approach\", hence why I am recommending this game for everybody.\n\nP.S: The developer(s) should have a Trello page to detail the game development plans and / or discuss future features with other players.

The notes just don't match the beats, and there are absolutely NO cues to help you line things up either. A much better way to have done this would have been to require the player to change direction as each arrow hits the outside of the diamond, since that's when it feels like the arrows actually match the beat. I don't know if this is the reason why, but the music doesn't have the same feel as Super Hexagon's.

If you go into [i]Project Rhombus[/i] expecting that the game wants you to hit the corresponding arrow key right as the colored arrows reach the middle of the screen, then you\u2019ll be having a bad time.\n\nThe objective is to actually have your central arrow facing the direction of the incoming arrow when the beat lands, which directly means that you have to orient your own arrow at the very latest a split second before impact. So yes, it\u2019s a rhythm game in the sense that the encroaching arrows always land on the beat, but rhythmic gameplay is not required from the player.\n\nThere is however a cardinal sin the game commits by introducing varying speeds between arrows, so you can\u2019t concentrate on the arrows in the order they appear. Some arrows can be slow as molasses and hang on screen for multiple seconds, getting overtaken by arrows that show up later but travel faster. This, coupled with the mechanic where blue arrows switch their trajectory mid-flight, makes it incredibly disorienting when trying to concentrate on which arrow is going to land next. And the reason why I call it a cardinal sin is because the speeds at which the arrows travel also don\u2019t seem to be determined by the rhythm itself, again taking away from the claim of [i]Project Rhombus[/i] being a rhythm game. Because the speed of the arrows is also not determined by the background music\u2019s intensity or anything, which incidentally can quite often end up not featuring any percussive sounds, making keeping the rhythm even more difficult for people who aren\u2019t musically skilled. \n\nI can\u2019t in good conscience not recommend a free game, since the most you\u2019ll invest in it is your own time if you\u2019re willing to enjoy a fairly simplistic arcade mechanic. There are things here that I really don\u2019t like, but then again, you might like it better than I did. \n", "timestamp_created": 1512945132, "timestamp_updated": 1512945132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38222624": {"recommendationid": "38222624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069166184", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515974384}, "language": "english", "review": "This shit makes me wanna play Undertale again... oh and my eyes are fucked. 10/10 dont play this.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I dont need to play this anymore http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1229249542", "timestamp_created": 1512945027, "timestamp_updated": 1513062017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589487", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38222587": {"recommendationid": "38222587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243650666", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518982674}, "language": "english", "review": "Fairly good game however I do have a few complaints. (ideas at the end of review)\n\nAdvantages\n\n1: Songs are very catchy and easy to memorise, but without consistent starting points memorising songs is a next to useless ability.\n\n2: Gameplay is quite solid, and the controls feel very fluid and fast. Not once have I ever died because of the controls, only due to me misreading the arrows. This brings me to my next point, The time you have to react to the arrows is perfect in the earlier levels, but it seems slightly unfair in the later difficulties. I understand that this is to make them harder, but at hard diff I expected slightly more reaction time then the given amount. Just a tiny amount more would make it more fair in my opinion.\n\n3: The game doesn't have an extreme amount of movement and colors in a level, but there is enough going on that you don't tune out or lose focus. There are constantly new colors and movement that keep you engrossed in the game and paying attention to what's on screen at any given time.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n1: Background is fairly distracting in the later levels. For some reason hard diff onwards has a background that changes a lot faster than the previous ones. This could be to make it harder to get a high score, but it changes slightly too fast and irritates my eyes. This means i have to take breaks every so often so i don't hurt my eyes, and causes me to lose my focus.\n\n2: The arrows arent synced up to the music. It isn't clear what beat the arrows actually follow, and more than once i've caught myself trying to time my movements to the music rather than the incoming arrows.\n\n3: The level starts at random points in the song, which i guess is to mix it up so the game doesn't get boring. The problem with this however is that it makes it quite hard to build up muscle memory. This does make sense with the game only having only 4 levels, but i hope when more levels get added this issue is fixed.\n\n4: Lack of levels. Only 4 levels are currently in the game, but it did just come out so im giving it a free pass on this issue. (for now)\n\nIdeas\n\n1: One review made by another user earlier had the idea of the following level design: Instead of trying to get 60 seconds on all levels to unlock the 4th level, maybe getting 60 seconds on easy unlocks another diff called easy 2. After that comes easy 3. This could continue onto normal and hard and the 4th diff. That way the game has quite a few levels and the difficulty ramp up isnt so big, just so the newer players to rhythm games don't find it as hard to progress and develop their skills.\n\n2: While the music isn't bad and actually quite catchy, it isn't exactly memorable. Some of the songs seem like a few random sounds were thrown together. Nothing wrong with electronic songs as they quite fit this game and the rhythm game genre as a whole, But maybe consider adding songs that sound more memorable. Not quite sure how to put it, but some of the songs don't seem to fit that well in my opinion. There are definitely some better songs that would fit well but i can't think of any off the top of my head.\n\n3: Maybe add some sort of reward system? Beating your highscore might get boring after a while. One idea i had is that you could add a point system that rewards you points every 10 seconds for staying alive in the later gamemodes.

Much like a dance arcade game, this functions similarly in that you have to time the arrow to the patterns of the music. \n\nBe warned, the tempo of the modes above do get very tricky. And once it's game over, you have to try again and again to beat your score. This IS a game of survival. But don't be fooled by how monotonous that sounds, the soundtracks are very captivating even if you're not a fan of dance music, and they don't fully reset every time you make another effort to beat your score - so it does try to make each attempt different, especially with the RNG of the arrows and their speeds. Much of the theme of the actual gameplay seems very reminiscent of the Undyne boss battle from Undertale where you have to guard against the attacking arrows and have to switch sides from the blue ones. Which can catch you off guard a lot.\n\nFor a free game, this is definitely a must-try. The animations are perfect, the sounds are great and the visuals are colourful and captivating. There is complete controller functionality involved, too - if you have one. As well as rumble. Although, if you suffer from dyslexia or hypersensitivity, then the arrows, the bright colours and the animations might be a bit much. That being said, this is a great, challenging game and a fun past-time to get stuck in with if you're bored and in need of a buzz. \n\n8/10 \n\nEDIT: One thing that does bug me, though, is the fact that the game isn't skill-based or based off of a score of how many arrows you managed to get in the time you had. Because every arrow is randomised and with it being a time-based score system, it's hard to get into the grips with the level of difficulty at times with how many arrows are being thrown at you from all directions. The arrows can be paced differently which can screw with your mind. So you either have the attention span and reaction time of a god, or you legitimately need to get better each time. \n\nAnother thing is that there doesn't seem to be any ranked system. Like an online scoreboard where you can share your time with your friends, etc. But as said previously, this game at its current state seems to be a pure past-time.

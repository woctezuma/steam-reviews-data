I still have the cd-rom package from '04, but the disc got destroyed :(\n\nYou get to pick an Austin Powers -esque persona and play as an evil genius and try to fulfill your doomsday mission. All of the character sprites or minions/henchmen are interesting to watch, with a unique art style, and there are plenty of fun interactions with base objects to look for. The gameplay consists of building a mountain dungeon, sending your henchmen to the board-game style overworld, and having they steal plans/art/machines to further your ambitions. Some of the art you steal is returned to your base for your henchmen to admire (for a loyalty bonus), and the nations of the world send their agents to retrieve them. Your notoriety increases as you steal more, and the agents become more gooder and tougher and more frequent. Eventually you steal all of the items necessary to complete your doomsday object, and you win!\n\nThere are some hurdles along the way:\n-You need to dispose of dead bodies.\n-Tourists come to the island to... tour. And then they freak out when they see dead bodies or guns.\n-You need to train your workers into different careers paths: soldiers, scientists, or social people. Scientists research new items for your base (traps or security features or rec room items), social minions are better suited for non lethal diversion of enemies. Soldiers more effetively arm themselves.\n-Super-agents are sent to kill your evil genius, and they each have a unique scenario to defeat them. They will judo-chop your minions all day long if you try to get rid of them like other enemies.\n\nI am very excited for the sequel announced this year. Sierra games was a good publisher.\n\n\nLikes:\n-Base building. There is a ton of freedom to build however you like. Of course, the game doesn't really provide you with much help either. The starting build area is small, but your options improve in the future. I like using the console to enable debug mode to allow more creative building. Do this at your own risk, you can bork your save.\n\n-Traps. They're buggy, but it's fun to set up a room to release bees on unsuspecting investigators. You have to tie a trap with a sensor, and the sensors occupy space, which can limit some designs. Sadly, some agents are too smart and they either won't fall for tripping the trap sensor, or they start attacking and causing the traps to explode. Whomp-whomp.\n\n-Soundtrack. Omg. Just run the OST on Youtube when you're bored at work.\n\n-Modding. The games files are a library of notepad-editable xmls. You can tweak the properties of anything or even define new base items to build. You can go further and add textures to create your own characters. \n\n\nUnlikes:\n-Controls. Your base consists of you (the evil genius, 1 life), your elite henchmen (limited #, 3 lives), and your minions (unlimited # to hire, 1 life). The minions are assigned to tasks in the background and you cannot re-order a minion to a building task (I.e. if they're right next to a box that need to be moved). Your henchmen can be told to move anywhere and kill anyone and they will, but they don't build. And your evil genius can be told to move anywhere; but, he can't attack, can't build, and his only plus if he produces a passive AoE bonus to your minions (loyalty +, perception +).\n \n-Tutorials. Yeah, they suck. The interface for the help videos is also trashy. There's not much in the game that's difficult conceptually, but there are some issues with building that may not be intuitive. I.e. you cannot destroy a room that is the only access path to a deeper room.\n\n-Money. The method for generating cash is by sending henchmen to the world map, in an overworld boardgame-styled menu. Here, any henchmen set to \"steal\" will produce X amount of dollars per minute. The game with place enemy agents in the region, and there are behind-the-scene dice rolls to kill your henchmen. I don't have much for suggestions in replacing this; but I've always found the # of henchmen required to be on the overworld stealing money at the rate I want to spend it was absurd. There are cheat codes to add $.\n\n-Population cap. I'm not a fan of these, and they're easily editable with the .ini config file, but your pop cap is 100 henchmen. I usually set this to 500. If you need to send 40 of them to the overworld to generate money, it limits your base functionality. There is a slider in your base menu that controls the rate at which you hire new lv 1 henchmen, which can be changed from 1 / min to 1 / sec (w/ a hefty cash penalty).", "timestamp_created": 1514996767, "timestamp_updated": 1514996767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39005272": {"recommendationid": "39005272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131764748", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514973662}, "language": "english", "review": "good old game", "timestamp_created": 1514973248, "timestamp_updated": 1514973248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38984043": {"recommendationid": "38984043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063083279", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504716061}, "language": "english", "review": "uninstalled the game, reinstall it lose all my save files. around 40+ hours\n\nit's a shame because it's a great game", "timestamp_created": 1514919222, "timestamp_updated": 1514919222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38951809": {"recommendationid": "38951809", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966752859", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514862797}, "language": "english", "review": "You cannot go wrong with this for the 2.49 price tag.

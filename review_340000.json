Your amnesic head must help clear out a few ships and stations of evil robots. Just like plugging different gamepads in and out, your astro mug can and will switch into new robo bodies constantly and take control. \n\nHeadlander has genuine style. And it's groovy! Laser shootouts occur in shag rug clad discos.\nPump out some sweet dance moves while in a robo worker's body. Psychodelic 70s sfx billow throughout colorful corridors.\nIt's sometimes a weird mixture where you'll hear some ironic comment from a door in the vein of Doug Adams' Marvin next to a Buck Rogers inspired robopoodle (which you can obviously incapitate).\n\nPuzzles consist mainly of which robobody can go where. Action is kinda 2d run and gun. Both are decent. There's no loot and items but a lot of upgrades which you can either find or unlock by uncovering secret stashes of space energy spheres. Not great, but okay.\n\nHeadlander is an easy game. Dying results in Sonic-ish situations (just grab a ring!) as you can almost always bail from a body quickly and reconnect to a new host immediately. Even if they blow your head to pieces, the last checkpoint is usually superclose, no save management whatsoever required. It's a chill game if you're somewhat competent with 2d action.\n\nA time tested narrator-in-your-ear hands out directions, missions or provides exposition. Overall, the story is great for a Metroidvania. The ending should not disappoint fans of the genre.\nDoublefine has even provided some deligthtful little surprises after you've beaten the game and revisit your last save (return to the dome!).\n\nSound & Music is superb!\n\nDr. Theopolis rates Headlander 4 out of 5 funky laser lightshows.\nVerdict: easy-to-play scifi Metroidvania with more style than uber depth",

They\u2019re both in 2D and look like low budget games. However, the similarities end there. Apotheon is set in ancient Greece whereas Headlander is set in a sci-fi 1970s world with both a retro and futuristic look. Headlander represents retrofuturism. The music has a groovy beat and sounds like 1970s disco.\n\nYou begin the game choosing a male or female Headlander. You are just a disembodied head inside a spacesuit helmet. You have no torso or larynx. Therefore, you have no voice. There is a jet thruster in the place where your larynx should be. You are the only human in the game and are guided by an AI named Earl, a male voice with an American southern accent. \n\nThe dazzling colors make the sci-fi setting look like utopia, but the reality is that the setting is far from utopian. The long-term goal is to overthrow a corrupt AI named Methuselah. This goal requires lots of exploration and backtracking. The navigation of the nearly 300 rooms requires you to dock or headland on the numerous robotic bodies. The bodies have colors that indicate a rank in terms of how many clearances they have to different rooms. White citizens have the least access and are always unarmed. They have unique dance subroutines according to their body type that you can use to entertain yourself. The armed guards are the Shepherd guarding the rooms and have colors like red, yellow, orange, green, blue, and violet. Red Shepherds are the weakest and can access red doors. This means that you must decapitate their heads using your vacuum force ability and dock onto their bodies to open red doors. The violet Shepherds are the toughest and have the most clearances. If you cannot access a door because of the wrong color the security AI will respond sarcastically to you that you do not have the proper clearance. It is an example of how weird and humorous this game is. There is one room where the exception occurs since only females can access one door and males can access another door. Your head has to use vacuum force to drag a female head to fool the security AI to open the door and the same strategy is necessary to open the door for males only.\n\nThe vacuum force attack can be upgraded and there are many upgrades in the game displayed in a skill tree. The vacuum force can also be used to take off spherical covers to access terminals for upgrading helmet health, helmet power, and helmet thrusts.  You spend more time upgrading your powers later in the game. The shield becomes crucial for deflecting laser shots and getting past horizontal and vertical laser barriers. The upgrades become more fun as you can eventually undock a body and allow it to become an auto sentry firing at enemies for you. As the game progresses, there are more laser shootouts and you can kill more easily with your upgrades. However, the problem is that it is also easier to get killed. In some rooms there are so many enemies firing lasers at you that you can lose sight of where your tiny head is and this can get frustrating. Sometimes you dock on a Shepherd and arrive on a lift, but you must dock off the Shepherd and dock on the lift to ascend or descend to the next floor. While ascending or descending, a turret is firing at you, forcing you to dock off the lift and either dock onto the Shepherd again to destroy the turret or decapitate its head.\n\nThere is a lot of backtracking the game that must be done for completing the main objectives. This backtracking can get tedious unless you enjoy backtracking frequently. Despite all the backtracking, the story follows a linear path. It is very difficult to get lost since the rooms are connected and there are teleports that can transport you quickly to a faraway room. There are side missions that also require backtracking, but they are worth it because they award you upgrade points that you need to upgrade your Headlander.\n\nEventually, you will come across a chess arena where various chess pieces, white and black, are fighting each other. This is one of the coolest scenes in the game. The chess arena requires you to dock on the bodies of these chess pieces like Pawns, Rooks, Knights, and Bishops to upload and download data to your friendly AI that will lead to a boss battle. There are only 2 boss battles in the game and are not extraordinary in difficulty or quality.\n\nThis game appears to be low budget, but it is creative in gameplay and quite colorful from start to finish. It felt strange to enter a room and suddenly enter combat in slow-mo while groovy music is playing in the background. The game feels like a space odyssey combining retro and future characteristics. It is weird in a charming way, as you constantly navigate so many rooms either using your disembodied head or using the correct body to open doors. The background views are lavish throughout the game. There are many jokes told by the robotic bodies that do not seem to sit easily with a story that takes itself seriously by reminding you about the potential end of humanity. It is a decent adventure game that does not have high replay value, but it would be enjoyable for a playthrough.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1507917894, "timestamp_updated": 1507917894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35696362": {"recommendationid": "35696362", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977702320", "num_games_owned": 725, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505622477}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a Metroidvania at it's core but it's a very clever and aesthetically interesting one.

It's somewhat reminiscent of the obscure 'Messiah', with a Metroidvania twist in terms of gameplay.\n\n[b]Gameplay - 8/10 - Riddles can be challenging, the action is satisfying, but more often then not the screen will be filled with so many enemy bullets you may confuse this game for a bullet hell shooter. The mechanic for developing new skills and upgrading them is a nice metroid-like touch. It's enjoyable.\n\nStory - 7/10 - The characters are not too distinct and original and you won't feel much for them, but the plot is somewhat intriguing. predictible, but interesting nonetheless. You will recognize the voice talent of Richard Steven Horvitz if you played Pyschonauts, as he sometimes appears as the occasional enemy.\n\nAtmosphere - 10/10 It feels as if this game came out of the 70/80s. The style is very retro and the design of just about anything in the game is special and neat. Not only the visual aspects are outstanding, but the music is also very space-y and 80s-like. Great work on that aspect.\n\nOverall: 8.3333333...

For a rather short game (6-8 hours without any 'side quests' or 100% completion) you'll be having an average level of challenge with a bit of action and riddle solving, with a side dish of a semi original plot and familiar voice talents, as well as some fun interactions.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1503149371, "timestamp_updated": 1503149371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34336475": {"recommendationid": "34336475", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990531230", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502665708}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing game.

There's just one problem: all that's left of you is your head, sealed up inside of a space helmet. Fortunately for you, your helmet is equipped with maneuvering thrusters and a docking system that allows it to replace the head of any robot you encounter. All you need to do is to relieve said robot of its existing head, first.\n\nA remote robot voice called ERL assists you, thick couuuuntry accent on full display (pardner); he prods you on your way, and directs you to the objectives you need to complete. You'll need it on occasion, too, as the locals are well aware that there's something REALLY off about you (as if your fleshy head-in-a-helmet wasn't odd enough). His primary purpose is to give you a friendly voice to listen to \u2013 after all, you can't speak, as you don't have any lungs! \n\nTHE FLOW AND THE STORY:\nHeadlander is a Metroidvania-style game where you get around by hijacking any robotic bodies you come across \u2013 whether that be a civilian, a soldier, a little janitorial bot, or even a robo-dog! Your helmet comes equipped with a vacuum system that can remove the heads of any bot in the game, allowing you to dock the body and control it \u2013 at least, until it takes too much damage and blows up. Hopefully, you've moved on before that happens.\n\nYou will also need to change bodies of your own accord from time to time \u2013 maybe an upgrade has come along with a superior weapon type, a map-bot has showed up (which allows you to expand your minimap), or a patrol bot with a higher security clearance has appeared. Taking over that last one will allow you access to higher-security areas, using a Paranoia-style rating system: Red is the lowest standard access level, then orange, then yellow, and so on. There are also separate color sets for specialized bots in the arena. \n\nNew abilities are unlocked over time, with points gained by collecting glowing energy pulses, or by downloading massive amounts of said pulses when docking with special terminals. Major upgrades are unlocked by progressing through the story, while others come along with them as those trees are explored. Do you want to improve your auto-repair rate when you lack a body, or do you want to prioritize allowing your helmet to repair the bodies you have docked with? Do you want to improve your melee strength or your running speed, or would you rather save up and enable a headbutt move that lets you instantly take over an undefended enemy body? You can also gain extra points quickly by completing optional mini-missions offered by civilian bots as you go along.\n\nThe game autosaves as you go, and the penalty for dying is minimal \u2013 you simply restart the room you are in from scratch, complete with the body you were inhabiting when you did so. This can get frustrating if you've spent the last few minutes working out some complex puzzle, aiming your lasers just so while the constantly-respawning enemy bots are taking potshots at you...but it's still far better than losing half an hour of progress because you couldn't find a save room.\n\nThere isn't a vast amount of story in this game \u2013 but heck, it doesn't need it. The atmosphere sells it all. The Master Control Program this time around is called Methusela, and it's made sure that the former humans are nice and content \u2013 or perhaps, complacent \u2013 due to the addition of control gems in their circuitry that mellows them out when they get excited, calms them down when they get emotional \u2013 and does some judicious editing of their memories when they've seen something they shouldn't have.\n\nCONTROLS:\nControls are straightforward and, for the most part, intuitive, though some of the more advanced unlockable abilities wander into the \u201cHold this and press that while under condition whatever.\u201d Your helmet has unlimited thrusters, and a limited amount of energy available for high-speed boosts and laser-reflecting shields, but no onboard weapons of its own. When docked with an armed robot body, you can use its weapon system \u2013 whether that means anything from a single laser beam to a quad-splitter laser to a heavy melee punch and a reflector shield. You can aim said lasers with the right stick (the game has full controller support, and will default to that if it detects one), and hold another button to show prediction lines indicating where your laser will go for the first couple of bounces. The \u201cprediction\u201d lines will glow more intensely if you have properly targeted another's head.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nA 60's/70's Jetsons-future-meets-hippy aesthetic. High-tech space stations, mixed with plenty of areas designed to allow the civilian bots to give themselves over to absolute pleasure: Carpets with absurdly thick pile, moodlighting, trippy ambience, and a \u201cfree love\u201d setting. Enemy types can be clearly distinguished by their uniform colors, the shapes of their heads and weapons, as well as the marking upon them.\n\nSOUND:\nUnobtrusive, retro ambience with the music. Lasers sound like sci-fi lasers. Speech (even the cameo from Raz/Zim's VA, Richard Horvitz, as the enemy turret that's just doing his job) is filtered to have a mild, slightly hollow electronic effect. Civilian bots constantly chatter in the background about their own concerns \u2013 e.g., getting their faces made over (presumably with an arc welder), or allowing their minds to wander in one of the relaxation chambers. Most every door you come across will give you (H2G2) Marvin-esque commentary, responding with outright sarcasm if your current body doesn't have the security clearance required to get through.\n\nOVERALL:\nA fun, silly Metroidvania game with a wonderfully absurd premise\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:\nModerate. Windows 7 or later, 64-bit required. Geforce 550/Radeon 7750 or better, 4GB RAM, and a 2GHz Dual Core CPU or better.\n\nSTORY: 70\nGAMEPLAY: 90\nGRAPHICS: 85\nSOUND: 85\nFUN FACTOR: 90\nATMOSPHERE: 90\n\nPros: \nGreat atmosphere\nConstant chatter from the NPCs\nDetailed map keeps track of goals, uncollected powerups, etc\nDeath penalty is minimal\n\nCons:\nUnskippable boss cutscenes\nHaving to backtrack to get the right type of body for an area you want to access, then getting it to your goal area intact\n\nPreviously published on dlh.net -- Eric_Kei", "timestamp_created": 1501790890, "timestamp_updated": 1506125752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33981866": {"recommendationid": "33981866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032632811", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 196, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501717067}, "language": "english", "review": "Metroidvania with a lot of personality. Loved all the cheeky doors and timid turrets. Gameplay wise, the Headlander is relatively simple and doesn\u2019t expand too much upon a few preliminary puzzle/combat elements. \n\nUpgrades feel small and a couple \u2018XP\u2019 upgrades would have been really nice to have as a part of the game, like to have given them just a room to find in a small puzzle to get around following their discovery. You also get OP really fast. About 50% of the way through the game, with the right upgrades, you can just walk past enemies, not worrying about damage. This added to the redundant nature that popped up more and more the further I played.\n\nI stopped paying attention to the story after a little while. Things go a bit too serious and I started to get Brave New World/iRobot, \u201cWhat does is it mean to be human?\u201d vibes, something that disappointed me [wasn't in the mood] and contrasted with the initial jokey, 4th-wall-breaking attitude I had enjoyed at the start of Headlander.\n\nI only ended up playing so much of it because of my unhealthy drive to attempt to 100% metroidvanias. Couldn\u2019t find the last couple of achievements though. :/\n\nOn that front, the Headlander is rather \u2018hand-holdy\u2019. \u2018Secrets\u2019 are displayed on the map and the whole experience is only rarely non-linear.

Better go right\u201d.\n\n Biggest downer of my experience with the game was that, even on lowest settings, the game runs okay at best.

You play Winters, a voiceless, disembodied head in a helmet, apparently the absolute last vestige of biological humanity. The rest of the human race has had their personalities downloaded into robots called Impostors and live lives of hedonic decadence in a space station overseen by the all-controlling AI Methuselah (and protected by his purely robotic Shepherds). The upshot of all this is that everybody's consciousness is disjoint from their bodies, the upshot of THAT being that you can vacuum-suck anybody's head off their body with a deeply satisfying POP and plug yourself in.\n\nThe core gameplay loop, then, is a mix of exploration, combat (with a rainbow of colored lasers that can be ricocheted around corners), and body-swapping. There are some very light metroidvania elements -- the entire game is on a single, sprawling map, you gain abilities over time that let you access new areas, and there are plenty of hidden powerups -- but it doesn't really belong in that category, as the overall flow is fundamentally linear, with zero opportunities for sequence-breaking and only a handful of times throughout the game you'll need to backtrack to an area because you weren't able to fully explore it the first time through (although, that said, the fast-travel system is smooth and well-implemented).\n\nCombat can be really fun, with rooms turning into gorgeous mini-bullet-hells with five different colors of lasers flying in all directions, and the game gives you lots of neat unlockable abilities to play with, like abandoning bodies to turn them into automated sentries and an aimable reflective shield. Unfortunately, you'll almost never use the vast majority of these abilities outside the few (but very well-designed) boss fights, because it turns out that in 95% of all normal combat encounters the universally dominant strategy is to fly over to all the enemy robots and just pop off their heads. And, I mean, that was still a lot of fun all the way through the game, but I do wish it encouraged you to USE more of the abilities it gives you.\n\nSpecial mention has to be given to the story, however. As mentioned, the game is visually a pastiche of 70's retrofuture aesthetics, but what makes that more than a random gimmick is that the story is also a pastiche of 1970s sci-fi: from the general worldbuilding, to the creepy and vaguely-religiously-tinged menace of Methuselah, to the scrappy, beret-clad, all-female resistance movement, to the secondary villainess who has turned the archive system into a giant game of high-stakes human chess for basically no reason and taunts you with chess-themed puns in a Russian accent as you are forced to play through it, Headlander would feel right at home alongside films like Logan's Run and Soylent Green. It's deliberately camp, yes, with a lot of funny lines, but the core narrative is played seriously enough, is sufficiently philosophically deep, and is well-executed enough that it works as genuine homage much more than disposable parody.\n\n(Seriously, the color-coded door system -- run by a hyperintelligent and therefore insanely bored AI -- is one of the highlights of the game, helped along by some fantastic voice acting.)\n\nHeadlander is not a long game -- it took me about 8 hours to finish and find all the secrets -- but its pacing, writing, coherent holistic art direction and general sense of fun make it a fantastic experience.

For some reason it reminds me of a cross between Shadow Complex (the gunplay) and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet (controlling your jet-powered head), both excellent Metroidy games in their own right. Headlander has a neat twist in that your head is your avatar, the bodies you can inhabit are merely tools you need throughout the game. It uses this mechanism well, different bodies have different abilities, such as the variously coloured \"Shepherd\" sentries which grant different levels of access, effectively gating your progress until you find the right one. There's plenty of exploration of course, lots of upgrades hidden away, and a few fun secrets. Fortunately you can always go back to earlier areas once you gain new abilities, even after the \"end\" of the game (very welcome).\n\nI think this game works so well partly because it establishes a strong sense of place. The graphics, music and sound create a vibrant 70s retro/future aesthetic, polished to a rare lustre. There are endless little touches which bring the place alive, attention to detail that's rare to see, including once you've beaten the game and return to find things subtly changed - completely unnecessary, but very much appreciated.\n\nIt's not a particularly difficult game, although it has its moments. There are a couple of boss battles which aren't too taxing, and frankly I was very happy to get back to the main gameplay mechanics. There's enough variety in puzzles, environments and straight-out blasting to avoid any feeling of repetition. When I am counting down the rooms left to explore with regret, I know I'm enjoying the heck out of something and don't want it to end.\n\nAnyway, I think this is the best original game that Double Fine has done in ages.", "timestamp_created": 1500988616, "timestamp_updated": 1500988616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688638", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33780653": {"recommendationid": "33780653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132748965", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 186, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500792633}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u590d\u53e4\u79d1\u5e7b\u8c03\u8c03\u513f\u80fd\u8ba9\u6211\u5ffd\u7565\u5b83\u5185\u5bb9\u5c11\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002\u8c01\u8981\u89e3\u8c1c\uff1f\u8c01\u8981\u6253\u602a\uff1f\u8c01\u8981BOSS\u6218\uff1f\u6211\u53ea\u8981\u5728\u8ff7\u79bb\u7684\u8367\u5149\u91cc\u8df3\u821e\uff0cbiu biu biu\u53d1\u5c04\u7729\u76ee\u6fc0\u5149\uff0c\u770b\u673a\u5668\u8eab\u4f53\u7684\u7537\u7537\u5973\u5973\u6414\u9996\u5f04\u59ff\uff0c\u542c\u626b\u5730\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u62b1\u6028\u548c\u95e8\u7981AI\u7684\u523b\u8584\u8bdd\uff0c\u65c1\u89c2\u9ed1\u767d\u68cb\u5b50\u65e0\u8111\u65e0\u4f11\u7684\u6218\u4e89\uff0c\u62d4\u6389\u4e00\u4e2a\u72d7\u7684\u8111\u888b\u81ea\u5df1\u53d6\u800c\u4ee3\u4e4b\uff0c\u98de\u884c\u2014\u2014\u4ee5\u4e00\u9897\u5934\u7684\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u62d6\u7740\u504f\u8272\u5c3e\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u50cf\u7ba1\u70b8\u88c2\u7684\u6591\u6593\u4e2d\u4e00\u6b21\u6b21\u6b7b\u800c\u590d\u751f\u3002\n\n\u70ed\u95f9\u3001\u6b22\u5a31\u3001\u53e4\u677f\u3001\u65b0\u6f6e\u3001\u50b2\u6162\u3001\u611a\u8822\u3001\u4eab\u4e50\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u81ea\u601c\u81ea\u827e\u3001\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5e7b\u60f3\u3001\u8001\u6389\u7259\u7684\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u2026\u2026Party\u4e0a\u7684\u5f69\u8272\u5851\u6599\u788e\u7247\u4e00\u6837\u5288\u5934\u76d6\u8138\uff0c\u90fd\u5e26\u7740\u5047\u60fa\u60fa\u7684\u5473\u9053\uff0c\u88c5\u8154\u4f5c\u52bf\uff0c\u8822\u5934\u8822\u8111\uff0c\u504f\u504f\u5438\u5f15\u773c\u7403\uff0c\u662f\u90a3\u6839\u96be\u4ee5\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u5927\u9ebb\u70df\u548c\u9012\u4e0a\u70df\u7684\u5973\u4eba\u5728\u8033\u8fb9\u7684\u7a83\u7a83\u4f4e\u8bed\uff1amake love, no war.\n\n\u603b\u8bc4\uff1a70's/10", "timestamp_created": 1500964189, "timestamp_updated": 1500989717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33751258": {"recommendationid": "33751258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072661932", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501837783}, "language": "french", "review": "Fantastique !

The idea is that \u2014 your player character is a flying head in a helmet in a 70s inspired sci-fi with groovy robots who\u2019s bodies you can steal by replacing their heads with yours. If you thought Stacking, or even an earlier attempt on the concept during the level in Psychonauts, you also play a lot of Double Fine games. And indeed, there\u2019s a lot of similar ideas here \u2014 different bodies you can get have different security clearance, just like a costume in a Hitman game will be, thus removing the need to find keys to open doors \u2014 instead you find bodies and ways to get them to where you want. Which is trickier than it may sound, because you can\u2019t jump in Headlander. It\u2019s such a weird thing for a metroidvania, but is tied really well with the overall design of you constantly swapping bodies with your quick and constantly improving head, so after the initial surprise, you get used to it really fast.\n\nWhich is not to say all the decisions in Headlander feel justified. While it looks and sound great and the basic setup and controls are surprisingly clever, the game sometimes pushes some ideas a bit too far. One of the earlier major hub areas to explore, for example, feels a bit too convoluted and overwhelming to be fun, even for a person like me who tends to orient themselves in levels easily. There are several frustrating parts focusing on precision shooting, which isn\u2019t particularly precise no matter how hard you try. And the combat in the game tends to be seriously unbalanced with the best ability of the whole game being an unlockable skill of damaging enemies by rolling into them, which you will then abuse until the game ends. Game also suffers from a surprising amount of repetition and feels longer than it should be, despite taking me about 5 hours to 100%.

I dont want to reveal anything here, so what I'll just do is give a bare-bones review. The mechanics on this game are very strange and unique, as you play much of the time as a flying head in a helmet. So, you jet around, headbutt heads from other bodies (usually vacuum them off though), jet around, reflect lasers, and more. Pretty much every machine in the game- and trust me there's a lot as you are the last fleshy human alive and you're just a head- can get its head pulled off and its body used. \nThe game keeps up variability too, with areas using tons of puzzles dealing with color-based clearance access to series of elevator that you had to keep opening doors to to even a warped version of chess which is basically all out war. \nThis game is great fun; it'll make you giggle and rage. It'll make you just have a good fun time for its sadly short length- get it if you enjoy metrovania games and just unique games in general.", "timestamp_created": 1499694033, "timestamp_updated":

It's not fun, it's not special, it's just a bit lacklustre.\n\nSince the game can also easily be completed in 4-5 hours I wouldn't say it's \"worth\" the asking price necessarily, but that's for you to decide.

This concept is: You are the only living being in the near galaxy, but you're only a head that is still living and can dock itself to robots. So pull the heads off of some robots so you can power their machinary to get around, blow up other robots, activate terminals, etc. All the while keeping to a pretty awesome 70's look that feels strangely cozy despite all the crazy laser blasting going on around you. And being a Double Fine game, there's tons of really good writing to go along with it, though largely optional.\n\nAs far as complaints go, mine's only minor. Though the writing is good, it isn't as good as what Double Fine usually puts out, it's strong but weak in noticible places. My second complaint comes down to the upgrade system which has a good chunk of upgrades but some of which feel largely optional. But they do give options to handle combat in different ways or just make things easier on you. Again, minor, as I was using every upgrade at some point by the end of the game. Finally, the door system - as creative as it is - can be absolutely tedious to deal with at times. Basically in order to get through certain doors you need to take over a robot of a certain security color or higher starting from Red and ending in Purple. For the most part Headlander is very generous with supplying you the bodies you need when you need them, but in some cases (POWER DOME) you'll be running around looking for a body color that you really should (POWER DOME) have by that point anyways meaning you have to explore a large environment that might be blocked off at certain points (P O W E R  D O M E) just to find that one color that will get you through to where you want to go. But as you can tell by the fact that I'm only pointing out one area out of about eight, it's also largely minor.\n\nHeadlander excells in a great many places however. Gameplay is fluid and each upgrade is simple enough that you can quickly work between them on the fly. A number of puzzles have mulitiple solutions, or are creative enough that they don't always feel the same. And in the case that neither of the above are correct, then at least they take a couple minutes to figure out with some laser fiddling. Voice acting is top notch, exploration is fun, combat is enough of an obstacle without being overwhelming (minus when a bunch of lasers are on the screen at once) and overall it's a solid title. Really the concept and style is enough to float the game on its own. So with it, Headlander gets my recommendation. It's a good snack title that fills a need, but doesn't quite have enough juice to go further. Despite that it's still enjoyable from start to finish and you won't regret your time with it.", "timestamp_created": 1499006384, "timestamp_updated": 1499006384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33127656": {"recommendationid": "33127656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088116189", "num_games_owned": 667, "num_reviews": 141, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498995689}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0434\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u041e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0435!

A 2D sidescrolling metroidvania with some shooting which looks a bit bullet-hell at times, though you never move fast enough to make playing the later stages as a bullet hell viable.\nBy the end the gameplay was starting to feel a bit too samey. I wouldn't say it outstayed its welcome, but I'm glad this wasn't a 10-15 hour game unless they improved some major tweaks to the systems.\n\nFor me, what really makes this stand out from so many other 2D platforming metroidvanias would be the style. It's managing a really well done kitchy 70s sci-fi style in everything from robot designs, colour palette, sounds and copious amounts of shag carpet.\n\nThe gimmick of the game, being able to pick off the head of everything and control it instead makes me think of Stacking, another Double Fine game. But where Stacking was all about finding loads of different characters and seeing what they could do, the novelty here wears off rather quickly and just becomes a thing to do to obtain new access or another weapon if your previous body got destroyed.\n\nOne thing that really went down well for me was the concept of snarky doors often making puns about the colour clearance you needed to go through the door, remniscent of the doors from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy combined with a snark-a-tron.

It's pretty satisfiying, you fly around yanking the heads off of robots and hijacking their bodies like a larcenous, floating hermit crab. The body has it's own health bar, so it's like a disposable shield for you. I get a very cozy feeling plugging into one, knowing I can't die as long as this body is in one piece, kind of like turning the heater on in a car on a cold night. Pulling heads off robots is very satifying, too. You pull on them for a few seconds and they pop off, like pulling a big booger out of your nose. The lasers on the other hand are as often a nuisance as a pleasure. The robots usually have a laser gun which in addition to combat is sometimes used for puzzles involving activating distant objects. Those puzzles can suck. They usually involve firing your laser at an arrangement of mirrors so its trajectory hits all the targets. It's a fine concept, but often you find yourself in a situation where you've figured out the trajectory, but can't quite get your laser to hit the last mark because you're trying to make fine adjustments with f*cking analog sticks. It's sort of like sewing with buttery fingers.\n\nVisuals: 8\nThe 70's aesthetic with cymk bleeding shaders is pretty damn fresh. It isn't mind-blowing, but it works quite well. They did a really good job here, the art is tight and super mininal.  You really can tell they did not spend a lot of man hours on art... There's a lot of asset recycling, all of the models and animations are pretty low effort, and some of the models are downright ugly. And yet, despite the very unambitious 3d art, the game manages to be beautiful.\n\nAudio: 8.5\nThey make the solid choice of hitting you with the hottest material right out the gate. Layers of warm frothy synths bathe you in curious and optomistic melodies. Pro musician type sh*t. The quality of the tunes tapers off comfortably, the midgame tracks can't compete with what came before, and they aren't trying to. Towards the end the synth focus has loosened up and you get some proggy jams as the plot starts to go off the rails. It all fits very well and is instrumental to setting the tone.\n\nWriting: 4\nWell, it's a puzzle platformer in a retro camp scifi setting. That doesn't exactly lend itself to \"Story-Rich\". The plot is basically vestigial. By the mid-game I had accidentally interrupted enough of Andrew Ryan's dialog that I had no idea why I was supposed to be doing what I was doing. Just do the thing to get to the next thing. To my surprise there are actually brief moments of suspense and psychological horror in the late game. But they are forgotten the moment you step into the next room and begin ejaculating lasers onto a gang of enemies. You can observe the writers awaken from their sloth-induced stupor and, in a moment of reverie, begin to write something with drama and consequence, before remembering this is f*cking Headlander, a game about sucking off robots' heads.\n\nFeels: 10\nGod damn does this game f*ck with me.

The gameplay is great. I even thought the chaotic minigame was pretty cool, followed up by a fun boss fight that incorporated elements of the minigame. The Texan narrator was a good companion throughout. The door and lasergun voices were entertaining and reminded me of Portal. Even the character animations were pretty awesome. The whole game is just great. I think at this point I'm about halfway through the game with 7 hours gameplay and I've just met the leader of the revolution.

But it, too, does suffer from under use, mostly because of the colored enemies mechanics that makes each starting area have the same enemies and make their veriarty limited and uninteresting.\n\n\n\nThe game's plot is uninteresting, making use of much of the sci-fi cliche you'd expect, and the saddest thing is that the four or so side quests the game gives the player to complete have much better and funnier writting, making you wonder why weren't they more expanded upon and was kept as optional content, especially since they also give a chance of pace and gameplay to the straight route through rooms that is the main campaign.\n\n\nOverall, Headlander did disappoint me a little, but was still a nice experience.

Die haben mehr Ideen in mein Lieblingsspiel Psychonauts gesteckt als ein ganzes Portfolio eines anderen Herstellers mit seinen gesamten Spieleaufgebot nicht einmal hingekriegt h\u00e4tte!\n\nUnd die Idee von Headlander den Namen des Spiels gleich zum Programm zu machen, ist genial! In diesem 2,5D-Plattformer geht's als Kopf hei\u00df her, denn etwas anderes spielt ihr im Prinzip nicht = ein Kopf, der an K\u00f6rper an- und abdocken kann. Die Roboterwirte haben dann oftmals verschiedene F\u00e4higkeiten (stark, schnell, klein, gro\u00df) sowie unterschiedliche Waffen, mit denen ihr euch gegen anderer verteidigt, weil als Kopf allein zwar auch Selbstverteidigung geht, aber insgesamt nicht viel Schaden austeilbar ist. Aber auch einige Kopfn\u00fcsse wollen geknackt werden, da die R\u00e4ume nur durch bestimmte K\u00f6rperfarben (Autorit\u00e4tslevel) zu \u00f6ffnen sind und man so auch nur weiter kommt. Dabei muss die Farbe mindestens (! - also nicht exakt) den Anforderungen entsprechen - es geht von Rot \u00fcber Geld sowie Gr\u00fcn oder Blau bis hin zu Violett. Und dann gibt's da in dem Metroidvania-typischen Levelaufbau noch einige Upgrades zu entdecken und viel auf der Map \u00fcber 3 Hauptgebiete zu entdecken. Die Geschichte ist okay, aber nicht der Rede wert. Wirklich witzig ist das Gameplay und die Ideen selber - vor allem mit Schachfiguren eine Art Capture the Flag zu spielen, war schon eine geniale Sache f\u00fcr sich.

Una via di mezzo abbastanza riuscita.\n\nSe nel film cult Highlander (rovinato poi dai seguiti) , l'immortale moriva solo con il taglio della testa, in Headlander invece, oltre a poter prendere qualunque sorta di danno nel corpo, potremo staccare di nostra volont\u00e0 la testa per sfuggire ai pericoli che solo in quel momento diverranno davvero letali. Si perch\u00e8 \u00e8 questo che siamo realmente, una testa, una fragile testa vagante, disponibile all'inizio in tre versioni; uomo giovane, donna giovane, uomo anziano. Tutti e tre inscatolati in stile Futurama, ma con meno salamoia e maggiore indipendenza nei movimenti.  \n\nDovremo costantemente trovare un nuovo corpo ospitante, spesso scegliendoli in base al colore e alla dimensione utile alla porta che intendiamo attraversare. I nostri poteri principali consistono nell'aspirare piccoli oggetti e nello svolazzare coi propulsori per fonderci con varie strutture meccaniche, siano essi; ascensori, torrette,  robot di dimensione e capacit\u00e0 offensiva diversa ed infine, gli immancabili potenziatori, che per la maggior parte ci daranno punti da spendere ed energia extra per lo scatto veloce, che successivamente ci permetter\u00e0 a suon di capocciate di infrangere alcuni ostacoli nei condotti pi\u00f9 nascosti. \n\nOvviamente nulla ci verr\u00e0 regalato, l'aspiratore del casco servir\u00e0 proprio a staccare le teste nemiche per sostituirle con la nostra, e dovremo farlo spesso, spessissimo, cercando nel frattempo di non farci colpire dai proiettili vaganti, che in tutto il gioco godono di un alto grado di rimbalzo, al punto che vi sono anche enigmi ambientali su di essi, per togliere barriere ad oggetti o per aprire certe zone necessarie per proseguire.\n\nCon i punti guadagnati dai potenziatori e dai globi energetici nascosti potremo aggiornare notevolmente le nostre capacit\u00e0. All'inizio ci\u00f2 apparir\u00e0 davvero superfluo e sgravante, ma gi\u00e0 a met\u00e0 del gioco si dimostrer\u00e0 vitale per superare il numero crescente di laser e nemici. Oltre a migliorare le resistenze base, potremo acquisire due tipi di barriera, una parziale che si consuma assorbendo i colpi ed una totale a tempo limitato. Potremo velocizzare la propulsione per superare presse mortali, dotare di rigenerazione i corpi posseduti, aumentare gli attacchi fisici, rendere esplosivo un oggetto aspirato stile Gambit degli X-men, crearci un alleato e potenziare i colpi laser dei soldati posseduti, qui rinominati \"Pastori\", con la semplice pressione prolungata del tasto sparo.\n\nLa storia, tratta di un futuro distopico in cui l'umanit\u00e0, per come la conosciamo, \u00e8 radicalmente cambiata, robotizzata totalmente, e nonostante ci\u00f2 a rischio perdita di libert\u00e0, pensiero e sentimenti per colpa di un 'intelligenza artificiale chiamata Matusalemme. Ovviamente noi dovremo schierarci contro il cyber-dittatore per salvare tutti dal suo controllo. Ecco... ad essere onesto, causa anche la necessita di leggere in alcuni momenti concitati, non ho afferrato tutti i passaggi, ma anche cos\u00ec mi sono parse evidenti i buchi di sceneggiatura per risparmiare sulle animazioni e sui tempi di lavorazione. Non saranno moltissime infatti le occasioni per dialogare con qualcuno al di fuori di Aldo, l'unit\u00e0 che ci ha risvegliato,  della situazione in cui ci troviamo.  La maggior parte dei discorsi selezionabili con gli abitanti della stazione sono ripetitivi e inutili, roba astrologica e poco altro e anche e le sottomissioni per conto terzi saranno decisamente scarse di numero, come del resto i giganteschi Mid-boss.\n\nCome fu per The Cave o per il pi\u00f9 rampante e artistico Broken Age, verso la fine Double Fine  mostra un p\u00f2 il fiato nel cercare di darci un oretta extra in un gioco che non arriva comunque di suo alle 10 ore, a meno che non vi perdiate per strada per colpa degli ascensori da sbloccare o allunghiate volontariamente il brodo per finire di trovare tutti gli upgrade e le sottomissioni dopo il finale post crediti, che ci toglier\u00e0 il requisito del colore dalle porte. \n\nNell'ultima parte il titolo punter\u00e0 maggiormente sulle ondate nemiche e la nostra capacit\u00e0 di resistere, mentre alcune idee tardive come sequenze colorate e  controlli speculari non verranno purtroppo approfondite.\n\nHeadlander \u00e8 un titolo che prende chiari spunti da altri prodotti, ma li rimaneggia in modo personale e riesce a far sorridere a pi\u00f9 riprese nonostante il personaggio muto. Da menzionare in questo i curati e numerosi balletti che ogni robot non combattente ci permetter\u00e0 di fare.  Tra di essi, solo uno sar\u00e0 esente da tale capacit\u00e0, ma in compenso ci aggiorner\u00e0 la mappa agevolando la nostra esplorazione. Nel caso il giocatore voglia fare a meno di tale supporto,  guadagner\u00e0 un trofeo in pi\u00f9.\n\nHeadlander non ha pretese di profondit\u00e0 poetica e non fa dello stile artistico lo specchietto per le hardcore allodole, ci offre semplicemente una giocabilit\u00e0 solida e un'esperienza piacevole. Gli spunti per arricchirlo non mancavano, ma anche cos\u00ec mi sento di consigliarlo caldamente, pur ribadendo che si tratta di un prodotto a  budget basso, che ha dalla sua unicamente l'abilit\u00e0 di uno studio indie di livello superiore alla media, con uno stile spensierato e meno comune di quanto si sarebbe portati a pensare.", "timestamp_created": 1496161513, "timestamp_updated": 1496190911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578562", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32055968": {"recommendationid": "32055968", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981588360", "num_games_owned": 498, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496119484}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]tl;dr[/h1]\nTypical Double Fine: High Style, Low Polish.

Het spel speelt zich af in een op de jaren zeventig ge\u00efnspireerde toekomstwereld waar alle mensen hun hoofd op een robotlichaam hebben laten monteren. De hoofdpersoon komt in opstand tegen de 'powers that be' op zoek naar zijn of haar eigen lichaam, het laatste menselijke lichaam dat nog bestaat. Je kunt je hoofd koppelen aan ieder lichaam dat je tegenkomt en krijgt dan de beschikking over de specifieke eigenschappen en wapens van dat lichaam. Er zijn militaire robots die ieder een bepaald wapen en toegangsniveau hebben. Om verder te komen, zul je lichamen met een steeds hoger toegangsniveau moeten vinden. Ook kun je docken met sommige computers en bepaalde activiteiten uitvoeren, zoals het besturen van sommige liften. Gedurende het spel verdien je punten, die je kunt gebruiken om je hoofd nieuwe en betere functies te geven, zoals meer snelheid, een schild, meer mogelijkheden om andere robots te besturen enz. Het spel is groter dan ik had verwacht en naarmate je verder komt, krijg je ook meer mogelijkheden om snel naar andere gebieden van het spel te reizen. Omdat het spel is uitgegeven door Adult Swim, hebben de programmeurs van Double Fine de kans gegrepen om allerlei 'stoute' (Steam staat de woorden die ik eigenlijk wil gebruiken niet toe) verwijzingen in het spel te stoppen. \nHet spel kent ook een aantal zwakke punten, die gelukkig worden overstemd door de sterke punten. Zo herhalen verschillende npc's steeds dezelfde teksten, wat op den duur gaat vervelen. Het is ook niet altijd duidelijk wat je moet doen of hoe je op een bepaalde plek moet komen. Uiteindelijk ben ik er altijd uit gekomen, maar het zorgde soms voor enige frustratie. De nieuwe vaardigheden die je ontsluit, zijn soms weinig nuttig. Zo kun je robots overnemen en dan als turret of als guardian achterlaten. In theorie een goede manier om wat extra hulp te hebben.

And combat is pathetic, this is one of the easiest games I've played in a loooong while. Does not feel like there's any finesse to it and everything is so spammy you can barely keep track of it anyways. Some decent exploration going on here but absolutely zero platforming, you can't even jump. Flying around can be kind of fun though, sure. Story's... okay, a bit confusing to be honest and it feels like a lot of things go unanswered by the end. And the style is solid too. For a $20 game though it's pretty short; I got it for like $6 and that was maybe a bit cheap but I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this really.

Hitchhiker's Guide is one of my favorite books series.  And this feels like a metroid game with a heart of Hitchiker's guide and the aesthetics of what the 60s and 70s thought the future would be like.  I can dig that.\n\nThere's little need to worry about missing things, because most of the time you can go back and get what you missed. The only thing I had to restart the game to get, was an achievement where you  have to kill mappy before you take his data.\n\nI got stuck once, and that was really frustrating, because I didn't realize how the shields work.  The shield blocks both laser fire and wall lasers, and you can change the direction of the shield with the right analog stick.  I also got lost in the power dome area, but I figured it out.\n\nNo jumping is a little weird, but flying around is fun.  And aiming with twin sticks, on my controller was a ltitle difficult, but there's a good cover mechanic, when you can find cover.  There are lines that show the path of your laser as well if you hold down (L2 I think?)\n\nThere were a few fun moves that I neglected until the end of the game, and I kind of wish there was more opportuinty to practice them.\n\nThe game felt like a good length to me.  I might have spent a little more time with it, than others, trying to find all of the dialog that characters say, and all the secrets.  I enjoyed the dialog, for the most part.  I also did 100% on achievements.  I got most of the achievements by chance, through my regular gameplay but there were about 5 I had to look up, at the end.\n\nI think the full price ($19.99 in the US) is fair and worth it, but I bought the game when it was on sale, and I'm happy to have been able to get it on sale, because money is a little tight.\n\nI do wish I had the soundtrack, so I could add it to my work music.\n\nEdit: one thing I didn't mention is there's this nice Interstate '76 vibe as well\nEdit2:  And lots of fun dances!", "timestamp_created": 1494217443, "timestamp_updated": 1494294363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609144", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31600740": {"recommendationid": "31600740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026002532", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494151401}, "language": "english", "review": "A very strong Metroidvania with an excelent art style.

The concept sounded strange to me at first: You're the last survivor of mankind and the only thing left of you is... your head!? In a flying helmet, ready to mount on robot bodies?\n\nWell, that's the story - and more, of course. You have to fight your way through a large number of security guards to uncover the secret behind it all. Your primary weapon is the ability to take control of a robot after replacing his head with your own, which requires to get close without being shot. In return, you can make use of whatever they had to fight you, namely lasers and even bigger lasers.\n\nRobots have different security levels, designated by their color, and security areas only allow access with sufficient privileges. This brings a tactical element to the game as you need the right robots to enter secured zones. It often isn't easy to bring the respective droid where you need it in order to gain access. Sometimes, this requires thinking, sometimes it takes dexterity or fighting skills to reach your goal.\n\nThere are also hidden rooms to discover and you often find technical improvements for your helmet in them (faster movement, more energy, new abilities, and so on). These rooms normally can't be reached with a robot, so they require you to fly using your helmet only. Altogether, I really enjoyed finding all of them and figuring out how to get there.\n\nFighting is rather easy and there are multiple ways to defeat your enemies. You can shoot off their heads and take over their bodies, you can destroy them with your laser or ram and beat them, resulting in an overload. Your laser beams reflect off walls (as do theirs) to shoot around corners and there are different patterns of laser fire, depeding on the weapon model (single, double, triple, fractal, and so on). However, when you destroy a robot, it will respawn some time later, so it's best to shoot off their heads and leave their torsos standing around.\n\nThe very best about this game is the whole presentation. It's like the modern version of a 70s sci-fi movie. Robots are much like people imagined them to be back then, with humurous AI, big guns, following some simple program. Also the graphic style is very clear and polished. It somehow reminds me of the new Star Trek movies trying to resemble the original look, but with modern CGI. Additionally, the menu and loading screens have an awesome retro touch, just like an old 8 bit Atari game (but somehow modern again). The music much reminds me of the Tron 2 soundtrack and adds a great atmosphere.\n\nHere are the pros and cons in my eyes:\n\n[u]Pro[/u]\n- Interesting story\n- Great presentation\n- Modern retro look\n- Atmospheric soundtrack\n- Good humor (I just say door AI)\n- Excellent playability - responsive controls for keyboard / mouse AND controller\n- Fluent gameplay at steady 60 fps\n- Solid and bugfree (I didn't experience a single crash or any other issue)\n- Borderless fullscreen window mode\n- Moderate difficulty (mostly easy fights, nice riddles)\n- Some challenging achievements\n\n[u]Contra[/u]\n- Lift positions may require longer detours as you can't enter the lift from all sides in certain positions (actually the only thing that annoyed me a little)\n- Being such a quality game, I wish it would be longer (it's not really short though, I completed it in 18 hours without rushing)\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]:\nThis game is a real masterpiece and I enjoyed every second of it. I'll most likely give it another go in order to complete the five achievements I missed. And I'm already looking forward to play it again.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes, by all means!

I\u2019m Weise, aka Thomas, and I\u2019d like to invite you to join me in this retro-futuristic, side-scrolling, action-adventure game set in a world inspired by 70\u2019s science fiction. Be sure to check out my other reviews on the channel and watch me live at Beam.pro/WeiseGamer.\n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1]\n\nWelcome to the future, a utopia for humans, who have all gave up their bodies to live in robot suits that allow them to be immortal, free from disease, free from harm, and so much more. But they are NOT as free as they thought! The evil AI ruler of the utopia Methuselah has actually enslaved humanity and can control these robot-human hybrids.\nYou are humanity\u2019s last hope, possibly the only person with an all human head, preserved in a futuristic space helmet that resembles the head jars from Futurama. You must land on various heads (hence the name of the game), taking control of the robots to move through the world and take down Methuselah, freeing humanity from her control.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nWhen you start the game, you are merely a head in a helmet, able to fly around through a propulsion mechanism within the helmet itself. In a kind of RPG style, you unlock various abilities as you play through a skill tree menu which will allow you to do things like rip off the heads of robots walking around, have a higher durability so you take less damage, and much more.\n\nEarly on, you are introduced to a core gameplay element that almost acts like a light puzzle mechanic. Various security doors have color codes that will only open for guards of the same color. So for example, if you want to get through a red door, you need to take over the body of a red robot guard, shoot his phaser at the door, and walk through. There are security levels, so some higher ranked \u201ccolors\u201d will allow you to pass through the lower rank ones as well. Through this means, you can progress through more and more of the world, completing side quests along the way as you continue down the path to save humanity.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nVisually this game blew me away. Double Fine Productions did a fantastic job setting the theme of this as a retro-70\u2019s futuristic world. Throughout your travels, you\u2019ll come across disco dance parties, robots with afro heads, bell bottoms, and so much more. The 70\u2019s disco theme is present throughout the entire game and is extremely fluid.\nThe detail in the phasers, the robots themselves, the environment and destructible cover elements is just perfect and I couldn\u2019t have asked for more.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nWhen you play Headlander, you are given a COMPLETE game that sets you in the world of this futuristic 70\u2019s sci-fi environment. As mentioned with the visuals, the audio sets the scene perfectly from the start with a retro feel, that\u2019s groovy and hip and makes you want to boogie.\n\nTake that soundtrack and match it with great voice acting and you have a winning combination. Earl, the voice in your helmet that guides you throughout the game, was casted perfectly and the scripting and lines used are wonderful. Your character is a mute, but all the citizens, err, robot citizens, have their own voices as well and truly have some character behind them.\n\nFinally, the sound effects are just great. Overall, they did an amazing job with the audio here. The blasters sound right, the destructible environment sounds right, ripping off the head of a robot sounds right, it\u2019s just really a pleasant experience all around.\n\n[h1]Replay-ability[/h1]\n\nReplay-ability is really the only area this game is lacking. It\u2019s a fairly short game overall, and even if you wanted to 100% the game with all the achievements, it can be done in less hours than some may prefer. But honestly, the quality over quantity phrase is key here for me. This game was very enjoyable from start to finish for me and well-polished.\nThe main replay-ability mechanic would be to complete the game with 100%, finishing all the side quests and getting every achievement. While this is fine, it really doesn\u2019t leave much to come back for outside of just enjoying the mechanics of the game, and I do wish there was a little more to do.\n\n[h1]Overall Wrap-Up[/h1]\n\nOverall, I definitely suggest picking up this game, if not at full price, on a sale. To me, it\u2019s worth playing through due to the high quality and polish of the game. Again, there is not much replay-value to be had unless you are an achievement hunter and want to 100% the game, but it is a very fun experience that played to my metroidvania nostalgia in a fun world that felt complete all the way through.

By cramming the player into a head rather than a full character, the game opens up many opportunities for combat and exploration. Why destroy an enemy when you can just take over their body? \n\nThe level design in this game is quite good. There is room for combat, for puzzles, and for secrets. Everything is aesthetically pleasing and keeps one big theme in mind all the time, and that is 1970s retro-futurism. The game captures the style of the 70s perfectly and never misses a detail in its style. Along with its style, the game also maintains a humorous approach to some things which makes the game more enjoyable.\n\nThe writing of the game's story is also top-notch, Characters have their own interesting personalities and feel alive. The way the story develops deliberately leaves you aware of the present but completely confused about the lore, because that is the same way the character, a 20th century man awoken from cryostatis would feel like. \n\nThe drawbacks in this game are:\n1. Backtracking is very common. For example, the player finds a locked door, so they need to go to a branching hallway and cross 5 rooms full of enemies to flip a switch after they flip a switch, they have to run back through all the five rooms with all the enemies re-spawned back in their places as if the player never touched them.\n2. Combat is functional but not satisfying, instead it feels like a chore. The slow paced combat often involves standing in one place, shooting at an enemy, shifting a little to the side and then continuing the firing until the enemies are dead. WIth the constant respawning of enemies, this eventually gets annoying.\n\nIn conclusion,, this game is not legendary, and will not be remembered for decades. But, regardless of that, the entertainment value is really good and a purchase on sale is a really good idea.", "timestamp_created": 1490994358, "timestamp_updated": 1490994358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30860932": {"recommendationid": "30860932", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983749619", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490983947}, "language": "spanish", "review": "CABECINAUTA MODE ON\n\nToda una sorpresa de juego, de nuevo Double Fine la l\u00eda parda y sale airosa. Es un juego que es una amalgama de conceptos, que milagrosamente funciona, muy muy bien. Se trata de un dual stick shooter, con ambientaci\u00f3n de ciencia ficci\u00f3n de los 70, con un estilo gr\u00e1fico s\u00faper personal y bien resuelto en lo t\u00e9cnico y lo art\u00edstico. Como protagonista eres una CABEZA FLOTANTE que puede poseer distintos cuerpos rob\u00f3ticos, con el objetivo de descubrir tu procedencia y misi\u00f3n en la vida, mientras abres puertas, disparas l\u00e1sers y descubres habitaciones secretas.\n\nLa historia es sencilla pero sirve para darate un motivo para moverte por el mundo, que es sumamente divertido, lleno de gui\u00f1os a la ciencia ficci\u00f3n cl\u00e1sica, con personajes de dise\u00f1o extravagante que dicen frases con un sentido del humor sarc\u00e1stico genial. \n\nLa duraci\u00f3n en mi caso es de 12 horas, teniendo en cuenta que algunas zonas se me han atragantado, y los jefes finales pueden ser un poco pesados de resolver. La dificultad est\u00e1 bien ajustada, y creo que no se llega a abusar del hecho de recorrer los escenarios varias veces. Teniendo en cuenta que volver a recorrer escenarios con poderes nuevos es la mec\u00e1nica b\u00e1sica de un Metroidvania, etiqueta donde este juego entra perfectamente.\n\nComo punto negro, el control de los disparos a veces es impreciso, cuesta conseguir apuntar donde uno quiere. Se juega fant\u00e1stico con el mando de 360, pero con el Stem Controller es un infierno apuntar bien.

Play as a flying head that docks onto robots exploring a metroidvania 80s themed future space station with groovy music and rad graphics? Sign me up! *Terms and conditions apply unfortunately.\n\nThe gameplay is unique to say the least. You fly around as a disembodied head with jets at your neck and dock into robots of various colors. The color of your robot determines where you can go in the level as there are gates that are color coded and only robots with access level of a certain color or higher can cross those doors and this is mostly where the metroidvania aspect mostly resides. You traverse the levels in search of the next access level robot to go through the levels that you know are gated and repeat until you unlock the purple(?) robots which unlock every single door in the game being the highest access level. You can also unlock various powerups for your head which allow you to boost when flying, suck more powerfully with your vacuum suck (???) and transform the robots you take over by giving them shields or making them into sentries or turrets.\n\nThough the flying and exploration aspects of the game are pretty fun, the combat is not great honestly. The aiming on the robots is not precise and most of the time you'll simply shoot in the general direction of the enemies hoping to hit them. You have the option to aim but some enemies have some quirky hitboxes which mean you won't always hit them or hit them in places you don't expect. You'll also get caught in rooms that have been FILLED with bullet particles from various enemies shooting at you and their bullets bouncing off the walls which has lead me to many deaths over the course of my playthrough. You'll mostly want to keep pushing on to explore the rest of the game but this gets frustrating sometimes.\n\nThe graphics are SUPER trippy with lots of rainbow LSD-esque effects and wild colors. The bullets all leave particle trails that may sometimes overwhelm you. The detail in the levels is very well executed with the 70s-80s theme shining through on almost every room you'll explore. Suffice it to say, the art direction is one of the best parts of the game. There are also a LOT of attempts at dirty humour which are amusing at times.\n\nThere are problems though. The BIGGEST caveat when playing this game is the fact that it feels unfinished. There are only 2 major bosses in the game and when defeating the second one, the game ends ABRUPTLY. There's very little resolution and you'd find yourself wanting more of the game yet the only thing left to do is find any rooms you might have missed to get 100% completion. There is definitely a feeling that a lot of the areas in the levels were gutted due to restrictions in time or budget. There are 2 major exploration levels with one of them less than half the size of the other and one linear map which is essentially a path straight to the boss. The whole game takes about 6-8 hours to complete 100% including every single achievement which seems really small. The side missions are INCREDIBLY dumb and are simply \"go here -> collect thigs/kill things\" and there are WAY too few of them. I hope at some point the devs release the game with some dlc to fill the empty areas as was done with Ori and the Blind Forest.\n\nAt the normal price point, this may not seem worth it for a game that's just 6-8 hours of content. I bought it at 70% off and at that price it was DEFINITELY worth the cost. I suggest waiting for a sale for the game only due to the lack of content.

"english", "review": "The weirdest thing about Headlander is that you can't jump. Can you imagine completing a Castlevania without jumping? Bionic Commando didn't let you jump, but it had the bionic arm. There is no bionic arm in Headlander. There are short range teleporters, but otherwise your legs are simply for moving left and right. Except, at any point in time, you can pop your head off of whatever robot body you're currently inhabiting and fly around. I guess that's pretty weird too, now that I think of it.\n\nIn Headlander, you are a disembodied head. You have a little thrust rocket and not much else at the start. You progress in the game by attaching yourself to headless robot bodies with varying abilities. There's an experience point system, and you can upgrade your head's abilities. By the end of the game, you'll have more abilities than you'll know what to do with. The story kind of gets a little lost, but the gist of it is that you might be the last surviving human after everyone has uploaded their brains to robot bodies, but an AI named Methuselah has taken control of them and you have to stop him.\n\n\nHeadlander does this all within a beautifully realized 70's sci-fi style. Funk. Rooms with shag carpeting all over. An early area known as \"the Pleasure Port\", which is full of sexual overtones without ever doing anything get in trouble with a ratings board. Every enemy shoots lasers, and they bounce around the room. Trippy colors everywhere. Every non-combat robot body can dance. I didn't grow up in the 70's but it all seems very spot-on. It's a fun to explore world with a lot of what we expect out of a Metroidvania.\n\nWhere it loses some shine is that there's a real lack of enemy variety. It's mostly humanoid robots that stand still and shoot bouncing lasers at you. After you learn how to aim for their heads as a reflex, they don't offer much challenge. You also get the ability to pop the heads off of enemy robots while disembodied early on, which is a quick way to disarm them if you're not actively being shot at by other robots. There are a couple more enemy types that show up late in the game, and some with defense against having their heads immediately removed, but they're rare. It's also a fairly short game, but that's less of a complaint and more of a welcome sight that the game won't overstay its welcome.\n\nHowever, beginning to end, Headlander is good, weird fun. There's a moment halfway through that I won't even begin to spoil that literally made me laugh out loud and it reminded me that these moments are what Double Fine does best, even if the gameplay has a few kinks. Headlander's a pick-me-up for a boring weekend.", "timestamp_created": 1489466363, "timestamp_updated": 1489466363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.771246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30387680": {"recommendationid": "30387680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045452810", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480188923}, "language": "french", "review": "Tout simplement g\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9niaaaal!", "timestamp_created": 1488964460, "timestamp_updated": 1488964460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30342721": {"recommendationid": "30342721", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970485167", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488923475}, "language": "french", "review": "Univers tr\u00e8s original, plein d'id\u00e9es de gameplay. \nJe le conseille vivement!", "timestamp_created": 1488737640, "timestamp_updated": 1488737640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466321", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30262118": {"recommendationid": "30262118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002009022", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475230270}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh, soooo gooood aesthetic and sense of humor.

For under twenty bucks, it's a great game at the price.\n\nI loved the game's atmosphere, the music--the music!!--the style, and the natural ease in which you control your character's disembodied head as it soars hither and yon across the futuristic scenery.\n\nThe story was... well, I would say \"Good\", or \"Quite Acceptable\" considering its Double Fine lineage.  I've seen better and no doubt will continue to see better games from them, story-wise, but overall I'd have to say that this game's story is one that they can be proud to add to their list of accomplishments.  Just, you know... not at the top.\n\n\nThe game is not without its sins, however, and I have compiled a list of them thusly:\n\n\n1. Technical issues.  \nShortly after starting the game and for every cut-scene or level transition afterwards, the game hangs up due to it popping up another hidden window box underneath stating simply \"Disc not found\".  If this happens to you just alt+tab over to the message and click \"OK\", then alt+tab back to the game.  This seems to satisfy it, because the game continues on as if nothing had ever happened.  This occured to me about 5 or 6 times during my entire playthough, which was pretty annoying but otherwise manageable.\n\n2.  Dialogue.\nThe dialogue in this game is great--when it's great.  That is to say, several characters and scenes tend to get a lot more care and attention from their writers when compared to, well, pretty much every other character.  Don't go blundering into a fresh playthrough of this game thinking that every character has a scripted or comedic gem hidden within them; some secret facet to their personality or past that will be revealed unto you, the steel-eyed adventure gamer, if you just click them enough times.  Sometimes a boring, bland, background NPC is that way for a reason.\n\nThat being said, certainly you should pester every NPC you meet that actually bothers to bring up a dialogue box and /or is not immediately targetable by the character (which in this game denotes that they are important enough to maybe have some story attached to them).  Also, pester Mappy, because he is the greatest thing in this game.\n\nAlso, another caveat - What the game lacks in quality scripted dialogue it more than makes up for in fantastic voice-over work.  Major props to those guys and all involved with that.  Double secret probabation props to whoever grabbed Richard Horvitz (Invader Zim, Raz from Psychonauts) who voiced several characters in his own special fashion.\n\n3.  Sidequests.\nThere are exactly three sidequests in the game.  All of them are \"Find thing A, fetch it and bring back to location B.\"  All of them reward you with the same thing - a pretty decent experience boost, but nothing valuable or unique.  None of them have any impact on the story whatsoever, and serve only to pad out the game's playtime by a few tedious extra minutes.  Their very existence only serves as a frustrating glimpse into an alternate-dimension's version of this game, one in which the developers had enough time and resources to create and fully flesh-out the richly-detailed and immersive story experience that they were so obviously aspring for, filled with dozens upon dozens of unique, personable, and heavily-scripted characters.  Instead, here in our dimension, we'e left with nothing but these sad abortions, withered survivors of the cutting-room floor.\nI guess what I'm saying here is that if you're going to include a side-quest in your game at all, it should serve to expand and deepen upon the storyline.  It should not be a god-damn chore.  If I wanted to pick up some rando's laundry on my way to saving the world, I'd be playing an MMO, not whatever this is.\n\n4.  Tedium.\nHeadlander has a fast and loose affair with being tedious.  Initially your character moves around quite slowly, but you'll unlock permanent speed boosts fairly quickly which solves that issue outright.  \nThen you'll start to notice that it seems like every other maintanence tunnel is crawling with lasers that need to be carefully manuevered around... and at the end of that very tunnel, you'll unlock a shield ability that lets you breeze right through them.  \nThere's a lot of stuff like that, wherein a flaw of the game makes itself noticeable only to be solved in a reasonably swift manner via an unlocked ability or new locale.\nLess easily fixed is the problem of security doors, seperate from normal obstacles which require you to explore a bit and discover an alternate path around them.  These doors each have their own \"colored key\" requirement of needing you to wear newer and tougher stolen bodies in order to pass through them.  While this initially spawns a lot of backtracking and frustration, especially if you lose your \"key\" in a firefight and have to find another new body of the same type, it turns out that higher-level bodies allow you to pass all lower-level doors, and when combined with a decent fast-travel system that you unlock as you progress it takes out much of the sting of backtracking everywhere, although unfortunately it does not eliminate the need for it entirely.\n\n\nTL;DR = It's a very enjoyable game despite any flaws.  Buy the damn thing already.\n\n\nBonus!  Some non-spoiler hints to vastly improve your first playthrough:\n\n-  Kill Mappy.  You'll know him when you see him.  He's the best character in the game, by far, and he'll respawn if he dies, as he is after all just a soulless automaton.  You'll see him a couple of times throughout the game, so make sure that one of those times (the first or second), you kill him dead before you do anything else with him.  Doing so will net you the only missable achievement in the game.\n\n- Most NPC bodies can dance, just use the melee button when you are wearing them.  Every \"type\" of NPC has a different dance.  Not very useful, beyond a hidden achievement, but it's a really nice touch.\n\n- Avoid backtracking.  Push on, ever forwards, at least until you reach a part of the game where they start talking about teleporting you to a new area.  The perks, maps, and enemies you unlock will make back-tracking in order to ferret out hidden locations and power-ups much, much easier.\n\n- That being said, make sure to fully explore each area eventually.  Almost every hidden tunnel or secret room has one kind of power-up in it, and they stack.  Thanks to power-ups, I had maxed out my stats well before the final area of the game, which made things a bit easier.\n\n- Remember that even if you can't reach a security door with your stolen body, you can open it by shooting it, allowing you to dash through it with just your head before it closes. \n\n- Finally, near the end of the game you'll come across colored targets in various rooms.  These can be shot to unlock secret areas or remove force fields, and the difficulty in shooting each varies wildly from room to room.

[/b]\n\nThis is going to be shorter than my normal reviews because, frankly, there\u2019s not much more to be said about Headlander other than it\u2019s excellent.\n\nMade by Double Fine, Headlander is a Metroidvania where the character you control is a head who can dock and control with any NPC/enemy in the game. There are different enemy types based on security clearance and color. For instance, red is the lowest security with orange being next. To get through a red door you need a red body. If you have an orange body then you can get through a red or orange door. This goes up to about five different colors. This design choice leads to some devilishly clever and rewarding mechanics of swapping bodies to get through different doors.\n\nThe game boasts a fairly robust map with plenty of secrets to keep you hunting and plenty of powerups to chase after. The reto-futuristic 60\u2019s aesthetic is also a nice setting to seat the game in. You can expect the typically great Double Fine humor and charm here as well.\n\nThe core loop of getting new bodies and gaining access to previously unavailable rooms is so addictive that I found myself finishing this game in just two sittings.

Sadly while the art is Spectacular, it's Story and mechanics dont quite fit togther in a lot of places. \n\nI've done everything in the game and I still dont understand the story.

You have to be very carefull with your shield as the origin point for lazers can falll inside the shield rendering it useless. \n\nWhat confuses me most is that double fine has no audio priority. Enviroment Barks keep interupting conversations your having. They have multiple voice actors read out the eact same lines.. which confounds me. For a company so much about their writing I'm just shocked at that.\n\nThe collectibles are numerous, too mumerious to feel any imediate value to moving forward as you have to buy things from a skill tree instead of being rewarded with weapons in a Metroid style. Alot of the deeper tactics never became usefull as the controlls to activate them were too complex to remember and they werent as usefull as just spaming the fire button.\n\nIt's got some fun concepts in there that you just wish were explored in a deeper fashon. Humanity without boddies, space exploration, expamsion of humanity out of earth.

Unfortunately, Headlander is a poor game by Double Fine standards and by metroidvania standards. It falls short in (almost) every area. \n\n\n\nPROS:\n-Great art style\n-Clean controls\n-Base concept of switchable bodies is a brilliant idea, but they do literally NOTHING with it all game.\n\nNEUTRALS:\n-Very generic upgrades (I didn't use any of the active abilities except the roll attack which is really overpowered)\n-Very generic collectibles (health, energy, and power....but all are basically the same\n-Barely any puzzles\n-Trippy room that flips upside down appears literally for half of one room AFTER you beat the final boss of the game. This is the only room in the game with any type of mechanic to it. \n-Game has 2 bosses (one halfway through, one endboss). The midgame boss is just thrown at the player without any real introduction or reason as to why he's a \"boss\" (esp strange since the game has only 2 bosses).\n\nCONS:\n-No hidden areas (all the access points to a room show up on the map when you enter a room, even if you have not downloaded the map for the area from mappy)\n\n-No plot. No character development. This is really surprising because Double Fine are famous for their storytelling. Sometimes I wonder if parts of the story just didn't play on my system or something because there was virtually no plot throughout the game, but in bits and pieces (esp towards the end) there seemed to be an attempt at an actual story. By that point though, there had been character development and no build-up, so it fell very flat.\n\n-TERRIBLE level design (esp for a metroidvania game). The levels are 100% linear; you will never be able to access new parts of old areas by going back with abilities you earn later in the game (because you don't earn any abilities). \n\n-The unlockable abilities (earned via XP) are, for the most part, completely useless. Except the headboost, none of the abililties do anything in relation to map access and I don't think I used any of them throughout the game. I wasn't even aware I could slow time down until after I beat the game. \n\n-Linear \"key\" system does not promote any type of exploration. Since they needed to avoid players getting stuck, the colored robot will always appear through a matching colored door, so you don't really need to worry about the locks in 90% of the game. \n\n-Literally NOTHING was done with the awesome idea of body switching except using the cleaning guys to access smaller rooms (and the one dog quest if you count that). There could have been tons of different body types that all did different things, but unfortuantely not. \n\n-VERY EASY. I got a 100% run on my first playthrough without even trying. The combat difficulty is also really easy. You can switch bodies to basically regen your health and even if you do die, it is very forgiving and you start at the same room. \n\n-No \"New Game+\" or HARD mode, but then again why would I want to replay the game? It was so linear there is nothing left to see and there was nothing hidden.", "timestamp_created": 1480374028, "timestamp_updated": 1480374341, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597175", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27994466": {"recommendationid": "27994466", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989202420", "num_games_owned": 812, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480367435}, "language": "english", "review": "Charming aesthetic, fun gameplay!", "timestamp_created": 1480367794, "timestamp_updated": 1480367794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27897506": {"recommendationid": "27897506", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983852858", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469676635}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love classic metroidvania games, stop reading this and just pick up Headlander.

This culminates with the chess area where I just quit. \n\nThis was such a hard game for me to like. I like the fact that it's a metroidvania, I guess. (\"I guess\" because I love MVs, just not really this one.)

The best thing about Headlander is that the core gameplay loop--fly around, collect power-ups, steal a body, shoot lasers to kill bad guys and open doors, repeat--is really fun. \n\nThe setup for Headlander sounds like pure gaming gold: you're the last human (albeit a disembodied head) in a world of robots, and your special power is to steal the bodies of said robots by vaccuuming their head off. The game has a cheerful, slightly-psychadelic, groovy 70's look, and a sense of humor that is lightly scatological, but not outright filthy. That said, I never found the game \"laugh out loud\" funny, but it did make me smile. The storyline starts out promising, and then kind of fizzles, which I found surprising, given Double Fine's other games. \n\nAs is standard for the Metroidvania genre, you slowly gain new powers--the traversal powers unlock new parts of the map, while the combat powers help you fend off the increasingly tough hordes. Both the combat and puzzles are surprisingly frustration free: The puzzles generally involve stealing bodies and using their bouncing lasers to open doors or hit targets, and using your various headless powers to squeeze through dangerous corners of the map. I'm not good at platformers or puzzle games, so I was surprised to never be stuck in any given puzzle room for more than a few minutes. The combat often involves some pretty chaotic situations, but between the overly generous leveling (i.e. I was fully maxxed out before the final mission) and the frequent save points, the combat is also pretty forgiving. That said, there's something to the frenzy of dozens of lasers bouncing around, while you're vaccuuming heads, throwing up a shield, and headbutting other robots, that was always pretty fun. \n\nThat sentiment is probably the best summary of the game: it's never AMAZING, but it is fun. Headlander is a cheerful diversion for the dozen or so hours that it lasts, but it's definitely not a must-buy. \n\n7 / 10. \n", "timestamp_created": 1479856990, "timestamp_updated": 1479856990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26741567": {"recommendationid": "26741567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035512862", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479789087}, "language": "english", "review": "I found it impossible to land in the Trans fiber node.

I'd give the first half of the game a 7/10 and the second half like a 5.  If you're just looking for something new to try out for a bit then this game is worth playing.  I had a decent time with it.  If you have a limited gaming budget and only want the very best, I would definitely pass and look for something else.  Most of my enjoyment of this game was from the atmosphere/novelty of it, but that somewhat wore off after a while.\n\nI'll probably sound pretty harsh in this review, but that's just because it's easy to pinpoint what I don't like about the game, and I think that stuff is worth mentioning.\n\nTHE GOOD -\nThe combat does not play much of a role in the beginning of the game.  When I started playing, this came off as a very charming little puzzle/exploration game (emphasis on exploration, not so much on puzzle) with a bit of light combat sprinkled in, and I thought it was pretty nice.  I enjoyed all the shag carpet nonsense and crashing my dong-rocket into the pleasure port (yeh that happens).  I enjoyed the sassy doors and general atmosphere of the game.  But it slowly moves away from this, and you will end up spending more and more time on the mediocre combat.\n\nTHE BAD -\nThe game feels a lot more combat-heavy toward the end and the combat is pretty weak.  You can take on different robot bodies, but most of them feel the same.  Trade in your orange body with an orange laser for a yellow body with a yellow laser!  I think one of the worst parts of the combat is that it was usually more effective to not even bother using a body, and to instead just float around as a head, removing the heads of everyone else.  IMO this *should* feel like a last-ditch effort, but instead ended up being my go-to method.  Even if you do decide to do it the \"fun\" way and use a robot body, it's usually fine to just walk at everything and mash the attack button, then pop into a new body whenever the current one dies.\n\nThe last big problem with combat is that the late-game enemies have way too much health.  I would sit there fighting something for long enough that I became convinced I was doing something wrong, and there was some kind of puzzle aspect to the fight that I was missing.  Nope!  Just had to keep shooting.  And shooting.  Without feedback that I am doing damage (health bar, red flashing, debris flying-- there are reasons that many games have this stuff!) I will start to wonder after I've been shooting for a bit with nothing happening.  Even in encounters that did have a health bar, I still felt that they just dragged on for longer than they should have.\n\nIt also felt like they kind of ran out of puzzly ideas after a bit.  Just rehashes of the old \"bring this body from point A to B\" or \"shoot this thing at the right angle\" that didn't have much meaningful difference from the last couple times I had to do it.  They even resort to literally having you play Simon (the old kids toy/game) completely out of the blue, which was about as boring as you'd expect it to be.\n\nAnd finally, I encountered one game-breaking bug that made it impossible to continue without exiting to the main menu (maybe closing the game entirely, can't remember) and starting over again.  No progress was lost because of this.\n\nSo yeah, overall I'd say it was a positive experience, but it has some pretty major flaws that I couldn't ignore.  I think if I were not streaming the game when I played it, I probably would not have bothered finishing it.  I don't think the game is bad but there are just better games out there.  If I could choose something other than thumbs-up or thumbs-down to describe my opinion, I'd probably call it \"lukewarm\".", "timestamp_created": 1479193786, "timestamp_updated": 1479193786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768888", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26609411": {"recommendationid": "26609411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065492575", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479771000}, "language": "english", "review": "Headlander is a fantastic metroidvania title that oozes 70's retro-futuristic charm. \n\nSERIOUS SPOILER, DO NOT LOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETED THE GAME!

What I will tell you now is how very wrong I was with it all. Head Lander is a simple, brilliant, GORGEOUS game to which I had the absolute pleasure in playing.\n\n-The strong, silent type....of head-\n\nThe story is pretty simple. You're a head. A head without a body to be exact. One of the first things upon playing that you discover is that since you have no lungs, you're unable to speak as well. This puts you into one of my favorite heroic categories: The Silent Protagonist. You might remember such members of the month including Link from the Zelda series, Gordon Freeman from Half Life, or perhaps Chell from a little title known as Portal. In any case, when you have a game that chooses to leave you silent, it becomes apparent that the story is told around you in many different ways. In Head Lander, you've awoken after being cryogenically frozen only to find out the terrible Methuselah has enslaved human consciousness inside robots for some terrible plan. \n\nThe menus took me off guard not knowing what exactly to expect from this game in the first place. Instantly you feel you're transported into some super 70's sci-fi flick with the burnt oranges, sound effects, tracking lines and clever way it's all put together. Hitting play, you dive into these amazingly beautiful worlds, so easy to navigate from the perfectly smooth controls. You would think flying a severed head around would be difficult, but it's quite the opposite--and crazy fun. It's a simple puzzle game of opening doors with the right colours attached which means you have to plop your head on other robots walking around the place. This isn't limited to the citizens or soldiers either--cleaning bots, information bots, hell, opening doors a lot of the times means you have to plug yourself into some computer system. It's completely off the wall, and so well thought out. \n\n-Try not to lose your head in combat-\n\nThe combat can be quite clever too. When you attach yourself to a robot that job is to carry a weapon, your abilities range with said weapon. Different colours are more tough than the last, or created more bounces with your laser beam. Since in a lot of the case of stealth or combat here is to line up a shot with your laser, you often end up playing a pocket game of Snooker just trying to shoot the other guy. If guns aren't your thing, you can usually just zoom up with avoiding the shots whizzing past and literally suck the head from your opponent right off rendering them useless. Guns blazing isn't always the best idea, but what I really like about this game is that it lets you try without penalizing you too much. \n\n-Head of the class-\n\nYou even get a little talent tree to dump points for upgrades in so you can become a more, uh....efficient head. Around the levels, you'll find cheeky vents hiding which have upgrades outside of the talent tree. It doesn't take you long to really beef the little guy up, and quite appropriately the areas scale to all the extras you have. Instead of feeling like you're going into God Mode with it, (which I tend to get easily bored of when I'm allowed to do everything around the place) it adds to the complexity of the challenges as most abilities allow you to move from one area to the next.\n\nIt's funny, slick and amazingly entertaining. I honestly can't recommend this one enough. The concept is so out of left field that it works seamlessly. The gameplay is ace, the jokes are a good laugh, and the graphics are stunning. Just don't play it in front of little ones...they might start to ask questions as to why that robot is...uh...humping things. -ChickenSupreme/Gamesxtreme.com", "timestamp_created": 1479073464, "timestamp_updated": 1479073536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26443399": {"recommendationid": "26443399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073832766", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476035361}, "language": "german", "review": "Diese Spiel ist wirklich Gut.\nIch liebe den Stil des Spieles.", "timestamp_created": 1478379423, "timestamp_updated": 1478379423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26429520": {"recommendationid": "26429520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010734627", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478326279}, "language": "english", "review": "Headlander is a metroidesque 2D sidescroller. 1-playgrough and 100% achievements took 8.5 hours, so there's a decent bang for you buck.

But Headlander has a more polished presentation.  The headlanding mechanic also reminds me of the Oddworld games, with Abe's possession ability, although it's much easier and there is no traditional platforming (no jumping).  \n\nLike with other Double Fine games, Headlander immerses you completely in a bizarre world.  The art, soundtrack, writing, voice acting are all top-notch, and I love the retrofuturistic look.  It also seems like an open world, although you do unlock different areas as you go along.  It's easy to navigate and go back to get upgrades you overlooked or did not have the abilities to reach before.  Everything in this game is simple to understand in a way that allows you to just enjoy it.  There's never much pressure, since the areas you've visited don't lock you out as you play.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and makes sense at every moment.  The chess area was my least favorite part, and it was still pretty fun.  The game is maybe a little short, but I think I only feel that way because I liked it so much.  But there are a lot of achievements, which give a reason to keep playing once you've finished the story.  \n\nA lot of the combat can be avoided, sort of, by removing enemies' heads rather than shooting them, but the actual combat is well thought out, too.  There are a few bosses; they're all of the type that you need to figure out a simple technique of some kind for each phase of a fight.  \n\nOverall this is a game that relies on thinking more than on reflexes, but although there are some cool little puzzles, including the boss fights, nothing is overly hard.  I can imagine some players considering this game too easy, although the difficulty was perfect for me.  \n\nRecommended to fans of classic sci-fi and/or puzzle platformers.

You are a disembodied head that has both a fully functional brain and a jetpack. You're in a world where the majority of humanity has had their personalities digitised and attached to robot bodies, serving an evil AI overlord. Your goal is to try to free everyone from this oppression and make them truly human again. You do this by possessing other robots by pulling their heads off and sticking yours on their bodies. For freedom!\n\nMost of the standard Metroidvania tropes are here, including doors that are restricted to certain weapons or robot types, a largely open area to explore and objectives that sometimes involve a degree of light puzzle solving. There's also some quirky combat and boss fights along the way.\n\nIt's not particularly challenging as it's very hard to die, harder still after a few upgrades and even when you do, you basically just respawn in the same room with no penalty. While the station you're in is vast, you also have a map system that makes it relatively straightforward to find where you have to go next and rarely laves you lost.\n\nYou'll also come across the occasional station goer who will have an optional side mission that can yield additional points to upgrade yourself, plus there are numerous hidden upgrades in the station, though the paths to them are often indicated on the map and aren't hard to find.\n\nDouble Fine is known for humour in their games and rightly or wrongly, there's always a heavy expectation of this from them. Headlander make me chuckle a few times but the humour is pretty understated compared to some of their past efforts. What really makes this game stand out for me is how gorgeous it looks and how well they nailed the vibe they were going for. Headlander is bright, colourful and doesn't take itself seriously, visually or in its writing. Those are good things to me.\n\nAfter multiple crowdfunded titles that I all thought were poor, it seems Double Fine managed to put out quality stuff when they have a publisher keeping their legendarily poor money and project management skills in check. Headlander won't necessarily challenge you but it's a good Metroidvania in its own right and quite a memorable one too. Given that Double Fine's never made one of these before, it's a great first effort.", "timestamp_created": 1473390719, "timestamp_updated": 1473390719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502142", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25361536": {"recommendationid": "25361536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013110518", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471616678}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Tetszet\u0151s vizualit\u00e1s, remek retro sci-fi \u00e9let\u00e9rz\u00e9ssel beoltva, klasszikus Double Fine humor, \u00e9s kell\u0151en \u00e9lvezhet\u0151 j\u00e1t\u00e9kmenet, mely ugyan nem v\u00e1ltja meg a vil\u00e1got \u2013 s tartalomban sem ny\u00fajt hatalmasat \u2013, puszta egyedis\u00e9g\u00e9vel (magyar\u00e1n a lebeg\u0151 fejjel) m\u00e9gis olyan \u00e9lm\u00e9nyt ny\u00fajt, mely k\u00e9pes kiemelkedni a tucat-platformerek sz\u00fcrkes\u00e9g\u00e9b\u0151l.

Ils nous proposent donc un nouveau jeu un peu barr\u00e9 et qui fera plaisir aux amateurs des ann\u00e9es 70. Dans Headlander, on incarne une t\u00eate qui doit se connecter \u00e0 des h\u00f4tes robotiques afin de sauver ce qu'il reste de l'humanit\u00e9. Le tout est m\u00e9lang\u00e9 avec un humour particuli\u00e8rement dr\u00f4le et bien pens\u00e9.\n\nHeadlander s'av\u00e8re assez marrant d\u00e8s les premiers instants de prise en main. On comprend vite que le d\u00e9lire ann\u00e9es 70's sera assum\u00e9 jusqu'au bout par les d\u00e9veloppeurs. Il faut donc s'attendre \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir tous types de rencontres originales et dont on pourra prendre possession afin d'avancer dans l'histoire. En plus de sa partie solo assez longue et progressive, Headlander nous propose aussi des qu\u00eates secondaires l\u00e0 aussi dr\u00f4les et qui ont le m\u00e9rite de casser un peu la monotonie du jeu. Il faudra par exemple aller retrouver un chien perdu dans la station et le ramener \u00e0 son maitre.\n\nUn bel hommage aux ann\u00e9es 70 avec pas mal de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences\nHeadlander se d\u00e9coupe en plusieurs phases, il faudra d'abord r\u00e9soudre des \u00e9nigmes simples comme de trouver la bonne position pour des satellites. Il faudra ensuite aller chercher le bon robot pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des endroits particuliers qui correspond \u00e0 la couleur dudit robot. Le gameplay est simple mais rudement efficace, on dirige la t\u00eate et on peut enlever la t\u00eate d'un robot pour en prendre le contr\u00f4le. Chaque robot dispose d'une barre de vie et si notre robot se fait d\u00e9truire, on pourra s'enfuir et chercher un autre h\u00f4te avec la t\u00eate. La partie n'est perdue que si notre t\u00eate est d\u00e9truite.\n\nUne fois connect\u00e9 \u00e0 notre h\u00f4te on r\u00e9cup\u00e8re ses sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s comme des tirs multiples, une plus grande endurance ou une r\u00e9sistance aux \u00e9clairs par exemple. Il faudra bien choisir son type de robot pour pouvoir avancer dans le jeu.

Le style graphique est tr\u00e8s color\u00e9 ce qui tranche avec les autres jeux du genre s'inspirant plus que Dark Souls que d'Austin powers! La maniabilit\u00e9 est en revanche un poil perfectible. on a souvent du mal \u00e0 bien viser avec une gestion des rebonds qui rendrait fou m\u00eame les pros de Bust-a-Move. Les ennemis n'ont pas ce probl\u00e8me et ils visent \u00e0 la perfection apr\u00e8s un petit temps de latence, frustrant.\n\nHeadlander dispose d'une dur\u00e9e de vie cons\u00e9quente avec pas mal de zones \u00e0 explorer et pas mal de challenges et autres zones secr\u00e8tes \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir. Si on souhaite le terminer, il faudra compter environ 7-8 heures car il arrive souvent que l'on doive faire quelques allers-retours chronophages. Les \u00e9nigmes et les zones \u00e0 explorer sont assez claires et on ne reste jamais bloqu\u00e9 trop longtemps dans un seul et m\u00eame ensemble de salles. Le jeu commence assez vite \u00e0 devenir monotone malgr\u00e9 la bonne gestion de d\u00e9couverte des diff\u00e9rents pouvoirs.\n\nBon il se termine quand le jeu?\nHeadlander fait malheureusement trop trainer les d\u00e9bats sur la fin. Parfois un jeu trop long peut-\u00eatre plus probl\u00e9matique qu'un jeu trop bugg\u00e9. On se demande assez souvent si on la v\u00e9ritable volont\u00e9 de terminer le jeu. On passe les derni\u00e8res heures \u00e0 s'exasp\u00e9rer et se demander ce qui est pass\u00e9 par la t\u00eate des d\u00e9veloppeurs lorsqu'ils ont imagin\u00e9 ce final. Une fois la bonne dose de LSD initiale pass\u00e9e, il ne reste plus qu'un pastiche d'un film de science fiction des ann\u00e9es 70. Il y avait surement bien mieux \u00e0 faire \u00e0 mon avis.\n\nHeadlander est un bon jeu, c'est une \u00e9vidence! Malheureusement il souffre de pas mal de soucis qui font que l'on a pas forc\u00e9ment envie de le terminer. Le d\u00e9lire est planant et le gameplay bien rod\u00e9 fait son effet pendant 4-5 heures. Sur le fin, le jeu tourne en rond et on a plus l'impression de subir le jeu.

The main premise of the game is you are the last human awoken from cryogenic storage and thus only your head has survived. So you find yourself as a floating head in a jar which can float around and attach yourself to other robots. The setting of the game is vaguely reminiscent of something like Logan\u2019s Run in terms of style.\n\nAs you attach yourself to different robots they gain you access to different weapons and more importantly different security levels that allow you to progress. Now don\u2019t get me wrong Headlander is a good quality game but I can\u2019t help but feel a few small changes would have made it one of the best Metroidvania out there.\n\nIn terms of Metroid-i-ness this game is Metroid Fusion as opposed to Super Metroid. There is very little in terms of exploration which is a bit of a missed opportunity. Every door is coloured or a hatch and almost all sections are really clearly marked on the map. There are a few hidden secrets that involve jumping down gaps or smashing through walls but these are definitely in the minority. My first play though not going out of my way to find secret yielded a 92% completion rate with the 100% doable in little over an hour extra.\n\nThe game is split up into a number of zones which each have a specific challenge to the zone. My personal favourite was the Chess Zone which sees you take over robots that work in the same was as chess pieces that lead to the game\u2019s most memorable boss\u2026 even though there are not that many bosses.\nOne thing that I did really like are the angle puzzles. In Headlander lasers generally bounce off of walls and this is used in a number of puzzles where you have to shoot multiple mirrors at once. The few of these puzzles that there are which tend to appear in the later stages of the game are fun and well thought out of these\u2026 An iOS game containing just these puzzles would be a welcome mini game. \n\nEach zone has an extra quest that involves killing a mob or finding something specific but these are generally low key and definitely could have been made into so much more and that really sums up the game. It\u2019s a fun, interesting and competent Metroidvania that is well worth playing through but it feels like everything could have been so much more. Maybe a little more development time, maybe a little more money who knows but as it is Headlander is a pretty good game as opposed to a jewel in the indie game crown. If you love Metroidvanias then this is a good one but it isn\u2019t the absolute best of the genre.\n\nCheck out our original Video Review this review was based off of: [url=http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/160826_game-tutor-grades-headlander] The Game Tutor Grades Headlander[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1472173937, "timestamp_updated": 1472173937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563944", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25153188": {"recommendationid": "25153188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017903397", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497154811}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun Game and cool music.", "timestamp_created": 1472173677, "timestamp_updated": 1472173677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484941", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25091406": {"recommendationid": "25091406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003640043", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471959953}, "language": "english", "review": "So what differentiates this Metroidvania from many others?

You play as a floating head that can take over robot's bodies. While it is not perfect, Headlander is a fun and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe gameplay for the most part is enjoyable. For some reason it is satisfying to rip off the robot's heads to take over their bodies. The shooting mechanics are interesting as well. The shooting mechanics work well but I liked them most when the game forced you to use ricochet shots in order to hit enemies. I wish the game had more areas like this rather than the situations where you get swarmed by enemies and just have to keep shooting to destroy all of them. \n\nWhile I enjoyed the gameplay, towards the end of the game it started to feel repetitive. After you have developed a good strategy of defeating robots you pretty much just keep repeating it. While the gameplay is fun I was starting to wish there was a little more depth to it towards the end of the game.\n\nOverall I am conflicted on Headlander's story. I think the game does a very good job creating an interesting environment. The problem is that I found the story itself is pretty average and not that memorable. The game is also not as funny as I have come to expect from Double Fine. \n\nI enjoyed my time with Headlander. It is a unique and fun game.

Headlander is no exception, but is a lot better then a lot of Double Fine's recent work in my opinion. A metroidvania game that focuses on exploration, Headlander oozes style from every pore, focusing on great art design and colorful storytelling over technical mastery. Cutscenes were always fun thanks to some great voice acting work, and the story is able to execute the standard dystopian sci-fi tropes rather well. Some good 70s/80s scifi music complement the action as well, and good sound design all around the board. Gameplay is where things get a bit more iffy, as the combat sections have the mechanics of a fun metroidvania game....they just don't have the difficulty that a veteran of the genre would want. It has trouble complementing its gameplay at times with its art design at times, and some of the control decisions at times don't make a lot of sense. The main vacuum mechanic is still fun as hell, and is one of the more unique mechanics in the genre. And when the game does get the combat right, it can be fun, especially in the boss fights. It just needed more oomph in the end. But Headlander is more about the journey and about the story that it tries to tell: and in that, it succeeds.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1n7pVjxup8\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Strong Visual Style, colorful and expressive in order to complement its storytelling. You can tell it's a double fine game, and a game published by the adult swim guys. \n[*] The vacuum mechanic is unique in the genre and is quite fun, as pulling heads off of enemies and replacing them with your own works really, really well. \n[*] When the game introduces a new GP mechanic, it works rather well, as it's always a nice change of pace for the gameplay\n[*] Voice acting is on point. Voice actors are talented enough to get the most out of the script they've been given: adding reasonable emotion and flare to their performances to make them standout.\n[*] Storytelling is done well here despite the basic tropes of the sci-fi genre. Good narration and fun jokes that hit a lot more often then they miss.\n[*] On top of that, it doesn't just dictate facts to you. It actually adds some colorful language behind it, and makes you actually want to listen to the story. \n[*] Flying around as a head is fun. Controls do a good job of giving the right amount of control: not too loose, and not too tight. While I recommend a controller (as I put movement > aiming),  both sets of PC and controller controls work well for the gameplay in question.\n[*] Like the laser ROYGBV system that the game puts forward, giving you reasons to grab new robots and risk your head for the next score. \n[*] Accuracy focused portions of the game play work well here. A lot better then the rambo portions of combat.\n[*] Actually feels like a completed work (I have not beat the game, but based on my time frame, there's no signs of rushed assets like in other games of Double Fine's recent history). So take that into account.\n[*] No real big performance problems. I saw little things here and there, some frame drops, but that only seemed to be when I was recording.  \n[*] Some graphical effects are rather nice, like the shag carpeting. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The game is too easy in the end. The game's mechanics doesn't punish failure like most metroidvania's do in terms of progress, and frankly the game suffers because of it. Nothing becomes a true threat.\n[*] I can't emphasis the difficulty problem enough. Even in death, you're respawned in the same room right away, and nothing ever feels that scary because of it. There's no fear of the unknown. \n[*] Sometimes the emphasis on the style overtakes the gameplay in bad ways. In particular, when the game is way too busy in terms of the colors, and it ends up becoming hard to see what your character is doing thanks to the neon lights overtaking things in the back ground. \n[*] Some of the map mechanics were inconsistent in information. Sometimes giving you too much information, making puzzles way too easy. Others made navigation in areas that you've already been too a bit more troublesome for no good reason. \n[*] Some textures aren't that great. \n[*] Needed more oompf combat wise. Sure, it has its fun moments, but combat became more of a chore towards the 4 hour mark, and considering the difficulty, it was easy to ignore it.\n[*] Don't think the switch direction/aiming sections should have had the turning restriction it did, as it doesn't make sense given this set of gameplay mechanics.  \n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1470939904, "timestamp_updated": 1470939904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24826971": {"recommendationid": "24826971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139160159", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471788724}, "language": "english", "review": "As great as this awsome game is with all of it's sarcastic humor door colour joke's it's a a FUCKING NIGHTMARE to navergate the controls are a bit toucy & is sometimes the reasion I die A LOT getting around is part of the charm but it will make you want to die after a few hours & theres a boss battle theres a few but in this one I wont spoil IT DOSENT TELL YOU U CAN JUST LEAVE & GO THE OTHER WAY NO WAY PIONT NO TEXT OR VOICE THEY KEEP RESPAWNING & I WAS THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR UNTILL I HAD A GUESS & SIMPLY WALKED LEFT FOR A BIT !!!!!!!!!\n\nThat aside lots of cute dog's vacume robots to become each with there own charm a map who is my favriot thing to kill because he yell's mappppy every time u suck him off  also may be the only thing that seems to care if it die's :(cleaver pullzle solving but overalll it fell's a bit rushed for instance the chess game is only hard when u fight the boss WTF !!??\n7.5/10 Robots .....that make tea cups....because...I like tea... :)\n\nI would recomend this to all more so if you liked the hitchhikers guide to the galixe the humor's right on par with it & thatsdoor's probaly where they got the idear !?!?\nDid I menchion ure a floating head ?!", "timestamp_created": 1470926049, "timestamp_updated": 1470926049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24825259": {"recommendationid": "24825259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122682839", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469832035}, "language": "english", "review": "Just amazing", "timestamp_created": 1470918283, "timestamp_updated": 1470918283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24820332": {"recommendationid": "24820332", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971474709", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470863427}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a very fun metroidvania-type game. Flying around as a disembodied head, and taking over all sorts of robotic bodies, many of which move and behave in very unique ways is awesome. There are also a lot of upgrades you can get by spending XP points found in the world, which actually give you useful abilities/boosts.\nNot all is great though. The main issue with the game is, that the core gameplay isn't quite as satisfying as it should be. Shootouts are too chaotic for their own good and usually don't involve much in the way of strategic thinking. It's definitely not perfect, however that doublefine charme goes a long way to ensure it's an enjoyable romp throughout.\n\nI'd recommend it to anyone interested in doublefine games and/or sidescrollers. There's a lot to like here, especially if you're a completionist type. There are many optional health,power and helmet-thrust upgrades to find in the environment if you keep your eyes open, and if you miss something you can always go back to get it. I actually enjoyed 100%ing the game. Attempting that with other games often severely bogs down the pacing, or it's just flat out boring, but in Headlander it's fun throughout as the map subtly helps you find all the upgrades.\n\nSo yes, definitely a recommendation from me!", "timestamp_created": 1470888067, "timestamp_updated": 1470888067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24817578": {"recommendationid": "24817578", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982666400", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470868207}, "language": "english", "review": "Starts out ok, and progressively get's worse and worse.

El primero es el estudio desarrollador creado por la leyenda de la industria Tim Schafer (Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island 1 y 2, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango, Psychonauts). El segundo es el canal de animaci\u00f3n para adultos por excelencia (Robot Chicken, Fantasma del Espacio de costa a costa, The Boondocks, Black Jesus, etc.). Teniendo en cuenta estos antecedentes, Headlander podr\u00eda haber ca\u00eddo en alg\u00fan lugar com\u00fan dentro del universo de sus creadores, algo as\u00ed como una aventura gr\u00e1fica con humor corrosivo y parodia pol\u00edtica. Sin embargo, este juego est\u00e1 lejos de la zona de confort de sus creadores y se nota.\n\u00bfDe qu\u00e9 se trata entonces? Headlander es un juego inspirado en las notorias pel\u00edculas de ciencia ficci\u00f3n clase B de los \u201970. Si lo tendr\u00edamos que encasillar dentro de un g\u00e9nero, responde a un Metroidvania con algunas mec\u00e1nicas de RPG, como son los \u00e1rboles de habilidades. La trama cuenta la historia de un futuro sombr\u00edo, donde una mal\u00e9fica computadora autoconsciente (al mejor estilo Skynet de Terminator) logr\u00f3 someter a la raza humana a una generaci\u00f3n de robots esclavizados a sus \u00f3rdenes. Por alguna raz\u00f3n que no se explica, las personas dejaron de usar sus cuerpor de carne y hueso, y trasladaron su mente a cuerpos rob\u00f3ticos llamados \u201cImpostores\u201d. Estas unidades est\u00e1n cargadas con la informaci\u00f3n cognitiva del humano que llevan en su interior y tratan de replicar una vida normal dentro de una plataforma espacial construida espec\u00edficamente para el deleite de sus ocupantes. Nuestro personaje es el \u00faltimo ser humano (o al menos una parte) en utilizar piel y rasgos org\u00e1nicos, por lo cual es cazado incesablemente por Matusal\u00e9n, esta computadora maldita. El entorno gr\u00e1fico es exquisitamente detallado, de un humor sutil que acompa\u00f1a a la historia y nunca queda en el centro de la escena. El gameplay resulta \u00e1gil y logra el dinamismo necesario que requiere una aventura espacial, con luces, rayos y explosiones incluidas. A simple vista, nada est\u00e1 fuera de lugar y parecer\u00eda ser un juego perfecto. Sin embargo, ahondando m\u00e1s en las mec\u00e1nicas y sobre todo en el end-game, encontramos fallas de criterios que hacen a Headlander un t\u00edtulo con much\u00edsimo potencial pero que se queda corto.\n\n[h1]Pensamientos encontrados[/h1]\nAl empezar el juego, queda muy claro que manejamos una cabeza voladora que tiene la habilidad de posarse sobre el cuerpo de determinados robots y utilizarlos para distintos fines. El m\u00e1s com\u00fan, poder de ataque y eliminaci\u00f3n de objetivos. Sin embargo, con el correr de los minutos descubrimos que Headlander no se trata s\u00f3lo de correr y disparar a mansalva, sino que hay muchos pasajes en donde debemos usar la cabeza (literal y en sentido figurado) para desbloquear ciertos sectores de la estaci\u00f3n espacial donde transcurre la mayor parte de la historia. As\u00ed es como descubrimos la existencia de los \u201cPastores\u201d, unos robots programados para controlar y reprimir todo lo que escape de la norma permitida en la estaci\u00f3n. Estos guardias de seguridad est\u00e1n identificados por distintos colores, y cada uno de ellos tiene acceso a diferentes partes de la estaci\u00f3n. La mayor parte del juego estaremos ocupando los cuerpos de estos robots para acceder a las diferentes puertas. Por supuesto que no siempre es tan lineal, y muchas veces habr\u00e1 que pensarlo dos veces antes de decidir c\u00f3mo avanzar de habitaci\u00f3n.\nAdem\u00e1s de la mec\u00e1nica m\u00e1s simple, Headlander ofrece ramas de habilidades que iremos desbloqueando a medida que capturemos energ\u00eda. Al igual que en un juego RPG, decidiremos potenciar determinadas caracter\u00edsticas de nuestro personaje, como ser el da\u00f1o cuerpo a cuerpo, la velocidad de vuelo, capacidad de succi\u00f3n, escudos, etc. As\u00ed son las mec\u00e1nicas que conforman este juego, y si bien se mantienen frescas para que el juego no pierda su inter\u00e9s, de todas formas el gameplay comienza a sentirse repetitivo con el paso de las horas. Analizando las razones llegamos a la conclusi\u00f3n que el mayor problema que tiene este t\u00edtulo son sus misiones, b\u00e1sicamente hacer lo mismo una cantidad de veces determinada, para desbloquear otra \u00e1rea de la estaci\u00f3n. Realmente se siente como si ese aspecto no hubiera sido debidamente planeado, ya que en un juego con un universo tan bizarro, se podr\u00eda ir para cualquier direcci\u00f3n. De hecho, era preferible tener misiones m\u00e1s ligadas al humor o lo par\u00f3dico, quiz\u00e1s reforzando la iron\u00eda de salvar al mundo con una cabeza voladora. Sin embargo, los desarrolladores decidieron ir por misiones que no escapan de la monoton\u00eda, y hacen peligrar seriamente nuestras ganas de seguir jugando.\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n[/h1]\nHeadlander es un juego con una puesta incre\u00edble, que nos despertar\u00e1 los sentidos en m\u00e1s de una forma. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los problemas que tiene en una experiencia de juego prolongada, es un t\u00edtulo que sin lugar a dudas vale la pena probar. Para fan\u00e1ticos de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n absurda y los juegos de acci\u00f3n, es diversi\u00f3n asegurada. Su end-game quiz\u00e1s est\u00e9 m\u00e1s reservado para jugadores con experiencia o acostumbrados a los desaf\u00edos que propone este tipo de juegos de plataforma, que en un an\u00e1lisis r\u00e1pido pueden parecer aburridos. Aunque no hay nada que temer, ya que tienen que pasar varias horas para que nuestra cabeza comience a cansarse de volar. Por eso recomendamos este juego, ya que incluso con sus advertencias, es un digno trabajo con una trama que parec\u00eda imposible de tomar en serio. \u00a1Agarren sus cabezas!", "timestamp_created": 1470765572, "timestamp_updated": 1470765572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24776121": {"recommendationid": "24776121", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970329288", "num_games_owned": 1817, "num_reviews": 978, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470400032}, "language": "english", "review": "The video below features non-biased 'first hand' gameplay experience only:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns0tP_5lsEw\n\nMy Thoughts:\nDouble Fine cannot do any wrong in my eyes and this game is a breath of fresh air and fantastic!\n\nGame Details:\nLaunch into the ultimate head trip as you blast through psychotic robots in a retro 70's sci-fi action adventure from Double Fine Productions.

That formula isn't necessarily a bad thing though. Headlander is a game that feels familiar but different. Challenging but simple all at the same time. This is Headlander's strength as much as it is its weakness.\n\nYou're going to have fun and the entire ride is well crafted, from interface, design, and setting. The selling point atleast for me was the setting. Headlander takes place in this dystopian future where robots who were formerly human have chosen a cold metal exterior in exchange for immortaility. Its somewhere between Lost in Space meets a psychedelic episode of Twilight Zone. It keeps this tone of surreal robotic world with splashes of cheeky, colorful, and weird for most of the game, Throwing in humor as much as possible. Even after about 14 hours and completing the game, I still chuckled as I rocketed my head about and it bounced around like a ping pong sometimes. You're a floating head for petes sakes. \n\nGameplay is broken up into shooting and puzzle elements. Mostly its get from point A to B. There are a couple of sidequests but no major reward for completing them aside from achievements. The obvious draw here or \"niche\" part of the game features is the ability to replace the head of just about anything with yourself and possess its abilites and functions. From moving elevators, guards, tour guides, even an entire live action chess match,(which I should mention was FREAKING AWESOME.) \n\nHeadlander can do more as you progress through the game, from charging objects until they explode, to creating dummy bodies that fight on your behalf. All the tropes of a Metroidvania upgrade system are there and done very well. Progression and map design is not blocked by jumping or movement but by color. Robots each have a unique color or scheme and as the story progresses the security clearance of robots is raised more and more until you have access to everything. It's a cool idea and it works, although it does start to feel a bit of a  rinse and repeat nearing the end of the game.  Visually the game is astounding as color is used quite effectively and not once did the environments ever really bore me. The game keeps you moving along that no one area over stays its welcome. \n\nThe only gripe I have with the game is its combat. As you get access to more advanced robots with better mega-man-esque blasters. Shooting becomes more of a spamfest and less about accuracy and cover. There is a cover system but it really feels almost pointless as most of the time it was far easier to just suicide run into a buncha of robots and just simply get a new body, no consequences. This becomes almost a pivotal strategy later on as hordes of robots are thrown at you and keeping any one body is just simply not going to happen. PRO-TIP: Spam the headbutt and GG, you win. There are 2 boss fights in the game and each of them is varied and very entertaining. I felt they could've added more but think it would feel forced and out of place. The bosses that are there are there for good reason. \n\nThe little facets of the game are given a good amount of attention as well. From voice acting being fantastic despite the fact that everybody has that voice modulator thing going. It never got grading on the ears. The sound department did a fine good job of making everything sound impactful while maintaining its quasi-seventies space themes. Controls are a bit hit and miss as button spamming is required nearing the end game as you headbutt your way to victory. Sometimes despite my many presses my character just stood there and got shot in the face. Flying was sometimes tricky as you rocket your head about in hilarious fashion but this is hardly a gripe. It should be noted the game does feature controller support and rebindable keys so major props for that.\n\nReplayability is probably where the game falls flat. Aside from seeking out all the games little upgrades there is no reason to continue playing. So unless you wanna do everything over again just for kicks. This is a play it and leave it type of game. \n\nIn all I enjoyed every minute of Headlander and think its a wonderful game. I wish there was more of a epilogue then what you get but perhaps this leaves room for a sequel? Headlander 2: More Head, More Action. Just an idea. \nThe game makes strides in being unique but anyone familiar with the genre will not find anything that blows the head off your shoulders. Pun intended.

Robots, not other humans.. After all, you ARE the last human around in this world... Anyway, this ability alone is used to solve many puzzles where you need certain bodies in certain places, especially for door opening since the doors can only be accessed if you're the right color. You're also able to explore hidden areas just like any other metroidvania and collect energy points to upgrade your head and body abilities, or upgrade your health, thrust power, or energy. To be honest, I just tried to collect nearly everything that was around before continuing, some of the later areas can get really spicy.\n\nThe areas that you travel in look really nice as well, heck, stunning even. I remembered myself purposely going slow just to take in the colorful environments I was traveling through. The dialogue was fun to hear too, whether it was a robotic map happily talking to you before you ripped its head off or a door you wanted to nuke open because it mocked you yet again for not being the right color. Made me giggle so much.\n\nWelp, as a metroidvania, I guess the only replayability is finding Easter eggs if there are any or completing the game 100% or something like that. As of me writing this review, I have 100%ed the game in about 8.6hrs, not counting the 6 hidden achievements that I'll try exploring for. Despite the game being a little short, the experience that I had with it excuses the shortish time length (for me). As for the price? ..Meh. Preordered the game when it was coming out and I think a bit of a price drop from the $20 that Headlander stands at now would be good but if you can't wait, by all means, headland into Headlander.\n\n\"Headland into Headlander.\" That's cool..

This game is like candy, and that may sell it for you or not. It has a lot of visual flair, interesting gameplay, and decent sound design. What makes it like candy is that it's short (though 7.5 hours to complete a $20 game 100% is good bang for your buck, if that matters to you) and is entirely lacking in substance beyond its general gameplay concept and gorgeous visuals (which I have found to be the case with other Double Fine games of late, maybe their writing team doesn't know they aren't good).\n\nThe story tries to allude to ideas regarding what it is to be human in a post-corporeal world, but the few audio logs you find, what Earl and Methuselah say, and the world at large don't tell a complete story in my eyes. Even though it's only 7 hours long, you will begin to tire of repeated lines from the security doors (some of which were entertaining the first dozen times) and if you re-explore old areas after completing the game, you will get tired of the new lines added in after the first time you hear them.\n\nThe gameplay is compelling as you start out, with the main exception being aiming. When using a controller, it's a complete pain in the ass to aim reliably without getting killed pretty quickly in the process. If you play this anything like I did, you will end up avoiding combat and instead of shooting, rip heads off bodies. It's fairly fun to fly around, though, and see the sights. The general concept of \"rip heads off, pick best color for security clearance, and avoid lasers\" does not overstay its welcome. The best part of the game in terms of making you think spatially and about what you need to do to get somewhere is the Power Dome. The areas following it are a little bit more combat oriented and feature only small parts wherein you need to think. The puzzles about hitting markers nearly simultaneously are fun and brief, but I wish there were more of them.\n\nHeadlander is full of many gorgeous sights to see, and the visual effects they layer on top of well executed 2.5D make it all the better. 99% of the game is inside space station type areas, but it stays fresh in my eyes throughout the whole game. You will love shooting fractal laser beams, watching them bounce around everywhere, even if those lasers don't accomplish much. The single tiiiiiny negative I can give about visuals is overwhelming chromatic abberation after a certain point in the game where an area is slow motion for a good while. I think it might have been a bug, but my game went back to normal speed but still had a kind of glow around everything from that point on. Sound-wise, the game has an enjoyable soundtrack that I would probably never listen to outside of playing the game and excellent sound effects, with no faults I can remember, writing this just after finishing it. Having said the lasers look beautiful, I also think they sound beautiful.\n\nIf this game didn't look as good as it did, I wouldn't have purchased it, and if it didn't keep me interested as long as it did, I would have returned it. It's not great, it's just good.

Lately I\u2019ve been drowning in MOBA's and YouTube.  While i wait on some projects i kickstarted, Double Fine has provided me with something that tickles my aesthetics.  Retro Future design, tied with clever dialog and animation.\n\nDouble Fine's Artistic team is one of the best in the business.  The environments are well put together and filled in with detail. The effects on the character are great and brought me to the days I saw all of the covers for Activision games on my Atari 2600. Electrical and Plasma looks great, and the color palate choice was appropriate for the setting.  Animation was top notch as well.  I laughed out loud when i got to the chess pieces that you will come across.\nThe enemies in the game work well, each bot carrying a different weapon, and each functions in the same way, but gives you different results.  Single shot, spread, fractal spread, etc.  I was not expecting the fractal weapon at all.  And strangely, as many shots as you could put into the air, it was not overpowered.  You must still play carefully in certain areas, or you will lose the robot body you worked so hard to keep alive.\n\nThe mechanics work well, but felt a bit lacking.  In most metroidvania games, your access to the map is mainly restricted to gaining abilities or equipment.  While that exists, the main means of restricted access is in the robotic body that you happen to be driving at the moment.  Since all your weapons and access is based on which one you have, the search for weapons and doing tricky moves to progress doesn't feel as satisfying.  For me, discovering the weapons in this genre was half the fun of backtracking the map.\n\nThe story and narrative are well done but a bit thin.  When I finished my initial run, I felt a bit let down for some feeling of ending.  It was more of a soft close, like the end of a chapter instead of ending a book.  But they story did have me engaged to see the progress as I played.\n\nIn Summary, Headlander is a excellent contribution to Double Fine\u2019s library of projects.  I feel the average gamer may complete this in around 9 hours or so.  And I have blown more money on a bad steak from a restaurant.

[/h1] \n\n[h1] \u00danico en su especie. [/h1] \n\nLa premisa de Headlander es bastante sencilla, al menos en sus primeros compases. \nNos hallaremos despertando de un estado de criogenizaci\u00f3n en una nave acorazada intergal\u00e1ctica, simplemente para averiguar que aparentemente somos el \u00fanico rastro de civilizaci\u00f3n que a\u00fan sigue con vida. La humanidad tal y como lo conocemos, ha dejado de existir y su lugar ha sido ocupado por una serie de criaturas rob\u00f3ticas que est\u00e1n bajo el control de  un enigm\u00e1tico l\u00edder llamado Matusalen.\nSin duda, el panorama que promete Headlander es uno de extravagancia, debido a la llamativa ciencia ficci\u00f3n de la d\u00e9cada de los 60 y 70 y, con tal solo darle una mirada a los primeros minutos de juego, ya podemos sentir esa ambientaci\u00f3n tan singular que nos depara. En nuestras manos tendremos el control de una simple cabeza, rodeada por un casco y sin cuerpo alguno, con la que emprenderemos una fren\u00e9tica aventura retro-futurista como pocas. De todas formas, lo que hace tan especial a Headlander no es su narraci\u00f3n, sino su jugabilidad, que sin lugar a dudas nos har\u00e1 perder la cabeza -figurativa y literalmente- en todo momento.\n\n[h1] Perdiendo la cabeza. [/h1] \n\nHeadlander se presenta como una aventura de acci\u00f3n y plataformas empa\u00f1ada en un sensacional dise\u00f1o en 2D. Entrando un poco m\u00e1s en detalles, tomaremos el control de un terr\u00edcola, pudiendo controlar la cabeza del mismo. \nA pesar de las limitaciones que esto aparentemente conlleva, tenemos una gran libertad de movimiento a trav\u00e9s de los niveles. Debido a que podremos transportarnos de un cuerpo a otro, gracias a las habilidades especiales que est\u00e1n implementadas en nuestro casco sobreprotector, estas determinaran que tipo de jugabilidad queremos desarrollar en el juego. Podremos optar, desde un enfoque m\u00e1s cercano y personal y mejorando el desempe\u00f1o de los cuerpos que sirven como recipientes o, por otro lado, mejorar el casco y ser m\u00e1s letales, r\u00e1pidos y efectivos a la hora de enfrentar situaciones inadecuadas en las que el control terrestre suponga una complicaci\u00f3n \u2013 aunque eventualmente es primordial contar con un cuerpo enemigo-  \nComo es de esperarse, para poder recibir estas mejoras es necesario investigar el escenario y darle una mirada especial al mapa ya que, al recorrer minuciosamente los niveles, hallaremos \u00e1reas y lugares secretos en los que encontrar movimientos y habilidades especiales o, registros de grabaci\u00f3n en los que podremos desentra\u00f1ar un poco m\u00e1s su humilde historia.\n\nTal como mencione anteriormente, lo que hace tan especial a Headlander no es su narraci\u00f3n, sino m\u00e1s bien su jugabilidad. La idea tan alocada y original de mantenernos constantemente cambiando de cuerpos ya sea, de un robot a otro, tomando guardias de seguridad, ciudadanos ordinarios o hasta canes rob\u00f3ticos con el objetivo de cumplir tareas secundarias, es lo que hace a este peculiar t\u00edtulo tan \u00fanico e irreprochable. \nNo obstante, cabe destacar que para mantenernos en el camino directo de la aventura ser\u00e1 necesario darle una mirada a cada guardia rob\u00f3tico y a las puertas que dividen las distintas zonas del juego dado que, en Headlander, las cl\u00e1sicas y conocidas \u201cllaves\u201d toman forma de cuerpo y color, por lo que para viajar de una zona a otra, ser\u00e1 necesario invadir el cuerpo de un guardia del color que se adecue a la puerta a la cual deseamos adentrarnos.\nLas puertas de los niveles contar\u00e1n con distintos niveles de seguridad asociados a los colores de sus enemigos ya sean, rojo, naranja, amarillo, verde, u morado entre otros tantos, quienes presentar\u00e1n sus propios y particulares tipos de armamentos para impedir nuestro paso. \nAqu\u00ed es donde las habilidades especiales de nuestro casco resultaran \u00fatiles, permiti\u00e9ndonos crear escudos, detener el tiempo o amplificar nuestra velocidad para poder succionar sus cabezas y asegurarnos una defensa \u00fatil y satisfactoria. No obstante, hay que tener en cuenta que no solo deberemos vencer a los enemigos regulares o los jefes de turno, sino que tambi\u00e9n el mismo escenario tiene trampas, torretas y caminos electrificados a los cuales hay que prestarle la atenci\u00f3n necesaria para no caer presa de un descuido espontaneo.\n\n [h1] Mantener vivo un legado. [/h1] \n\nTal vez fueron muchas las dudas que se levantaron cuando se supo que Double Fine estaba detr\u00e1s de esta pintoresca aventura espacial. Sin embargo, tal como nos tiene acostumbrados la m\u00edtica desarrolladora, con Headlander logra demostrar que no est\u00e1 atada a un g\u00e9nero en particular y que pueden ser buenos en otras \u00e1reas fuera de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas. \nHeadlander tal vez no revolucione el g\u00e9nero de los juegos de plataformas de acci\u00f3n pero, gracias a su propuesta sumamente extravagante, hacen que sea un t\u00edtulo fuera de lo com\u00fan, carism\u00e1tico y llamativo. En sus 8 a 10 horas de duraci\u00f3n, nos transportaran a un exc\u00e9ntrico universo, que espera a ser rescatado de la soberan\u00eda rob\u00f3tica.", "timestamp_created": 1469507250, "timestamp_updated": 1510370575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700114", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 466, "total_negative": 48, "total_reviews": 514}}

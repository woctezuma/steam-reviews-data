If you're a fan of retro games, this one nails it. The challenge level is perfect for a casual playthrough, but going for the achievements really amps it up. I've had the game for about 24 hours now, and I've beaten it five times going back to finish all of the achievements. My arm is numb from mashing the fire button at the last boss over and over again with different handicaps, and it was fun the entire way through.\n\nFor it's length, the game has a good amount of items and power-ups that keep you excited about exploring. There's a decent variety of enemies that are consistently satisfying to kill because of those crunchy retro sound effects. I haven't even checked out the level editor or custom maps yet, but the ability to create and play as custom characters is such a fun touch. Even though I never found beating the game multiple times tedious, it was that much more interesting going through each time with a different character that I already like from other games. My last run was for the no deaths, healing or saving achievement, and I did it with Donkey Kong, because coconut gun hurt. It was great.\n\nI can only think of three minor things to complain about. One, the enemies that move horizontally and shoot up and down. Sometimes they were pretty much impossible to get through without taking at least one hit. Not a big deal though. Two, enemies stuck in walls at bad spots for you, and not having a consistent way to kill them. Again, not a big deal, and reloading the room could sometimes fix both of those issues. Three, the speed upgrade should have just been the default. I mean, you can get it within 16 seconds of starting the game, but with all the integrated speed running incentives and leaderboards and whatnot, I was restarting runs a lot when I first started, and this was the only thing that I felt was a weird choice. Just makes each restart a bit slower, and you're pretty much required to go get it immediately.\n\nBut who even cares, game is great. I was fully sucked in by its charm and I'm honestly disappointed that I'm already finished. I know that this game was a prequel to Ghost 1.0, which I will probably have to check out now, but I'd really love to see more of this style. Cannot recommend it enough.

\n\nMini Ghost captures the essence of game of old with all it's good and bad elements. \nThe game consists of roaming the leveling looking for power-ups and keys to unlock new areas so there is a bit of backtracking if you're against that also it has a bit of grinding as some items come from shops though mainly the power-ups as key items tend to come from shooting select boxes or killing bosses so technically some of the shops items could be skipped. \nghost has basic abilities with only a jump and a limited range forward shot. with only a forward shot it's hard to hit some enemies and some of the enemies setups do seem unfair at first but reloading back and forth for better attack patterns can get past most of these. even with this deaths feel like it's the players fault and not because you missed a jump or got ambushed though you do have infinity lives dying will lose all your money (you do keep your items). that said the dev did go a bit overboard on the last area and \"motherbrain\" boss.\ni also found the movement almost unbearable until i found a movement power-up (it's fairly early, thank god) and then it was just tolerable (a speed setting would do this game wonders). \nplaying i ran into a issue where i got stuck for a bit because i didn't know the dead end with a fire pit was a boss room because if you only stand in the doorway it will not trigger the

Simple en apariencia pero con grandes aspiraciones es un juego que te llenara de objetos, todos f\u00e1ciles de encontrar (bueno excepto el \u00faltimo) y que poco a poco te soltara todas las herramientas para abusar de los enemigos.\n\nEs un juego muy pero muy sencillo, sin embargo es muy entretenido, f\u00e1cil de dominar y por ende bastante corto. Lo recomiendo porque me record\u00f3 todo o mucho de lo bueno que disfrute con t\u00edtulos viej\u00edsimos como Super Mario, mega man, contra, castlevania etc. Olviden ya eso de metroidvania por el amor de Dios, es solo una aventura simple (saltas y disparas) en un mapa peque\u00f1o, el control es bastante bueno, est\u00e1 incluido la opci\u00f3n de guardar en el lugar que desees (la condici\u00f3n es que no existan enemigos en la habitaci\u00f3n) y tambi\u00e9n cargar la partida cuando quieras, esto es una ventaja suprema para poder avanzar y cualquiera que se queje de que es un juego dif\u00edcil, injusto, o de alg\u00fan modo desbalanceado debe ser un aut\u00e9ntico friki/ni\u00f1o llor\u00f3n.\n\nRecomiendo este juego por su calidad de movimiento est\u00e1 muy bien realizado, recuerden es un mini juego, por tanto no hay historia impresionante ni le busquen explicaci\u00f3n a los eventos o los jefes. Son cosas como muy de anta\u00f1o pero est\u00e1n bien integradas de modo que s\u00ed te puedes divertir las casi instant\u00e1neas 2 horas promedio que te puede durar el terminarlo.\n\nCreo que va dirigido a aquellos que compramos y disfrutamos de Ghost 1.0 y queremos demostrar el apoyo al desarrollador, es un buen trabajo que nos da la perspectiva de que sus proyectos van por el buen camino del estilo retro.\n\nPuntos buenos\nEst\u00e1 muy f\u00e1cil. Enemigos y jefes f\u00e1ciles, es dif\u00edcil que mueras por aquello de guardar y cargar donde quieras.\nArma principal ilimitada\nTienes varias armas secundarias explotables.\nLe puedes poner otro protagonista de la Steam Work (yo puse a mario y queda muy bien)\nTienes un ejemplo claro de que calidad no tiene que ver con cantidad.\nTienes un teleport al inicio del mapa y una zona de curaci\u00f3n. (Se hace m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil y r\u00e1pido todav\u00eda)\nTiene editor de niveles\n\n\n\n\nPuntos malos\nNo tiene tutorial XD\nNo hay gu\u00edas en internet XD\nLos jefes no tienen l\u00f3gica alguna XD\nLa historia deja muchos huecos XD\nLos enemigos parecen tener ganas de atacarte. XD\nAlgunos boses sobre todo el tercero, no muestra alg\u00fan patr\u00f3n de movimiento para poder contra atacarlo. \n(Lo vi en una rese\u00f1a negativa jajaja)\nTienes que farmear para juntar dinero (cubos)\nTiene habitaciones secretas imposibles de descubrir XD\nTe pueden trolear tus amigos mientras juegas. XD\nNo tiene online ni cooperativo con pantalla dividida con marcadores de raking mundial competitivo con soporte para Stream en las ligas profesionales de E-Sports. \n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n si eres ni\u00f1o rata no lo compres, incluso usar un programa bot para sacar los cromos podr\u00eda causarte da\u00f1os irreparables en tu ego. \n", "timestamp_created": 1499722876, "timestamp_updated": 1499722876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33399741": {"recommendationid": "33399741", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990036156", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 208, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499595110}, "language": "english", "review": "Too much grinding.", "timestamp_created": 1499595119, "timestamp_updated": 1499595119, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.276113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33389737": {"recommendationid": "33389737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026376897", "num_games_owned": 1364, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499376579}, "language": "english", "review": "Great bite-sized proto-metroidvania that excellently pulls of a japanese 8-bit vibe.

Combined with some annoying enemies and those stupid electric enemies that rise out of nowhere, it makes for a game in which screwing up one bit will set you back a ton.", "timestamp_created": 1495990535, "timestamp_updated": 1495990535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32019436": {"recommendationid": "32019436", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971085089", "num_games_owned": 630, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496351171}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Joder Fran...

El sistema sigue funcionando muy bien, y gracias a un inteligente dise\u00f1o del mapa, nos pasaremos bastante tiempo dando vueltas por el, descubriendo secretos ocultos, que hay bastantes, y encontrando nuevas rutas, todo ello sin que el repetir zonas se haga pesado.\n\nLa intro del juego (y el final) estan representados como un bonito comic, en el que se nos muestra como Ghost recibe su primera misi\u00f3n. El tono en general del juego es desenfadado, y con detallitos propios de su autor.\n\n\"Mini Ghost\" cuenta con numerosos extras y logros que lo hacen mas rejugable, y si hay algo que lo hace fuerte es que viene con un completo editor de mapas, personajes y entornos, con los cuales podreis crear vuestros propios mundos y aportarlos a la comunidad, por lo que si la gente se molesta un poco en crear contenido, este juego puede dar mucho mas tiempo de entretenimiento.\n\nA\u00f1adir ademas que su autor esta muy pendiente de la comunidad (como siempre), atento a los fallos y las sugerencias que le comunica la gente.\n\nUn juego peque\u00f1o, modesto, pero a pesar de lo \"mini\", muy grande.

It's a pretty straightforward game design, a metroidvania platformer where you explore the map, shoot enemies, collect cubes to buy items from shops, find other items hidden in crates, and take on a number of bosses. Items and upgrades enable you to access areas that you couldn't reach or navigate earlier on. You've probably played this kind of thing before.\n\nIt works, though, because it's a tight game design, and because the basic mechanics of jumping and shooting feel great. Each upgrade makes a noticeable difference, and so progress feels satisfying and rapid. It's not a long game (took me around five hours, but I'm a completitionist and you can certainly do it in less) but then it only costs a couple of bucks. For that, not only do you get this great little game, you also get a surprisingly robust level and character editor, the results of which you can share on the Steam Workshop.

No hay ninguna sala que no puedas pasarte por exceso de dificultad, y si fallas, tendras la sensaci\u00f3n de que t\u00fa, como jugador, eres el \u00fanico culpable.\n\nDurante el avance de ljuego vas consiguiendo diferentes \u00edtems que mejoran la experiencia y te dan la sensaci\u00f3n de haber conseguido un artefacto realmente importante. Es lo bueno de este juego, cuanto m\u00e1s avanzas, m\u00e1s realizado te sientes. \n\nDentro del juego tienes la oportunidad de salvar en cada sala siempre y cuando hayas acabado con todos los enemigos de la misma, por lo que \u00e9sto facilita mucho el avance a trav\u00e9s de Mini Ghost.\n\nPosee un editor de personajes y de mapas que puedes compartir por steamworkshop, adem\u00e1s, quiz\u00e1 lo m\u00e1s interesante sea su modo troleo en el que puedes precisamente trolear a tus amigos mientras juegan, a\u00f1adi\u00e9ndole dificultades a su partida, sin duda todo un puntazo.\n\nNo es un juego demasiado extenso, pero tampoco lo es (para nada) el precio que tiene y por esta poca cantidad merece much\u00edsimo la pena su compra. \n\nSi os gustan los juegos de 8 bits de MSX o CPC (por ejemplo), os recomiendo encarecidamente que le d\u00e9is una oportunidad a este Mini Ghost ya que vais a disfrutar como cuando \u00e9rais cr\u00edos (quiza a\u00fan lo sois, as\u00ed que incluso mejor para vosotros). \n\nEnhorabuena por este juegazo.", "timestamp_created": 1493847656, "timestamp_updated": 1493847656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31531167": {"recommendationid": "31531167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046069015", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504035997}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\u00bfHab\u00e9is jugado Ghost 1.0? \u00bfNO?

At the start of your adventure you kind of suck; you blast enemies, collect \"cubes,\" and use them to buy combat upgrades. Scattered throughout the maze are crates that contain either nothing (usually), more cubes, or unique items that give you advantages or make you able to reach new areas. Your goal is to defeat bosses, opening up new areas, and eventually reach and destroy the computer.\n\nGhost controls really well, the graphics are bright and colorful, and the design of the maze is pretty clever. This isn't one of the all-time great Metroidvanias, but it's definitely a good one.\n\nWhat makes the game so interesting is the presence of several software editors. You can create new skins for Ghost or even entire new maps, then upload them to the Steam Workshop for others to play with. The inclusion of this kind of feature in a game this cheap is amazing, and upgrades this to a \"must buy.\"\n\nIf you don't use the editor features, Mini Ghost probably offers 3-5 hours of platforming action, which is damn good for the price. If you do, there's theoretically no limit (but I'm betting you'd probably start hankering for some more features around hour 20).", "timestamp_created": 1493678865, "timestamp_updated": 1493678865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566080", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31490529": {"recommendationid": "31490529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071902072", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493571330}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Perfecto juego para dedicarle una tarde y pasarselo", "timestamp_created": 1493656628, "timestamp_updated": 1493656628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31490127": {"recommendationid": "31490127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074243514", "num_games_owned": 850, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493671180}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un grand\u00edsimo juego a un m\u00ednimo precio.

Esto te ocurre a ti tambien asi que andate con ojo, este modo viene con mucho Karma cargadito, yo de ti iria cargando la venganza.\n\nPor is fuera poco, Mini Ghost no es solo un juego, \u00a1Es practicamente un Motor!

C'est un platformer dans lequel on tire pour tuer avec des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de RPG (une barre de XP qui sert \u00e0 regagner des HP) et des items \u00e0 trouver qui font progresser le personnage dans l'aventure. Les gens appellent \u00e7a un 'metroidvania' (ahahahah).\n\nNiveau univers on est dans une sorte de vaisseau spatial, des mobs un peu futuristes ou organiques pour certains (robots, gu\u00eapes ou sortes de 'crocodinosaures' cracheurs de feu compl\u00e8tement troll), le tout dans un style graphique retro et des musiques retro. \n\nLe personnage r\u00e9pond parfaitement bien, les sauts sont agr\u00e9ables et certains bosses demandent du skill ! Il y a une progression dans la difficult\u00e9 sans que ce soit ing\u00e9rable. On est donc dans un jeu, puisqu'on s'amuse. Et \u00e7a c'est positif.\n\nIl faudra compter \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 4 heures de jeu (pour 2 euros c'est une performance vu les merdes \u00e0 60 balles qu'on ose nous demander d'acheter XD) pour finir le jeu en ayant tout ramass\u00e9. Six heures \u00e0 tout casser pour ceux qui sont un peu plus lents.\n\nPar ailleurs, le jeu propose d'autres modes et options int\u00e9ressantes ou dr\u00f4les, comme troller ses amis[...] (voir le trailer ^^) ou la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser un speedrun par exemple.\n\nL'outil qui rajoute de la dur\u00e9e de vie au jeu, c'est l'\u00e9diteur de niveaux et de personnages. D'une fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s ludique, vous pourrez donc cr\u00e9er vos maps ainsi que votre personnage \u00e0 vous ! Virtuellement, \u00e7a fait beaucoup d'heures de jeux en plus.

It's even on sale so it's even cheaper! \n\nA great platformer reminiscent of the old 8-bit games with authentic visuals, music and sounds with solid controls and design. \n\nBut for me, what truly makes this game is special is the robust level, tileset and character editors. The game as it is is definitely worth the money, but with these editors included it makes it a must buy. They're so easy to use, you can make a 8-bit platformer of your dreams. I can't wait to see what other people can do with these tools. Shame you can't create your own music or sound effects, but honestly the editing tools and nature of this  game makes it much more open and freeing then say for example, Super Mario Maker. It may not be as accessible as SMM, but it's much more liberating.\n\nI haven't even touched upon the online options to troll your friends who also own the game, the speedrun challenges and other goodies. You like Metroidvania style games with 8-Bit aesthetics then definitely give this game a go. \n\nIt's less then \u00a32, it's great ^_^", "timestamp_created": 1493397553, "timestamp_updated": 1493397553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601108", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31419334": {"recommendationid": "31419334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163499360", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493395594}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Mini Ghost es ese tipo de juego que vas matando enemigos y bosses, y vas mejorando y mejorando.

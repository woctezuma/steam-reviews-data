You've got to learn safe zones, angles of shooting, bunts, with or without jumps, special moves, etc... and consequently, when you hit 50 hours of playtime, your friends will be no match for you anymore.\n\nThat's why Wand Wars is epic to play on a couch.

It's excellent by every measure. The gameplay is novel and fun, the soundtrack is catchy as hell, and the art is beautiful.

It evokes the glory days of 16-bit multiplayer party games on SNES and Genesis, but it's much smarter, faster, and more engaging than anything that existed back then.\n\nHighlights\n- Arcane Arena is probably the most intense single-screen deathmatch I've ever played. Unlockable maps and powerups offer plenty of variety and depth.\n- Merlinball combines quidditch with air hockey and ends up feeling a bit like NBA Jam! Unlike NBA Jam, you can turn your opponents into chickens before you dunk on them. And unlike quidditch, it actually makes some goddamn sense.\n- Endless Trials Co-op offers a high level of challenge and a really interesting take on progression. Great for preserving a friendship after destroying someone at Merlinball.\n- The AI in this game is surprisingly great, and 10 levels of difficulty means you can fine-tune the bots between matches. As a result, 2v1 is quite viable, because you can choose whether to treat the bot like a handicap.\n\nNegatives\n- No online multiplayer.

It is the most fast paced, fun, heart racing, colourful, and unique game I have encountered so far. There is no way I'll ever be able to do this game justice with just one simple review, but I'll try anyway! (Warning: I wrote this review in the span of like 10 minutes, so forgive me if this is a little short. Also, English isn't my first language so feel free to point out any mistakes I made!)\n\nThe Good:\n\n[list]\n    [*]The Sprites\nThe pixel art in this game has to be one of the best I've ever seen, the art style really helps it stand out among other pixel art retro games with their, unfortunately, samey designs. Everything on screen is colourful and clear, it is obvious that a lot of love and attention to detail went into this game. I still find myself ogling at the wonderful art in between matches or games. \n    [*]The Music\nA fast paced game obviously needs some fast paced music, and honestly, the soundtrack, while on the short side, doesn't disappoint. It is extremely catchy, well-made, flows wonderfully, fits the feel of the game, and it is just amazing. I even got the soundtrack, which I never do with any game, and I still frequently listen to it. It is just the thing to make someone really hyped for what's coming. However, some people may not like the rather short soundtrack, but every song is varied enough to not make you feel as if you're listening to the same song over and over again.\n    [*]The Gameplay\nI'll admit, at first glance, I thought this was just an over-glorified Pong game with wizards instead of whatever those white lines were supposed to be in Pong. I could not have been more wrong. While it does share some elements with Pong (and by some I mean just one), it still manages to stand on its own as a game. The power-ups, characters, challenges, game modes, all that good stuff really helps to keep this game fresh and adds a lot of replayability. I honestly see myself years in the future still starting up this game to beat someone's ass at [strike]Quittich[/strike] Wand Wars. The game is also very faced paced but balanced. Anyone from the most casual to hard-core gamer can sit down together and have a fair 1v1 match. Or 1v1v1v1, or 3v1, or 2v2, and you get the idea. In short, there is a lot of poopy to do in this game, and I'm enjoying every second of it. No matter how many matches I play, I can never get bored of it.\n    [*]The Controls\nWhile this may seem like a silly thing to comment on, you will not believe how many of these fast paced games I've played that have the most horrendous and awkward controls. Thankfully, Wand Wars doesn't fall into this trap. The controls in this game are very smooth, tight and responsive. Your fingers flow naturally over the keys and you're never let wondering what button does what. And it's even better when using a controller! To be honest with you, I would [i]adore[/i]  it if I was able to change the controls. But that's more of a nitpick than actual criticism. If the Devs decide to let you tweak your controls, then yay for me! And if they don't, then eh, what can you do? The controls are still tight and responsive nonetheless. \n    [*]The Local Multiplayer\nAll I have to say about this is, YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS. FINALLY, A GAME WITH PROPER LOCAL MULTIPLAYER. HAVE I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN? THIS. IS. SO. YES. Just yes, you have no idea how it fun it is to be able to sit on a couch and duke it out with friends. While yah, lobby making is a thing in a lot of games. Lobbies will NEVER match the amount of fun and the intimacy one experiences when you sit down with all your friends together and play rather than playing on separate consoles/PCs.\n[/list]\n\nNow, we all know no game is perfect, and Wand Wars has a few problems it does need to sort out. As much as it pains me to be critical about this game, I really want this to be a fair review.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n[list]\n    [*]The Obvious Problem\nLet's address the elephant in the room. There is no online play. Yah, that's right, no online matchmaking, no online tournaments, none of that. All local multiplayer. WAIT DON'T LEAVE YET! Trust me, the Devs KNOW that people want online play, and the Devs want to implement it into their game! Trust me, I talked to them. They REALLY would love it if they were able to bring all of y'all online play, but they can't do it right now. For one reason or the other, the Devs currently cannot add that feature into their game, but you and I know, they really want to. And maybe they will! We are just going to have to be patient. And remember, Wand Wars is Moon Radish's first game, and they are an EXTREMELY small team. I would appreciate it if you didn't constantly pester them with questions all the time, feel free to respectable ask about something that concerns you, but remember these are very busy people. They just realised a HUGE update, and they are very hardworking, you will get your online play, don't worry. But just not now.\n    [*]The Unfairness\nI get it, these fast paced games have to be difficult and to present a challenge if they don't want to get boring fast. However, at the time that I am typing this out, the game is very unfair. The campaign can get near impossible at times, and it really could use a little tweaking. With enemies that catch the spell almost a 100% of the time, pin-point accurate enemies, hordes of the enemy teams constantly volleying the ball to the point where it's impossible to catch it. The whole game suffers from this, but the newest game mode, The Trails, suffers the most from this huge problem.\n     Everything and everyone you constantly fight in The Trails are part of the same team, the opposing team constantly volleyed the ball to the point where it goes supernova without you touching it once, the AI is way too smart at countering and killing the enemy (Hell, some can predict where you're going to spawn after dying), the Knights always and only targeting the enemy. The whole thing is a cluster fook and soon it'll be impossible to see your own character as the screen fills up with the red sprites of the enemy team. Don't get me wrong, the game mode is extremely fun and creative, don't let my harsh words stop you from buying this game. I am being very hyperbolic here. But still, the game could use a bit of tweaking and maybe starting with The Trails first would be the best option.\n     Perhaps make some trails a free-for-all, or always have a very small chance of a friendly wizard spawning to help you, or have the Knights and other random spellcasters (whose names I forgot) pick no teams and go after everybody. When most people can't get past the 7th trail, it's time for some tweaking.\n[/list]\n\nA few closing words. if any of you really want to help the Devs to make their first game a success, then I recommend you go out and spread the word about this. DO IT. The Devs had an extremely unfair start, with their game realising at midnight, the \"Add to Cart\" button bugging out, and having their game pushed down the new realises list by 50 open-world, survival, zombie crafting games. The Devs had an extremely rocky start and deserve all the help they can get. Please, do not let this well-crafting game be doomed to be forgotten. The Devs put ALOT of heart, hard work, and effort into this beautifully crafted game.

Je peux mourir tranquille.[/i]\n\n[u]GET READY, PLAY BALL[/u]\n\n\u00c0 l\u2019instar de [i]Lethal League[/i], le jeu consiste - dans son mode star, \u00ab l\u2019[b]Arcane Arena[/b] \u00bb - \u00e0 pulv\u00e9riser son/ses opposants en envoyant une balle charg\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9nergie cin\u00e9tique sur le pi\u00e8tre corps de son ennemi magique (les personnages n\u2019ont pas de particularit\u00e9 de gameplay sp\u00e9cifique, \u00e0 une saine fin d\u2019\u00e9quilibrage). Toutefois, contrairement au jeu de la [i]Team Reptile[/i], on trouve des diff\u00e9rences de taille : [list]\n[*] Vue descendante oblige, les joueurs (CPU comme Humains) peuvent circuler librement sur l\u2019\u00e9cran, quand les niveaux le permettent (on reviendra sur les diff\u00e9rentes ar\u00e8nes).\n[*] Une fois la balle r\u00e9ceptionn\u00e9e, le coup (qui doit \u00eatre correctement orient\u00e9) peut \u00eatre charg\u00e9 afin de faire monter plus rapidement la v\u00e9locit\u00e9 de la balle ; de plus, le tir peut-\u00eatre r\u00e9orient\u00e9 en temps r\u00e9el. [i]Ces deux param\u00e8tres sont tr\u00e8s importants car ils permettent de jouer sur les feintes pour duper un adversaire trop pr\u00eat \u00e0 s\u2019attendre \u00e0 un retour direct[/i].\n[*] La balle magique gagne en taille en plus de la vitesse. Une fois la \u00ab vitesse de la lumi\u00e8re \u00bb atteinte, elle a la taille d\u2019un gros soleil en fusion !\n[*] Les mages peuvent tirer des fl\u00e8ches maudites transformant les ennemis en poulet au contact. L\u2019art du \u00ab Hex \u00bb n\u2019est cependant pas ais\u00e9 : il faut un coup charg\u00e9 pour le faire gagner en port\u00e9e (avec un petit effet \u00ab t\u00eate chercheuse \u00bb en bonus), qu\u2019un combattant peut sans difficult\u00e9 contrer, d\u2019un coup de baguette magique. Ces fl\u00e8ches mettent en \u00ab pause \u00bb l\u2019\u00e9nergie cin\u00e9tique de la balle, comme le \u00ab blunt \u00bb de Lethal League. [i]Essayez d\u2019interrompre un concurrent qui charge une balle, c\u2019est tr\u00e8s efficace ![/i]\n[*] Certaines ar\u00e8nes droppent des [i]power-ups permettant de se prot\u00e9ger ou de balancer d\u2019intenses sorties d\u2019\u00e9nergie qui d\u00e9vastent tout sur leur passage[/i]. Aussi, il est possible de customiser enti\u00e8rement les r\u00e8gles pour par exemple d\u00e9finir l\u2019acquisition automatique de certains power-ups \u00e0 chaque respawn des joueurs. Jouez \u00e0 votre sauce !\n[*] On peut jouer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quatre, que les joueurs soient humains ou contr\u00f4l\u00e9s par l\u2019ordinateur. \u00c0 ce sujet, le niveau de chaque CPU peut \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9 de 1 \u00e0 10, le dernier palier \u00e9tant synonyme d\u2019humiliation imm\u00e9diate par l\u2019intelligence artificielle.[/list]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697082147\n\n[u]\u00c0 vos baguettes ![/u]\n\nToutefois, Wand Wars n\u2019est pas avare en modes de jeu. Le \u00ab [b]Merlinball[/b] \u00bb fait tout de suite penser au air hockey : en 1v1, 2v2, ou 1v3, il s\u2019agit ici de marquer dans le camp antagoniste, ce qui n\u2019est possible que si la balle porte notre couleur, une fois un coup port\u00e9. Qu\u2019on \u00e9change avec son partenaire pour trouver une situation favorable de tir ou que l\u2019on pr\u00e9f\u00e8re d\u00e9gommer l\u2019\u00e9quipe adverse - les joueurs respawnent en quelques secondes, fort heureusement \u2013 tous les coups-bas sont permis. Le nombre de manches gagnantes peut \u00eatre d\u00e9fini de 3 \u00e0 10. Le \u00ab [b]Hexout[/b] \u00bb change radicalement notre fa\u00e7on de jouer : plus de balle magique, ici c\u2019est du deathmatch bourrin \u00e0 coup de \u00ab Hex \u00bb, qui sont alors visc\u00e9ralement mortels. Chaque mort de l\u2019adversaire engrange un point ; 7 \u00e0 21 points seront n\u00e9cessaires pour empocher la victoire. Restent alors les \u00ab [b]Team Arcane[/b] \u00bb et \u00ab [b]Team Hexout[/b] \u00bb qui permettent le 2v2 voire le 1v3 des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents modes de jeu.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=700713025\n\nLa diversit\u00e9 des modalit\u00e9s d\u2019une partie \u00e0 l\u2019autre fait en grande partie la force s\u00e9duisante du jeu. Ainsi, non content de laisser le joueur installer ses r\u00e8gles, Wand Wars offre 10 ar\u00e8nes toutes aussi s\u00e9duisantes sur ses th\u00e8mes visuels que par les codes qui les r\u00e9gissent. [i]The Crystal Maze[/i] fait mouvoir \u00e0 chaque round des obstacles de verre entre vous et vos partenaires/adversaires ; obstacles totalement ignor\u00e9s par la balle et les sortil\u00e8ges. [i]The Hidden Hoard[/i] a des allures de casse-briques et la balle ira faire du pinball dans [i]The Featherforge[/i]. Enfin pour les joueurs solitaires, on retrouvera un mode story d'une dur\u00e9e approximative de 2-3 heures. On incarne \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le plusieurs petits personnages qui s'\u00e9changent des vannes ou se lient d'amiti\u00e9 entre des challenges parfois bien cors\u00e9s.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=700913666\t\n\nL\u2019esth\u00e9tisme de Wand Wars s\u2019accomplit jusque dans sa [url=https://bogdanrybak.bandcamp.com/album/wand-wars-soundtrack]bande originale[/url], tout simplement grandiose. Entre le chiptune et la dubstep, les balades sont entrainantes et d\u00e9crocheront des sourires de bonheur aux plus cafardeux d\u2019entre nous, entre deux pistes fa\u00e7on chill music \u00e0 la [i]Dustforce DX[/i]. Non, en fait, le seul point noir c\u2019est le syndrome [i]Towerfall[/i] : malgr\u00e9 le talent des 3 d\u00e9veloppeurs de [i]Moonradish[/i], son unique d\u00e9veloppeur n\u2019a h\u00e9las pas de comp\u00e9tences en netcode ; comprenez par-l\u00e0 : pas de multi en ligne mes bouts de chou.\n\nWand Wars n\u2019est pas un b\u00eate clone de Lethal League, il sublime ce qui faisait son essence en offrant aux joueurs une myriade de modes et param\u00e8tres de jeu. Les sensations, elles, sont toujours aussi imm\u00e9diates et brutales, pour notre psychotique et \u00e9ternel d\u00e9sir de violence \u00e0 plusieurs ; et tout \u00e7a dans un \u00e9crin visuel et sonore de premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie.

As the match proceeds, the orb gets larger and faster.\n\nIt's about timing, basically - hitting the button just before you get smashed in the face, then turning the tables on whoever threw it. With the full 4 players, it's pure twitch gaming.\n\nWand Wars gameplay review video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrBZzu1F23o\n\nOn its own, that would be a decent but limited game. But your second ability is to fire black arrows. If you hit an opponent, they briefly turn into a chicken, whose only ability is to run away. The arrow can also be used to neutralise the orb, making it slow and harmless until next caught. \n\nTogether, these two things add an element of strategy to your attacks, although nothing complex or clever. The only way to really add strategy to the game is to play in teams, 2 vs 2. So perhaps one player would be on chicken duty, the other orb. Or you could pass the orb between you (you can only harm enemies when firing the orb), and only strike when the time is right.\n\nPowerups are sometimes added to the arena (and you can optionally start with some in Versus). They're massively powered deadly attacks of different kind, and can turn the game into chaos as everyone tries to fire them off at once. When you fire them, the game pauses for a couple of second for an animation, which can get tiring!\n\nThe singleplayer Story Mode is split into the stories of six unlockable characters, each consisting of several matches. Each match has something unique about it - number of players, teams, weird levels with moving walls, different game types etc - so it never gets dull. \n\nVersus Mode consists of single, customisable 1-4 player matches (including however many bots), with a choice of 5 game types. This includes the basic battle type, a type where your team has to get the orb into the opponent's goal, and more.\n\nPleasingly, Wand Wars works well in singleplayer. The bots are well programmed in the basics (with multiple difficulty levels), so it doesn't feel like you're not really playing the game properly. They're not so clever at guarding the goal in that game type, but that's a team-focused game and should really be saved for humans.\n\nWand Wars feels slick, it's easy to learn and not difficult to master. Pulling off a good move is very satisfying - stuff like turning an opponent into a chicken just as you're about to grab the orb, then bouncing it off the wall into their stupid clucking face. \n\nThe limited strategic potential means this game will have an exciting but fairly brief life in your library, but if you have a good local multiplayer scene going, it'll fit happily into the rotation. And if you play it singleplayer, the Story Mode keeps changing things up enough for you to want to keep going.\n\n* Version reviewed: 13 April 2016 build\n* [url=https://youtube.com/user/randomiseuser]More indie gaming videos by Randomise User[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1460551193, "timestamp_updated": 1460552350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662981", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22393124": {"recommendationid": "22393124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044829564", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460814549}, "language": "english", "review": "Aesthetically this game is fantastic!

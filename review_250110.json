The levels are fun and frantic and manage to escalate the pace without overstressing the player.  Bosses are large and impressive with the typical pattern-recognition gameplay, and each one unlocks a new character to play as.\n\nThe downsides are repetitive enemy types, enemies that can one shot you, enemies that insta-stun, and the 'Battery' system which is a poorly disguised countdown timer.  This last part was probably the most annoying aspect of the game as I prefer a very defensive style of play, but was frequently forced to 'dive' straight into large swarms of enemies in order to keep playing, despite not having taken critical damage.  It's not a deal breaker, but something to be aware of.\n\nStill, it's fun albeit too short.  There are 5 stages which contain 5 levels...and that's it.  I didn't go into boss rush, time attack, or whatever daily quest option they've implemented...that stuff's just not for me.  It was nice being able to switch characters at the beginning of each stage instead of them having to make their own progress, but I do wish the game kept track of who cleared what.  I may have been more inclined to replay more missions.\n\nIn the end, it's a fun, pick up and play game that is definitely worth getting on sale.  I think there are better games to buy at full price, but this one is worth a spin at a lower price.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1515640462, "timestamp_updated": 1515640462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39177885": {"recommendationid": "39177885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082855723", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514408422}, "language": "english", "review": "Good.\nEven better with controller.", "timestamp_created": 1515407400, "timestamp_updated": 1515407400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39121283": {"recommendationid": "39121283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014236185", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 89, "last_played": 1515280327}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun shooter gameplay, terrilbe design choices.

It is a bit shallow, I wish there was more to do in terms of grinding, rather than chasing high scores. However, if you like things like that, then you will have no issue here. This is a game, even a player who doesn't enjoy \"endless runners\" (ie COD Zombies, Temple Run, etc.) Where you can just turn on and have fun with. Controller or M&Kb works fine. However, the controller is definitely the way to go to fully enjoy the game. As there isn't many buttons you can push anyways. Most buttons are not mapped to any single key. It is a twin stick shooter. If you never have played one, you simply play by aiming with the right analog, moving with the left, with a various combo of other buttons. \n\nThis game is relatively short. It took me about 6 hours to complete. However, this does not make the game a breeze. I played the campain mostly during single player. This game is a kick ass party game, to get people together playing something. You don't have to be super good to have fun. The levels are not randomlly generated, and neither are the bosses. If you play enough, you will begin to memorize spawns. I assume playing the entire campain would be faster with more players. Please dont get this game looking for a bangin' single player. The story is a one and done. Nothing really awesome, unless you get into the characters and story. Which isn't bad either. The game does get progressively harder and harder, and as you unlock new unlockable characters, and play older levels, you will see how much better you got without even noticing!

Weapon-switch is tied to a \"dodge\" function, giving you a few iframes when you switch weapons. Combine that with a short regenerating health meter and you can take a few scratch bullets without it instantly ending your run (Though solid, strong hits don't cut you any slack, so play smart.). In fact, dying is not a serious impediment either, as the game relies on a \"battery\" timer, which you need to refill by blasting enough enemies and collecting the battery that falls out. Death costs you rank, score, time, and weapon power, but the game only ends if you cannot keep that battery timer full.\n\nThis sounds silly but it works really well. The rank system is incredibly smooth and there is enough to chaining and survival play that it doesn't matter if you're amazing, great, decent, or awful at Assault Android Cactus, you will still have fun and have something to aspire to. From just survival, to careful secondary weapon management to keep your chain, to perfect play still trying to squeeze points out of the game, AAC has something for everyone. Not to mention an infinite survival mode, too.\n\nAnd the game itself? Hordes of robots on elaborate, shifting levels. As you shoot through the levels, panels flip up, paths open and close... each level almost feels like a character in the game, and it's done without being disorienting or feeling cheap either. Enemy spawns are smart so as to not impede your chains. Big bosses cap off each world, all top notch. In addition, you have nearly a dozen characters to choose from, each with different weapon sets, demanding different strategies (And all with unique story dialogue if that's your thing.). That's not even counting the unlockable cheats. Small Head Mode. First Person Mode. Alternate weapon sets. AI partners. Tackling higher player count enemy swarms by yourself. All on offer. AAC is the total package.\n\nI never thought I would see a twin-stick shooter outdo Geometry Wars 3 in excitement or game design, but Assault Android Cactus delivers in spades. Definitely give this one a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1494820141, "timestamp_updated": 1494820141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529016", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31760720": {"recommendationid": "31760720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057112146", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 10799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507510150}, "language": "english", "review": "A small, four legged robot fires a trio of bullets at me and I dodge, switching to my secondary weapon to gain a few brief moments of invincibility, kill him and turn to\u2026 Another small four legged robot. Who shoots me dead. Anyone who knows me can tell you that the only way I improve in a video game is through knocking my head against the proverbial brick wall. Assault Android Cactus is no different, and my first few hours are not going well. \n\nDeveloped by a small, three man studio out of Australia, Assault Android Cactus, or AAC for short, is a top down, twin stick shooter that is both difficult and extremely forgiving at the same time. Featuring twenty unique levels and five memorable bosses, it offers a good solid chunk of game play, unique maps and bosses, and online leader-boards for those who are more aptly skilled than I am. Players take control of one of eight Androids, and one secret unlock-able Android, in an attempt to make it to the end of a large space ship in order to stop a robot rebellion. Once you\u2019ve finished with that, the game also offers a once-a-day randomized level, score hunting on those leader-boards and something called \u201cInfinity Drive\u201d which seems to be an endurance type game mode where enemies spawn in large numbers, and you\u2019re expected to do your best to survive. I cannot tell you that I did well in it.\n\nIn short though, it took me about five or six hours to beat every level in the game, but it was time well spent, and I look forward to coming back to it.\n\nGameplay\n\nGetting shot in the back by a treacherous, sneaky dog-robot is, in other games, a death sentence. Game over, try again, learn from your mistakes. In AAC, the devs went with a different approach. Where most games like this give you one or two hits before you game over, AAC gives you a generous health bar that can take three or four hits, and that regenerates whenever you go a period of time without getting hit at all. And, instead of lives, player Androids are given a bar at the top of the screen in the shape of a battery that continuously ticks down as you play. Every so often, killing an enemy robot drops a battery for you to pick up, extending your meter at the top and letting you continue playing. Coupling these two together results in a system that encourages you not to get hit (You obviously aren\u2019t going to get a battery when you aren't killing things), but also rewards you when you manage to do so, and forgives you when you make a mistake. Some might call it hand holding, but I call it being kind to the player. Not everybody has lightning quick reflexes.\n\nSpeaking of reflexes though\u2026 you\u2019re still gonna need some. Trying each of the eight Androids you can  unlock taught me a lot about myself, and how much I suck at video games. Each of them has two weapons, each unique to them and from every other character, and they all play differently. While Cactus, the lead character and the namesake of the game, is given a standard machine gun, and a short range flamethrower you need to get in close to an enemy to use. Easy to use while teaching you the basics of the game and where you can stand without getting shot, she\u2019s the first Android you are thrust into this world with and is a good choice for beginners. Then you begin to unlock the others, and things take a turn.\n\nI won\u2019t describe every Android and their play style in detail, but expect to find characters who wield Railguns that penetrate, short range shotguns whose power drops off immensely with range, a gun that tracks enemies for you (not always a good thing) and a smoke covered tomboy that shoots lava. Yes, really. They each feel different from the last, and each feel as if they were designed to do different things in the game. Some seem designed to finish quickly and compete for high scores, while others seem weaker, designed perhaps to work best with a buddy in co-op. And yes, there is local co-op.\n\nWhile a game like this would easily shine in online co-op, the small three man team that built this can be forgiven with taking the easier option of local only. Up to four players on a couch, or in chairs huddled around a small computer screen, can play at the same time with fun, chaotic effect. A small crown above each characters head lets you know who is doing the best at the time, but things shift quickly and getting knocked down once or twice can send the crown flying across the screen to find your buddy. Fast paced, colorful and sometimes hard to keep track of yourself, AAC toes the line of making you hate your friends and having a genuine good time because, while one person cannot finis hthe co-op version of the levels alone, having that one guy (me) who is not as good as the rest does not doom you to failure. Life, and co-op AAC, is a team game.\n\nGraphics\n\nMost top-down shooters struggle to make the graphical side of their game fun to look at, and with such a small team working off a limited budget, you\u2019d expect Assault Android Cactus to do the same. Like me, you\u2019d be wrong. While it won\u2019t challenge games from big companies for eye candy awards, the team at Witch Beam went to painful lengths to make sure their small little game was as nice looking, and sounding as could be. From their lead animator, programmer and designer who has worked at companies such as Midway, Electronic Arts and Sega, to their Audio Director who worked with games such as Total War, Need for Speed and FIFA Soccer (throwing in a BAFTA award along the way), their passion and ability ooze from every corner.\n\nFrom colorful, expressive characters to bright enemies, constantly changing levels and cute, albeit short, cut scenes there is not much you can complain about the game from a visual standpoint. Enemies are easy to pick out from the bullets, the bullets themselves are easy to find and avoid, and where some games find you lost among the chaotic battle happening around you, AAC goes to great lengths to make sure you know where you are, where the danger is, and conveys all of that in a gentle on the eyes, easy to read screen.\n\nThe one complaint I can lodge has to do with a certain dog shaped, toaster looking enemy in the game. Hopping around joyfully, these little monsters open up a hatch on their back, launching a missile up into the air where it rains down on you. A bright red marker shows you where it\u2019s going to land with plenty of warning but, with your eyes watching the enemies around you, the floors sometimes moving on you and the game wanting your attention in seven different places at once, it\u2019s far too easy to miss that little red circle and walk straight into a missile. Maybe that\u2019s my mistake though? We\u2019ll call it fifty-fifty.\n\nPerformance\n\nThis is where things get a little tricky for me to sound authoritative on. While certainly not a five thousand dollar machine, my desktop computer is designed and built to run games at a high level, and finding myself hitting 250+ fps with all settings cranked to maximum in the game is not a rare occurrence. So how can I say exactly how smooth this game runs from a technical aspect? Well, I can\u2019t. Not entirely. But I can tell you that the game has very low minimum requirements, others I know have run it on mid-tier laptops and I, myself, have run it on my Mothers laptop, she of the \u201cthis website said I needed to download this\u201d fame.\n\nI\u2019ve also found success running it on a desktop at school and, while the frame rate stuttered and struggled to stay steady at anything over 15 fps, the game did run, and on a machine I expect contained pictures of components on the inside instead of any real machinery. As long as you keep the settings reasonable, know your own machine and keep an open mind, it should run fine for you. And, hey! If you\u2019re still worried after reading this, the game has a free demo for you to check its performance yourself.

The game is fun.  It has unlockables and achievements to keep you interested in progressing through the levels and doing your best.  That said, it's frustratingly hard for the less bullet hell oriented players.  If you are familiar with bullet hell games, you know to focus on dodging bullets above all else, and that's sometimes very difficult to accomplish in this game.\n\nOverall, it's worth the full price, but I feel like the devs could add a lot to the experience through DLC or free updates.  There's a lot of room for improvement.  I will now list the pros and cons for those who are still on-the-fence.\n\nPros:\n\n[olist]\n[*]Characters are very unique, giving each character its own playstyle and some room for replayability and experimenting with character abilities.\n[*]Gameplay is very well balanced between bullet hell genre and coop shoot-'em-up genre.\n[*]Boss fights are very challenging!\n[*]The overworld map feels very much like a recent Super Mario game.  I found it very unique for this type of game.\n[*]Graphics are very pleasing to the eye.  Characters look very stylish, and there's no slow-down or framerate drop even when there are tons of enemies and bullets and explosions.\n[/olist]\n\nCons: \n\n[olist]\n[*]Characters can't be picked solely on appearance, because the weapons and abilities are tied directly to each character.  That means you can't play as the green character and use the red character's abilities or shooting style.\n[*]Difficulty doesn't scale to the amount of players, so playing with only one player or by yourself makes the game kind of frustrating.  I don't really mind the difficulty when playing by myself, but my wife hates playing without the cheat for additional AI players.  That cheat was especially useful for defeating the first boss.\n[*]The game is linear and lacks any form of exploration.

Tormentor X for it crazy frantic, balls to the wall gameplay? Nuclear Throne for its insane presentation, killer soundtrack, and tight mechanics? Binding of Isaac for its random craziness and replayablilty?  Monilith for upping the Isaac formula by adding faster and tighter gameplay? Nex Machina for its beauty and the desire to 100% a level at all costs? Full Mojo Rampage for is sheer visuals and difficulty or Geometey Wars 3 for....well, a lot of the above? No. After a ton of time will all the mentioned titles I decided Cactus was the winner.\n  No game on my list nails everything so well. The presentation is the highest I know of in this genre. The graphics, gameplay, control, unlockable character, unlockable \"mods\", and flow of this game are perfect...and the music, the MUSIC.\nEvery unlockable character plays very diffrently from the others and changes the core mechanics. The levels are clever in their design from a sheer visual aspect, and demand revisiting just to get a high rank and a position on the leaderboards, and the infinity drives just that, a battle arena that goes on forever and keeps the high standards main game, even a daily for an added bonus.\n I know some people don't like the battery aspect ( you have to kill quicky and wait for a battery to drop to keep on playing), but this is why I chose this game over all the others. This one added element keeps the game frantic and fun. The battery system is fair. Do well and they drop at a constant pace, don't and the game becomes heart pounding experience where its a race to do better in hopes of getting a drop. This mechanic never felt cheap, and in the end made me a better player.\nBeing an old ass arcade gamer I love these types of games. Robotron 2048 was my favorite game as a kid, not Pac-man. I've played every twin-sticker there is. This is my overall favorite. It does so much so well. It really came down to Tomentor X ( hard mode please), and AAC. Both are extremely fun, each for thier own reasons, but Cactus won me over. One is short and mean, the other is meant for longer gaming stretches and rewards you with more than a high score.

With this unrealistic battery life the game is now perfect for gamers who are high on speed.

Instead, we'll address the common negative comments for the game:\n\n\"Game is too hard\": there are unlockable EX options to make the game easier; they disable high scores but that shouldn't matter if your goal is to just have fun.\n\n\"Game is too hard\": There are many different playable characters; if you're having trouble with one character, try another. The character you unlock first is extremely good against bosses, and against the first boss Cactus is pretty servicable. For normal stages (and the Licorice fight), Holly and Lemon are probably the easiest to handle, while characters with narrow shot patterns that don't penetrate (like Cactus) aren't quite as good. Also seriously use your secondary weapons.\n\n\"Game is too hard\": I'm 35 with old man hands and a crappy trackball mouse, and I found the game a little on the easy side, since weapon switching makes you invulnerable for a really long time (probably .75 seconds).\n\nIn other words, if you see a review that claims the game is too hard, chances are that reviewer is bad at video games.",

It has [i]excellent[/i] animations and a camera that rather impressively captures long-ranged and/or fast abilities that most games would have trouble with. It runs on a potato and usually looks nice.\n\nThe main problems with the game are that the difficulty curve is totally ecletic, and that the bosses are very bland and uninteresting. That is a huge let-down in a genre where the bosses are usually the main attraction. The game is never particularly difficult, due to the interesting \"Battery\" mechanic where you can only die by failing to score a certain amount over time, instead of dying when your health depletes. I'm generally positive about this mechanic but my god does the game tend to use it as a crutch for completely negligent enemy and area design. The main source of difficulty is the sheer amount of enemies spawning at any given time, which can get very difficult to handle in stages with gimmicks. Despite the zone-based design, the difficulty of each stage appears to be totally arbitrary since in nearly all cases, smaller stages are harder than larger stages. This means that I managed to S+ rank three levels on the open-ended final zone on my first try, but I struggled to even get a C rank on a second zone level with tight corridor design and a rotating flamethrower. \n\nThe bosses similarly seem to defy a curve. the second boss has an expanding and retracting swarm of insects protecting it with extremely little room to move once they retract on you. But the fourth boss's [i]most difficult[/i] attack is a curtain of bullets with obvious character-size holes inbetween them.\n\nThen there is the extremely bizarre decision of having barely two frames of invulnerablility after getting hit...in a bullet hell. This is what I mean by the game using the battery mechanic as a crutch.

It's extremely addictive, and this game caused the first time I've ever had strain in my directional key fingers in my ~25 years of PC gaming.  It was a subtle ache that felt so good because it reminded me how much fun I'd been having.\n\nThe art style is modern futuristic.  The music is pumpin' and really gets you into the game.  The sound effects are absolutely perfect.  The characters are simultaneously cute and cool in every way, and each has their own unique style.  I love them.  The simultaneously cute and cool style of this game sets it apart from any other futuristic game I've ever played.\n\nThis is a game with an example of a perfect difficulty curve.  It starts out very easy and increases in difficulty at steady rate.  It took me about 8 hours to beat the game the first time, and 4 or 5 of those hours were spent on the last boss.\n\nWhile I think this game is incredibly good, there are a few minor technical flaws I encountered that I'll cover in the next few paragraphs.\n\nI found that disabling vsync for lower input latency helped me, as their vsync implementation seems to add quite a lot of input latency.  With the frame rate I'm getting, I barely notice any tearing.  Also, the isometric camera mode makes the game a little easier for me, and I was able to start getting some very high scores using it, as it just aligns with my brain.\n\nThis game does have multiplayer, but it is local co-op only (not even LAN, unfortunately).  It does not support multiple keyboards and mice, so at least one of the players must use a gamepad.  My brother and I played it together and it was quite an enjoyable experience, but there is one major flaw with the multiplayer camera.  The camera is so zoomed in that often, one player or the other goes off the screen, making it much more difficult for that player temporarily.  I hope this is fixed in any sequels, expansions, or patches of this game.\n\nThe player character is not locked to the center of the camera, which makes mouse aiming require a bit of extra effort to know where your character is on the screen, making leading shots and close-range angles more difficult than they could be if the player was always centered.  This is an extremely minor complaint to me, but one I figured I should address in my review for completion.  The bullets are fast enough that simply mousing over most enemies gets the job done.  Obviously, this does not affect gamepad users.  I hope an option to enable a locked camera with a more distant zoom level is added, as it would make the game even more enjoyable for mouse users like me.\n\nI am a Dvorak keyboard layout user, and I also use qwerty's ESDF key positions for movement in other games.  This game doesn't support other layouts than qwerty, unfortunately, so I had to switch my keyboard layout to qwerty.  It also doesn't support rebinding controls, but the in-game binds are only directional movement (WASD), fire weapons (LMB), and switch weapons (RMB).  I was annoyed and confused for the first few seconds of gameplay, but I switched my keyboard layout to qwerty and wasn't bothered any more.  It's not a big deal, though it would be kind of nice if it was keyboard-layout-agnostic by using keycodes instead of letters internally, like many other games do.\n\nOverall, excellent game, and a new favorite.  I would recommend it to almost anyone.  If there was a rating system, I'd rate it 9/10, with the 1 off only being due to the small technical drawbacks I experienced.\n\nEdit: I've now earned 100% of the achievements in this game.  This is the first game that made me want to do so, because it's so fun.  It took me 107 hours, though I was earning S+ rank on the first 18 levels with every android for a large portion of that time.\n\nWhile I still love the game, I've discovered several more issues that if fixed, could really improve the game.  While I don't remember all of them, I'll describe the most bothersome one.\n\nThe player character's aim lags behind the cursor.  The crosshair cursor is already a software cursor, so it is already slightly delayed behind the mouse movement.  However, even after pointing it to the right spot, the character's gun is not pointed to the same spot if it has moved in the last frame.  This is most noticeable when playing the sniper android, Shiitake.  I will often aim directly at the enemy in the last frame before she fires, but it will fire toward the previous frame, visibly distant from the cursor, missing the shot, even though I aimed properly, myself.  This may seem minor, but it is the cause of a large portions of my shots missed.  This affects every android, but most noticeably Shiitake and Starch, as their weapons fire in straight lines with no travel time.  If a sequel or update to this game is made, I implore the developers to fix this detail.", "timestamp_created": 1485124842, "timestamp_updated": 1486371442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29407691": {"recommendationid": "29407691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067106398", "num_games_owned": 1122, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514560061}, "language": "english", "review": "Great litte twin-stick shooter with a lot of awesome levels and features!\n\nPros: \n+ great level desing\n+ smooth gameplay\n+ fitting soundtrack\n+ cool bosses\n+ characters with different abilities\n+ different modes and bonus features\n+ replayable\n\nCons:\n- story is a bit short \n\nI can definitly recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1485033915, "timestamp_updated": 1485033915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29359432": {"recommendationid": "29359432", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969800146", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496083707}, "language": "english", "review": "While twin-stick shooters have long been the domain of zombie cash-ins and arcade quarter munchers, no other twin-stick shooter I've ever played has managed to feel more frantic while feeling more fair.\n\nThe cutsey aesthetic works and grows on you, partly due to a really good soundtrack.\n\nI got this game to scratch a Robotron/Smash T.V./Total Carnage itch and left amazed at what they've pulled out of the genre.

Really worth the money if you are into this type of games\n\nPros:\n- Graphics - it's so cute! :)\n- Awesome soundtrack\n- Replayability - there are 8 (or more) unique androids with individual play styles. You'll probably end up trying every level with each android\n- Addictive and thrilling gameplay - This is one of those games that after finishing level you just say \"Fuuuuuuhhh!!!! OMG!\"\n- Optimization - the game runs really smooth which is a must for this type of game\n\nCons:\n- Difficulty ballance - I rushed through the game and stopped only at the final boss. I'd like to have more challenging gameplay\n- Battery spawns - this is probably the only serious cons I have about this game. The core idea of the game is that you collect batteries to power your android (to continue playing). The problem is there doesn't seem to be clear rule when the battery will be dropped. In general I guess it happens every X killed enemies but sometimes it seems the game just gives you battery out of mercy (when you're low on battery level). It's really weird and because of that you start basically ignoring the battery because you don't know how to obtain it. You just know you have to kill everything as fast as possible. I know I go into much detail but this is the core idea of the game. It's not deal breaker, it just takes away part of the excitement once you realize this fact.\n\nBut besides of that Assault Android Cactus is trully awesone", "timestamp_created": 1484606948, "timestamp_updated": 1484607770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29287733": {"recommendationid": "29287733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091686266", "num_games_owned": 1014, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486692786}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Assault Android Cactus \u00e9 um SHMUP de controle duplo seguindo um dos formatos mais antigos, amados e ao mesmo tempo odiados de todos os tempos, essa \u00e9 a rela\u00e7\u00e3o de amor e \u00f3dio com jogos estilo Bullet Hell. Sendo este distribu\u00eddo e desenvolvido pela Witch Beam e lan\u00e7ado dia 23 de setembro de 2015.\nEste jogo n\u00e3o tem um real foco na est\u00f3ria, sendo que na pr\u00f3pria descri\u00e7\u00e3o na steam, est\u00e1 limitado a dizer: \u201cA jovem policial Cactus est\u00e1 fora de sua praia quando atende a um chamado de socorro e acaba presa em um cargueiro espacial danificado que est\u00e1 sob ataque de sua pr\u00f3pria frota de trabalhadores-rob\u00f4s. \u201d A est\u00f3ria se d\u00e1 continuidade antes e depois das batalhas contra chefes, mas s\u00e3o di\u00e1logos simples, por\u00e9m cada personagem usado tem seu dialogo pr\u00f3prio com o chefe, algo um tanto incomum em jogos que voc\u00ea pode trocar de personagem antes da fase. No caso, normalmente o que aconteceria era ter que rejogar tudo com cada personagem para pode ter acesso as est\u00f3rias de cada um.\nAlgo que sempre \u00e9 bem-vindo em jogos nesse estilo s\u00e3o as caracter\u00edsticas de cada personagem possuindo at\u00e9 um armamento pr\u00f3prio e bem diversificado de cada um.\nA gameplay \u00e9 relativamente simples, desviar dos tiros e atirar de volta, mas isso n\u00e3o quer dizer que passar de n\u00edvel seja f\u00e1cil, afinal n\u00e3o esque\u00e7a que estamos lidando com um bullet hell aqui.\nAl\u00e9m de enfrentar diversos advers\u00e1rios devemos ficar de olho na nossa bateria (parte superior central da tela) que ao passar do tempo vai se desgastando e s\u00f3 \u00e9 poss\u00edvel recuperar ao pegar um item especifico de algum advers\u00e1rio aleat\u00f3rio, este item o qual \u00e9 normalmente dropado uma vez por onda (certa quantidade de inimigos formam uma onda, ap\u00f3s matar todos a onda acaba e logo come\u00e7a outra), isto \u00e9 facilmente percebido pois a cada termino de onda a fase muda alguns elementos, algo que pode ser considerado incr\u00edvel e tira um pouco a linearidade, mesmo que talvez n\u00e3o fosse necess\u00e1rio, afinal cada fase tem em m\u00e9dia 2 minutos e 30 segundos at\u00e9 cerca de 3 minutos.\nO jogo tamb\u00e9m possui muitos elementos que podem estender a gameplay, pois al\u00e9m do modo campanha, existe os modos Raid: Infinito e Desafio di\u00e1rio & todos os modos possuem ranking. Sendo que o \u201cdesafio infinito\u201d tem ondas sem limite e a cada onda que passa novos inimigos aparecem e mais complicado se torna de continuar vivo e o modo di\u00e1rio na verdade \u00e9 apenas uma fase criada especialmente para o dia e como o jogo tem suporte para at\u00e9 4 jogadores, este desafio tem modos diferentes para ser jogado, dando at\u00e9 4 oportunidades para completar (uma para cada jogador a mais).\nVale ressaltar que todos os modos de jogo d\u00e3o pontos, os quais podem ser usados para comprar artes conceituais, biografias \u2013 nem todas s\u00e3o compradas -  e modificadores chamados de EX. Esses modificadores servem para transformar por completo sua gameplay, como mudar o contraste da fase, mudar o formato dos personagens que s\u00e3o chibis para tamanho humanoid e at\u00e9 mesmo o ponto de vista, como isom\u00e9trico e at\u00e9 mesmo primeira pessoa. \nAssault Android Cactus n\u00e3o \u00e9 considerado um jogo para qualquer pessoa, pois existem enormes chances de se frustrar por n\u00e3o conseguir passar de alguma fase em especifico, principalmente por n\u00e3o conseguir alcan\u00e7ar a recarga da bateria a tempo \u2013 ela recupera apenas parte da carga. Ou quando ca\u00edmos demais, nossa vida acaba e temos que retornar a jogada clicando repetidas vezes em um bot\u00e3o, isso tamb\u00e9m zera todos os boosters e level que conseguimos na fase, o que deixa sempre tudo mais dif\u00edcil, as quedas tamb\u00e9m afetam na pontua\u00e7\u00e3o final. Enfim, tudo no jogo corrobora para a sua derrota e a \u00fanica coisa que temos a favor \u00e9 nossa habilidade que na verdade voc\u00ea come\u00e7a a ganhar ap\u00f3s enfrentar o primeiro chefe e ent\u00e3o perceber que o jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 algo t\u00e3o casual quanto parece. \nPor fim posso dizer que o jogo \u00e9 incr\u00edvel e que as m\u00fasicas eletr\u00f4nicas que s\u00e3o tocadas s\u00e3o muito mais que fant\u00e1sticas e d\u00e3o maior empolga\u00e7\u00e3o na hora de cada fase. O impressionante \u00e9 o fato de n\u00e3o ter presenciado muitos bugs, apenas um na verdade, onde a minha arma, que na verdade \u00e9 um rob\u00f4, ficou preso em uma \u00e1rea do mapa, logo quando a fase mudou de forma e ent\u00e3o fui obrigado a parar de \u201catirar\u201d e tudo voltou ao normal & nada mais ocorreu. Ent\u00e3o deixo minha recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o para aqueles que gostam de desafios.\n\nJogo recebido exclusivamente com o intuito de realizar esta review, caso se interesse por mais, gostar\u00edamos de convida-lo para acessar [url=gamephasis.com/] Gamephasis [/url].

It looked good enough...What I got is a masterpiece I am going to sink hundreds of hours into.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssault Android Cactus is one of those fabled relics of gaming magic.  You know, when all of the mechanics, design, gameplay, and programming all come together to achieve pure bliss; this is a game for the real, core gamer.\n\n\u2026Oddly, the above is perhaps partially to blame for its lack of commercial fame.  The game is not well known or played, as you can see from the leaderboards.  What will you *Will* also see is that many of the few who have picked up Cactus hold it in very high esteem.  This is a testament to the goal of the developer: A lot of time and love was put into the game to ensure the experience is as good as it could be.  It is not a game primarily made to sell.\n\u2014\n\nAAC is a twin-stick shooting game (like geometry wars), but it is, in my opinion, the best the genre has to offer.  Unlike other twin stick shooters where you frequently must run away and back yourself into corners to survive, Cactus has the opposite mentality- You are forced to dish out as much damage and kill as many things as fast as possible by dashing headfirst into giant hordes of enemies. The reason for this is that you do not lose by dying.  You have infinite lives.  You lose by running out of battery meter, which is constantly draining as you play.  New batteries spawn after killing a certain amount of enemies, which is expertly programmed in a very in-depth way, if you are interested in that sort of information.  This means that trying to sit back and pick off enemies won\u2019t work, not only because the battery will be too far away to recover when it appears, but also because you will not deal damage fast enough, since practically every character must get in close to the crowd to deal their damage the fastest.  The correct mentality to mastering Cactus is to be as aggressive as you can.  Think of yourself like an evil terminator android, relentlessly rushing down your foes with calculating precision.   The meta of Cactus is fine-tuning your ability to be as efficient as possible at dealing damage.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nI could go into a lengthy discussion of what makes the mechanics and the game itself so good, but no one wants to read through all of that.  \n\u2014\u2014\n\nCactus experience #1:  Trying to S+ a level with Shi itake (sniper character) on a level with escalator floors and changeable walls.  Zipping around at high speed, twirling (a dodge mechanic) through moshes and waves of crawlers, drones, bullets, bombs, rockets, drones, bees, lasers etc. while dropping mines before I lose my kill chain, picking off multiple enemies at once by lining up my shots to snipe the edges of enemy hitboxes while dashing atop escalators and around cover, chaining power ups so I can stay afloat while also trying to kill everything as quick as possible\u2026All at the same time...Losing literally 100+ times (never stops being fun) but pushing harder and harder to be my best.  It is mad, sweaty gaming zen.\n\nCactus experience #2: Playing on endless mode (infinity drive) with my brother and trying to coordinate attack patterns and coordinating the effects of our different androids\u2019 primary and secondary weapons.  Changing our tactics on the fly while racking up 800 kill streaks, while the frame rate blazes along at 140 fps. shooting and rushing down, blowing everything up, and sucking everything into a black whole as the level and music continues to warp and bend before our battery runs out.  \n\nCactus experience #3: Trying to complete each level on VPC4 (virtual player count 4), which basically scales enemy spawns as if 4 people are playing, yet you are by yourself.  Being swarmed by impossible odds, yet strategically thinking your way to victory, by choosing the right android and figuring out just the right strategy for the level\u2019s specific challenges.  It\u2019s like a puzzle.  And yet, even though it acts as a puzzle game, you are challenged by a high need for skill as well as a high ability to adapt, since you can\u2019t completely rely on memorizing enemy patterns.  You can\u2019t perfectly predict all of the enemy spawns and power ups, so you must be able to shoot and think on your feet in addition to planning ahead.  \n\nCactus experience #4: Earning #1 in daily drive (daily score chase mode) CO-OP, only to realize no one plays this game, then being sharked by 200,000 points right before the day ends.  \n\nCactus experience #5: watching the best players speed run levels and the campaign in awe.\n\nCactus experience #6: Being mindblown at how geniusly programmed the following are: The game is impossibly fun and balanced no matter whether you\u2019re playing solo or up to 3 buddies or 3 AI partners\u2026There is challenge for the casual gamer all the way to the hardest of hardcore, without ever compromising the core metagame!  There\u2019s a variety of challenges to shake up the meta and keep you going for hundreds of hours. Every one of the 9 droids has insane potential and very different play styles, yet are all balanced and excel under varying situations.  Some droids are very friendly to those who aren't the best at aiming, while some characters demand nothing less than perfection.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nVerdict: if any of this sounds remotely intriguing, pick this up or try the demo.  Do you live for the edge of your seat, hands sweating, heart pounding feeling when you can feel yourself on the verge of beating an impossible challenge?  Are you craving a bat-sh*t insane, high octane arcade game that requires a staggering amount of skill, concentration and strategic thinking?  If so, just buy this and thank me later.  \n  This is a game to master, and with 9 droids to master for every stage and changeable play conditions/challenges, an infinity mode that is literally near impossible to beat, and daily score challenges, you can easily sink hundreds of hours into this game either alone or with friends as a party type game.   Oh, and good luck trying to S+ every level with every droid... But can you do it on VPC2-4?\n\nNegatives: I wish the campaign was slightly longer (a few more levels to master)\u2026.it\u2019s just too f***ing good, especially with how much variety and originality is in the stages, whether it\u2019s on a moving train car or a giant convection oven with changing heat patterns.  I also wish the UI was slightly better designed.  It isn\u2019t necessary to look at the UI during intense moments, but it would be nice if it were quicker to read.  The audio cues for certain situations should also have been explained to the player.  Basically, you will hear things like dings and chimes to notify the player of recharging health etc.  It can be really useful to pay attention to.\n\nBonus: the soundtrack is also very good and crazy and will get you in the zen mode and pump up your jams.  You\u2019re gonna need to be in that zone.  \n\n9.5/10  (I don\u2019t give high scores lightly)", "timestamp_created": 1484118450, "timestamp_updated": 1484125088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29173146": {"recommendationid": "29173146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123293911", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511552086}, "language": "english", "review": "So, Assault Andriod Cactus is a game that I can see myself playing for at least another 40 hours, if not more.\nIt has some of the smoothest rewarding twin-stick action I've played, because it has a very strong focus on getting you into the aim/dodge groove.

The unlockable android characters are well done, and I feel like the level design and bosses push you towards utilizing different androids.  There are a lot of really enjoyable levels with a nice amount of variance and some callbacks to Bomberman stages.  Sometimes the huge numbers of swarming enemies are a bit much, and the hot floor level is a bit ridiculous, but those are minor gripes in a very enjoyable shooter.  \n\nSome of the voice acting is a little bland, but with the energetic techno and sounds of your weapons cover them up well.  When your battery runs out and you have to restart the level, do yourself a favor and listen to the song they play.  It's got to be the longest \"you died\" song in any video game, but it's darkly amusing and always gives me a chuckle.  \n\nOne of the reasons I bought this is because it's on Linux.  Thanks devs for porting it over, the game is a good fit for SteamOS.  I had trouble getting my Steam controller to work like an actual controller instead of a mouse and keyboard, but I also have been experiencing some other annoying controller issues after an OS update so YMMV.  XB360 controllers worked great.  \n\nAfter beating the game make sure to use those credits you earned to unlock stuff in the store.  There's also a final android unlocked for your second playthrough along with a boss mode.  The android character playstyle design is very well done, with a fun mix of different styles and some imaginative weapons.  It would be nice if there was a little bit more info on what their abilities do, as some are not obvious from the select screen.  A power and range meter would be cool too.  \n\nEven so, this game is a lot of fun.  It was about a 6-7 hour experience for me which feels just about right for the $15 price tag.  The boss battles are old school pattern memorization affairs, that feel a little unfair until you learn the fight and then breeze right through it.  A little tip, switching your weapon gives a half-second of invulnerability for dodging some of those bullet-hell style barrages.  \n\nThe level designs, android playstyle designs, and overall polish of this game make it for a great time with a buddy or three.  The game scales with the number of players, and you can even unlock a buddy AI if you're a solo player wanting to see the screen filled with death bots.

Move with left stick, aim with right stick, shoot with right trigger, switch to secondary weapon with left trigger, and your secondary weapon has cooldown. There are eight androids to play all with rather different sets of weapons, four to start, another four to unlock. You fight pretty generic robots, then there are bosses.\n\nIt's not complicated, but it's very well done. Since it's not a space shooter (well, it's in space, but aboard a space-ship, and- you get the idea) it uses space well, often shifting the battle and offering new impediments, like pits or walls or hazards. (You can't fall.) It's often shifting what robots you're facing or how the battlefields work - it goes to some lengths to change the environment around you, even if it's mostly pretty standard industrial interiors and exteriors. Still, levels never feel truly the same. Some are wide-open, some are confident, some have gimmick traps- I felt like at no point was it retreading itself. Which it better not, at its basic length of a few hours to beat the main campaign. It has leaderboards survival, and optional cheats and modes to encourage you to try and play to perfection.\n\nThere are some small disappointments. The leaderboards aren't divided by character, since some androids are more suited to some levels in others, and knowing you were the best with an oddball android with a spinning sawblade or a drill attack would be good to know. Though the walking speed is generally fast enough, at times I felt that it was just a hair too slow to readily escape attack patterns I hadn't already anticipated. And some of the bosses can be overly harsh compared to the rest of the game - one in particular hits with a swarm of robots that in one attack pattern I still have no idea how certain androids are supposed to deal with it without losing a life.\n\nAssault Android Cactus mostly just an example of how to take a classic game style and just polish it until it feels great. There's something intangible here, but circling around robots, hosing them down, singling out stronger robots to engage with missles or cannonballs, it all feels very satisfying. The characters are very basic but appealing. The story is... generic but at least not intrusive in its genericness. The continue mechanic is clever in how it subtly allows score attackers to give up at a point of failure but allow everybody else to truck on to victory without feeling like they actually failed. Ultimately, if you're in the market for a twin-stick shooter with a fun charm to it, this'll do you.

It is a top down shooter that can be controlled with either mouse and keyboard or with the analog sticks of the controller.\n\nThe only way for you to lose in this game is if your battery runs out. If your health goes to zero you just have to get up by taping your fire button. Batteries are used with time even if you don't shoot. To restore your energy you must get new batteries, which are dropped by one particular robot in each wave. So time is the most important factor in this game.\n\nThere are many characters in this game and each character has different weapons. All characters carry two weapons. The primary weapon does not have any limitations, you can fire non stop until the level ends. The secondary weapon is usually more powerful but requires some time until you can fire again. Each character has it's own advantages and disadvantages. You can choose whatever character you want in each level at any given time and in some cases a character is better than another in a particular level. All characters also have very distinct personalities, making the game more interesting.\n\nSometimes power-ups are dropped. There are three kinds of power-ups: tiny robots, pretty wings and blue circles. Tiny robots gives you more fire power, pretty wings makes you faster and blue circles stop every robot in screen for a limited amount of time. The power-up item changes to another power-up every few seconds. The order is always the same. If you get the same item twice, the time is extended.\n\nThere are also bosses in each section. The bosses are easy to understand but hard to defeat. As usual the bosses work with patterns. A small but welcome detail is that each boss has a different speech for each character you choose and in this way you can figure out the story of the characters.\n\nThe game does not have any FPS limitations and works very well in my 144hz monitor. Altough the models and textures aren't very detailed the game looks very good and there is a lot of variation in each level. The music never gets in your way and in fact it is pleasant to hear. The voice actors are very good and give character to each android.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game a lot but I have two minor issues, mostly personal opinion. The character design seems to be an attempt at chibby style 3D models but look more like bobble head action figures. The models look okay but \u00ce think they could be better. In fact my favorite is Starsh because she's the one that looks less of a bobble head. That and the extras that she's easy to control and the funniest one. The other is that it is very hard to notice some things because the coloring is not distinguishable enough. These kinds of games usually have very bright bullets so that the player can notice them. While the bullets are bright in this game they're still easy to miss in my opinion.\n\nAfter you beat the game you have some options. Option one is to beat each level in campaign with score S+. To do it you need to kill every robot in a single link and at a reasonable short amount of time. For bosses you just need to kill the boss fast enough. Another option is to beat the boss rush more, where you defeat all bosses in a row. The infinity mode is simillar but before beating the bosses you need to kill all robots that show up. Finally you can try to beat the score of other online players.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone who wants a challenging and fun top down shooter.", "timestamp_created": 1482450701, "timestamp_updated": 1483204579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543755", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28536761": {"recommendationid": "28536761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154573513", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511466110}, "language": "english", "review": "Not that much gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1482439362, "timestamp_updated": 1482439362, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.309250", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28523671": {"recommendationid": "28523671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050484139", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446185876}, "language": "english", "review": "ton of fun", "timestamp_created": 1482393888, "timestamp_updated": 1482393888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28494715": {"recommendationid": "28494715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029922482", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482270537}, "language": "english", "review": "Paid 2,24\u20ac or something like that and that's why I recommend this game.

No difficulty options while almost every wave feels too easy and the bosses unrelatively hard.\n\nfun 7/10 - even though it has its problems, for 2,something it's quite worth buying, the difficulty on bosses make it more satisfying to beat them but sometimes too frustrating for a chilled round of hacking through masses of enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1482271136, "timestamp_updated": 1482271136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493716", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28478736": {"recommendationid": "28478736", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960272349", "num_games_owned": 749, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482198939}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a very long game, Very beatable under 2 hours. \n\nWould recommend to a friend.", "timestamp_created": 1482198994, "timestamp_updated": 1482198994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28476383": {"recommendationid": "28476383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170159766", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498255876}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't usually play shooters, but when I do, it's Assault Android Cactus ;)\n\nThis is really an amazing game. The character design is cute, and they have voice overs and dialogue lines to match. The controls are quite smooth in terms of moving your android around the map and aiming to shoot. If you have a Steam controller, I highly suggest downloading my custom control template where the trackpads do all the work as your thumbs simply hover over them, no button presses required! Well maybe except for self revival and weapon switching, but still a lot f stress of them gaming muscles.\n\nIt may get hectic from time to time with tons of enemies crowding the screen and a bunch of projectiles coming your way, but it's a blast trying to navigate the well constructed levels while also learning enemy properties all on the fly. This game forces you to pay attention to everything on screen, especially your battery. If it runs out, it's gameover. You can keep on \"dying,\" and you can revive yourself, but the level isn't over until your battery fully runs out, so keep on an eye on that and how much you shoot. Aimless shooting will cost you your battery, so be careful and be present. If you blink, you die! If you think about anything else, you die! So pay attention.\n\nI highly recommend this game at either full price or a significant discount. You can't go wrong with it if you want to practice making your brain really really focus on some serious hand eye coordination. If someone like me who doesn't usually like FPS or any other shooters, can love this game to bits, that's saying a lot.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1482186971, "timestamp_updated": 1482186971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28465251": {"recommendationid": "28465251", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995723922", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502608012}, "language": "english", "review": "It's real, real, really, pretty, pretty, pretttty good.

You can use either controller or mouse and keyboard for single player/local co-op.\n\nYou choose from selection of characters (four initially, one more for each boss you clear to a total of nine), each with their own primary and secondary fire. Secondary fire is usually more powerful but has a cooldown period in between uses. Different characters do better in different situations.\n\nPowerups are dropped after defeating some enemies. They include temporary firepower boost, enemy freeze, and movement speed and I believe they cycle if you don't pick it up right away.\n\nBattery is just a timer on how long you have to complete the level. Your battery always drains but as you kill enemies they sometimes drop battery powerups that refill the battery a bit.\n\nThere are five zones and six bosses. The regular stages were pretty standard and forgettable but I enjoyed the boss fights. The later bosses are sometimes like a bullet hell lite because they sometimes spray the traditional screen-filling bullet patterns but it's very managable compared to other bullet hells.\n\nIt was nice for me because when you get hit enough times and die you can continue (losing score and battery life) so I didn't really get stuck on a level. The way you lose is if you don't defeat enough enemies in time or let a battery powerup despawn (usually because you waste time while respawning) and run out of battery.\n\nWorth a try if you like the idea of bullet hells/shoot em' ups but aren't at the skill level/don't have the patience to do hardcore ones.\n\nOther thoughts:\n[list]\n[*] Nice that it has a codex, unlockable character art, game play modifiers (first person camera, graphics theme changes, etc.), sound test.\n[*] Nice that it has campaign, boss rush, endless (score attack), and daily (score attack) modes.\n[*] I liked to circle strafe fire around the arena, it felt like it was important to keep moving. When things get crowded it approaches the level of a bullet hell though the fact you don't die in one hit makes it bearable (I was never skilled enough to beat the true bullet hell games). Respawning here doesn't interrupt the flow of battle (no wasting time on a death animation and continue screen) because the only way to really lose is by running out of time (battery).\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1481504278, "timestamp_updated": 1481504278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28309207": {"recommendationid": "28309207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057360310", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512687222}, "language": "english", "review": "Tired of playing the same shooters?

From what I saw in screenshots and videos, the presentation didnt appeal to me at all, the story seemed really uninteresting, and the aestethic of it all simply didnt mesh well with me. All of those things remain true even after I have beaten the game.\nHowever, that in no way should be an excuse to miss out on this, because what I didnt expect to find here was a videogame.\nAnd when I say videogame, I mean it in the rawest and most primitive sense possible that the term implies.\nThis is the kind of game that leaves your hands sweating and your eyes glued to the screen in the hopes that you dont miss a single moment of action.\nAssault Android Cactus is a twin stick shooter, where the goal is to kill every enemy in each stage of the game. Thats it. Thats all you do here, the \"story\" it presents is just an excuse to give some sort of context for the player to get back into the action, and besides shooting enemies, there really isnt much else for you to do here.\nAnd thats why this game is so great. It has no pretenses about what it is, and it uses its genre to full effect to give you one of the best arcade experiences in the last few years.\nEvery stage is a frenetic chase to the end goal, with the screen filling with impossible levels of enemies and bullets while you do your best to avoid it all and stay alive for as long as you can, and every arena introduces a unique layout to shake things up, from floors disappearing when you step on them, to laser beams moving across the screen at certain intervals and making you run for cover just in time.\nThe game also introduces a brilliant game mechanic where your character has a battery that depletes as time goes by and that can only be charged back by killing a certain number of enemies. This means you can never play it safe and stick to a corner waiting for enemies to come at you, as you will have to chase them at numerous times during the game just to get that recharge before you run out and fail the stage. This is what makes the game unique among other similar titles, as it provides alot of entertaining stressful moments where you are running against time as you throw yourself at every enemy just to get a goddamn recharge.\nThe game has a huge list of characters to pick from, each with their own unique weapons and skills, so the game never gets stale, and gives ample room for experimentation and player preference.\nIt also comes with bosses, and they all significantly ramp the difficulty up with creative attack patterns and alternate forms, the Final Boss being one of the highlights of the game.\nSoundtrack is amazing and perfect for this game, with one of the best Game Over tracks  I have heard in a long time, that alone is worth losing a stage on purpose.\nSo yeah, if you truly like engaging videogames  that actually demand the player's effort and attention, then please give this a chance, it truly deserves more love than it gets right now.  \nAnd who knows, you might actually like the characters and story more than I do", "timestamp_created": 1481332308, "timestamp_updated": 1481332308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28270640": {"recommendationid": "28270640", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968010552", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 50376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "last_played": 1515934118}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: Probably the best twinstick shooter ever made. Why are you even looking at this review? Play the [b]free demo[/b] and then buy the full game when you inevitably love it.\n\n[h1]The good[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*] It's a blast, plain and simple. Blowing up robots with the various weapons, powering up your weapon, dodging bullets, lasers and mines, stacking up immense combos and multikills... there is a lot of classic arcade twinstick action to be had here. \n    [*] There are 9 playable characters to choose from, each with really unique weapons. No two characters play alike. \n    [*] It looks and feels great, especially for an indie title. Models, animations and textures are on point. Controls are simple, tight, and responsive.\n    [*] The electronica soundtrack is fantastic and has exactly the right mood. I usually don't value soundtrack that highly but this one is exceptional. \n    [*] All of the levels are awesome, and the bosses are all unique and have their own identity. \n    [*] The skill floor is pretty low, and the ceiling is wicked high. There is a lot to be learned and achieved before you can say you've mastered this game. I'm hundreds of hours in and I definitely haven't. \n    [*] They don't labor you with cutscenes, but there is an interesting backstory if you care to look for it. \n    [*] Kind of a minor one, but the achievements are interesting. For some of them, part of the challenge is actually figuring out how to accomplish them first. For example, there's an achievement for getting a chain of 1000, but no one campaign level has 1000 enemies in it. \n[/list] \n\n[h1]The bad (kinda)[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*] It's an arcade game at heart. That means most of the replay value comes from replaying levels to get the best ranks, to shoot for the highest possible score, and to get the shortest completion times (there is an active \n[url=speedrun.com/aac]speedrun board[/url] !). If that's not your thing, this game is going to be about a 5-hour experience for you. I don't see this as a downside, but a lot of people do, and this review is here for your benefit, not mine. \n    [*] No rebindable controls. I don't have any problem with the control scheme, but if you plan to play with KB+M with an alternative layout like Dvorak or AZERTY, you're going to need a workaround like AutoHotkey. \n    [*] No online play. More a lack of a positive than a negative, but it's important to know. Cactus is primarily a singleplayer experience and online play was too costly to implement. If you have an Nvidia card and a strong upload speed, you can work around it with [url=http://moonlight-stream.com]moonlight-stream[/url]. \n[/list] \n\n[h1]Stuff that other reviews say is bad, but actually isn't[/h1]\n\nI looked through the negative steam reviews to find some common objections. God, there is some stupid stuff in there. For your sanity, please don't read them... \n\n[list]\n    [*] \"It's a time attack game\". Well, yes and no. The failure condition is time-based, and beating a level fast is rewarded, but it's not a speedrunning game at its core. There is a more interesting scoring system which gives rise to other ways to score high. The fastest runs are very, very rarely the highest scoring. \n    [*] \"The characters aren't balanced.\" They're not supposed to be. They're balanced in the sense that you can get an S+ rank on every level and boss with every character if you try. Some characters are easier to play, some are better for speed and survivability, others are better for scoring. The highest scoring characters are also the ones that require the most skill to use, they're not noob tubes. Some characters are better for crowds while others excel at boss busting. \n    [*] \"The battery is a bad system, lives or health would be better\". Never understood this one. There's never any reasoning to back it up whatsoever, nor is an alternative system ever properly outlined. The battery is a great system, I don't see anything wrong with it. How would lives or health work in multiplayer, anyway? (Badly is the answer). \n    [*] \"You need to memorize every spawn to play well.\" Lol no.\n    [*] \"The final boss is too hard.\" I don't agree personally, it seems appropriately hard for the final boss of an arcade game, but devs listened to this sentiment and nerfed it recently by a little bit. If you're struggling with any boss or level, you can ask the community for advice.\n    [*] \"Getting knocked down is too punishing.\" It isn't. You drop lots of weapon power pickups on knockdown, your secondary weapon is unaffected, and you push away mobs and have temporary invincibility on wakeup. The game gives you lots of ways to work around knockdowns. \n    [*] \"It's not very casual friendly\". Alright, this one is fair enough, I suppose. It is an arcade game that requires developing some skill, and there's no easy mode, but it's not some hardcore ultra hard l33t game either. If you're a very casual player, you're not the target audience and thus this game might not be for you. \n[/list] \n\nSo yeah, try it out. I love it, I think you will too!\n\n[h1]Obligatory shilling[/h1]\n\n[url=https://discord.gg/kSyaZk6]AAC Community Discord[/url]\n\n[url=https://assaultandroidcactus.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page]AAC fanwiki (Miraheze)[/url]\n\n[url=http://www.speedrun.com/aac]AAC Speedrun Leaderboards[/url]\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1y9jbn7VezoS8Kad7f2EzQ]My YT channel[/url] where I post a ton of speed/scoreruns", "timestamp_created": 1481292930, "timestamp_updated": 1491858280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620381", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28259005": {"recommendationid": "28259005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093363183", "num_games_owned": 459, "num_reviews": 191, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501806879}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best twin stick shooters I've played.

Assault Android Cactus is a twin-stick shooter in which you are the title character Cactus (or one of her 8 Android companions, when you unlock them all) attempting to stop the Section Lords on an impossibly large spaceship from planning to destroy the universe or something. \n\nThe plot is not that important, but it does have some funny dialogue and cute characters, so that's a plus. Graphically, the game is actually pretty impressive, and it can get quite hectic with the multi-colored enemies and different types of projectiles all on screen at once. Just as well, the game supports up to 4 player Local Co-Op, which is an absolute blast to play with anybody who will join you on this bullet fiesta. (Sadly no onlie multiplayer, but I understand why the devs couldn't implement it).\n\nThe gameplay is the star of the show, here, and it MORE than fulfills the desire of anyone who enjoys these types of games. Not only is there a wide variety of distinct characters to play with,  each with primary and secondary weapons, but there's so much replayability for score chasers with the rating system. Not many games have convinced me to play for so long just to make my score a *little* bit better, but with the addictive gameplay and skill-based rating system, this game inspired me.\n\nThere's plenty of replyability with the EX modes you can unlock for the campagin, finishing each stages with every character, AND Daily Challenges and a Boss Rush mode. This is a game that is ABSOLUTELY worth the price point with all the polish and content on display here.\n\nI'll give it a 10/10.

It gets a little bit hard after a while and it would have been nice to select which weapons you want, as oppose to them being set for each character. It also gets kinda repetitive after the first few levels. A difficulty adjustment setting would have been nice.\n2. Did i finish the game? NO/ Maybe in the future\n\nThe story is almost nonexistent, but in this type of games there is no need to be. All that it is is a fun distraction after a hard day at work.\n\n3. Pros/Cons.\n\nPROS:\n-Great colors and visuals\n- Easy to understand controls\n\nCONS:\n- No difficulty setting\n- Gets repetitive after a while. \n\n4. Final thoughts:\nNot a huge fan of top-down shooters, but this game made me want to play more, until I\u2019ve died 7 times on the same level and rage quit. If you like this kind of game, get it!\n5.

Moving platforms, night sections and environmental hazards are only some of the problems you will have to face.\n\nFinally, the large cast of characters, each with their own weapon and special weapon, enriches the game further.

The story is pretty simple: a gigantic space cargo ship has been seized by a super AI gone rogue. A special space police force known as 'Assault Androids' send in their cop 'Cactus' who happend to be nearby to stop the AI from keeping the ship hostage. Unfortunately the ship is divided in large different area's who are all controlled by other robotic section lords who also have gone rogue. You're going to have to fight your way through the different levels to get to the core of the ship and put an end to the mutiny!\n\nThere is a large selection of characters to play with that you gradually unlock. The difference in gameplay per android is quite considerable. You don't need to worry about ammo for special attacks, instead there is a cooldown for special moves. \n\nAn interesting mechanic is your battery. This game doesn't work with continues but once the battery depletes, it's game over. Enemies will drop batteries throughout the fight and you'll have to collect them to keep going. If you get hit multiple times, you go down and you'll have to tap yourself back to life, at the cost of battery power. No matter how many times you get knocked down, as long if you have battery power you are good to go.\n\nThere is a fun combo system that revolves around chaining enemy kills. Once you killed an enemy, a counter shows up with a timer in the shape of a circle around it. You need to kill another enemy within the time limit to keep the chain going. You get a ranking based on your combo chain. Breaking the chain will end up in not managing to get the highest ranking for the level. \n\nOther than batteries enemies will drop power-ups that give you temporarily boosts, such as extra speed, firepower assistence or freezing enemies in their tracks. They can help you a lot if you're in a pinch. \n\nIf you're a fan of twin-stick shooters this is a very, very enjoyable purchase. It feels refreshing to play and is also fun in couch co-op.", "timestamp_created": 1480355448, "timestamp_updated": 1480355546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27961884": {"recommendationid": "27961884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062168949", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480349946}, "language": "english", "review": "Good old shoot them up.

It's... just awesome.\n\nThe graphics are awesome. Although the super deformed look of the protagonists is a tiiny bit cringey, the animations and the personality of every character more than makes up for it. The levels are colorful and everything's perfectly identifiable despite the intense chaos that usually clutters the screen. GUI is clear and immediate, and there's a lot of detail put into the game's appearance. Shield emitters will change colors depending on your current level, shell casings will spray everywhere, lighting effects look great, and it keeps a mostly solid 60 FPS throughout.\n\nThe sound is AWESOME. The OST is catchy and upbeat, with a lot of really kickass tunes. Voice acting is cool and the sound cues are always present and identifiable. Honestly one of the best sound designs I've heard in a while.\n\nThe gameplay is awesome. The controls are a *tad* awkward since the right stick is a bit overly sensitive and being used to TBoI having to constantly aim in 360\u00ba takes a bit to get used to, but it is otherwise very fluid and fun. There is no death (you only get knocked out) and the core of the gameplay consists in killing enough enemies to spawn a battery in order to keep the timer up -a battery takes 60 secs to deplete-, resulting in a very fast paced kill-a-thon. There's a lot of enemies that can knock you out in one hit but also power-ups that help in staying mobile or killing the enemies faster. All enemies are easily identifiable and all have cues for their attacks. It feels awesome zipping around the battlefield taking out high priority targets while lasers fly everywhere.\n\nThe characters are awesome. Although they have just a couple of lines they have distinct personalities and a very different feel to them. The weapons are sort of expected but very varied and sometimes rather original, especially on the unlockable androids. Each one will have different lines on the bosses, helping replayability, and all are viable to get e throughout the game, although some will work better than the others. Overall though, they're really franchise worthy, they're that good.\n\nThe bosses are... well, on the one hand they are pretty awesome because they are bullet hell stages that feel super satisfying when you get to beat them, but on the other they can become really annoying and frustrating if you're not carrying a character that works well against them.\n\nThe play value is awesome. Every stage is pretty easy to beat, but there are ranks to them where you'll compete against your Steam friends and put on a global leaderboard as well. There's also Daily Drives and the Infinity Drive mode, which takes place on an ever shifting arena. It's really impressive to see it change shape and completely alter its mechanics Layer after Layer. You really won't get tired of it any time soon, and for the price it's going, it's a real value. There's 5 levels per stage plus one boss, and 5 stages total. After beating the game you get Boss Rush, *and* there's several unlockables that you can buy with credits which add filters, change the camera POV, give you super alternate weapons, and so on.\n\nAssault Android Cactus checks all the boxes for a *great* game. Memorable characters, unlockables that keep you going, amazing soundtrack, great graphics, easy to get in and hard to master and polished-to-a-shine gameplay really makes it a title worth playing. The bosses can be a bit of a bitch, and you'll always end up wishing for a whole campaign more, but that's the problem with good games, they eventually have to finish. For a 3 people team, this is an outstanding achievement, and truly a twinstick fan's wet dream. 9.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1480165548, "timestamp_updated": 1480165548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522108", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27635945": {"recommendationid": "27635945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211559477", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512911361}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1480157085, "timestamp_updated": 1480157085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27616108": {"recommendationid": "27616108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104913438", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498026800}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the few shooters I like.

It was a game I bought from Humble Bundle, and I only now got around to it.\n\nIt's actually a extremely solid game of it's kind. A rather \"safe\" twin stick Bullet Hell.\n\nWhat I mean is, unlike any other like this that I know of, taking hits won't end in immediate gameover. Instead, your true life bar drains over time, and when you take enough hits in a row in a short time, you'll topple over and shut down. You'll have to smash the fire buttons to revitalize your systems and get back to the fray. A battery in the top-middle of the screen will drain constantly, without pause. You'll have to be killing enemies by the packs constantly to spawn powerups, and the battery which is VITAL to your progress and survival.\n\nThe levels are all unique in every way. While 25 levels may seem like a lazy number, it's far from that. They truely affect the gameplay and force you to fight smarter, rather than harder. Do not expect easy victories. For those addicted, there's even Daily Drives and Infinite Drive. Daily Drives are daily levels, as expected on the tin. Infinite Drive goes on forever, until you can no longer support your android.\n\nThe characters you get to play as all cater to different styles, which is a fantastic plus. From snipers to shotguns, railguns and magma launchers, this is perfect for anyone. In fact...\n\nOne of the best things about the game is that it's 100% multiplayer friendly, allowing you to have up to four players in the mayhem. Sadly, there's no online co-op, which would've been a nice addition.\n\nOne of the things that I was surprised about is the story. This game didn't even need a story, and I assumed it didn't have one to begin with. I was wrong, and pleasantly wrong. It's not a big story, and I like the implementation. Bossfights give you good insight into the story of the characters, and there's even bios you can look into if you really want more.\n\nThe bosses are quite worthy of their position, ready to absolutely destroy players. They all have several phases and are a lot of fun to fight.\n\nJust don't expect the game to be easy. The music is mostly techno, and is alright in my opinion.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nWhile I struggle to reccomend this at a full purchase, anything 10$ and below, you will get your money's worth!", "timestamp_created": 1480032094, "timestamp_updated": 1480032278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27321079": {"recommendationid": "27321079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120803272", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1515679783}, "language": "german", "review": "Assault Android Cactus ist ein hervorragender Twin-Stick-Shooter, der besonders mit Freunden zu viert viel Spa\u00df macht.

Plus they're all really cute and full of personality! The level design is great and is constantly changing things up or throwing new surprises at you. All of them are different and have really cool visual theming too, since each one is a different section of the ship the game takes place on, like hydroponics or freight zones. The music is some awesome EDM and it really gets you pumped to blow up robots, and keeps you going when you lose and retry.\n\nI also really like the battery mechanic, where your battery constantly drains and you have to kill enemies to get more recharges before it drains down and you die. It fits so well into the core loop of shooting and dodging enemies and their bullets, and succeeds in making a bullet hell type of game that is really freindly while still giving a great level of challenge. It also makes the action, which is already fast-paced and relentless as hell, even more tense when you're on the verge of running out and are fighting extra hard to find that one enemy holding the recharge.\n\nAlso the boss battles are great and it has a whole bunch of neat extra modes and mutators. And local co-op multiplayer!! My girlfriend and I played through a bunch together and its a really fun way to play since you share a battery meter and have to watch out for each other.\n\nOverall this game is a ton of fun and extremely worth the money.

I even did a search for tips online, and found out there were basically in-game \"cheats\" you could buy with the credits you acquire from playing through the game, so I blew a ton of them on some \"mega weapons,\" and I did just as badly (if not worse) than before.\n\nWhat's worse, it's not one of those multi-tiered boss battles where you get a checkpoint after each part of the boss; oh no, instead, I have to fight the multiple really easy phases of the boss every time I try, despite it being an utter waste of my gaming time, since a checkpoint or separate level could remedy this, but the developers instead elected to make me \"fight\" (not time into, but not effort) the same parts of the boss I've dealt with easily time and again.\n\nThis boss battle has made my experience aggravating, to the extent that I cannot recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1479014176, "timestamp_updated": 1479014272, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.359522", "comment_count": "31", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26571415": {"recommendationid": "26571415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054080456", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 122, "last_played": 1516233626}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is exactly what I wanted for my twin-stick shooter craving.

However this isn't to say that I wouldn't pay RRP for it given the chance now. \n\nThe main campaign is about 3 hours along, and extremely exciting. The difficulty curve in this game is just about the right area, and it gets progressively challenging, with the final 3 / 4 levels giving you the anger which would make you want to rip your hair out. Naturally when you complete it you get a massive sense of achievement just from the final 2 levels alone. \n\n For the campaign, it is around 3 hours. There isn't much narrative to look into here, just a standard 2 stick shooter arcade game. Due to the mechanics in the game being solid, the lack of narrative does not harm whatsoever. The characters are only in the game to add some charm, there is nothing there to make you attached to them, you could have made this game with rather primitive shapes and I would still be giving it the same positive review I am now. \n\n The soundtrack can feel repetitive in places, but each zone has its own different style of music. \n \n The game does have a lot to offer when it comes to the replayability scale, it offers you new characters as you play throughout, all of which with their own unique pro's, con's and playstyles, you could do a run through with each character. After the main campaign you also unlock boss mode, there is a variety of game modes and collectables to keep you going, if you enjoy the game enough. \n\n For me, the 3 hours I spent in campaign were very refreshing after taking a back seat with games recently, and due to having a job, the 3 hours is good for now, and I'm happy with being able to pick up this game in the future. \n\n If you like a challenge, and good gameplay with some difficulty, definately a must have.

Neben dem nur bedingt Hirntoten Storymodus, gibt es in Assault Android Cactus auch noch einen t\u00e4glich zufallsgenerierten Arschlochkurs, der sich alle 24 Stunden resetet und neu aufbaut. UND die wohl gr\u00f6\u00dfte St\u00e4rke des Spiels : einen Endlos Modus, der f\u00fcr das was er ist, einfach schei\u00dfabwechslungreich ist.\nNat\u00fcrlich kann unsere minderj\u00e4hrige Hobbysprengmeisterin auch ihre \u201eschwachen\u201c Kameraden Terminators zur Hilfe holen. In dem Chaosreichen COOP- Modus schie\u00dft ihr die b\u00f6sen Roboter Bastarde mit bis zu 4 Freunden in St\u00fccke. Grobe St\u00fccke. Wie in Leberwurst.\nNun , das Spiel ist trotz allem nicht perfekt. Die Story kommt gerade so an das atemberaubende Plotlastige Gameplay der 2D Super Marios heran und das Balancing ist, vor allem in Bezug auf Cactus Kampfkraft alles andere als Perfekt. Mal ehrlich, DER NERD ist abartig stark. Das sollte nicht so sein. Auch die Abwechslung h\u00e4lt sich bis auf ein paar Giga- Blechdosen wirklich in Grenzen.\nTrotz allem ist Assault Android Cactus f\u00fcr mich das etwas bessere, farbenfrohere und vor allem schnellere The Binding of Isaac, auch wenn es keine absurd blutigen Item- Combos gibt. Das Spiel macht Spa\u00df wie sau und mit ein paar Kumpels k\u00f6nnt ihr Im Couch Multiplayer auch echt eine verdammt gute Zeit haben. Mit den Lollita- Robo- Rambos macht ihr nichts falsch. \n", "timestamp_created": 1478628587, "timestamp_updated": 1478628587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26482799": {"recommendationid": "26482799", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961873335", "num_games_owned": 708, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478802390}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Twin-Stick Shooter\" is a genre that doesn't often interest me.

Creative and dynamic levels that are stimulating by asking the player to adjust on the fly, similarly creative bosses that switch things around quite fast. So, how can I not recommend this game?\n\nBecause it is plagued with the most atrocious design flaws it possibly could've been, that is why. If you want a tl;dr, I will say this: easily the most frustrating game I played in a long time, seemingly dedicated to obsessive masochistic OCD perfectionists. Deeper explanation below.\n\nThe battery/revive system is interesting, but my god why did the idea of weapon dropping to null power whenever you die make it to the campaign is beyond me. In all the score-focused modes, yes, keep that in. But the campaign is the whole different story, there are many bottleneck places in the levels where if you die (and they are hard moments) you are fucked. Because now you need to somehow clean up this hard part with severely diminished firepower, which leads to more deaths. On top of the fact that lowered firepower makes it quite hard to catch up with killing, which is needed to refill the damned battery. This becomes even most absurd in the boss fights which are, for the most part, quite tight timing-wise, on top of being extremely stingy with orbs that you can actually pick up. And no picking up == no weapon powering up. \n\nAn additional problem with the bosses is that the battery refills usually spawn right at the point where they stood when the phase of the fight ended, so usually right behind the boss. Retrieving these is often paramount to suicide, and since batteries disappear in time... yeah, enjoy.\n\nThe health bar could almost not be there, really. The game has an unhealthy obsession with one-hit deaths (and we already established how much going down hurts) and will throw them at the player all the time. This is coupled very annoyingly with how ridiculous the terrain can get; while enemies generally provide visual feedback to when they will strike, the terrain can be very subtle with when it wants to kill you, leading to many frustrating deaths. Also, bonus points here for the terrain spewing enemies out with no warning right onto your face. Especially when some of them blow up. Instant death if you didn't restart the map X times to finally understand what and when happens.\nBut there is one thing that adds an insult to the injury and it is the nonexistent post-hit invincibility. Doesn't matter that your character has several hit points, if there is a cluster of bullets coming at you, failing to dodge it will just outright kill you. A favourite thing on the bosses, they weave real rich patterns of bullets, one wrong step and you are dead. The second boss is the most sadistic here, requiring strong weaponry to deal with an absurd amount of adds that she summons while being deviously adept at killing the player right when her third phase triggers. The swarm of little flies will just ram into you and drain your health in a second or two.\n\nAll of the stuff presented above wouldn't be as fun as it is without yet another thing that just makes me shake my head in disbelief. And it is a catastrophic lack of visual clarity. The game is flashy and visually noisy like a glittery Twilight vampire, and it can lead to easy demise. When I said the health bar could almost not be there, I neglected to mention some humanitarian enemies that actually shoot stray bullets. Which, for reasons unknown to me, are smaller than every other bullet, including yours. It is possible to get randomly hit with something just because amidst all of these explosions and spray of your own weapon, something will hit you. And pray it is not a rocket. You see, some enemies shoot a rocket into the sky, and it will fall down on a designated location. And instakill you. Would be fair, it is delayed, there is a targeting reticle indicating where that will happen. So why for the love of god it is the least flashy, most dimmed and blurred thing in the entire game? On some arenas, it is more subtle than the actual environmental lighting. Just astounding, really.\n\nAs an added complaint, the devs didn't bother to design stages in a way that makes sure each of them is reasonably doable with each and every of the long list of characters offered to the players. Sure, if you grind for long enough, you will become the god of Cactus and master every character in every stage, but this is exactly the overarching problem with this game.\n\nIt is not considerate of anybody but mad perfectionists who will time the sparse invincibility frames down to a millisecond, and learn how to get through each level without dying once. People who won't be deterred by hundreds of re-tries of boss fights. In a great many cases, the game demands such an obnoxious level of perfection just to get through the damned stage without cursing all of the creation while hammering the revive button (absolutely pointless that you need to do that, btw, and just fuels the anger) that it is simply not worth the nerves.

A large easy to see life bar with number of lives would make more sense.\n-At the same time there is a battery level meter (a timer) and if *that* meter drops its game over.

The bosses will make you think about your approach and challenge you (except for the final boss, which I think is flawed, so it's hard because of that). The life system works off of small shield and disabling your character if you take too much damage. You're really battling the clock because your android runs out of life the longer you are playing each level. Take too long between battery recharge pickups and it's game over. It's good to see the options for unlockables WITHIN THE GAME and not as DLC, which gives this arcade-y title an old school feel.\n\nNow, the final boss. Waaaaaay too hard. The second phase removes battery pick-ups and it's INCREDIBLY challenging to deal enough damage to survive without your battery running out. My go-to for bosses was often Coral because of high shotgun damage. Even with her, I was one second or less away from dying when I beat the last boss/phase. This is not counting the dozen or so times I came within 3-4 blocks of winning and ran out of battery due to the way the final boss phase is designed. Introducing a fractional recharge from enemies would have been useful (aka, as long as you are fighting and not disabled, you will be able to survive to the end. This way if you get hit too much, it can still be GAME OVER).", "timestamp_created": 1478369846, "timestamp_updated": 1478370013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488949", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26440086": {"recommendationid": "26440086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005327779", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511651968}, "language": "english", "review": "You just gotta trust me o this one, this is the twin stick shooter of the god damn decade.

Le jeu pourrait \u00eatre sympa, c'est du twin stick shooter avec une direction artistique simplement immonde mais \u00e7a reste du twin stick shooter sympa dans son approche. Chaque ar\u00e8ne offre un petit chalenge qui se renouvelle constamment: la lumi\u00e8re se coupe, la salle change de forme, la cam\u00e9ra s'emballe, des tapis roulants t'entrainent l\u00e0 o\u00f9 tu ne veux pas aller ... nan, y'a des id\u00e9es et chaque ar\u00e8ne se joue (en th\u00e9orie) avec beaucoup de plaisir.\n\nSeulement \u00e7a, c'est tout ce qu'il y'a: des ar\u00e8nes avec des id\u00e9es. Sans \u00e7a, c'est du twin stick shooter avec une horrible absence de retour ... les vagues d\u2019ennemis se comptent en centaines, on abat du monstre m\u00e9canique \u00e0 la chaine (y'a m\u00eame un compteur de combo), mais il n'y a AUCUN feeling de puissance. La faute aux bruitages qui manquent de patate, \u00e0 la direction artistique d\u00e9gueulasse tendance choupi-kawa\u00ef-je n'utilise que des couleurs sans nuance pour que tu ne vois rien, une vitesse de d\u00e9placement assez rapide, une hit box des plus curieuses et une lisibilit\u00e9 des plus approximatives. \n\nL'absence de feeling est un \u00e9norme d\u00e9faut dans un jeu qui se veut court et \u00e0 run (c'est pens\u00e9 pour faire des cessions courtes, deux-trois minutes pour une ar\u00e8ne et basta), quand tu te fais chier pendant une ar\u00e8ne tu n'as pas exactement envie de la refaire pour am\u00e9liorer ton score ... m\u00eame si elle est courte. Mais il n'y a pas que \u00e7a comme souci.\n\nLe jeu \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me (tr\u00e8s con) d'upgrade: tu butes des ennemis, ils l\u00e2chent des petites boulettes, tu les ramasses et tu remplis une jauge de puissance. Quand la jauge de puissance est pleine tu gagnes un rang d'arme (ton arme fait plus de d\u00e9g\u00e2ts). Seulement quand tu \"tombes dans les pommes\" (j'y reviens) tu perds tes boulettes et de fait ton arme redevient un pistolet \u00e0 petits pois. Donc non seulement le feeling n'est pas l\u00e0 mais en prime il n'y a m\u00eame pas la sensation de devenir plus puissant puisqu'il faut toujours tout recommencer: le flingue tout pouwwi, ramasser les boulettes pour avoir un flingue pas trop ridicule, rince and repeat \u00e0 chaque ar\u00e8ne ... c'est chiant comme boucle, et lassant tr\u00e8s rapidement.\n\nQuand je parle de \"tomber dans les pommes\" c'est pour parler de la jauge de vie: encore un syst\u00e8me bien con. Au lieu d'avoir une barre de vie classique il y'a une jauge d'\u00e9nergie: elle se vide au fil du temps ET quand tu te fais toucher. Quand elle est vid\u00e9e tu es mort, fin de partie. Mais quand tu te fais trop toucher tu tombes seulement dans les pommes: foncer dans les balles/coups n'est pas intrins\u00e8quement mortel. La barre de d'\u00e9nergie ne suffi pas pour durer sur tout une ar\u00e8ne, donc il y'aura de temps en temps une batterie qui sera l\u00e2ch\u00e9e par un monstre pour recharger la dite jauge et pouvoir continuer ... \u00e7a n'a pas l'air comme \u00e7a, mais c'est vraiment con comme id\u00e9e. Le principe est de t'obliger \u00e0 bouger pour ramasser la batterie, donc d'avoir un jeu nerveux qui t'oblige \u00e0 bouger pour ramasser tous les power ups ... ouais mais camarade t'oublies un truc: DANS UN TWIN STICK SHOOTER TU PASSES TON TEMPS A BOUGER CONNARD ! C'EST LE PRINCIPE DE BASE DU GENRE ! Y'avait pas besoin de ton syst\u00e8me d\u00e9bile qui n'apporte m\u00e9caniquement rien et qui fait profond\u00e9ment chier puisque l'ennemi le plus dangereux est en fait ta barre d'\u00e9nergie qui se vide, pas les monstres qui arrivent par dizaines ... c'est pas une id\u00e9e de g\u00e9nie \u00e7a ? Avoir un TWS o\u00f9 ce ne sont pas les ennemis \u00e0 buter qui sont les ennemis \u00e0 surveiller ... \n\nJe signale au passage que devoir marteler la g\u00e2chette de tir pour se relever quand tu viens de tomber dans les pommes est purement exasp\u00e9rant ...\n\nEn fait ceci doit aussi jouer dans l'absence de feeling, le but du jeu est de ramasser les batteries et d'\u00e9viter les balles que quelques monstres tirent vers toi ... c'est pas un vrai twin stick shooter, c'est pas vraiment du bullet hell (trop peu choses \u00e0 esquiver), le cul entre deux chaises le bonhomme.\n\nComme d\u00e9faut purement \"game design \u00e0 la rue\" il faut aussi souligner les boss particuli\u00e8rement stupides/insipides. Comme j'ai dit le but du jeu est d'avoir quelque chose de rapide, o\u00f9 tu passes ton temps \u00e0 esquiver des dizaines de monstres pour ramasser des batteries/power up ... \n\nBien, alors partant de \u00e7a, il faut m'expliquer qui est l'abruti profond qui s'est dit \"notre concept de jeu c'est \u00e7a, alors pour les boss on va faire EXACTEMENT L'INVERSE ! \\o/ \" ? Parce qu'avoir un gigantesque sac \u00e0 point de vie que tu vas mettre des plombes \u00e0 tuer (merci le flingue de base pourri que tu ne pourras pas augmenter avec les boulettes puisqu'il n'y a personne \u00e0 tuer ^^ ) qui se divise en plusieurs phases (l'aberration de game design qui emmerde le monde vid\u00e9o-ludique depuis la premi\u00e8re utilisation de cette id\u00e9e qui n'aurait jamais d\u00fb voir le jour) toutes aussi chiantes les unes que les autres (quelle surprise, comme les centaines de jeu qui ont essay\u00e9 avant celui ci ...), c'est la goute d'eau qui fait tomber la pierre qui roule ... nan, \u00e7a fini de t'endormir en fait. C'est simplement pas fun \u00e0 jouer, il n'y a AUCUN plaisir \u00e0 les buter, et ils sont surtout incroyablement \u00e0 cot\u00e9 du concept du jeu. \n\nAu final c'est donc un jeu lassant/pas amusant/pas motivant. Il y'a un syst\u00e8me de point \u00e0 gagner pour d\u00e9bloquer des petits bonus: des filtres visuels, un mode multi avec des bots (pourquoi c'est pas disponible d'entr\u00e9e de jeu \u00e7a ? Ha oui, parce que la cam\u00e9ra avec plusieurs joueurs est terriblement catastrophique et fini de d\u00e9truire la lisibilit\u00e9 de l'action en s'\u00e9loignant d'environ 14 kilom\u00e8tres quand les deux joueurs s'\u00e9loignent l'un de l'autre), des t\u00eates de taille normale (\u00e7a aussi \u00e7a devrait \u00eatre disponible de base, \u00e7a rend le jeu moins moche) mais l\u00e0 non plus il n'y a rien de transcendant. Comble de la b\u00eatise d'ailleurs le multi est uniquement local ...\n\nNan, vraiment, c'est un petit jeu \u00e0 petit prix mais il ne vaut vraiment pas grand chose ...", "timestamp_created": 1477595605, "timestamp_updated": 1477595605, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26249672": {"recommendationid": "26249672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028252107", "num_games_owned": 669, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478984600}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a lot of fun even though I'm normally terrible at \"bullet hell\" style games.

Una pesante, che solitamente necessita di un recupero una volta usata, e una leggera, per il \"fuoco d'ordinanza\".\nQueste ultime possono essere upgradate fino a 3 volte raccogliendo i \"resti\" dei robottoni da noi uccisi. Ogni livello \u00e8 fine a se stesso, quindi ogni volta l'arma si upgrader\u00e0, ma al livello successivo partiremo con la nostra arma \"scarsetta\" per arrivare nelle fasi pi\u00f9 concitate con l'arma ben \"pompata\".\nLe armi si depotenzieranno anche quando verremo messi KO.\nMa il KO non sar\u00e0 la fine del livello! Ci potremo rialzare e combattere anche dopo essere stati stesi. \nIl Game Over sar\u00e0 quando la nostra \"Batteria\" si scaricher\u00e0, rendendo il gioco molto frenetico e sempre alla ricerca di nuove ricariche per la batteria, a suon di robot nemici uccisi.\nPer gli amanti degli arcade, o i perfezionisti (come me) questo gioco presenta una sfida continua. Non baster\u00e0 uccidere tutti i nemici senza venir messi KO per ottenere un buon punteggio, bens\u00ec bisogner\u00e0 ucciderli tutti in una unica catena. \nPi\u00f9 la catena avanza, pi\u00f9 il tempo tra una uccisione e l'altra dovr\u00e0 essere ravvicinato, fino ad arrivare al paradosso di ringraziare quando i nemici a schermo sono tantissimi, cos\u00ec da cercare di non perdere la catena raggiunta con fatica. \nNel gioco sono presenti anche gli spawn di 3 power up, dopo l'uccisione di determinati nemici:\n1)Due robottini che temporaneamente ci aiuteranno con maggiore potenza di fuoco\n2)Una maggiore velocit\u00e0 temporanea unita ad un magnetismo che ci far\u00e0 raccogliere pezzi di robot e (eventualmente) ricariche per la batteria (ma non attireremo altri power up se presenti nel campo, ma dovremmo \"raccoglierli manualmente\")\n3)Uno shot down che ferma temporaneamente i nemici a terra dandoci un bonus di danno verso quest'ultimi. \n\nIl gioco \u00e8 vario e non lascia niente al caso. Finire i livelli ad S+ raramente \u00e8 una \"fortunata casualit\u00e0\" ma richiede studio degli spawn nemici, tempistiche, coordinazione e tanta, tanta, tanta, TANTA pazienza.\nSe vi piace il genere, e gli sparatutto isometrici colorati, travolgenti ed esplosivi, questo \u00e8 senza dubbio il gioco per voi!!", "timestamp_created": 1475893702, "timestamp_updated": 1475893702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25896145": {"recommendationid": "25896145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032830771", "num_games_owned": 748, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476320618}, "language": "english", "review": "On so many words?

It's a steal at full price.\n\nAAC is a twin stick shooter where you play as androids. There's a lot of characters to choose from and each one has unique weapons and shooting patterns. You'll want to play them all since they're not just for looks, but actually play completely differently. There's a play style for just about anyone, and plenty of options for breaking out of your comfort zone.\n\nThe goal is to survive to the end of each level and fight the bosses of each world. Go to town dodging enemy attacks, power up your weapon, finding batteries to keep you going, collect temporary power-ups, and shooting everything in your path. There's dozens of enemies, every level has a unique concept, and each boss has several phases and unique attacks.\n\nAll these small things will overwhelm and keep you on your toes at all times. You will die, and it will be fun. You'll actually have to gain some skill, learn some things, and improve to beat the levels.\n\nThe real challenge is getting S+ on every single level though. To do that, you must keep the chain meter going and defeat every enemy without it breaking. Incredibly challenging and you'll keep coming back again and again to try it. The game even features an option to reset the level automatically when the chain breaks.\n\nThe game is challenging, but the average player can beat it with persistence. S+ ranks will involve quite a bit of optional skill.\n\nThe game has a lot of unlockable bonuses and extras ranging from vanity to cheat like options. You'll have to play a lot to unlock them all. If you play normally and are really into the game, you won't have to grind for them. This leads to a well balanced stream of enticement while playing the game.\n\nThe game could run on a toaster, and it supports unlocked framerate, making it not only play better, but a great showcase for a high refresh rate monitor, as any decent hardware can max out its potential.\n\nIt supports local cooperative play with up to 4 players simultaneously and scales the difficulty depending how many users play.\n\nIt isn't perfect, but nothing is. There's some minor quibbles that will lead to some unfortunate or frustrating deaths. The camera can be wonky with how it frames the action, and it can be difficult to tell where missiles will land when the screen is loaded with enemies, but you'll have so much fun, that even after you die, you'll say one more time. The short and easy to easy to digest levels make it easy to keep coming back.\n\nThe game hasn't sold well, so this is definitely a game that needs more support. You can easily put in 50 hours into the game, and there's a ton of quality content in it.

Hell, even some AAA developers. This is how you polish a game! \n\nYou can clearly tell that the developers of Assault Android Cactus loved what they were creating, they shared a creative passion and wanted to bring it to life, to share it with the gaming community. And did they ever! Every single part of this game was polished until chrome, from the characters (each character has a different animation for being selected, cancelling character selection, entering a level, and completing a level, along with different primary and secondary weapons, some of which use completely different mechanics than any other character) to the boss battles (each boss is completely different, with pre-fight dialogue that's different for every character, and after defeating them you unlock new characters) to the arcade style interfaces, complete with credits and drop-ins.\n\nProbably should mention the gameplay, because it's nothing like anything I've ever played. A top-down bullet-hell style game where getting hit doesn't matter, because what's really important is your battery. Taking damage simply stuns you, but when you're on limited battery, you really have to make sure you make every second count. I'm pretty sure that's the game's exact motto. When a battery drops, you (and your friends if you're playing coop) make a beeline for it, because that's your health. You miss a battery, you're as good as dead.\n\nThere's even special game modifiers you can buy with your credits, such as AI teammates, or even a fully fledged FIRST PERSON MODE. The developers of this game put effort into something that was completely optional, something I didn't even notice until I already beat the game. That's awesome. That should be the industry standard, like it used to be, where games boasted dozens of cheat codes that let you play it any way you wanted, because they wanted you to ENJOY WHAT THEY CREATED, not so you could line their pockets with cash.\n\nMy complaints?

Even without using Mouse Regions, the triggers alone made temporarily playing this with a 360 controller an agonizing experience. I also frequently have problems with my right thumb getting over the edge of a stick in intense settings like this, making me have to adjust under fire- not a problem with the Steam Controller.\n\nCons: Compared to what's been expected of you in every level and every boss previous to it, the final boss is BRUTAL. Unbeatable? No way. But objectively an insane jump in difficulty vs. the process that's led you to that boss? Absolutely. That's by no means a reason not to buy this game- I just feel it's a one poor design footnote in an otherwise fantastic title.\n\nCampaign isn't so long, but it's a shooter- when are they ever?

I like twin stick shooters with multiplayer - it is a guaranteed way to get my money. But this? \n\nRegretting. Purchase. \n\nGameplay is paced through code - good play is not rewarded, you can always expect a battery to drop when your alarm goes off. Powerups suck because they cycle VERY SLOWLY. One of them(and there are only *THREE*) is pretty much completely pointless.\n\nThe characters are really badly unbalanced, and chances are that you're going to find yourself defaulting to one or two most of the time because the others suck or have serious flaws or are only good for one kind of fight. Special attacks are seriously a very mixed bag, with some of them being completely and utterly pointless while others will obliterate every enemy on the screen without fail.\n\nSpawning is also done programatically I suppose, because the game stupidly spawns crap RIGHT ON TOP OF YOU that BLOWS UP AND MAKES YOU DROP ALL OF YOUR POWERUPS . \n\nWell done designers, you got me. I can't escape your ineptitude now. Standing in the wrong place under the invisible spawn point? Here, let's teleport this thing in right on top of you with zero warning and no chance to dodge.\n\nHAVE YOU A$$HOLES EVER PLAYED A SHOOTER?\n\nOnce this happens the game turns into a bull$hit $logfest that is poorly paced and unfun because you are rocking a pea shooter and the level is just ramping up.\n\nGetting up requires button pounding. Please. Why. Just. No.\n\nThere are dozens and dozens of other little things I hate about this game. \n\nUtterly pointless powerups(and plentiful) blot out enemy bullets so you smack right into them. \n\nThere is a stereotyped Asian android. \n\nController support is half-assed so you can pretty much expect that only your *official* xbox brand controller will work right. \n\nThe camera jerks around like a jack russel terrier that's been snorting cocaine, and you can't really expect consistent camera distance while you're playing from board to board, sometimes not even within the same board.\n\nEarning credits takes forever. Spending them is pointless, and the one or two things that actually alter gameplay dump your score over it.\n\nYes. If you try to evolve this game ANY it DUMPS YOUR SCORES.\n\nAnd here is the absolutely number one thing that pisses me off about this game: It's some kind of indie darling because of the unusually(for indie) high quality presentation. The character visuals are polished, the voice acting is great, the graphics are wonderful and highly stylized, the animation is top notch and the facial expressions are great, the music is perfect and usually suits - but when it comes to the actual core mechanics there are some serious issues. \n\nTo be honest I wouldn't suggest buying it unless it was on sale.

While its story and graphics may not be spectacular, it makes up for it with unique and intense gameplay.\n[b]Overall score: 8/10[/b]\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nYou know those guys who charge around without strategy constantly firing at everything and repeatedly getting themselves killed? You know how everyone hates them for being a stupid liability? Have you ever stopped to consider how they feel or WHY exactly they have no strategy? The reason is revealed in this game; cry no more, that guy! The game pushes you to use this chaotic strategy, whether you like it or not. Guerrilla tactics, sniping, and farming have no effect as the only way to stay alive is to kill everyone as fast as possible. People who play this game will quickly learn that most power ups are worth more than your life and recklessly charge into a hoard of enemies, firing constantly. Trust me, this doesn't subtract from the strategy. To understand it better, look up gameplay. All of this makes up for how very generic the game looks at first.\n [b] [/b] [i] [/i] You thought that was all? The game gets twice as crazy when you try to get a good score. This game is no longer casual when trying to get an S+! Suddenly, local multiplayer becomes an added difficulty and life is precious. Strategy and planning are essential and must be carried out to the millisecond in order to work. Nothing less than a perfect marriage of brilliance and skill will work. (So I'm obviously at a loss. :P)\n[b]Score: 8.5/10[/b] (Only because it's not completely original.)\n\n[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]\nAlthough the game is notably long, it still has a fair amount of replayability. In fact, some can argue it has too much. With two different multiple different game modes that both focus highly on score, you could literally play this game for months without being satisfied with your completion... The definition of hell for some. However, to a less hardcore gamer, it'll still be fun for a while. After you tire of the many central elements, there's the EX options to change up the game. Among the more notable ones are FPS mode, AI partners, super weapons, duplicate characters, and [ALT CAMERA WHT DOWS IT DO]. Though for some... The immensely fun gameplay, character variety, and local multiplayer could be enough In itself. Perhaps the only problem with playing it over and over is the lack of randomness. I think the only thing that's random is the things dropped by enemies... But you could still argue that it has a great amount of replayability.\n[b]Score: 8/10[/b]\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS AND CUSTOMIZATION [/h1]\nAnyone with FPS mode can say that the graphics are unnecessarily good. It has a sufficient amount of settings to suit your computer and playstyle... I'm unconcerned with graphics unless you can't see crap or if they lag my admittedly bad computer. This game does neither, so I see no problem with it. For someone who likes playing with graphics, there are plenty of options for that... Which brings me to customization. As mentioned above, you can change the graphics. Other necessary options at included, but they have extras that go above and beyond. I mentioned a few of the EX options earlier, but there are many more. Some make the game more challenging, others make it easier. Some relate to graphics and music, and others fundamentally change the game. Most are serious, some are silly. While the game isn't spectacular in either of these aspects, everyone can agree that it does well.\n[b]Score: 7.5/10[/b]\n\n[h1]STORY [/h1]\nI would not buy the game for the story alone. Not that it's terrible; I've seen much worse. The problem is that it's not the BEST. The integration of story with graphics and gameplay is poor... Death robots pop up out of nowhere and brainlessly attack you, and three untrained androids manage to grab extremely powerful weapons and use them for a presumably long time with SIXTY-SECOND BATTERIES by ripping out and draining the batteries or enemies... Just ignore that. Dialogue is infrequent, but characters still have a shocking amount of personality from voice lines in and out of battle. This raises new questions about how they got to be like that, but I'll count it as a plus since personality counts for story in my book. I could go on, but I don't like saying bad things about this game. Let's just say that there are good and bad things that mostly balance each other out.\n[b]Score: 4/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1460334515, "timestamp_updated": 1460334652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22347244": {"recommendationid": "22347244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095891244", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460322937}, "language": "english", "review": "Just give the demo a try!

Okay, I'll get the demo and check it out. I like these kinds of games.\"\n\n2:00 AM, upon finishing the demo: \"Oh my gosh, that was so fun. I want to play it all again with a different character. Holly looks cool.\" \n\n2:30 AM, after finishing another play through of the demo: \"This game is amazing. I'm buying this.\" So I bought the game + DLC because the soundtrack is amazing.\n\n10:30 PM: I start playing from the beginning again with one of my good friends in my house. He loves it.\n\n11:30 PM: Another friend hops in as he gets home, and I can't tell if he's tired or just mildly interested, but he wasn't exactly rushing to the computer.\n\n11:40 PM; The second friend is totally in the zone, and a third friend we invite says \"Okay, but I only have time for one round.\" Yeah, right. Sure. Okay. Go for it.\n\n11:55 PM: The third friend decides to help us with the boss fight, and as he plays as Cactus, he goes right up to the boss and is using the flamethrower relentlessly. I say, \"Dude! You're so hardcore! You're right up in there!\" He laughs and says, \"Yeah man! I'm gonna get this guy!\" I am reminded of when he said he'd only do \"one level.\" Yeah, right. Uh-huh. Sure. That's like saying \"Okay, but I'll just have one Pringle.\" Never happens. \n\nApril 6\n12:00 AM: We beat the second boss three or four levels later and the third friend is like \"Dude. This game is so sick.\" Sadly, he did finally drop out after going through the last half of the second section to go to bed. \n\n12:30 AM: Me and the other two friends finish the third section of the game and finally decide that this is the best time to call it quits since we all have class or work in the morning.\n\nIt's charming. I don't give that kind of description to many games nowadays. It is charming and reminds me of the innocent fun we all used to have in the 90's before everything turned into a dark, harsh, nickle-and-dime, profanity-laced online mulitplayer FPS universe. It reminds of a time when games were games and it was just good fun. The characters are witty, there are lots of little things that make the game fun (like the characters being disappointed when you change your mind on who to select), and even an entire section that gives you the backstory on each character, NPC, and enemy. It even gives you info on stuff you won't encounter that is only mentioned in dialogue. It's like you get all the fun preface stuff from your old video game manuals built into the game! Surely any 90's gamer will remember such game manuals.\n\nAt this point you're still here because you're looking for an excuse not to buy it, but deep down you know you want it. Buy it.

But lets forget about that and look at the game. This game had me hooked from as soon as I turned it on and heard that great music. It accompanies the visual style well and gives a very clear theme to it. When the gameplay came along, I found myself nostalgic for hardcore shooters like Smash TV and was, in honesty, disappointed.

Cactus for your basic damage, Holly for ranged support, Lemon for spreading damage to large groups, and Coral for hitting small clusters hard.

And the difficulty is never artificial, like something like 'I Wanna Be the Guy.'  Every time you die, it was your fault and you could have avoided it if you were better.

I understand that you have to react to them fast, but until you get really good at dodging those on a dime you'll die to them a *Iot.*  That's the only moment in the difficulty curve I found too steep and a little artificial - it can get frustrating to die over and over to the same damn bombs, but you get used to the twitch nature eventually.\n\nAll in all, a 9.5/10 game for me.", "timestamp_created": 1458791062, "timestamp_updated": 1458791062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22002902": {"recommendationid": "22002902", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970640308", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488857411}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game.

Great mechanics, not buggy at all, good tutorial, excellent learning curve capitulating in a super difficult boss. Sounds great, right?\n\nBut here's the thing. The last boss broke from the rest of the game's solid gameplay in a big way. The final boss of AAC is an amalgamation of all the previous bosses, with some significant power-ups. This by itself is great; it gives the player one big challenge to overcome which is also representative of all the smaller challenges that led up to it. The amalgamation takes about 10-15 minutes (don't quote me on that, but the point is it's not an insignificant time investment). This is a common mechanic in video games, and I had a ton of fun with this very challenging level.\n\nThe problem for me came with the fact that following this multi-stage bossfight is yet another, even more challenging level. This, also, by itself, would be fine - but despite giving the player full battery (health) at the beginning of the level, the player gets no checkpoint. With the amalgamated boss fight being a gatekeeper to the hardest level in the game, I became frustrated and gave up trying to beat this game - twice. It's a genuinely unhealthy mechanic, made all the worse by the fact that the game got everything so very right all the way up to that point. \n\nSo my actual ratings:\nIf you don't care to complete games or you're a total masochist who loves to waste time: 10/10\n\nIf you like good games that _don't_ deviate into unnecessarily frustrating game mechanics in order to prevent you from wanting to beat the game: 2/10\n\nI really wanted to see what happened; guess I'll look it up on youtube. =(\n\nPre-edit:\n2/10\n\nthis game would and should have been a 9+/10. but unfortunately the devs decided that the final boss would be 8 super difficult stages (which is fine) with no checkpoints (which is not fine). after about 20 attempts i put the game down for what i thought would be forever. a friend came over and wanted to try about 3-4 months after that, and i had forgotten about the boss and recommended the game highly.\n\nbig surprise, after about another 20 unbelievably frustrating attempts, i'm done with this game forever and writing them a bad review. the devs clearly have a fundamental misunderstanding about what makes challenging games fun. it shouldn't cost me 10 minutes every time i want to _get_ to the hardest challenge in the game. you get full health beforehand anyway, so why no checkpoint? \n\nfrustratingly difficult != fun challenge", "timestamp_created": 1456556669, "timestamp_updated": 1456906260, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469213", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21468063": {"recommendationid": "21468063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010674389", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509049948}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing the game a short amount of time about only 20 hrs and so far all I can think of is praise for this game.

The music is well produced and the voice acting is good. Although it is hard and sometimes frustrating the game is fun to play\n\nThe game can get hard. Assault Android Cactus introduces a battery life system, the battery constantly deplets until it reaches zero, once it reaches zero, you're dead. To regain your battery's life, you have to get battery life and it increases your battery life. However, the game can get frustrating when there are a lot of enemies and the power up lands right in front of them and you die because you didn't manage to get it in time. The battery life system is clever but can get annoying immediately\n\nThe game's main story is short, clocking in at around 3-4 hours. It is extremely short however the game does offer infinite waves, daily waves and once you've completed the game's story, a boss rush where constant bosses spawn. Plus, you can modify the game with EX mode. EX mode offers you to play in first person and other such modifiers\n\nAssault Android Cactus is a fun game, hard but fun. The game's short length might turn some people away. Thankfully, there is a demo for you to try out before buying the game\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1455914722, "timestamp_updated": 1455914722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21297048": {"recommendationid": "21297048", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996597573", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490459612}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Jogo absolutamente maravilhoso para fans de shmups ou semelhantes!\nEdit: Quanto mais jogo, mais gosto! :) Isto \u00e9 uma mistura de bullet hell com area shooter! :D", "timestamp_created": 1455807108, "timestamp_updated": 1455882336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21277743": {"recommendationid": "21277743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000046933", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489254230}, "language": "english", "review": "Great twin stick bullet hell with an awesome soundtrack!\n\nMust buy for anyone that likes that kind of gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1455728262, "timestamp_updated": 1455728262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21271787": {"recommendationid": "21271787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010551145", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464626548}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun until Liqorice battle which is completely RNG + terrible camera.

The devs are called \"Witch Beam\", which should be kind of telling.\n\nDon't be fooled by the twin stick control setup, this game is definitely a bullet hell title. AAC is very arcadey in style, putting heavy emphasis on scoring via chaining enemy kills consecutively while not getting hit too much, much like a proper bullet hell game. However, it also features roguelike-style dailies and an endless score run mode.\n\nThe game's art style and dialogue are very tongue-in-cheek. Kind of like if Sonic Adventure grew up and realized how cheesy it was, then ran with it. The playable characters are all likeable in their own way, spouting one-liners while mowing down hordes of rogue AI. Each of the 9 heroes has a unique playstyle, posessing a unique primary and special weapon. Also, if it matters to you, despite the all-female playable cast, none of the characters are even remotely sexualized.\n\nReally charming and fun game, but if you're into games for the story, don't look here.

example for the whole genre with its energizing gameplay and fluid mechanics.\n\nInitially, the character selection is limited to four Androids, with more to be unlocked as you make your way through the 25 stages spanned throught 5 unique chapters that fill up the story campaign. As you progress through the game you unlock more and more playable Androids, taking it to total of nine. All nine of them are incredibly diverse in how they work and play. \n\nEach character comes with a primary and secondary attack, both unique across all characters. Primary attack will trully be your main source of engaging combat, as it has no cooldown or any limit of using in rapid succession. Using secondary attacks cannot be abused, as there is a cooldown after usage. The dodge is extremely important to the game\u2019s mechanic if you want to stay alive and keep them high scores comming.\n\nLevels are constructed to keep a constant flow of action and intensity. Good for us that the controls are very responsive, as dodging becomes almost an art in evading constant danger, while using swift reactions to stay away from danger. Lives are non-existent here, meaning death is only a handicap that drops the android to the ground for a few seconds, while removing any power up or primary weapon buff gained from energy orbs dropped from the defeated. Tapping the fire trigger brings the android back on their feet ready to battle on.\n\nInstead, life is represented by a battery bar that drains over the course of play. If it empties, the level is a failure, and the only way to stop this is by collecting batteries caches that drop somewhat randomly after you blast decent amound of those evil robots. Don\u2019t think this makes the game easy, as dying constantly will prevent you from killing enough machines to generate the next battery. The whole battery system is very well thought-out and intuitive idea by any standard.\n\nAssault Android Cactus requires the player to be alert most of the time. That said, I still think that that the game as a whole is a stress-free and fairly easy experience (campaing wise that is, as there are some extra and bonus modes that will really test your skills and reactions). Getting a S+ rank in any stage is another story. Requirements are quite brutal, as you must not let your combo streak end, you must not get hit more than a few times and your battery must not deplete. Good luck with that.\n\nOverall, Assault Android Cactus is a slick game that feels so good to play with its satisfying controls, fluid game mechanics, some really terrific levels and diverse combat styles. \n\n[i]Disclaimer: Key was provided by developer for testing the game and for review purposes only[/i]\n\n[url=https://pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com/2016/02/07/review-assault-android-cactus/]FULL REVIEW[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1454854386, "timestamp_updated": 1454854386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693013", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20920577": {"recommendationid": "20920577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112489000", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504346350}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun, faced paced, and addicting.

The reason I bring those games up is because the twin stick shooter genre is one of the oldest there is, and somehow a little indie developer named Witch Beam has made a title that is one of the best in it's class... now onto the game.\n\nAssault Android Cactus is a hybrid of sorts. \n\nIt's mostly a twin stick shooter, but there's a bit of bullet hell in it's DNA. The first few levels are fairly easy, as you progress the game gets harder, as more enemies appear on screen AAC becomes more of a bullet hell, and you have to make smart use of the invincibility you receive when you switch weapons.\n\nThere's 8 playable characters, each \"Android\" has a unique primary and secondary weapon, and a bit of personality. All 8 play pretty different, and i'm sure you'll find at least one or two that fit your playing style. Witch Beam actually put a story with voice acting and cutscenes, something you rarely see in this genre. It's not the best story ever told but it has a lot of charm and style, and is a nice bonus.\n\nOnly real complaint I have is the last boss. Maybe i'm just terrible, but the last boss seems far more difficult than the rest of the game, and to this day I can only seem to beat it with a particular character, and only that one. But maybe i'm just doing it wrong, i'm not sure. Other than that, the game is excellent, looks and plays beautifully and I can see me returning in the following months even though I've finished AAC and play some more of the endless mode.", "timestamp_created": 1453081236, "timestamp_updated": 1453081236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20592542": {"recommendationid": "20592542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126989495", "num_games_owned": 657, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453330858}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tanto el coop como el single player es divertido, los niveles son interesantes, los jefes desafiantes y tiene varios personajes diferentes.

I enjoy the game, but can't recommend it.\n\n-I game on a craptop. When it was in early access and I only had the demo to play, Cactus was one of those shining gems that ran beautifully, seemingly without sacrifice. When the demo was updated for the full release, the graphics went to piss, probably as a final compression render to make sure they continue to run smoothly. This is a minor gripe compared to what comes next.\n\n-Acheiving +S rank in the demo was a satisfying challenge. Shootdodge, a great shootemup experience. This was not reflected in the full release at all, on multiple levels. \n[list]\n[*]The difficulty spike is un-fun. You will reach a point where you are swarmed with robots, small, large and in between, that you were not prepared to even think about. This game will not appeal to the casual shmup player, as the spike is more severe than Nuclear Throne's. Im sure there are already extreme hardcore cactus players because Ive seen the leaderboards, and Im sure they'll try to disagree, but the fact is Cactus is the type of shmup where you will need to fail a level over, and over, and over, just to study the wave patterns in preparation.\n[*]Combine that with many enemies that tend to blend in to the floor and you have a recepie for multiple downs every level until you've studied it like you're preparing to take the BAR exam.\n[/list]\n-Make sure you don't forget grabby corners. You will get stuck on them. It's infuriating. Helo, Aubergine's weapon, get's stuck on geometry as well.\n-Hitscan on some of the weapons can be very bad. [spoiler]Peanut.[/spoiler]\n-Physics on most of the weapons will stop you from playing with a controller. E.G. Coral's shotgun, Lemons Scattershot. Corals shotgun no longer shoots in an even spread, making her essentially a non-damaging character. The recoil of Lemons Scattershot causes it to wobble, preventing you from focusing damage.\n\n[h1]Don't get me wrong, I still mildly enjoy the game. I will definitely enjoy it more if some broken things are fixed though.[/h1]\n-The bosses are pretty good, challenging but capable of being defeated reasonably, with the exception of [spoiler]Liqourice, who sends an army of robots at you before you fight her[/spoiler].\n-Each character has different diagloue to every boss. [spoiler]Again, Liquorice, that bitch, breaks the 4th wall in a way that can be taken good or bad[/spoiler]\n-Apart from some enemies being the same color as the floor, causing them to blend, the art design is really nice.\n\nTL:TR [h1]I bought this game because it was fun in the early game/demo.

Gameplay variety is mostly provided by playable characters (you unlock them progressing through story): nine different cute androids. Each android has two weapons: everyday gun and something special and powerful, but with a cooldown. Weapons and specials are very different (seekers, laser, railgun, shotgun, etc.) and you must change your playstyle depending on it.\n\nGameplay: fast, furious and aggressive. Don\u2019t think, don\u2019t plan \u2014 see, react, destroy. Your battery's running low. You\u2019re surrounded. Break through. Don\u2019t get hit. Get wings pickup.

Assault Android Cactus is undoubtedly one of my favorite games ever made, and I don't say this lightly. It's weird to say, but I don't really compare this game to other twin-stick shooters. I compare it to Devil May Cry 3. Because this is exactly how it feels to me (except, it has better controls).\nIt is action sequence after action sequence with witty commentaries of loveable characters who go through a cheesy, yet interesting story, while listening to absolutely fantastic music. All of this makes you forget your troubles and ultimately, I think this is what games are for.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of twin-stick shooters or bullet hell games. To be honest, I'm just bad at them. They are so bright, everything always explodes and shoots at you from all directions, I just get lost, don't know if I should watch my aim or my character, it's all very overwhelming. And sure, there's that element in Cactus as well, after all, there are tons of enemies and bullets and it is a fast-paced game. But it feels more structured. I rarely feel lost, the difficulty curve is very nice, so you have some time to get used to things before they kill you brutally AND when they do, there's still chance for recovery.\nI would say that in regards of difficulty, Cactus is on a more casual side of the genre, but that's not to say it's easy. It's just a little more forgiving. Casual players like me will find sufficient challenge while moving through the story, whereas more hardcore fans of the genre will find themselves fighting against timer and trying to maintain combo meter to get the highest scores possible (which is lost upon death, unlike the level progress).\n\nThe explosions, bullets, lasers, fire, spikes, environment destruction etc., etc., are so nicely tuned that you never think \"oh god, please, spare my eyes!\". It's all greatly balanced, so you can see everything that's going against you clearly, enjoy the beautiful graphics this game has and not feel like your eyes have been violated after a couple hours of playing.\n\nOne of the reasons I generally can't get into bullet hell games, aside from difficulty, is lack of interesting story or characters. Which is not to say there aren't exceptions, but still, they are generally heavily gameplay focused, so the rest is secondary.\nCactus fixes this problem. Every character has unique personality, which is reflected in the story and dialogues (they all have unique encounters with bosses), and, which is even more impressive, in their animations - their victory poses, their selection screen when you pick a character or cancel selection, with some of them feeling scared, pumped-up or disappointed. And the unique commentaries a certain character provides are priceless (like, calling \"speed up\" boost \"pretty wings\" for example). I never expected to love characters in a game like this as much as I do. You can easily see that they weren't an afterthought, but are as much of a game's focus as the gameplay itself. And the aforementioned unique boss dialogues add replayability if you want to see every character's interractions.\n\nAnd of course, one of the main reasons this game is such a blast in my opinion... the music. The soundtrack is phenomenal. I very rarely buy soundtracks for games. Or even pay attention to it. The only exceptions I can think of from the top of my head are Persona series, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Sentinels of the Multiverse and... well... Assault Android Cactus. That's it, I believe.\nI'm not sure if the music dynamically changes during the level or it's just written so that it feels this way, but it always, and I do mean ALWAYS fits what you see on screen, becoming faster and more aggressive as the action intensifies. It helps you get into the rhythm of the action so well that sometimes it starts to feel that you are playing a rhythm game. This flow of the music during levels, along with the pumped-up feeling it fills you with are probably the most important reason why I love this game as much as I do.\n\nThat said, this game is not without its flaws... for once, it's one of the dumbest game names I've ever heard.\n...\n...\n...\nJust kidding, it's awesome. Or rather, it is so stupid that it is amazing. If it wasn't for the name I may have overlooked the game entirely. But no, I just thought \"WTF? What kind of name is \"Assault Android Cactus\"? I just NEED to click it and see what's up with it\". And then after you play the game it actually makes sense and doesn't even sound stupid anymore.\n\nBut on a more serious note, I actually do feel like this game has at least one flaw. And it lies in its achievements. I can't say that I'm a kind of person that absolutely MUST get 100% achievements in every game he plays. But that's what I strive to do with the games I absolutely love. And, as you may have noticed, I do love Cactus.\nSo, what's the problem with the achievements? It's the requirement to get \"S+\" (which is the best rank possible) on all levels. And here's the thing, to get \"S+\", you must be perfect. Literally, perfect. Not dying, not losing your combo even once, basically not being hit. And between this requirement and me being mostly a casual player, it's just driving me insane. And don't get me wrong, striving to get better in a game you love is amazing. Getting an \"S\" rank is a joy for me. It usually happens when you have a blast with your favorite character and it's when the game is at it's best. Getting S+ is more of a... \"Was it even worth it? I'm not even having fun anymore...\" situation. At least for me.\nAnd then there's luck factor, like, when you have that \"S+\" ready for the grab, and there's just one enemy left, and you just don't run to him in time because he's on the other end of the map... \"fun\" is not the word I'd choose for this situation.\nBut of course, achievements are such an insignificant thing that it's honestly just a minor complaint. And it is a reward for better players out there to grab. However, if you are a player who just NEEDS to have that 100% achievement in their game, get ready for quite a bit of pain.\n\nSo, to end this review, I want to once again mention one simple thing. When I was in college, Devil May Cry 3 with its endless mode used to be my go-to antidepressant. I knew that if I felt down or angry I could turn it on and just slash some demons, while slashing my troubles away with them. Now, Assault Android Cactus took that niche. Whenever I feel bad, this game with its colorful characters, action-packed gameplay and lively soundtrack is here to cheer me up.\nAnd I truly hope that you give it a chance as well. It is absolutely worth it. Especially considering it's low price. Compared to the amount of emotions I personally got out of this game, it's just nothing.\n\nAssault Android Cactus deserves far more recognition than it currently has. \n\nIt is hands down one of the best games I have ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1449208214, "timestamp_updated": 1502804486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19432069": {"recommendationid": "19432069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060527161", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499321866}, "language": "english", "review": "It's frenetic bot destruction. \n\nIn Assault Android Cactus, you get to channel the devastating power of nine forceful femme fatales whose combined firepower could easily destroy the very ship they were standing on, if game-world physics allowed such a feat. Their goals: to crush the robot rebellion, defeat the Sector Lords, and to prevent greater loss of life aboard the [i]Gemini Star[/i]. \nBut mostly to crush the robot rebellion.\n\nYou're given three weapons with which to fight the coming menace: Speed, firepower, and a brilliant dodging mechanic that will doubtlessly save your life on many occasions, provided you have the presence of mind to use it amidst the chaos induced by a thousand rotating bullets. \nAs to your armaments, each android is equipped with one main weapon and one rechargeable secondary weapon, whose cooldown ensures that you can't spam black holes and macross missiles across every inch of the stage. Switching between them doubles as the dodging mechanic, so wise use of your secondary weapon is necessary to ensure you'll be able to dodge a bullet when you need to most.\nAnd trust me, you will need to. A lot.\n\nThe game starts off slow and easy to let the players accommodate to new controls, and difficulty builds in a fairly linear curve with short spikes representing the boss battles at the end of every layer of the ship. \nThe score system is based on how quickly you completed the mission, how many robots you destroyed and powerups you collected, and how many times you ran out of life (more on that later.) It is accompanied by a combo system in which each enemy you destroy adds to the combo counter and increases a score multiplier, and if you go more than two seconds without destroying another bot, the counter resets.\nDuring your first mission you'll be lucky to get a chain of more than 50, but by the end of layer two, you'll easily be pulling out combo chains of 200 or more. This is in part because the game teaches you how to play it intuitively, and in part because enemies will become greatly more numerous \u2013 being surrounded is a common circumstance in this game, and the sooner you learn how to weave through the besieging bedlam, the more likely you will be to survive each successive battle. \n\nIn this game, your battery is what keeps you alive. You have a health meter, sure, but it's no big deal if it runs out. A second or two to catch her breath and your android is up and kicking again, albeit without her upgrades and powerups. But once the battery runs out, it's game over. The only way to prevent your battery from running low is to find another amidst the flaming wreckages of your erstwhile opponents. And as a result of this design choice, the battery will almost always be in the middle of a swarm of other angry, smashy robots ready and waiting to annihilate you. What's an android to do?\nDestroy them all and take the battery, of course!\n\nSo when the screen begins to flash and you hear the droning THUM, THUM of the low-battery alarm, your first instinct isn't to hide behind a barricade and hope it all goes away while your health regenerates. No, your first instinct is to scream \"LET THERE BE NO HOPE FOR THE MORROW,\" and to blitz head-first into the enemy lines with the goal of taking as many with you as possible in a final blaze of glory - and, you hope, with the chance of finding that next elusive battery, and using it to replenish your ever-depleting life.\n(In developer terms, this is called \"Badassery as a Game Mechanic,\" and it works just as beautifully as it sounds.)\n\nIt is simultaneously necessary to avoid taking damage while doing so, because recovering from a 'death' takes more battery than merely staying alive, and once the alarm begins to sound, you no longer have the luxury to afford that time. \n\nWith so many bots encircling you, it might seem like your chances are dim. They're not. You'll quickly learn to spin, dodge, and blast your way through every wave of enemies you encounter, and each time you do, you'll quickly find yourself surrounded again. It's a chaotic frenzy of robot destruction in which you are the sole star, and it's easy to find yourself getting lost in the blaze.\nThen you look over to the combo counter and see that it's climbed well past 1,000.\nNot 1000 hits. 1000 robots. And in the zen-like state of robot eradication this game induces, your only response will be, \n\"Cool. Now let's go higher.\"\n\nThe FPS count on games this frantic usually dips into the twenties, or even mid-teens when they look as good as Cactus does. Strangely, however, I experienced no performance difficulties on this game whatsoever. The options menu has an FPS lock automatically set to 60, and though I am not as attuned to these things as some, I never noticed a dip in frame rate during the entire time I played. \nThis is stunning, not only because the game is chaotic, but because it's downright beautiful. I very seldom judge games based on their graphical quality, but Assault Android Cactus might be one of the prettiest games in my library, and not for lack of competition.\n\nTo replayability, each of the nine androids uses weapons unique to her and has a playstyle distinct from (though often similar to) any of the others, and each has her own dialogue when taking on the Sector Lords. There is also an entire category of EX Options to unlock that can further alter gameplay by providing AI companions, changing the camera to a first-person or iso-dimensional viewpoint, applying various visual effects and even providing the androids with a new, even more powerful secondary weapon in the same vein as their primary. \nMy favorite among these options is the ability to up the number of enemies to levels that would normally only spawn with 2 or more players, as this can increase the action dramatically and I'm always in wont of a challenge.\nIt's almost as if this game was made for me - but in fact, it was made for every fan of twin-stick shooters. I personally recommend using a controller with this game (though the keyboard and mouse work perfectly fine in their own right,) and would even go so far as to say that this game alone would make that purchase worth the buy.\n\nI strongly recommend Assault Android Cactus.", "timestamp_created": 1449041937, "timestamp_updated": 1508905085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502820", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19421378": {"recommendationid": "19421378", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963643853", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470443848}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome !!!

At first it seems like it might be simple or easy, and the story doesn't set itself as being too extensive. However once you get past the tutorial you quickly realise how frantic and fast paced it is.\n\nThis is SMASH TV meets Gunstar Heroes. It's an isometric twin stick shooter filled with frantic hordes of enemies that push you harder and harder to keep them back. The weapon variety between the different androids you chose definitley makes every one of them feel unique and fun to play as, and the switching from primary to secondary and the pickups you get ads to the game. The weapon's attack style is what reminds me a bit of Gunstar Heroes, although you don't necessarily pick and stack your weapons like the legendary game.\n\n*Additional edit* I've since beaten the whole game but just can't put it down. Each level is really well designed and vary from one another that they don't feel the same and add a uniqueness to run through, and the daily challenge and infinite drive makes this a great game for SHMUP fans. I try to be as honest as I can and not let the key being given by request affect my critical interpretation, but this game is great and fun.\n\nYou can do up to four player coop, and in addition to the story mode there's two varieties of infinite mode to add more variety to the plate.\n\nThe only negative I can really give is the coop is local only. I love local coop and appreciate having this option, but for $15 I really feel like it should have online coop too. Still,  with everything you get in the game itself I feel that the $15 is justifiable despite that.\n\nOtherwise this is a really fun and fast paced twin stick shmup!", "timestamp_created": 1447964508, "timestamp_updated": 1449029383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540364", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19143736": {"recommendationid": "19143736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075800877", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411424848}, "language": "french", "review": "Quand une \u00e9quipe r\u00e9duite r\u00e9alise un grand jeu.", "timestamp_created": 1447851889, "timestamp_updated": 1447851889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19142052": {"recommendationid": "19142052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019230245", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485856427}, "language": "english", "review": "Assault Android Cactus is freaking sweet.

More or less at any rate. It's a twin stick shooter set in the future starring a bunch of androids trapped on a ship filled with homicidal robots. The titular Cactus is an Assault Android sent to investigate why the ship, the Genki Star, shut down contact with its other vessels, and is the type who prefers to let her trigger finger do the talking.\n\nAs a result, mayhem, explosions, and heavy weapons fire ensues. With a bunch of other surviving androids along for the ride (more unlocked as you progress through the campaign), there is a lot of action to be had, and a lot of beautiful bullet patterns to be avoided/destroy yourself on whilst you (possibly fail to) eliminate your enemies.\n\nAdding to the challenge of dodging and weaving around gorgeous blooming bullet flowers and huge beam lasers and kamikaze mines and rockets and such, you have to not get too close to enemies which usually have some kind of devastating melee attack which they will attempt to hit you with, keep your battery topped up with battery pickups, and evade/make use of the levels' various hazards and traps...\n\nAll of this to a fantastic soundtrack ,and with plenty of EX Options to unlock, which will up the difficulty further if you so wish. Can you S+ rank every level by making sure you never drop your combo and never get knocked down? Can you beat every boss flawlessly before your battery runs out? Can you discover why the robots on board have turned against the humans?\n\nWhilst primarily a single player experience, local co-op exists of up to four players and is purportedly lots of fun (as well it should be). There's also lots of fun things to unlock and even a first person perspective mode if you really want to ramp up the difficulty.

Each character also has a more powerful weapon that can be used to destroy large enemies more quickly but this weapon can only be used on a rechargeable basis.\nEach level is completed while constantly trying to look to recharge your battery which constantly depletes. This means that each level is essentially completed against the clock and death acts as a time delay rather than an all-out game ender. I love this mechanic and think it is the best idea to happen to the shooter or bullet hell genre in recent memory and I hope more developers take this idea on board as it makes death\u2026 something that happens frequently\u2026 into a managed penalty rather than the end criteria.\n\nThe game is extremely accessible to casual players and can be blown through in a couple of hours but achieving high scores can easily become an obsession as you look for the best strategies and best androids to complete each stage.\n\nThe level design is superb with platforms, conveyor belts and rearranging floors making the games level unique and engaging in what could otherwise be a repetitive game. The enemy design is equally as interesting with particular stand out types being the dog type androids who ground you in place and the swarms of insect androids that appear from the destroyed android hives.\n\nThe endgame in AAC sees you push for increasingly higher and high scores to gain better rankings. Gaining an S rank in a level, involves completing it without a single knock-down. S+ involves no knock-downs but also killing every enemy in the level in one long successful chain. This is equivalent to getting perfect in a guitar hero game or never missing a beat.\n\nOverall the game is a joy to play and definitely one of my favourite twin stick shooters of all time. An extremely varied roster and wonderful charming presentation makes this a must buy for fans of the genre.\n\nFor our video review check out the link below: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/151017_game-tutor-grades-assault-android-cactus", "timestamp_created": 1445826854, "timestamp_updated": 1445826854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503597", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18684244": {"recommendationid": "18684244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042076293", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474779350}, "language": "english", "review": "Obviously one of the best games on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1445803726, "timestamp_updated": 1445803726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18682470": {"recommendationid": "18682470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068631221", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480057416}, "language": "german", "review": "PRO / CONTRA\n+ 8 verschiedene Charaktere ...\n+ ... die sich alle unterschiedlich spielen\n+ abwechslungsreiche Levels\n+ Schwer aber niemals unfair\n+ interessante Bossk\u00e4mpfe\n+ guter Soundtrack (selbst Game-Over-Screen)\n+ Freischaltbare Gimmicks\n\n- teils zu hektisch\n- Kampagne zu kurz\n- Abseits der Kampagne nichts zu tun\n- Story nur Ger\u00fcst f\u00fcr Spielfortschritt\n\n7 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1445798139, "timestamp_updated": 1491128109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18677615": {"recommendationid": "18677615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069986443", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457154427}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first shooter in ages that has me glued to my seat.

The closest thing I've played are Touhou games, and I was never that good at them (I think I've only ever beaten a couple in Easy mode). So, as a casual noob to this genre, I have to say Assault Android Cactus was loads of fun, providing challenging but fun gameplay that was smooth as silk and high on adrenaline. The action never stops, thanks to a forgiving health mechanic where you can take a few number of hits before you die, and if your health is low, all you have to do is not get hit for a few (felt like five?) seconds and your heath regens to full. Also, when you switch weapons you get a few frames of invulnerability. This allows you to dive for those power ups and, more importantly, batteries.\n\nThe battery mechanic encourages aggressive gameplay, since your power constantly drains and the only way to get more power is by killing enemies for battery drops. If your power drains to zero, it's game over. This gives you the perfect excuse to go ham on those mobs. Besides batteries, there are three types of power ups that drop. If left on the ground, the power ups change between each of the three types. So if you want a specific power up that isn't currently on the ground, you can run around killing mobs until the power up changes to what you want (it feels like five seconds or so between each change). This becomes an interesting tactic as you balance killing high priority mobs with power up timings, taking into account how many seconds it takes to run to that mob, kill it, and run back in time so the power up has changed to the one you want.\n\nThere are nine playable androids (four to start, the others unlocked as you go), each with their own unique primary and secondary weapons. All of them are a joy to play, though I found myself gravitating towards three or so favorites. The story is light and fun spirited. It's easy to get behind the androids even with the dearth of character development, simply due to how cute and enthusiastic they are. The campaign took me about 5 to 6 hours to complete, including all the fails and retries for some of the harder levels (the final boss was the hardest, taking me about 15 attempts to beat). But, as I said earlier, I'm a complete noob to this genre, so it will probably take you less time. I personally found the difficulty level to be that sweet spot of challenging but still enjoyable. Some of the bosses have bullet patterns that resemble Touhou games, but with maybe half the bullet density.\n\nThere is a decent amount of replayability to be found in the Infinity Drive game mode, as well as trying to beat your high score on the campaign levels. The gameplay is slick, the soundtrack is amazing, and the level design is beautiful-- all this, along with the ability to choose between nine different androids, makes replaying levels a blast. That feeling when you S+ a level is quite satisfying as well. \n\nAs someone who is not really into these types of games, I really enjoyed AAC. The gameplay is smooth and addicting, the sound and level design are top notch, the characters are lovable, and the difficulty level is just perfect in my experience.

A few flaws (some a little more subjective than others, I'll admit) hold it back:\n* The camera. It's set up to keep your character centered on the screen or, if in a group (I tested it with AI teammates) to keep all players on the screen. This means that the edges of the arena are sometimes hidden. This is especially prevalent in co-op, where I often found myself attacked by enemies I could not see.\n\n* The battery. This one may be a strength, depending on how difficult you want the experience. In addition to having to master a character's play style and learn boss patterns to beat the game, you're also on a very tight timer in the way of your battery. Killing enough enemies or clearing a phase of a boss fight drops a powerup to refill the battery somewhat, but it's still a very tight time limit. If you miss a single powerup (which is plausible, considering how fragile the characters can be), you will lose, guaranteed.\n\n* Lack of difficulty options. As I hope I've made clear, this game is hard. Very hard. I will admit that I'm not all that good at action games, so I prefer playing on a lower difficulty so I can enjoy the game without putting too much strain on my heart. AAC has a campaign mode, an Infinite mode (apparently a survival mode, judging by the description) and a 'daily' mode that I also didn't look into. The point is, the campaign mode has a single difficulty. Personally, I'd have rather it had a standard easy/normal/hard set, with easy being detrimental (or disabling) your score.\n\n* The Ex Options. This isn't a flaw, just a related observation to the last point. You earn credits by playing the game that can be used to unlock options. These include adjusting the characters to human proportions, unlocking AI teammates or two options I'd like to mention in detail:\n\nFirst, the ability to play a co-op game solo, meaning more enemies with more health. Effectively a hard mode, I suppose, which may appear to conflict with my previous statement about difficulties. The idea of unlocking a harder challenge sound like a good inclusion to me, since it means a player unlocking the option is confident in their ability. It seems more emotionally rewarding, at least to me. But it adds context to my next point:\n\nSecond, the ability to toggle on stronger weapons. This sounds a bit like an easy mode (and in fact, a friend suggested it to me specifically when I mentioned being stuck), except the option costs 5000 credits, versus the 1000 most other options (including AI co-op) cost. It also disables your score. To me, that feels like paying twice. First I have to grind for credits (since I'm only getting double digit rewards from each stage) just to afford it, and then I'm barred from the leader board. The AI co-op option also locks you out of scoring, but only costs 1000 credits.\n\nThough considering I care very little about high scores, personally, this doesn't bother me. I'm just a little confused about why it's implemented that way.\n\nSo to sum up my thoughts: I love the game. Genuinely adore it. But I'm a filthy casual and would love it more if it had an easy mode.\n\n\nOn a side note, I had difficulty playing with a controller due to it being very hard to aim with the right stick. A slight movement would have my character firing in a completely different direction. So I swapped to keyboard + mouse controls and found it much easier, so my thanks to Witch Beam for including keyboard controls.\n\nI also apologize for the length of the review.

Not much on story, though the bits of it have a bit of humor to them and you can piece together a minor plot based on different dialogue with the bosses depending on which android you are. Gameplay is fast and frentic and generally quite enjoyable. There's a spike in difficulty around the halfway mark, but it doesn't get too ridiculous until the last few stages and especially the final boss of the game. In fact almost the entirety of the final five stages lives up to it's billing as a twin stick meets bullet hell. There's also enough playstyle differences between the characters that multiple playthroughs of stages are encouraged even if you aren't a perfectionist. \n\nWhile I wish the dodge mechanic was a little more fleshed out, I do like how well the simplicity flows in the game. Graphics are vibrant and colorful (there's an option to make their heads normal sized if that bothers you) and a number of filter options for those less rainbow vomit inclined. My only complaint with the graphics is some early areas are a bit barren and so they look straight out of the PS2 era with bland backgrounds and no enemy fire to distract you. Later the backgrounds get a bit more unique and the sheer amount that's happening will take up your attention. \n\nSoundtrack is kick ass and usually works with the action very well, especially the boss stages. \n\nIf you enjoy arcade-style twin stick shooters or modern updates like Geometry Wars, yes this game is worth picking up. If you're on the fence about that style of game or have never played on before, wait for a steam sale or something and pick it up.

While some of these characters are available from the very start of the game, others must be unlocked by playing through the game's story mode, and each of them brings its own unique playstyle to the table.\n\nWhile the story mode can be completed within a few hours, the real allure of the game lies in its high score system. I can't remember the last time a game has successfully motivated me to try scoring for an S+ rank on every single stage, but AAC is so masterfully designed, that I didn't mind playing a stage over and over again until I had achieved a perfect score. No matter how often I had to restart a stage, the gameplay just always felt great and when I had finally managed to reach an S+ ranking, the sense of satisfaction was simply overwhelming. And even after reaching a perfect score on a stage, I would just replay it again later with a different character, to see whether I could reach another S+ with a completely different weapon layout. (A quick note for all Gurren Lagann fans: One of the characters even carries a giant drill into battle that you can use to pierce your enemies as well as the heavens ;))\n\nI could probably go on and on about how much I love this game, but I'm afraid eventually you readers would lose all interest in my ramblings, so tl;dr:\n\nGreat game, best twin stick shooter I've played in years, I want more of it.", "timestamp_created": 1444759177, "timestamp_updated": 1444766829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18457079": {"recommendationid": "18457079", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971797316", "num_games_owned": 2176, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 9756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514472820}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a game that is so much game that you want to game.

Having put in a few hours and done all the modes I have to say I like this game. One of its shining aspects is how differently the characters play, it's almost like a different game with each of them. The overall simplicity and straightforwardness of the goals and ideas is refreshing in an era of stagnant game play focusing on illusions of free will and choices mattering. Here the choices come down to, character, stage, and method. And unlike other games, choices here make a direct difference :P Either way I have found myself really quite enjoying this game and have done really well on some daily challenges and some levels. There is some character inbalance, for example Startch is mindlessly easy to play and is very easy to rack up insane scores on while, Aubergine takes a great deal of focus to do half as good as swigning your second stick around randomly with Starch. The level designs are interesting if simplistic. There is one near the end of the game where the floor is constantly being made and unmade under your feet; this is an amazing level. The boss fights are a lot of fun, I found some of them frustrating, until I simply gave up and owned them with Startch. There is a silly story line that is kind of irrelevant in the enjoyment of this game.\n\nOverall the game looks good and plays nicely.

First person mode in a bullet-hell is something im looking forward to..... in a kinda Masohcistic way...\n\nit runs pretty well on my computer and even on my crappy really old worn down useless laptop for that matter before it hit the point it cant run ANYTHING and thats saying something. back when this ran on my laptop you'd have better chances getting a flash game to work on a calculator in most cases. \n\nthe graphics and artstyle are nice and while not superhyperrealiticultraperfect levels most people dream for they dont need to be as the graphics look good as they feel styled. i feel it will likley age well because of that. i've played plenty of old games that still look good today because they took a style to their graphics and went with it instead of trying to look realistic. this is a game i feel will be able to pull that off. \n\nas many people have said before the one thing that would make this game one of the best things ever is easily an online multiplayer. co-op modes for this game would do it a world of good and the level where the boss has android health even implies you could have some rather fun competative modes too. however even without those this game holds up on its own but that would of been the icing on the cake for me and im sure plenty of other people would agree.\nIm not sure what the Devs of this game have planned but i'd like to maby see more of this game and maybe some DLC or expansions. the story and ending works well to say you could easily have more stories and levels and so on and i'd love to see more and learn more about this world and the characters in the game.\n\nOverall i HIGHLY reccomend this game. it is well worth a look even if you aren't so much a fan of the type of game it is. i usually dont go for twinsticks or bullet-hells and i love this gamenevertheless. \nIt was good back in its early stages and it has easily improved alot since then to even greater levels. \n\nNow thats enough typing.... i have some S+ ranks to go get...", "timestamp_created": 1444478006, "timestamp_updated": 1444478006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18407644": {"recommendationid": "18407644", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971143071", "num_games_owned": 760, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489277858}, "language": "french", "review": "Si les graphismes ne cassent pas trois briques, la DA est mignonne.

Overall the difficulty is not too tough if you just want to beat it, while still being quite challenging if you want to push yourself to do well. The way your health works gives a bit of leeway but not so much that the game feels too easy.\n[*]The enemy variety is quite nice. A good number of different types without going overboard and becoming overly contrived. The bosses are interesting and their patterns are complicated enough that you spend a bit of time learning them.\n[*]The character variety is great. Each character is well thought out and has two weapons which complement each other or interact in interesting ways that are fun to figure out. This gives them each a unique feel and approach to mowing down the hordes of enemies.\n[*]The levels are interesting and varied, especially the later ones, and there aren't so many that they become samey. Replayability comes more from getting the levels done well and going for a high score, or from re-playing with a different character.\n[*]The heat gauge and two weapon system works well and has a good amount of hidden depth, especially since it is tied to the dodge. The game gives you lots of options to kill enemies fast including power-ups (which feel noticably powerful), your secondary weapon and charging up your primary weapon.\n[*]Even though the game punishes you for messing up, it also gives you the tools to get things back on track again. And on the other hand when you don't mess up and get a good chain going it feels awesome.\n[*]The characters and lore are interesting but not too in-your-face. There's just enough to get you invested in the game world, but you can also skip right past it if you're not interested. I admittedly don't really like the big heads of the characters and am glad there is an unlockable option to make their heads normal-sized.\n[*]Probably most importantly, the game feels really smooth to play and there is a satisfyingly large number of enemies to kill. Playing a level well is also really satisfying.\n[*]The music is absolutely amazing.\n[/list]\n\n[b]tl;dr[/b] If you like this sort of game give the demo a go.

If you like explosions, missiles, lasers, and more explosions this is a love letter to you. AAC is an amazing twin sticker shooter that just does everything right. The controls are tight, the graphics pop and dazzle, the soundtrack is enjoyable and never gets dull or lost in the background of explosions. The gameplay itself is fast, fun, and addictive, having that \"Must play one more time\" mentality. As you begin to unlock more characters and defeat bosses, you essentially unlock new play styles for you to try out. Each of the nine characters has their own distinctive weaponry that changes the way you approach enemies and situations. One character can generate black holes while another drops deadly land mines. It's this dynamic shift in combat and abilities that makes picking new characters refreshing and enjoyable. While AAC story isn't necessarily the focus, the game does have plenty of charm and style. Each of the nine androids is adorable and comes with their own dialogue and bios. I shouldn't forget to mention the game also features Co-op for up to 4 players, so bring your buddies along and blow some shyt up! On TOP of all that is unlockable content and different game modes to keep your appetite wet.

Assault Android Cactus is quite the score based twin stick arena shooter.  The game also supports mouse and keyboard.  I've tried both controller and keyboard and each method of control is more than precise enough for this genre.   \n\nMultiple characters are available, four initially and five unlock-able, each with different load outs and each requiring their own strategy for you to perfect, and I do mean perfect.  Every little detail in Assault Android Cactus has been methodically thought out and implemented by the veteran developers and it is up to the player to not only play but observe and learn the characters and arenas in order to maximize scores.  The Austrailian developer team's lineage has roots in Midway, Electronic Arts, Sega and Professional Gaming Leagues.\n\nThe ranking system is of the D to S / S+ variety.  In AAC, to maximize scores, it is not only about dispatching enemies as quickly as possible but how you dispatch them.  Maintaining chains is paramount.  Strategy is important and seeing players with 100+ hours in the game speaks volumes of depth and replay-ability.   \n\nAAC features a battery mechanic, essentially an energy charging pickup that prevents death.  In simple terms, your battery runs out and it's the scrap heap for you.  Hits alone will not explicitly kill you but will make your demise imminent if you accrue too many.  The player character has a limited number of recharging hit points of which a count of zero will render the player incapacitated requiring resuscitation by mashing the fire button.   When rendered incapacitated you will lose some of the energy pellets you've been accumulating to power level your weapons resulting in a powered down weapon and ruining any chance for leader board supremacy.  \n\nThe game spawns not only batteries but a power-up, one of three types.  Speed, companion orbs to accelerate weapon discharge and stasis.   Not all types are optimal for every situation or every character in every arena.  The three types will rotate in place until the type you desire is picked up. \n\nAAC features a twenty five stage campaign encompassing five themed levels made of five arenas with difficulty increasing with progression.  AAC is high intensity, very challenging and will require a degree of dedication in order to maximize efficiency.  Arenas may contain environmental obstacles and will on occasion morph.   Each of the themed levels is capped with a very challenging boss battle.  Boss battles are typically multi layered and require advanced pattern recognition.  In addition to the campaign, there are additional modes such as survival, daily and local coop with up to four players.  Coop games are also recorded on the leader-boards.    Locally, game pads and mouse / keyboard combinations may be mixed on the same computer.\n\nI mentioned Geometry Wars.   The spawns in the AAC, both battery and power-ups are designed to encourage aggressive game-play.  Having played my share of Geometry Wars, obsessively battling for score dominance with a lovely friend of mine, I'm reminded of a similar design.  Baiting the player to take risks to maximize scores but yet encourage mastery by rewarding success with ascension up the leader boards.   From experience in both games you might think that you've achieved your score goal only to stare in disbelief at the final total.

I usually am not a huge fan of the twin stick shooter genre because frankly I am usually not very good at them. The main reason I am terrible at these games is that I have a hard time avoiding enemies when there is a bunch of things happening on the screen at one time.\n\nTherefore I really liked the idea behind the battery power. In Assault Android Cactus you don't die when your lose all of your health. Instead you are stunned. You need to make sure that your android doesn't run out of battery power though. In order to recharge your batteries you need to kill enough enemies in order to have one drop a battery powerup. I liked that Assault Android Cactus allowed you to focus on killing enemies instead of spending all your time trying to avoid enemy projectiles. \n\nThe only major issues I had with the game was the length and difficulty. The main storyline only takes four to five hours to complete. Outside of the bosses the game is quite easy and you will rarely die. \n\nIf you hate twin stick shooters you won't like Assault Android Cactus.

Boss fights are top notch and unique all around and NEVER boring. Bullet patterns feel fantastic to move around and really give you and empowering feeling when you make it through a wave of them without getting touched. Getting strategies down to complete stages or beat bosses just feel so good and really gets you pumped up to tackle on the next obstacle. I had to pull myself away from the games after wanting to push forward to complete more areas. \n\nThe biggest part about this game that makes it so amazing for me are the stages and how they are laid out and even dynamically change during gameplay. It stage transformations happen so smoothly and look so beautifully that sometimes you loose yourself to it and forget that you have bullets flying in all directions. Who ever the stage designers were for this game deserve some sort of award. They are that amazing to watch. \n\nOne thing that I found to be relieving is how fast the load times are for restarting stages when you know you are trying to make it through without getting hit or getting knocked out. It's so quick. Even boss fights with dialogue at the beginning are skipped when restarting the boss fight. I just wish more games like this would implement this system. It really helps with getting practice in certain areas without wasting time.\n\n It has a very genuine arcade feel to it. You can really feel the passion that this team put into creating this game.  The game seems like it will run buttery smooth on most modern systems out there for those that are hesitant on picking this up on lower end hardware. The game really seems like it was focused with 1 player in mind due to how the difficulty and bullet patterns are. So the game not having online multiplayer really isn't that big of a deal. I would welcome it for other modes in the game where a extra set hands would definitely help. But personally, I feel like play the campaign of the game with 2 people would really take away from the feeling you would by taking each stage on yourself. \n\nAll in all this is one game that should be in every STG and Twin Stick Shooter fan's library of games.

You have a battery meter that will slowly decrease, but can be recharged with battery drops from the said baddies. This isn't anything to worry about unless you're taking a lot of hits - this is a bullet hell game at its core - when you take too many hits you can become stunned, and this is when the battery meter can become an issue. It's all about time management, and getting stunned saps at it. But even after bouts of badluck and poor play, things have rarely felt completely hopeless. Come backs feel like a real thing if you up your game. There are also powerups that drop and you primary weapon progressively gets more powerful until being reset when knocked down. \n\nThat's all pretty straight forward. Things get interesting because of the levels you're fighting in. To call them dynamic might be a bit of an understatement. From circular rooms with spinning wheels to square grids that reconstitute at will, things wont get boring anytime soon. \n\nThe boss fights are a blast. Each android feels unique.

The controls are sharp, with both gamepad and mouse / keyboard working just fine (although I personally find using a gamepad much more fun).  There's no ammo or need to reload, meaning you can put out a never-ending barrage of firepower against the constant stream of enemies.  Visual design is superb, with all the robots having distinct looks, making it easy to remember and react to their attack patterns in the middle of the chaos.  Despite the ridiculous number of exploding robots on screen, I never find it overwhelming - everything reads well and the times when you die to something you didn't have a clear warning about are very rare.  The battery system (which is effectively a timer + checkpoint system, with a bit of a twist) keeps the pace up and forces you to be aggressive.\n\nSound design is great too.  Audio cues are easy to pick up on (such as the \"woop woop\" when you reach low health, or the little \"tink\" when your secondary weapon recharges), even while having your face melted off by the soundtrack.\n\nAll the little details feel right - the speed at which the power ups cycle, the range at which you can collect the weapon orb things, the time it takes for the secondary weapons to reacharge - and it all comes together to make a game that is just plain fun.\n\nOn top of all that, the difficulty curve is handled well.  There's a smooth progression from playing just to clear levels, onto playing for S+ ranks (along with a robot voice saying \"S plus!\" that makes you feel special inside), onto playing for pure score on the leaderboards.  There are no real difficulty spikes - by the time you've cleared most of the levels, getting the top rank on the first stage is easy, and from there you can just keep going.\n\nHaving said that, I do have a couple if issues with the game, the only one worth mentioning here is that I don't think it works very well in co-op mode if you have a bit of a skill mismatch.  Due to the battery mechanic, every member of the team needs to contribute to killing robots as fast as possible in order to reach the next battery drop.  If you have a less experienced player who falls behind, it's not like you can wait for them to catch up - the other players need to immediately pick up the slack by killing robots even faster.  While this is possible, it's no fun for the player at the bottom, as they will be constantly dying, having their weapon level lowered, being unable to keep up with the damage, and then dying again.\n\nIn single-player, however, this is a game that I can recommend unequivocally if you have any interest in fast arcade games.", "timestamp_created": 1443101433, "timestamp_updated": 1443101433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760291", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18171879": {"recommendationid": "18171879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045614273", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492190963}, "language": "english", "review": "*Musthave* for twin stick shooter / bullethell fans.\nPerfectly playable with keyboard and mouse.", "timestamp_created": 1443101425, "timestamp_updated": 1443101425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18171558": {"recommendationid": "18171558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205694692", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448682873}, "language": "english", "review": "Won this in a giveaway from TheSpartanShow and 10 minutes in and I know I'm going to be addicted.

Now that it's finally complete, I would love for anyone who's been on the fence to give this wonderful arcade blast-a-thon a go.\n\nWhat makes AAC such a great videogame is that it is just that -- a damn videogame.  There's no need here for bloaty features like RPG elements, perks, weapon customization, or what have you.  If you just wanna turn off your brain an' go out gunz a-blazin' with unlimited ammo, this game is it, and the three-person Witch Beam crew were steadfast in delivering that experience.  With little to get in your way, AAC is perfect pick-up-and-play fun for both casual players and S+ experts.\n\nAfter a short tutorial and a couple of cutscenes, the game catapults your chosen Android into a campaign filled with relentless robots ready to wreck you.  Using your unique primary and secondary weapons, as well as some helpful temporary powerups, you must destroy wave after wave of bots or duke it out with a fearsome Section Lord before proceeding to the next stage.  Five hits will knock your character down, but you can press the buttons repeatedly to get back up and continue the fight, no problem!  But don't party just yet -- Assault Android Cactus also features an interesting gimmick in the form of the Battery Meter.  Instead of relying on a limited number of Lives, the Game Over screen gleefully waits for your Android's power to completely drain during battle, so be on the lookout for occasional Battery drops from enemies to keep yourself afloat.  This feature adds to the intensity of the game, as you're encouraged to balance between being careful and getting aggressive.\n\nIf you wanna take a break from AAC's Campaign, there are indeed other modes to try out:  Boss Rush, the Daily Drive, and the endless Infinity Drive.  There are also fun unlockables (\"funlockables\"?), such as other playable Androids, and with enough hard-earned in-game credits, you can purchase character art and bios, story info, and the excellent EX Mode features.  The EX Modes alter the game in cool ways, such as placing the gameplay in First Person view, changing the graphics (can you handle Psychedelic?), or even allowing helpful A.I.-controlled Androids to assist you for faux co-op play.  \n\nSpeaking of co-op, while up to four players can have at it, I should mention that it is local only, as Witch Beam did not have the means to work in online multiplayer.  AAC was originally to be only single-player, but they were able to change that at least.  I sincerely hope the lack of online co-op doesn't deter you from trying out this game, and that perhaps the unlockable A.I. mode will suffice.\n\nAgain, if you're looking for simply \"a damn videogame\", and don't mind local co-op, I highly and wholeheartedly recommend Assault Android Cactus.  A lot of love was put into this game, and it definitely shows.

Video review below with text thoughts after: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVbxXAYnDWQ\nAssault Android Cactus is a game that I feel sets the bar higher for what indie studios can produce.  Not only is it mechanically sound and a blast to play, but the presentation is simply out of this world.\n\nYou take the role of Cactus (or 1 of 8 other androids) in a fast paced, arcade style, twin stick shooter environment for 1-4 players in local co-op, blasting robots and attempting to restore peace to the inhabitants of the Genki Star.  The Campaign mode in Assault Android Cactus spans across 5 areas each with a handful of levels apiece, each topped with a challenging and visually impressive boss fight.  Each stage is unique and beautifully crafted.  In fact, the only 'downside' I see in AAC is simply that I wish there were more campaign stages, purely for how well they're made.\n\nEverything about Assault Android Cactus shines.  The graphics are charming and clearly display information in the intense environment, the soundtrack is [b]spectacular[/b], the voice acting is solid, cutscenes are engaging, the controls are tight and response, everything simply flows together for a fantastic experience.\n\nWhile the Campaign may only take you a few hours if you're skilled, Assault Android Cactus is all about replayability.  You're ranked on your performance and in-game leaderboards keep the competition hot.  Additionally, the game provides an unlockable 'Pro Mode' that you can setup to facilitate better rank monitoring or quick resets if you're going for that perfect run.\n\nIn addition to the Campaign leaderboards, there's also the 'Daily Drive' which is a ranked Daily Challenge for 1-4 players, with each category separated.  You only get one shot at this and everybody plays the same level.  The Daily Challenge spans 10 'layers' of a shifting arena with a variety of enemies and bosses.  Beyond that, there's also the Infinity Drive, an endless mode that works much like the Daily Challenge but can be replayed as often as you'd like, seeing how far you can get.  Also included is an unlockable Boss Rush mode if you want to practice against the bosses or simply challenge yourself to back to back boss fights.\n\nOh you want more unlockables?  Done.  Playing the game earns credits, much like many older games or early entries in the Uncharted series, which you can use to unlock a variety of different things.  Lore entries, artwork, or even gameplay adjustments in the form of visual changes, AI companions, or powered up weapons (the latter of which turn off leaderboards for that run of course).  \n\nAssault Android Cactus is chock full of options and replayability to a level that's typically reserved for AAA games, many of which have even been lacking in the past few years.

After taking a peek at the pre-alpha build, I began corresponding with Mr Sanatana Mishra from developer Witch Beam Games, and it transpired that the game would be on show at the then-new Eurogamer Expo (now known as EGX). Since I was heading to EGX anyway, I made an appointment to meet with Mishra and have a chat about the game, and in the meantime I familiarised myself a little more with the early build.\n\nWhen I first heard about Assault Android Cactus, I wasn\u2019t sure what to think. On paper, it sounds like any number of games that bloat Steam\u2019s marketplace daily \u2014 it\u2019s an arcade-style twin-stick shooter inspired by retro classics \u2014 but it quickly became apparent from playing through the limited number of levels in the early build that there was actually something quite special taking shape here. This feeling was further compounded when I eventually made it to the Eurogamer Expo and had a thoroughly enjoyable chat with Mishra about the game and the team\u2019s plans for it in the long-term \u2014 to cut a long story short, it was apparent that Witch Beam was a small team who were absolutely dedicated to making Cactus the best experience it could possibly be, and to creating a truly authentic Dreamcast-style experience heavily inspired by the masters of Japanese shoot \u2019em ups like Treasure, Cave and their ilk.\n\nSince I first gave Cactus its glowing write-up on USgamer, I\u2019ve checked in on the Early Access build numerous times as it\u2019s developed, and regularly talked about how much I like it. I\u2019ve also kept in touch with Mishra and the rest of the team at Witch Beam via Twitter, and it\u2019s been a genuine pleasure to witness the passion they\u2019ve been pouring into their project. It\u2019s been a long and slow road to release for the game, but it's finally here.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I received an email from Mishra containing a beta code for the full review build of Assault Android Cactus\u2019 full version as a \u201cthank you\u201d for the support I\u2019ve shown them over the last couple of years. Touched by this thoroughly nice gesture of appreciation, I made a point of immediately downloading the new build and playing it for a good few hours. And it seems my early impressions were very much correct: Assault Android Cactus is something very special indeed, and if it doesn\u2019t end up taking its rightful place of honour alongside modern arcade classics like Ikaruga, DoDonPachi, Geometry Wars and their ilk, something is very, very wrong.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Assault Android Cactus is, as previously mentioned, a twin-stick shooter. There\u2019s a few twists on the usual formula, though: the right stick just aims rather than shoots, for one, so you have to actually pull the trigger to fire, while the left trigger swaps between your chosen character\u2019s main and secondary weapon. Main weapons have unlimited ammunition; secondary weapons have a cooldown before they can be used again, but tend to be considerably more powerful.\n\nAnother major twist on the formula is the fact that there\u2019s no lives system, with the challenge factor instead coming from a time limit represented by the characters\u2019 declining battery charge. Blowing up a wave of enemies allows you to collect a recharge item, while getting knocked down wastes time and battery charge as well as costing you some points, so avoiding getting hit is a very important part of going for high scores. The battery system proved to be a controversial addition to the game when it was first put in place, but it\u2019s now such an integral part of the game structure that it\u2019s difficult to imagine Assault Android Cactus without it. It ensures the game strikes a good balance between accessibility for casual players and rewarding skilful play from the people who know what \u201c1CC\u201d stands for.\n\nOne of the most noteworthy aspects of Cactus\u2019 gameplay is its selectable characters, who are gradually unlocked as you progress through the main series of levels. Far from just being different skins, each of the playable android characters handles uniquely, with very different main and secondary weapons allowing you to play in different ways. Title character Cactus is the most straightforward, boasting a simple machine gun and short-range flamethrower combination, while Aubergine is one of the more peculiar offerings due to her main weapon being an independently controlled helicopter drone and her secondary weapon being the ability to summon a quantum singularity and suck everything into it. The way the different characters play is one area where Witch Beam has clearly taken inspiration from classic Japanese shoot \u2019em ups, since many of these have selectable ships with different weapon setups. There\u2019s a huge amount of creativity in the way the characters play, though, and it\u2019s a real pleasure to get a handle on how some of the more outlandish characters work. (I still have no idea how to use Aubergine effectively, mind.)\n\nAnother interesting aspect is in the level design. Cactus could have easily been a straightforward arena shooter, but instead the levels show a great deal of variety in their structure. While they all have the same goal \u2014 destroy all the enemies \u2014 some of them take place in a confined space; some of them unfold in an arena that changes shape over time; some of them are in levels that force you to move from one place to another. One particularly memorable one scrolls infinitely in every direction, with checkerboard floor tiles flipping up and down according to which direction you\u2019re going; the backdrops are always interesting and exciting to look at as much as the main action is.\n\nCactus\u2019 long-term appeal comes from the same place as other arcade-style shooters: score attack. Completing a level immediately shows you a leaderboard as well as a letter grade, with the elusive \u201cS+\u201d rank being reserved for those who chained all of the enemies in a level into a single combo, didn\u2019t die and were generally a bit of a superstar. After attaining an S+ rank, you unlock \u201cPro Mode\u201d, which puts an on-screen indicator on your HUD showing whether or not it\u2019s still possible to attain an S+ on the level you\u2019re playing; you can also quickly restart a level if you make a mistake along the way somewhere.\n\nThe ranking system has been well thought out. Levels are designed so that you can \u201clearn\u201d them, much like a bullet hell shooter, and attaining the best ranks is dependent on you figuring out these enemy patterns, how to avoid their attacks and how to ensure that you\u2019re always on the offensive to keep your combo active. Bosses are similar, unfolding across several learnable phases, with the boss\u2019 health bar clearly showing where there\u2019s a phase transition so you can ensure you\u2019re in an advantageous position ahead of time.\n\nIf you\u2019re not in the mood for score attack, though, some Sega-inspired \u201cEX options\u201d allow you to play the game in various different ways. You can try the game in first-person, for example, or from a fixed isometric perspective rather than the dynamic camera angles of the regular game \u2014 though both of these options disable the leaderboards. There are also several graphical filter options \u2014 including an entertaining \u201cJJ Mode\u201d, which spooges lens flare and bloom all over the screen for an incredibly colourful experience \u2014 as well as options for having AI players alongside you or taking on co-op enemy waves with just a single player.\n\nIn short, if you\u2019re a fan of arcade-style shooters and you\u2019re looking for something entertaining to feed your virtual quarters into, Assault Android Cactus is pretty much an essential purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1442998804, "timestamp_updated": 1443178779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18138946": {"recommendationid": "18138946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025004060", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510198119}, "language": "english", "review": "Sucha  frantic and enjoyable twin stick shooter.

Simple concept, easy to learn and hard to master. Levels are short and punchy, each usually with a gimmick, a good sense of escalation, and never outstay their welcome.\n\nFrequently described as a \"Bullet Hell\" shooter, that's somewhat of a disingenuous title. Bullet Hell shooters typically depend a lot on memorisation and can feel frustrating when a single mistake costs you everything.\n\nBy comparison, AAC feels far more forgiving than most any of the bullet hell shooters I've ever played (this is NOT the same as requiring less skill to perfect, more on that later). Whilst there are often floods of enemies and bullets onscreen, you have a (relative to the genre) generous shield which allows you to take some hits before being knocked down. Even this is a unique design decision, as it doesn't automatically end the level level, it merely sucks up time. In order to survive, you merely have to defeat the level before your battery runs out (recharges drop intermittently as you destroy robots).\n\nAs such, completing the levels is doable once you get used to the systems at work. But the real draw of the game is when you stop \"surviving\" and start aiming for \"the perfect run\" (No knock-downs, one continuous combo chain). All the levels are built around this, to the point that they've included a handy \"auto-restart\" option should you miss the combo.\n\nFar too many modern games depend on lengthy grinds and unlockables to try to get you to keep playing. In AAC, the what keeps you playing is getting better at the game, getting that S+ (and then, purple S+). Unlockable characters are present, but don't depend on a grind, just beating the levels.\n\nIt's why over the past couple of years of Early Access I'ved dumped about 100 hours worth of 10 minute intervals into this game where other ostensibly more \"in-depth\" grindy titles left me cold.\n\nIt's a solid and easy recommendation. Try the demo. Learn to survive. Then learn to S+.

You have the typical Arcade mode, and it is here where I have spent the majority of my time. There are other modes available, such as a Boss Rush Mode and a daily Grind Mode, for bothe single, 2,3, and 4 players.\n\nThe Arcade Mode is a labour of love for me. It just contains everything I loved from the same kind of games I played more years ago than I care to think about. You can select from a number of different characters, each of who has a different main and sub weapon. From the off, you are thrust into a manic level, blasting at anything that moves. The sound effects need a special mention. I do not know who the Devs got to do them, but he deserves a pat on the back. With a head-set on, they really put you into the middle of the action. \n\nAs you are blasting away, you have to be careful about your battery, which slowly drains. However, every so often, a battery pick-up will present itself, and you MUST get to it, otherwise your battery will run out and...... GAME OVER.\n\nThere are many levels, and they change shape and colours half way through, and even more some time. The number of different enemies is pretty good, and some of the Bosses are, well, Sons of a B**ch.\n\nIt has local multi-player for up to 4 people. Also there are online leaderboards, for the Campaign, The Boss Rush Mode and The Daily Grind.\n\nThe Daily Grind gives you ONE chance to score as many points as possible with just one life. It can be a bit nerve racking at first, but slowly you WILL get better.\n\nOverall, depending on your skill set, the main Campaign will probably last anything from 4-10 hours. Add on top of that the other modes, and the multi-player, and it is most certainly worth its asking price.\n\nWitchBeam have done an AMAZING job, and I look forward to their next release with baited breath.

Updates every two weeks, at the least, and there is at least minor attention shown to the community reactions.\n\n-It's chaotic. Like, Beat Hazard level of chaotic. Sure, you can still see your character... most of the time, the problem is picking out which bullets come from you and which came from the thirty enemies you just massacred.\n\n-Characters are simple, yet detailed. Every character has two weapons, and many have their own voice acting. One of the robots, for example, names the powerups like most Lets Players would name them: \"Fun Circles!\" \"Pretty Wings!\"\nThe weapons behind each character also have some thought put into them. Starch, for example, has a laser. It doesn't do much damage, but as you level it up (temporarily - you grab XP balls form dropped robots), the damage output gets higher. Get downed once, and you're back to a level 1 laser. Go too long without picking up XP balls and the laser starts losing DPS. It requires a LOT of quick thinking to keep the laser at full strength.\n\n-You are going to have nightmares about the alarm noise you hear when the battery level is getting low.\n\n-GRAB. A. FRIEND. The game can be played solo, and there are slightly lower enemy counts when only one player is around, but the difficulty level spikes quickly at the first boss and it will not stop there. You can eventually earn enough game credits to buy AI teammates to shoot far away distractions, but it'll be a while until you can.\n\n-One of the recent updates added some buyable extra options (available under Collections in the main menu) that can change the way you play. For example, you can buy a first person camera as a replacement for the normal camera angle to aim your weapon much more easily. These are still a heavy work in progress, and it shows with some scenery dissappearing and reappearing in places (such as the first level), and your FPS going down considerably when you use the first person camera.", "timestamp_created": 1436391664, "timestamp_updated": 1436391664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16910809": {"recommendationid": "16910809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048190579", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436293505}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um dos melhores Twin Stick shooters no mercado, talvez n\u00e3o todos, mas a maioria dos personagens possuem uma jogabilidade \u00fanica, ent\u00e3o s\u00e3o basicamente 8 maneiras de jogar o jogo.\n\nPra que tem saudade da \u00e9poca em que disputava-se scores com os amigos, onde cada ponto contava, esse \u00e9 o jogo.\n\nUm ponto positivo/negativo (como preferir), \u00e9 que o jogo n\u00e3o oferece multiplayer online, ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea ser\u00e1 obrigado(a) a convidar seus amigos em casa para um bom e velho 'couch co-op'.\n\nO jogo est\u00e1 em Early Access, mas se a vers\u00e3o final fosse o que j\u00e1 temos agora, recomendaria na mesma.", "timestamp_created": 1436193370, "timestamp_updated": 1436193370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16839731": {"recommendationid": "16839731", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990126587", "num_games_owned": 793, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443747088}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolute gem of a game, and can definitely be counted as one of the successes of Early Access.

The premise is that you are part of an all-female Android police team who have responded to the calls of a stranded space freighter and discovered a plague of malfunctioning maintenance robots who have gone awry. You have to battle these robots, make your way through the crippled space ship, the Genki Star, find the brain of the ship and fix things while avoiding becoming a bullet sponge. \n\nEach arena is a stage on that journey. Your android has two unique weapons, a main continuous use weapon which has unlimited ammo, and a secondary weapon with more power and unique abilities, but with a slower reload to limit use. You dash around the arenas, avoid the varied robots that crawl, jitter, fly and stomp towards with your demise in mind. All the time you move and fire your weapons, your batteries are used up. There is no death in this game, after all you are an android and are not alive, nevertheless the sense of urgency which the battery forces upon the player is palpable and a strong part of the gameplay mechanic. You can get 'hurt', however by taking too many hits or getting too close to certain enemies and if you take too much damage you power down temporarily, freezing you on the spot while you manically have to pump the fire button to re-energise your character. If you do run out of battery then you permanently power down, ending the game \n\nAll the while you are moving around, this is important as keeping still means almost certain death on harder levels, you also get the opportunity to collect power-ups. Small white orbs are dropped by all the enemies as you destroy them and these contribute to the overall power of your weapons, scaling them up as you collect more. Also dropped are larger temporary power-ups, that are colour coded according to use. Blue ones freeze any current enemies on the spot, allowing to time how you pick them off, red ones add extra firepower to your main gun (my favourite) and yellow ones are like red bull; they give you wings, allowing you to zip around the arena at high speed. There is a good risk reward system here. Get too close to enemies, or take too many shots and you lose these power-ups immediately. \n\nThe depth to the gameplay does not stop there, however. Each arena is graded according to how well you clear them; not taking hits, never powering down and piling up chain shots all contribute to a higher grade. If you can avoid power downs and maintain a permanent chain throughout the level you achieve the highest rating, the S+, and unlock extra modes in the main game. This adds a massive extra level of playability, as the difficulty curve becomes quite steep. Couple this with the shifting levels, the variety of enemies and how they attack you, Assault Android Cactus becomes extremely nuanced. \n\nSpeaking of the shifting levels, the variety in design is excellent. It makes for much more tactical and thoughtful gameplay than first impressions suggest. You could just wade in all barrels blazing, but that wouldn't help to achieve the higher grades. Clever use of the alternate weapons at just the right time (useful for the bosses), thinking ahead when moving, learning the habits of enemies and second guessing them, taking advantage of the weaknesses of the robots at just the right time, using the shifting levels to block line of sight, learning the patterns of bosses and discovering which android works best in which arena make this an onion layered challenge of the highest and most exciting order. Nevertheless that doesn't stop the game being fun and approachable for the less experienced player. \n\nThe game looks beautiful, and blends the feel of a retro shooter with the looks of a next-gen console game. The graphics are pin-sharp, and were demoed on a massive 4K  screen at  the SMPTE 2013 Symposium. The soundtrack is poppy and pleasing, adapting and changing to your gameplay and the art design and characters are fun and don't take themselves too seriously, edging on the cutesy anime style. It is very hard to remember that Witch Beam are a three man team. This is quite an accomplishment. \n\nIt is important to note I played this game with a PS4 controller attached to my Mac. I tried playing with a mouse and WASD buttons. and it was very challenging and felt a lot slower. This could just me being a sad, old console fan-boy, but it's worth playing with twin stick controls to get the real fluid movement.\n\nThere's a wealth of fan service on the Assault Android Cactus website showing development of the game, creation of extra characters based on fan feedback, art and design assets and regular updates on new patches and features. \n\nWhy are you still reading this?

There are a few things in the game that feel a bit unbalanced or a bit unfair. Some of the weapons used by enemies will instantly deplete your health meter, and at times the screen can be so packed full of enemies that it can be easy to lose track of your character. Let alone dodge the walls of projectiles coming from all sides. That's not including all the explosions and enemies that grab you to keep you from moving. Unlimited deaths helps to ease this a bit, but it can still be frustrating to get up and immediately be knocked back down.\n\nThis game can get HARD. The last world is brutal.

Once inside the ship, she finds out that all the robot workers have rebelled because some malfunctioning. Attempting to save the ship, Cactus fights hordes of robots and bosses that control different decks of The Genki Star, together with 7 other androids that she recruits along the way to reach the brain of the ship while trying to find out the cause of the malfunction.\n\nThis game is a Twin Stick action arena shooter with an isometric top-down view that up to 4 players can play in co-op mode. It was firstly made for PC, but it will be available for PS4, Vita and Wii U, and although the game is still in Early Access, it is extremely refined and polished, it has great 3D graphics and great performance, it runs very smoothly even when the arena is packed with enemies.\n\nThe art style reminds me of Jet Force Gemini and Megaman with influence of anime, and every android is remarkably different, not only in appearance but also in gameplay, each one of the androids has a unique primary and secondary weapon. The primary weapons go from an assault machine gun with high precision to a shotgun with more spread shooting that can help with crowds. The secondary weapons are very powerful and have short cooldowns, they help a lot when taking down the big robots, and as if it wasn't enough you can power up the primary weapon by collecting energy, and there are also 3 pickups that can assist you in your fire rate and speed.\n\nEach level consist of two objectives, the first one is to destroy all the enemies, and the second one is to collect the batteries that the robots drop when they are destroyed, so you can keep fighting. This battery system works as a timer and in fact, the only way you can lose is by running out of battery which will shut down your android. Apart from that, getting hit a few times will eventually stunt your android, making you press the shooting button repeatedly in order to get up and keep fighting, this doesn\u2019t count as dying but it does drain your battery.\n\nNow, what makes ACC one of the best games of its genre that I have played is the mechanics of the game and the amazing dynamic levels, the arena changes while you are fighting, moving and rearranging itself, this can play in your favour or against you by making you take decisions really fast and being spontaneous. There are 20 levels and 5 bosses, which are very different and challenging.\n\t\nI would like to say that I'm really impressed with the work these developers have made, the game is getting close to its final stage but they keep adding more awesome stuff, like the bonus features on the EX options where you spend credits for more features like more visual filters, A.I. partners and a First Person Shooter Camera MIND BLOWN!.", "timestamp_created": 1426672246, "timestamp_updated": 1426686087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14938161": {"recommendationid": "14938161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027462990", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437662544}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this for my 7 year old, \u00a310.99 seems far price he played for an hour and loved it. \nim sure will play loads more. \n\npros \n- plays great a my low end system fx6300 and gtx 650 ti boost never going below 60fps\n-tons of characters\n-music and soudn seemed very good\n- great big picture support for my lad\n\ncons \n- could not see a way of selecting easy,hard ect\n-lad loves trading cards  to use as  desktop wallpaper non to collect\n\nid say great game to add to collection 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1426622708, "timestamp_updated": 1426622708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14913773": {"recommendationid": "14913773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084706898", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510486934}, "language": "english", "review": "Even in what the developers call \"Alpha\" stage this game is incredibly well balanced and polished, which makes you want to play it [i]at least[/i] until you get an S+ on every level.

Do you know what SHMUP is?  \"Yes\" to either = get this game.   AAC is pure arcade shooter fun.  \n\nDon't be discouraged by the Alpha state.  This game is more polished and stable than most full releases.  It runs flawlessly on reasonable hardware.  Control (gamepad or keyboard/mouse) is smooth and really tight which are important for games like this.    Basically:  the core of the game is complete and future updates will cosmetic updates to a few levels, minor balance changes, additional game modes, and lore/story/info bits.  The devs are very responsive and open about future content.  \n\nAAC has a few mechanics (such as the battery mechanic) which simultaneously lower the skill floor and raise the skill ceiling.  This makes the game accessible for novices but also very competitive if you like chasing high scores.  Otherwise, it has pretty much every feature you'd want in a game like this.  Level select for the levels that you've cleared.  An infinite arena mode.  A daily 10-wave mode that is different every day which adds a ton of replay-ability.  Quick access to different menus for character/level/mode select.  \n\nCo-op is a riot but it's local only.  You can have up to 4 players and you can mix and match control schemes (you can play 3 person co-op with 2 controllers and one keyboard/mouse) but it has to be done old-school-console style.  This makes AAC a really great co-op game if you have an HTPC or living room PC.  \n\nPlayer base is small-ish but they are pretty dedicated to dominating the leaderboards so expect some stiff competition that's your thing.  \n\nI love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1424374325, "timestamp_updated": 1425667770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14513360": {"recommendationid": "14513360", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994721281", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401371094}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, devs are seriously spraining ankles to make this game!\n\nGGWP", "timestamp_created": 1424176139, "timestamp_updated": 1424176139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14470562": {"recommendationid": "14470562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010591131", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499289896}, "language": "english", "review": "Assault Android Cactus is one of those games I didn't know I wanted until I got my hands on it. The game takes the simple premise of being a bullet hell-ish arena shooter, peppers it with unique and memorable morphing levels and eight playable androids with different kinds of playstyles, strengths and weaknesses (four of which are playable from the start), and tops it with a race against time to beat the levels before your batteries run out (yes, even boss levels work like this!).\n\nEven though levels tend to get downright overrun by enemies really often, I never felt like I lost sight of where I was (I did mix up my character on ocassion with that of other players) or that I didn't stand a chance agaisnt them, and the enemy variety is enough that you'll feel challenged by them, and will have to think fast when some particularily pesky ones decide to show up.\n\nUnlike with regular stages, bosses are fought one-on one, with you pelting them with all you've got while struggling to get them to drop the next battery in time. Again, I feel like they are challenging and can get to overwhelm you, but still do so in a fair way (gotta learn their attack patterns!).\n\nEven if you don't care about the score attack aspects of the game you can have plenty of fun with the crazy levels and huge number of enemies that get thrown your way. Still, the game really shines when playing local co-op, so I'd definitely recommend Assault Android Cactus to those of you who know other people you can play it with more than to people looking for a satisfying single-player experience (except for score attack enthusiasts, of course).\n\nHaving personally met the team behind it, I'd say that their concept of designing levels with easily identifiable features (ie: the popping lava level, the conveyor belt one, the one where the lights go out...) was a really good decission, making for a wide variety of fun and interesting arenas which also have the added bonus of letting different characters excel at each of them.", "timestamp_created": 1423948966, "timestamp_updated": 1423949187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14441751": {"recommendationid": "14441751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025148070", "num_games_owned": 496, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459640754}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a great game!

The mechanics are quite\"snow-bally\" in that if your doing good you'll soon find yourself doing better but make a mistake or five rather and you'll have lost all momentum which can quite easilly be a serious pain trying to climb back up with your batterry at around half, which i cvan note it does feel like once the batterry goes red, it drains faster which while emphasizing the need to grab the batterry and re-charge the meter that does get frustrating at times and sometimes it's much easier to simply hit escape and restart the level then to try and pull the round back into a good position.\n\n Now lets talk about the levels themselves, each level has a set \"gimmick\" to it be it turning off the lights, or flinging you accross the stage and turning the camera about alah, the transit level. each of  these levels are fun, intense, and easilly quite enjoyable after the first round of it where i find myself sutdying it, and then going at it again with calculation, and a little bit of luck and reaction time. now while that's all done and good, beside in the level select there is NO correlation between one level and the next besides maybe a matching theme of colors. you seem to drop down from one level to the next but you do not really feel that you are on a ship but you are exploring a \"complex\" if it was in space my best guess is this being some sort of station floating through space, not really a ship and certainly more based towards looks than function. which while being the largest nit-pick i have and any other complaints i have are usually found in the midst of thought, like the time you wish something was nerfed or buffed for \"insert random event here\" which looking at those i find them to be not worthy of mention as you have many ways you can go aboutn a situation. which leads me to the \"bullet hell\" of the game. the bosses!\nThis bit is hard to type down simply because i wish to avoid spoiling what story this game provides, which is all found in the interaction from your character to the bosses themselves so i'll stick to the first boss \"embryo\" which quite obviously by his looks is a mix of eggman and the crasy weapons guy.. you know the one guy who has an absolute love for weapons explosions and anything involving trying to use them to get you. never heard of him? well... damn.. nevermind then. now as you begin he has a seperate set of dialog for each character, and quite good interactions between you and the boss for me coral straight out called embryo a punching bag, which i found hillarious at the time. now the boss plays out with as many sections as his health bar has, with a surprise nearing the end of the fight. for example embryo cowers a little bit and begins throwing absolutely EVERYTHING he has at you. i'm not joking either on that one it's like a test \"lets see if you actually can deal with all of this aat once\" which is quite rewarding and at the end of it leads to some damn good clutch moments with bosses, with the third boss i killed him/it/her (let you geuss or you can buy it to find that out) i found myself with 0 batterry and killing the boss right as he killed me which was definitely one of those ... uhh... what do people say? \"omg yeessssss\" or something along a sigh of releif comes to mind. i myself can't do them justice, all the elements of the boss are found in previous levels and each boss acts as a test before you can go to the next set of levels which isw how it should be.\n\n[b]reccomendations? (READ AFTER THE REVIEW, NUMBNUTS!)[/b]\n\npersonally i find this game to be stupidly good for just going nuts and having a whale of a time. if you got the spare cash, go right on and grab it. no don't go off to another game to look at. trust me with what little impressions i have with you, and grab, the, GAME! it's worth the time and i personally had and will continue to have a damn good time playing it. also if you aren't conviced... grab the god-damned demo... by god man the demo is FREE! if you need a slice of gameplay grab the damned thing!", "timestamp_created": 1420962985, "timestamp_updated": 1420963133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13937947": {"recommendationid": "13937947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006999027", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 8814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491213888}, "language": "english", "review": "Assault Android Cactus caught me by surprise as a very competent arena shooter that is loads of fun. \n\nIf you've ever played Smash TV from back in the day, this game will feel immediately familiar to you. After selecting your android of choice, you enter a room of varying design with hazards and mobs of robots. Each character has two weapons: a primary which can be leveled, and a powerful limited use secondary that has a cooldown period. The eight playable characters (half of which are unlocked with gameplay progression) each offer a unique play style that can be vastly different from one android to the next. For example, Shiitake uses a high damage, low rate of fire railgun that is devastating  to lines of enemies, while Lemon uses a spread gun to evenly dish out firepower in wide area.\n\nThere are lots of elements to keep the game interesting. Right off the bat, you'll notice that score is a big part of replayability. In its current form, you'll spend a good chunk of time chasing those better score rankings and leaderboard positions. When you achieve S rank and the coveted S+ rank scores, you feel like you really earned it along with a sense of pride. The level design throws specific challegnes at you (like evading a white-hot torch as it spins) while you dispatch hordes of robots that range from missile launchers to quadrapedal melee brawlers to spectral teleporters with beam weapons. As you might expect, the later levels are very difficult. The number of enemies that can effectively one-shot you grows in number. Not to worry though, as pickups like Firepower, Acclerate, and Shutdown help you keep the playing field level. On top of all those challenges, you have to keep an eye on your battery meter. Without regular recharge pickups, you will fail the level if you let it run out.\n\nApart from the great story mode maps is a survival mode called Infinity Drive. Here, the environment changes on the fly in a fixed-size arena as you face an endless waves of enemies.  A Boss Rush mode is also offered to let you practice against each of the game's tough bosses. Local Co-op is there, but I am really pining for some Online Co-op. Unfortunately, that's not in the cards as the dev has admitted that due to technical limitations and a small team, it won't be happening.  \n\nThe controls are tight whether you go with mouse/keyboard or a gamepad and both options are comfortable to use. Your android choice may affect which control style you go with, as some characters require more precise aim than others.   \n\nIn summary, for an EAG this is far from your run of the mill broken beta release. It has a lot of polish, plenty of content to enjoy, and the communication from a passionate developer shows what EA can and should be. Each update brings more fixes and even more shine and shimmer to an already glowing product. It's an easy recommendation for fans of twin-stick shooters and old arcade games. I realize I've been raving about this game the whole time, but I really can't find a lot of fault with it. Even at this stage, bugs are rare and the ones that are found (and well documented) get addressed quickly.

Vague planes of what will be in the game and what will not? Developers who have very little communication with their community? All the stuff that happens one Early Access? Well then, take a look at Assault Android Cactus! There's a clear goal of what they want to be in the game at launch and how much is in it at the time you're buying it, right there on the store page! A lesson to the majority of developers that put their game out there on Early Access\n\nBut what about the game itself? Is it any good? The short answer is: Yes.\nThe long answer is the amount of time you'll find that you sink into the game. With four characters to boot and another one unlocked with every boss leaves us at 8 in total. All of them unique in their own way. They all have a primary and a secondary weapon which drastically changes the way they are played.\n\nThere's a whole heap of different enemies for you to blast to bits and rack up the points in a total of 25 planned levels! 23 of them available as of the time of writing this. And in addition to that you have Boss Rush and Infinity Drive game modes. The latter of which might need a bit of explaining, It's basically a wave survival mode.\n\nSo you're having a good time blasting enemies and all that, and then you suddenly get your first S+ rating. Meaning that you got through a level with an unbroken chain of kills. Nailing the level perfectly. And this is where your dark descent begins. This high is something you'll keep chasing, again and again on each of the levels, with your ranking going higher and higher on the global leaderboards.\n\nThe music and sound design is fantastic and fits the game like a glove.

The health-death mechanic is bit different because health loss costs you score/weapon level and you only really 'die' by running out of time limit.\n\nThe levels work mostly by changing the terrain on the fly rather than having you move towards something.  So instead of more traditional 'scroll left' type of map, think of an arena where walls and grounds are changing every now and then.\n\nThe enemy variations are pretty good IMO.  You got your standard slow dumb cannon fodders to bigger mooks with varying tactics (some shoots seekers at you, some ground pound for shockwave, etc.), swarmers to turrets  to verticle missile launching robot dogs, it's got healthy variety in both design and function.\n\nSo all of this probably reads rather conservative in terms of mechanics and yes, you probably have seen all of these bits and pieces before but you probably haven't seen them to this degree of polish.

It has local co-op too so that's a plus if you have friends over. As I mentioned before, the graphics could do with a few tweaks, but it is by no means unattractive. The gameplay is fluid and you will be moving around the arena a lot while gunning down hordes of machines. There are powerups available, which also encourage you to keep moving.

But it helps that the game is fantastic, I guess.\n\nGreat music, graphics that look like a great PS2 game with perfect IQ, frenetic but highly fluid action that runs well even on a fairly poor PC. One of the best twin stick shooters I've played; controller recommended but mouse works fine. Note the game is pretty hard, and score MATTERS; your \"life\" is a battery that constantly drains (not by taking damage, by time), and you get battery pickups by scoring. You will have to be good to beat this game.\n\nAs for the Early Access, this is how it's done. From the very start it was clear what was done, what was being worked on. The place holder graphics were clearly not final but polished in their own way that it's not quite so jarring to play an unfinished level. More than enough good music to make it feel like a final release, and gameplay is extremely tight.\n\nOverall it feels like you're playing a curated selection of a finished game rather than unfinished chunks of randomness that the creators will polish later.

All of my yes. This is actually my first purchase on Steam that was FULL PRICE. All of my friends that know me, know you gotta do a lot to make me pay for anything full price. What makes this game good? \n\nFirst off, let's begin with gameplay. Gameplay can be described as a combination between Smash TV with the aestetics of Bomberman. Sounds weird but plays great. You have a primary and secondary weapon which you can switch between. That simple. There are multiple characters and actual unlockable ones. I'm being honest when I say that these aren't just simple re-skins. With how the engine runs, every character playstyle is drastically different. Only thing that stays the same is you have to keep moving regardless of character. \n\nThe controls are not complicated at all. R-trigger shoots. Right stick aims. Left Stick moves. I think left trigger swaps weapons. Pay attention to your cooldown time with weapons, keep moving, and priotitize. If you do this then you're golden.\n\nMusic is very catchy. It's not exactly the same as the trailer music was originally. All tracks start of mellow making you slightly bob your head which snowballs when the beat drops. I'm halfway through the game and a perfect example would be the hive. The checkpoint stage I couldnt help but shoot to the beat like I was Ulala or something. Would I download the soundtrack? You beat you sweet and/or sour bottom I would! \n\nNow everybody wants to be a critic and say \"What about the graphics?\". It's not Crisis 3 nor does it need to be. It's art style compliments the gameplay. Why would I want to play a top down shooter that has over the top graphics. There is too much that goes on in this game and truthfully you need the change in colors so you don't foolishly just run into the bullets because you can't tell that they're bullets. Can't say it's too colorful or too dark. It's just right. \n\nFinal notes: I can't believe this is still just an Alpha. That scares the crap out of me. I'm happy to own this game and hope you get it. The only turn off could possibly be the art style since that may not be for everyone. All in all I suggest buying it. There's not much I can peg this game for and it's challenging. Like old school challenging also while being played as a respectable shump. \n\nRating: 5/5\n\nAssault Android Cactus", "timestamp_created": 1402981343, "timestamp_updated": 1402981343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "10300575": {"recommendationid": "10300575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020743825", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465096357}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredible insane and \"fun to die\" shooter! absolutely perfect in a round of 4 friends.", "timestamp_created": 1401551612, "timestamp_updated": 1401551612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "10166887": {"recommendationid": "10166887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000318945", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475013991}, "language": "english", "review": "*UPDATE*\nOver the past year or so they've been updating.

The Weapon Level system, Battery system and Power-ups encourage the player to get in close, and this creates a feeling of urgency and danger that is unique among twin-stick shooters.\n\nEvery level is an ambush. Hundreds of robots will attack you in the span of a couple minutes and attempt to overwhelm you with sheer numbers. Good thing your weapons are so powerful. And this is just in singleplayer -- if you have any buddies playing with you, the robot count may rise into the thousands... Good luck!\n\nThis game is excellent for a coffee break. The rounds are typically 2-3 minutes, so you can hop in and play a quick game whenever you want. And then you'll want to play just one more level.\n\nDid I mention the incredible production value? Assault Android Cactus's art style reminds me of Jimmy Neutron. Everything looks really cool, without eating too much of your processor. This game can run very well on even low-end computers.

So. The title. It makes about as much sense as the game does. But hell, whatever. There's been more crazy names thrown around in the Steam universe. Let's roll with it. What are we looking at?\n\nAssault Android Cactus, and from this point on I shall merely refer to it as Cactus, is an arena score shooter. Where you pick from a stable of androids, each with their own weapon loadouts and personalities and looks, and then select a level from an ever expanding list and have at it, dealing with wave upon wave of horribleness in the time honoured tradition of Arena Shooters everywhere. With obscene firepower.\n\nOn my rig, it runs beautifully, after the first run on a level which for some strange reason it needs a bit of time to shake out the cobwebs it will invariably run at 1920x1080 with all the shiny set to max, and with nary a judder. The movement is slick and the animation is crisp. The effects are bright and the game moves along at a rapid clip, controls are ridiculously simple, you have four keys for movement, you use your mouse to aim, one button to fire, the other to switch between primary and \"power\" weapons. \n\nAnd that's it. Kill everything that isn't you.\n\nThank god, because this is all about instinct, you pretty much are on the move from start to finish, dodging bullets and badguys in a near incessant firestorm of incomming pain and rage in the form of various mechanical and I -think- biomechanical baddies, I didn't get time to admire the scenery too much. Kinda hard when everything is trying to kill you.\n\nThe graphics are excellent and the story, what there is at this point is witty and well presented, in the style of some sort of adult teen anime, there seems to have been some kind of robot mutiny, and the androids you control are tasked with restoring order. Each of the androids has a very specific personality, which shows through quite nicely in the boss fights, their expressions and their playstyles. Music and sound effects are also uniformly excellent, with each \"area\" having a thumping soundtrack that keeps a high tempo and keeps you pretty much immersed in what's going on.\n\nAnd this is an early alpha.\n\nThis review will evolve but bluntly - short of the developers being visited by aliens and having their brains replaced with cottage cheese and pineapple chunks - this should be an easy recommendation, and a big thumbs up from me.", "timestamp_created": 1392262853, "timestamp_updated": 1392262853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.347073", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "9042874": {"recommendationid": "9042874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046936728", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403422731}, "language": "english", "review": "Got early access and boy is this game TONS of fun.\nYou control the cutest little bad ass you have ever seen and fight all of the robots.

All of my yes. This is actually my first purchase on Steam that was FULL PRICE. All of my friends that know me, know you gotta do alot to make me pay for anything full price. What makes this game good? \n\nFirst off, let's begin with gameplay. Gameplay can be described as a combination between Smash TV with the aestetics of Bomberman. Sounds weird but plays great. You have a primary and secondary weapon which you can switch between. That simple. There are multiple characters and actual unlockable ones. I must say these are not simple re-skins. With how the engine runs, every character playstyle is drastically different. Only thing that stays the same is you have to keep moving regardless of character. \n\nThe controls are not complicated at all. R-trigger shoots. Right stick aims. Left Stick moves. I think left trigger swaps weapons. Pay attention to your cool down time with weapons, keep moving, and priotitize. If you do this then your golden. \n\nMusic is very catchy. It's not like how the trailer's music is originally. All tracks start of mellow making you slightly bob your head which snowballs when the beat drops. I'm halfway through the game and a perfect example would be the hive. The checkpoint stage I couldnt help but shoot to the beat like I was Ulala or something. Would I download the soundtrack? You beat you sweet and/or sour bottom I would! \n\nNow everybody want's to be a critic and say \"What about the graphics?\". It's not Crisis 3 nor does it need to be. It's art style compliments the gameplay. Why would I want to play a top down shooter that has over the top graphics. There is too much that goes on in this game and truthfully you need the change in colors so you don't foolishly just run into the bullets because you can't tell that they're bullets. Can't say it's too colorful or too dark. It's just right. \n\nFinal notes: I can't believe this is still just an Alpha. That scares the crap out of me. I'm happy to own this game and hope you get it. The only turn off could possibly be the art style since that may not be for everyone. All in all I suggest buying it. There's not much I can peg this game for and it's challenging. Like old school challenging also while being played as a respectable shump. \n\nRating: 5/5", "timestamp_created": 1390746760, "timestamp_updated": 1390746760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8852272": {"recommendationid": "8852272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028038472", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444389994}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have a controller and a few friends, makes for good, crazy fun for a few hours.", "timestamp_created": 1390720147, "timestamp_updated": 1390720147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8779793": {"recommendationid": "8779793", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992869485", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447046557}, "language": "english", "review": "Some of the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time, despite my inability to do well.\n\nFeels really nice and looks really delightful.", "timestamp_created": 1390197935, "timestamp_updated": 1390197935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8773973": {"recommendationid": "8773973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045806689", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514517751}, "language": "english", "review": "Even in Alpha, this game is really well polished!

It is also one of the finest examples of Twin Stick Arcade Action Shooters on the market. The bar this developer set for the genre is now set extremely high for any Twin Stick game to try to compete with. \n\nYou'll need to bring quick reactions for the fast paced non-stop action. With the hoards of enemies, morphing arena, power ups, explosions, more enemies, grueling boss battles, environmental hazards, walls of bullets, even more enemies, and the option of your friends playing simultaniously (local co-op, for your cheap friends) you need to be quick. The gameplay and levels are so well designed and balanced, that they'll have you coming back for more, time and time again. Even in its early access state this game is solid and almost feels complete.\n\nPersonally, I'm a sucker for anything twin stick shooter so even with a price tag of $15, for me it wasn't a question of being worth the cost but how long it would take to download but for everyone else I can honestly say at that for the price it is worth every cent, and even more so for those who have an arcade action addiction like mine. \n\nThe one small issue I have with the game is with the text based dialog. I'm hoping this is only an early access thing and haven't gotten around to doing the voice overs or, since this is a robot based game, use a text to voice program. I know this isn't a huge issue for some but me being a musician, I'm a stickler when it comes to audio. \n\nThe only other issue I have with the game is that I got it on early access. Yeah, I get to play it before it is completed but here in lies my problem. It's like hanging a brilliant painting on your wall that is not finished yet. You can see it, even though you don't really see the real final product. I'm aware this is petty gripe. ....but! On the other hand, its not that the $15 I spent is going to pay my rent or even my phone bill for that matter, but my contribution is going to a worthy developement team that is working diligently to make a decent product, all the while keeping public relations strong in the community hub. \n\n[code]\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\n[b]Game Play:[b] Twin Stick Arena Shooter\n[b]Graphics:[b] Great - runs great on my i5 - intel HD3000 laptop even though according to the dev, \"the HD3000 graphics are below minimum spec's.\"\n[b]Sound:[/b] The sound track is great but it is missing the voice overs!

Here's an excerpt:\n\n\"Responding to a distress call from the crippled Genki Star, Junior Constable Cactus soon discovers she is overwhelmed by malfunctioning worker robots. Desperate to save the ship, Cactus battles her way through deck after deck of rampaging robots and bosses whilst befriending and recruiting androids along the way to heart of the ship, where presumably they will find the cause the Genki Star's malfunctions.\n\nAssault Android Cactus features four main playable android characters: the titular Cactus, a plucky, but perhaps out of her depth police android; Holly, a nervous inventory manager; Lemon, a trainee medic with a happy outlook; and Coral, a fitness instructor with an outgoing personality. In addition to these four, a range of additional unlockable characters are planned. The current Steam Early Access and Humble Store DRM free versions of the game include Starch (who is my personal favourite), an insane android with a mysterious past. Starch's silly presentation shows that this game doesn't take itself too seriously and values fun above all else.\n\nWhere Assault Android Cactus shines (even in its current unfinished state) is in the execution of mechanics, where the same attention to detail and stylistic choices already covered have been brought to bear on creating a robust and satisfying experience that is as enjoyable the fiftieth time as it was the first.\"\n\nThe full review along with some screenshots can be viewed here: http://cheesetalks.twolofbees.com/aac.php\n\nI also did a write up of some of my post-early access reflections, which, like most of my articles, doesn't fit within Steam's character limit.\nhttp://cheesetalks.net/aac2.php", "timestamp_created": 1381064084, "timestamp_updated": 1479952850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7307330": {"recommendationid": "7307330", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968473192", "num_games_owned": 782, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450399772}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game - great mechanics for playing with newbies or pros.

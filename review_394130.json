It's pretty satisfying to solve a puzzle for this reason.\n\nIn terms of the puzzles, it's really solid. Super simple concepts that build up very gradually. As thing progress you'll need to plan carefully and actually manage your building materials properly. Alot of the later levels have just enough to make a proper habitat for the water bears. It gets challenging enough towards the end of the main game and theres actually a whole bunch of challenge levels after that. I'm sure they will really test me.\n\nAs a VR experience, it's very pleasant and intuitive. You will be moving around the habitat, instinctively, crouchign and wanderign around to locate the water bears and take note of thier needs. Then you of course work out how to improve the habitat to complete the puzzle.\n\nFor the price, you really can't go wrong here. I'd recommend it to young, to old and everyone in between, even those people who aren't usually puzzle fans. I feel like this game could make anyone into a puzzle fan.

Even my seven year old, who is tall for her age, has to stretch to reach some of the upper levels of the puzzles. This also puts her at a severe disadvantage because she doesn't have a very good vantage point to look at the puzzle from.

No teleporting here, you can walk around the puzzle to inspect it from all angles, and then use the space to build your pipe contraption by hand. The space requirement is high, but oh so worth it. Definitely one of the most polished games currently available.\n\nThe puzzles start easy and grow more complex. Usually the solutions are fairly simple, but it often takes a lot of experimentation and rebuilding to find them. Some of the puzzles are open; you have a large number of pipes and can do what you like; while others only give you exactly enough pipes to finish.\n\nThe Water Bears are the most adorable creatures ever, and will interact with you once you finish the puzzle; I've probably spent half my time in this game doing puzzles, and half just playing around with them.", "timestamp_created": 1466147748, "timestamp_updated": 1466147748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23608779": {"recommendationid": "23608779", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969913402", "num_games_owned": 2080, "num_reviews": 153, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466299926}, "language": "english", "review": "A while back this game was on a promo for free, and even though I didn't have a VR headset at the time, I knew i'd be getting one sooner or later, so I grabbed it while I could.  I was going to play it the other day and then saw that the game actually required just a tad bit more space than I had available... my bed was in the way or I'd have had the space for it for sure.\n\nWell I said \"screw it\" and traced my play space so that it went over the edge of my bed so I could play this game.  Occasionally I would be RIGHT up against one of the boundries but I made it.  Also if you have a ceiling fan: turn it off if you value your hands.   I turned mine off and I still wound up banging my hands against the light fixtures (I would have probably hit the blades with the controllers too).  \n\nSo what is Water bears VR?   Basically you have these cutesy little tardigrades that sit inside little bubbles asleep.  Your goal is to fill the bubble with water so that they wake up and float/fly off through the air.  Sounds easy?  It is!  You just connect pipes to make sure the water flows towards the bubble and that's all you have to worry about at first.\n\nLater you get puzzles where the pieces are in short supply so you have to be careful, and eventually there's different colors of water that you have to direct to the appropriately colored water bear.  It gets slowly more complicated as time goes on. \n\nAlso, you can do most of the puzzles standing up, but occasionally you'll have to crouch down to see better, and of course you'll want to view the puzzle from all sides. \n\nIn between levels you step into a teleporting tube (marked with footprints in a circle on the ground) and that teleports you to the next level or back to the hub.  I only saw 4 main sets of puzzles (each set had 4-6 puzzles in it) with a few special bonus puzzles.  No puzzle was so difficult that I couldn't complete it with a bit of experimentation and I got through 75% of the puzzles I saw in one sitting.  \n\nMaybe the game is aimed at younger kids?  In any case, it's fun The title doesn't make you think \"puzzle game\" though.  For $10 it's worth a run through just for the cutesy environment and the \"pipe laying\" gameplay.  Difficulty is probably suitable for kids age 10+ and if you're looking for a game to add to your VR library this wouldn't be a bad addition (if you like puzzle games).\n", "timestamp_created": 1466142369, "timestamp_updated": 1466142369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581715", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23539727": {"recommendationid": "23539727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077253135", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475267701}, "language": "english", "review": "Great VR puzzle game.

However Water Bears VR functions well not only as a puzzle game, but as a fantastic prototype for VR game design. \n\n First, the game menu and inventory are controlled from a handheld pop-up that is dimissed or traded between hands with a single button. The opposing hand interacts with this menu like a touchscreen display. If there was anything I dislike about non VR games, it is the inability to break away from keyboard bindings. Having a menu that can be summoned and interacted with intuitively makes using the menus themselves fun. \n\n Levels maximize use of small standing area and don't needlessly complicate puzzle layouts to take advantage of all available play space. I use a smaller than recommended play area which honestly isn't super critical for this game to begin with. Being able to move around a static puzzle without bumping into a desk is a plus. \n\nThe cartoonish textures are well crafted and are suited for the Vive. Despite the cartoonish nature, however, there is a definite sense of presence for objects. So much so, I would often travel around the puzzles or move my hands over or under walls, subconsciously feeling they were actually in my way. The environment feels alive and open with little animation. The background isn't needlessly busy and makes itself known without being distracting.\n\nThen there's the little things: Little waterwheels in the controllers, the water bears following you around or giggling at being touched, even the way the triggers are animated 1:1 despite having no function until fully pressed.\n\nThis game is well polished and has a few surprises in way of puzzles.

I have to say this was the first VR game among the 40+ I had that I really wanted to come back to and finish.

You move around the entire level, place pipes in 3D, watch the seemingly volumetric fluid flow. All interface parts are moved into world space and works really well, the water bears can be interacted with using your controllers, there is nice coherent graphical style making the world believable, it runs without issues on a rec spec system.\n\n[b]Value[/b]: I usually compare game times to a movie ticket. If I get 1.5-2.5 hours of quality entertainment for \u20ac10-15, I'm happy. Then I'm one of those people who jump between many games, but to me it makes sense. For this game I am happy I got it and played it, no regrets :) I will probably not replay it, but that's fine by me, it's usually how puzzle games work.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]: I thought this game would just be something I'd try and forget about, but it has become the first consumer VR game I finish.

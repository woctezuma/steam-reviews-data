My first VN game was Stein;Gate and it was impressive for extensive stories. So I decided to try Clannad, VN that I was familiar with because I watched the anime. I understand the game was pretty old and I know was little late for it. But I will make a review just for those who want to explore old visual novel games that was anime.\n\nOverall games are nice, there an option of choices you can make throughout your games. However, I have landed in really bad ending one...\n\nIt brings me back to the main menu, Just because I reach an end where I don't pick any girls I encountered and by rejecting someone for the first time...\n\nThere aren't even ending credit for the bad one, it was really disappointing ending. It was like telling me \"No, you must pick Nagisa route. Or go back then pick this other girl you left with, Ryou. based on how terrible my decision were.\" And I feel like the game was always forcing me all on Nagisa, which is ridiculous. I don't like it, I expected the VN to have a choice of our decision. \n\nSome of the problem such as:\n[spoiler]- Not to live with Nagisa when she offers. [/spoiler]\nReason: I thought there could be another chance, or it's too early yet, wanted to see how the story will proceed if I did that. That decision was pretty much dead route instead... \n\nToward my end, I was left with Ryou with the decision by following Kyou setup. I saved between. Then I decide to go along, she [spoiler] confess her feeling. My first choice was the rejection[/spoiler], The reason for that is, I feel like it was too early and barely have any bonding with her at all. I would blame the game, in the beginning, keeps forcing me with Nagisa. Barely any moments for Ryou or other people that the choice they left me. \n\nAnd even before I reach that bad ending, [spoiler] having to see her cries. [/spoiler]I went back to my save before everything happen to avoid Kyou setup, then it leads me to this bad ending instantly. I was confused. \n\nSo I went back to continune where I left off before I reach that same bad ending, [spoiler]Ryou, I reject her then it lead me to eh same bad ending where Tomoya explaining that he went depress and stuff and then there a scene of cold winter lonely life... [/spoiler] Then it brings me back to menu screen. I'm like, really? It was really disappointing.\n\nLike, come on!?! I haven't finish side stories of Fuko. Or even meet Kotomi!\n\nI thought [spoiler] rejecting her [/spoiler] would lead:\n- Next girl options\n- More stories of others\n- Back to Nagisa \n- Move on to next stories\nBut for some reason, it ends me just like that. I don't know if I was really unlucky or my decisions were really terrible that it end whole game like that. Not only that, it shows how pathetic Tomoya was, but that bad ending was just \"bad\" [spoiler]So what? He kill himself or something by avoiding Kyou setup + rejecting your first girl? So vague and ridiculous![/spoiler]\n\nSo because of that, I have to start over where I left my saves of important decisions. \n\n\nOverall the game is good, \nThe thing I wish they would have is Tomoya voice narrating for what he said.\nI would set preliminary review as not recommending for now. Because wow, the bad ending is bad, if you end up like my ending. But if you have patience in starting over, then no problem.\n\nMy suggestion is to be really careful with the decisions. This VN is more of Tomoya more than YOU, the player. Pick what is best for Tomoya, not yourself. Hopefully once I explore more of the game, then I will see what I think of it.", "timestamp_created": 1514707153, "timestamp_updated": 1514708320, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

It's obviously pretty bad, but you get used to it. Other than that, though?\n\nCLANNAD is probably the best VN ever made. The writing is so on-point that Jun Maeda (the mastermind behind both this and the other KEY classics) admitted that he reached his peak with this game.\n\nCLANNAD is infamous for being a gauntlet of emotional sucker-punches. This is the daddy of all nakige, so expect a typical nakige experience except turned up to 11. Key's flagship game was built from the ground up to make you cry, and the game accomplishes this with copious character development, trope inversions, big themes and an amazing score. So to showcase how incredible this game is, I'll explain why all these things are EXCEPTIONAL in CLANNAD.\n\nCHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:\nKEY faced harsh criticism in their previous big project, \"Air\", because the game was hyper-focused on the main route and had noticable dips in quality in other areas. So, Jun Maeda took personal control of every damn thing in their next project CLANNAD, including the mini-routes and joke routes. So, what you get is a very consistant level of quality and an extensive amount of content. The side route with the longest running time, Tomoyo, takes longer to complete than the entirety Katawa Shoujo, has a fucking LEG-EN-DARY ending that brings men to tears years later AND has a spinoff VN, \"Tomoyo After\" (which is also on steam, and you should get it). In addition to THAT, every character is expanded in the second half of the main route. And in addition to THAT theres CLANNAD side stories, also on steam, which gives extra scenes for every character. So, what you're looking at is a good couple hundred hours or so of mostly just characters talking to one another with no gameplay. All of it micromanaged by the god of visual novels himself, to assure this doesn't get old or lose consistency.\n\nTROPE INVERSION:\nNot every route does this, but enough do that I'm willing to say that CLANNAD admirably avoids cliches and manipulates your expectations. Some characters (i.e. Kyou) are famous for being clear-cut examples of the different anime archetypes (\"tsundere,\" \"yandere,\" you get it). This is due to the anime not having time to flesh everything out. (almost) Every character feels like a real person, with values and motivations that make a great deal of sense. The end result is that (almost) nobody feels like a statue, or a walking cliche. Even the fucking comedic relief characters have suprising moments of genuine depth that'll make you look twice at who they really are.\n\nBIG THEMES:\nIt's hard to talk about this without spoilers. But generally, this VN has multiple messages to give you. The delivery is mature, unique and often subtle.\n\nAMAZING SCORE:\nYou be the judge. This is almost the first track you hear after starting a new game, so no spoilers. Beware some of the thumbnails on related youtube videos, though, as they have some fucking egregious ones.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzx6bsUH0ik\n\nAnyway... That's why I like this game. The only multiple-route VNs that offer something that CLANNAD doesn't have are in a totally different setting (i.e. actiony VNs like Fate stay/night). And even then the romance is often weaker. Other VNs have routes I'd put on relative parity with CLANNAD, but I don't think you can go wrong with this old gem. \n\n\nP.S. If you're looking to get started in VNs, begin here AFTER playing Katawa Shoujo. The two are very similar and both kick major ass, but KS is shorter, free and written by westerners.", "timestamp_created": 1514355128, "timestamp_updated": 1514461637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

Set aside at least 50 hours and get ready to cry.\n\nThe story is excellent. There are quite a few routes, and all of them are required to be completed in order to unlock the (long) epilogue chapter. Most are fantastic, and a couple are mediocre. I wouldn\u2019t recommend playing the game if you aren\u2019t going to see it through to completion.\n\nThe writing is quite sharp, and the translation is great. I lost track of how many time I laughed out loud after twenty-something. I rarely find writing that is this funny, so it was a real treat.\n\nThe characters are quite enjoyable for the most part. None of them fall too deeply into stereotypes or tropes, and the routes are long enough to tell interesting stories with the characters. The characters\u2019 visual designs are also pretty good.\n\nLackluster art is probably the biggest weakness the game has. The characters are well designed, but the art that you see in-game for them is not very good looking, which is a shame since you\u2019ll be looking at them for 50+ hours. The CGs look fine though.\n\nThe music and voice acting are top notch. The score does a really good job setting the mood appropriately. It\u2019s the type of soundtrack I want to download and listen to afterwards. The voice actors are a huge reason why the game is so funny and emotional. No complaints whatsoever in this department. All characters besides the protagonist are fully voiced.\n\nSome of the routes (especially some of the more joke endings) have somewhat arbitrary choices required to enter them. There are some order-specific dependencies (some routes can\u2019t [i]really[/i] be fully completed unless other routes are done first). This is kind of annoying and might lead to have to replay some routes if you don\u2019t consult a walkthrough.\n\nThis game is super sad. Pretty much every route has some serious tragedy or heartbreak involved. For the most part they have happy endings, but be warned that you will cry like a baby many times unless you have a heart of stone.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend it if you have the patience and desire for 50+ hours of reading.", "timestamp_created": 1513751735, "timestamp_updated": 1513751735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810",

Having seen the anime I know how the story goes and the first time Nagisa came into scene, it hit my like a box of rocks. the second half of the story was so relatable it brought me physical pain. growing up in high school, I had it fairly rough. My step dad was a drunk and although Tomoya's dad wasn't abusive, mine was. it resulted in me leaving home and living with my best friend. his little sister, 1 year younger, was there andwe cared deeply for each other. This isn't so far from Tomoya and Nagisa's story and it just reminds me of some of what I had to endure as well. the feeling of being an outsider hit especially hard and this VN portrayed that so well. \n\nBeyond the story's relatability to my own upbringing, the quality of this visual novel is well worth the full price IMO. While I haven't completed it yet after 10.5 hours, the translation so far has been amazing. I haven't seen a single typo or poorly translated line yet. The voice acting is also amazing with every line other than you're own being voiced out and sounding authentic. the music is spectacular, and of course, the dango song is here and just like in the anime, is played at the perfect times to emphasize both joy and sorrow, truly artful. the art is also incredible, though there are some expressions that characters portray that look drawn on. this mostly an issua with Yohei (spelling?), the other character's expressions all looked natural. Saving the best for last is the story. in typical Key fashion, this story is AMAZING. Key has always made incredible stories that really know how to tug on your heart strings and Clannad is no exception.\n\nI picked this game up on sale for $17.50 but I think it's absolutely worth the $49.99 price tag, especially if you don't know the story.

Well written, with a good mix of humor and pathos. It follows the trials of a high school boy in his final year, who has no long term goals and spends more of his time skipping classes and annoying his teachers than attending to his studies. It's quickly made apparent that his home life is a sad affair, with a mother who died in his infancy, and a distant, slovenly drunkard of a father who makes genuine but ineffective attempts to repair the seemingly long broken relationship with his son. A chance encounter with a girl on the way to school sets the game's events into motion. \n\nThis is equal parts a coming of age story for the protagonist, a story of reconcilation, and a story about taking responsibility and learning the meaning of family. It's very much in the romance and slice of life genre, with a lot of detail given to mundane, yet character building moments. \n\nThe game is split into two distinct parts, the first of which follows his life through that final year of school. Though still good, this part is the weaker of the two and firmly adheres a little too rigidly to the standard conventions of visual novels. In this part you will make choices which affect the ending, which for the most part are distinct in that each one will end you up in a relationship of some description with one of the female cast. \n\nThe problem with this part is that not all of the arcs are as interesting as the others, with some characters being a little too one dimensional. The other problem is that for the most part, particular choices arbitrarily lead you to specific endings and you will need to do a lot of trial and error, save scumming, or consulting online guides to help you reach them. Lastly, the other issue with this part is that there are a lot of shared events between the different arcs, and you will be skipping a lot of text on subsequent playthroughs. There is no feature to skip already viewed events quickly other than a 'fast' text option, which for a game as text heavy as this is not fast enough. \n\nThe second part is where the game really shines. It follows the time after the protagonist leaves school and begins adult life. It is much more focused than the first part, with more developed characterisation and a better structure overall, with a much tighter, cohesive narrative arc. Partly this I think is owing to how it treats one of the possible routes in the first part as canon, so it doesn't have to spread itself so thin and concern itself with tying together various plot threads. Choices, though still infrequent are much more clear in their consequence down the line. \n\nThe ending of this visual novel is excellent and will stick with you. My only issue with the ending is that some parts of the major plot development as it's written are underdeveloped. For me this slightly blunted the impact of aspects of the ending overall. \n\nThis is a very long visual novel and it took me about 120 hours to complete it, with the multiple routes of the first part taking me about 90 hours to complete and the second about 30 hours thereafter. It has good production, with the entirety of all dialogue other than the protagonist being voiced, with attractive art - though I know some people are turned off by the some of the character designs, I personally liked them. If i had any problem with their designs it would be that a lot of characters look a bit too young, especially in the second part when the characters are getting into their twenties but some still appear to be children (Fuko stands out especially). This is not something that I typically play, as mostly I have played VNs with more focus on action or intrigue such as Steins;Gate or Type Moon games, but as someone less familiar with this genre I thought this was excellent.", "timestamp_created": 1511263359, "timestamp_updated": 1511312559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36669116": {"recommendationid": "36669116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368938698", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505816292}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5f88\u503c\u5f97\u5165\u624b\u3002\u52a8\u6f2b\u4e5f\u5f88\u597d\u770b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1511237931, "timestamp_updated": 1511237931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36640264": {"recommendationid": "36640264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116803092", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511794232}, "language": "english", "review": "What a beautiful VN!!  \nBetter get ur tissues ready folks.

The style was not my taste at all. The price tag was hefty. And so I waited for a sale.\nSome months later...\n\nI can proudly say that CLANNAD is my favorite Visual Novel of all time.\n\nOnce I started playing I immediately fell in love with it. The humor, the characters, even the style.\nIt was magical. I didn't understand why, but I wanted it to keep going on.\nEvery single route feels complete and every character has a beautiful background story.\nAt no point did I have the feeling that it was stretched or boring.\nAnd when you think you're done with the game HOLD ON there's even more!\n\n'' But soon everything changes, well at least it does eventually. ''\n\nOf course, even CLANNAD has an end to it, but I can promise you, countless hours will pass before you will reach the true Ending.\nI don't complain, this game is filled with tons of content, secrets, endings, JET SAITO and more.\nIf you're a slow reader or enjoy re-reading lines there'll be even more hours on the count.\nBut I think it's best experienced when playing the first walkthrough blind followed by using a spoiler-free guide for the \nother routes. Reason is, CLANNAD has LOTS of choices and paths, and while it surely can be enjoyed by finding things out by yourself, some things are just hard to find out on your own in my opinion.\n\nTo be honest, it's hard to describe what the fascination with this game is about. I didn't now s*** about this game \n- except that it would make me cry - \nuntil I played it myself and I enjoyed every single moment of it.\nI think I can put my hand in the fire for saying that CLANNAD will touch you.\nIt will make you laugh about Sunohara's foolishness, and at times, it will make you cry. \n(for obvious reasons I don't want to spoil you about these)\n\nToo bad it's only in English, while it's a good localization, I would've liked to see a German version for example too.\n\nI give everybody my recommendation to try CLANNAD out as it was a once in a lifetime experience for me about friendship, love, family and life itself.\n\nDon't like Visual Novels? Watch the Anime. Don't like Anime? Read the comic.\n\nI also want to give a HUGE credit to the music.

the Clannad anime series. Ive seen it several times, fallen in love with the characters, the mood, the art, and everything about this series and can proudly say it has been an important, positive, and powerful influence in my life.  So as you can imagine, I was very excited upon hearing about the kickstarter for the English HD version of the Clannad Visual Novel. I had heard a lot about just how amazing the original visual novel was, so I finally decided to purchase the full collection of CLANNAD on steam, both to repay Key studios for the amazing anime creation that had had such an amazing impact on my life and also because the VN really intrigued me.\n\nMy expectations weren't super high, I did not expect the visual novel to rival the animes Clannad or Clannad: After Story, but honestly only partway through the Misae character arc I was quite blown away by the quality of the voice acting, wide variety of character stories & pathways, touching soundtrack, and overall mood/design of the game. It was beautifully intimate being able to experience a more in-depth look at the Clannad characters, their back stories and relationships... I felt more connected to this world and the people in it than ever before. \n\nIn the end I would have to rank this on the same level as the original series, and highly recommend this VN to anyone who is a fan of the anime. I would say it's absolutely necessary and mandatory in fact, to really get a complete sense of the full characters' stories and their motivations. The CLANNAD visual novel is touching, heartbreaking, inspiring, beautiful, intimate and truly special. I can't say any interactive experience has had an emotional impact on me like the CLANNAD visual novel has. \n\nThe only downside to this VN I would say is the annoying sexist attitudes of many of the characters and how those views aren't really questioned at any point. such as \"a yell uncharacteristic of a girl\", \"girls and boys cant be platonic friends\", only girls can sew or when almost all of Tomoya's love interests come to visit him when he is suspended from school ,each one brings a dish trying to get him to choose her cooking over another girl's.

I shed my first manly tears at the Fuko ending ;). Even if you only play the main-route (Nagisa) you at least need several hours to clear to thing, and you wont get the full experience.

Lonely that is, until he meets Nagisa...\n\nIn short, CLANNAD is a fantastic game. The story, all the characters, my GOD, the music! The art is a little moe but it's not by any means a deal breaker. The player is immersed in the role of Tomoya, as he lives out his days in high school in the School Life arc, before graduating and getting a job later in the After Story arc, which becomes available after a number of playthroughs of School Life. However, I do want to point out, what I really liked, was that in the Misae and Kotomi route paths, the player, for a time, is immersed in the game as Katsuki Shima and Kotomi respectively. It's so interesting and unique how the player gets to play as more than just the MC and it really drived home just how heart breaking their stories are. \n\nEach story route in CLANNAD has its own unique qualities to them, and they're all worth experiencing. I do't have the time nor patience to go through ALL the routes and what each of them does well and not so well so I'll just give some important hilights. Baseball route is funny and pure comedy with no drama, it's a nice, relaxing route, but doesn't really pack the Key punch. Misae and Kotomi routes are two favorites especially with the immersion as different characters, as I mentioned above. Tomoyo's route in the first half is a bit annoying at times because they made Tomoya a really perverted MC, much more so than he is in other routes, but the second half of the route is nothing short of a masterpiece, and makes it all worth it. You see the effects and pain the passage of time can create between people. There is a character called Kappei who never made it into the anime and he is male which really intrigued me, but his route isn't all that amazing. Kyou's route is really nice and the character interations make it, but the pacing is a little too slow. It really drags for a while. Komura's route is nice, but too short. It's more of a scene than a route. Yukine's route hardly has drama and much of what they included in the anime is not included hereAnd of course, there's Fuko and Nagisa, who are just treasures who need to be protected. After Story is a whole other thing and in the essence of spoilers, I'll stop with hilights here.\n\nKazamatsuri made a really helpful guide you can use to get through the game. I highly recommend using it. Though if I had to point out one thing that disappointed me about the game is there are a good number of uneccesary choices. They carry no significance to the plot at all and really offer a 10 second snippet difference in story. It leaves the player (or me, at least) somewhat frustrated trying to figure out what choices to make when I shouldn't need to make one. Another little issue I had was not with the actual game, but with the translations. Not in the sense they are inaccurate, but they just read kinda clunky sometimes and sound unnatural. There are also a few typos here and there as well.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game. It's classic Key. Hilarious, dramatic and sad, has beautiful music, and the voice acting is great. There's also an option on the menu to listen to the songs as you unlock them in the game, which is a nice touch, and the Dangopedia is interesting too. There's plenty of material in here that did not make it to the anime so even if you've seen the anime, I still recommend you play this. I watched the anime first but still fell in love with this visual novel.

(And for people who don't want to spend 80 hours on a VN, the anime is a perfect substitute in this case!) \n\nI had always assumed that most romantic visual novels starred blank slate protagonists and cliched filled women, and served simple as wish fulfillment. I still hold that assumption for the majority of the genre still, but Clannad is different. Tomoya has a very defined personality, and is nowhere near a perfect character. And despite the fact that most of the routes end in romance, Clannad doesn't consider getting the girl to be the good end. The game puts the happiness of the characters first and foremost. In some cases, that means accepting that being apart is the better choice for both characters, In others, it has nothing to do with romance at all. Even though I feel like the female characters have some writing issues, the fact that acquiring their affection is not the overall point, makes them feel more real.\n\nDespite some issues I have with the writing, I think it hits at every single point where it counts, Not just the sad moments, but the joyful moments too. The amount of visual/audio gags that are pulled off through the simple presentation astonished me. I was rolling on the ground at points.\n\nSpeaking of the visuals, the artstyle takes a bit to get used to. I do not think its bad per se, but it is definitely not something that I love about the game. However, it looks crisp in 1080p. Only the 4:3 ratio keeps it from looking more \"modern\" although I am not someone who absolutley needs my TV screen to be filled up. \n\nAnd the music, oh man the music. It is so dang catchy, I was always humming along to most of the songs. And the ones that I was not humming along with, were causing me to cry instead. It all fits perfectly wherever it needs to be.\n\nThe VN did actually change my opinion of the ending. Its something I now think the anime did not nail as well. I want to get into that, so for anyone who isn't familar with the material, leave and play/watch this.\n\nSPOILERS BEGIN\n\n\n\n[spoiler] It never sat with me that Nagisa was saved at the end. I felt like it would have been better to end with Tomoya living with Ushio and leave it with that. I never felt like her revival was a deus ex machina, since it is built up since the beginning, but I did feel like it was too \"neat\". And that feeling started to develop even more when the VN started to confront the theme of change, much more than in the anime. Until I hit this dialogue: \n\n                      \"Is our reaction supposed to be to say 'Ah, everything is always changing...?' But we're human beings \n                        Living creatures with emotions. Who fight with everything they have to keep from being sad, and \n                        from losing what's important to them.\"\n\nThat's when it hit me: Clannad is not saying change is inevitable and we should just always accept it and move on, it's saying that change is inevitable but some of it deserves to be fought. In fact, this theme is also prevelant in Tomoyo's route. Her whole goal is to prevent the sakura trees from being cut down, because she believes its a change for the worse. Once that realization hit me, the ending made much more sense. Tomoya and Ushio refused to accept Nagisa's death as a change that was acceptable and did everything they could to stop it. It made the whole end feel much more thematically relevant than I had thought before. [/spoiler]\n\n\nSPOILERS END\n\nI love Clannad. Whether as an anime or VN (but not the movie) I will always cherish it as a special experience that constantly blew my expectations out of the water.", "timestamp_created": 1505194066, "timestamp_updated": 1505194394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34894127": {"recommendationid": "34894127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058040250", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511151024}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65e5\u8bed\u82f1\u5b57\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u82f1\u8bed\u9a6c\u9a6c\u864e\u864e\u7684\u4eba\u8fd8\u82b1\u94b1\u4e70\u7684\u7406\u7531\u4e5f\u5c31\u53ea\u6709\u7ed9\u4fe1\u4ef0\u5145\u503c\u4e86\u5427", "timestamp_created": 1505185152, "timestamp_updated": 1505185152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34883062": {"recommendationid": "34883062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342033983", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505210920}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u97f3\u4e50\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1505137616, "timestamp_updated": 1505137616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34877253": {"recommendationid": "34877253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328623529", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505038100}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u4e2d\u6587\u7248", "timestamp_created": 1505108495, "timestamp_updated": 1505277603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34852582": {"recommendationid": "34852582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064999379", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464968053}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7eaf\u7cb9\u4e3a\u4e86\u60c5\u6000\n\u4f46\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u662f\u597d\u6e38\u620f\nps,we need chinese\uff01\n", "timestamp_created": 1505015616, "timestamp_updated": 1505015616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34846364": {"recommendationid": "34846364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096858338", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469908305}, "language": "english", "review": "This was the first true visual novel that I've ever played, and it remains my favorite for a reason.

If you're unfamiliar with the genre, think of this as like a \"choose your own adventure\" that starts at the same basic point but can branch off widely depending on your choices.  VNs like this are often erroneously called dating sims, but that's a different genre entirely.  VNs like this are more like a bundle of separate romance stories, the choices you can make in-game locking you in to one of the stories, or \"routes.\"  Once you finish a route, you can start the game from the beginning, making different choices, and see how that changes the story.  \n\nVNs like Nekopara or the Sakura- games have probably given VNs a bit of a negative reputation around here, but this game doesn't stoop to those lows.

If you love visual novels and love emotional rides then CLANNAD is for you.  If you loved the anime, this visual novel is for you.\n\nThe only potential issue from this superb work is that CLANNAD is quite lengthy.  Some people will find that to be a positive, others will find that it is a negative.  The story unfolds at a remarkably sedate pace (even compared to the anime) so the reader truly settles into the routine of school life.  But along the way you will be fully immersed with Itaru Hinoue's gorgeous art and Maeda's music.

No jogo, Clannad conta a est\u00f3ria cotidiana de certos estudantes colegiais japoneses, assim como nos mang\u00e1s, anim\u00eas e light novels japoneses.\n\nA est\u00f3ria passa centralizada em Tomoya Okazaki e em Nagisa Furukawa, este primeiro \u00e9 quem o jogador controla durante o visual novel.  Tomoya (ou qualquer outro nome que jogador queira renomear) entra no col\u00e9gio sempre atrasado ou falta em algumas aulas, \u00e9 t\u00edpico daquelas pessoas que os outros chamam de \"delinquente\", mas no fundo, Tomoya teve uma inf\u00e2ncia meio dif\u00edcil, al\u00e9m de que o conv\u00edvio com seus pais n\u00e3o era grande coisa. Tomoya acabou se machucando seriamente na adolesc\u00eancia e isso o impediu de participar de campeonatos esportivos como basquete, que ele sempre gostava. Tomoya acaba conhecendo Nagisa, uma menina de sa\u00fade fr\u00e1gil, mas muito d\u00f3cil e meiga (certeza que non ecziste uma pessoa assim na vida real). Mesmo suas personalidades n\u00e3o serem parecidas, o envolvimento entre os dois vai ficando mais \"\u00edntimo\" com o desenrolar da est\u00f3ria. Mas claro, Tomoya acaba interagindo com v\u00e1rias outras garotas do col\u00e9gio e isso \u00e9 que torna o jogo, um leque de caminhos at\u00e9 chegar a cada final diferente.\n\nGraficamente falando, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito o que se comentar, pois como o jogo inteiro \u00e9 com conversas e escolhas m\u00faltiplas do protagonista em mudar o rumo da est\u00f3ria, s\u00f3 d\u00e1 para se destacar no cen\u00e1rio e nos personagens interagindo no centro da tela em tra\u00e7os de anim\u00ea/mang\u00e1. Ali\u00e1s, j\u00e1 falando na divers\u00e3o e jogabilidade, este \u00faltimo n\u00e3o existe, pois voc\u00ea apenas aperta ENTER no teclado para prosseguir as falas e usa o mouse ou direcional para selecionar escolhas do protagonista e menus. Com a divers\u00e3o, talvez para alguns jogadores, Clannad pode ser bastante mon\u00f3tono, pois simplesmente n\u00e3o h\u00e1 a\u00e7\u00e3o ou novas variedades de jogos ou puzzles dentro de Clannad; apenas a est\u00f3ria rolando. Senti falta de op\u00e7\u00f5es de jogabilidade nesse sentido e isso tornou-se repetitivo e meio enjoativo. O som \u00e9 ok, com uma boa trilha sonora e vozes dos outros personagens com que voc\u00ea interage, menos a sua. Talvez o grande ponto forte do jogo mesmo s\u00e3o os personagens carism\u00e1ticos, como a Nagisa, a  Ryou e a Fuko. J\u00e1 n\u00e3o posso dizer o mesmo do Youhei Sunohara, o amigo bak\u00e1 do protagonista...\n\nPara quem curte jogos visual novel, como os japoneses e orientais em geral, Clannad \u00e9 um bom game com uma boa est\u00f3ria, pois o est\u00fadio respons\u00e1vel \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m criador de Air e Kanon, outros visual novels que, assim como em Clannad, ganharam vers\u00f5es em mang\u00e1s e anim\u00eas. Mas acho que faltou mais op\u00e7\u00f5es de jogatina, pois com o tempo, o jogo come\u00e7a a ficar repetitivo e cansativo, apesar da est\u00f3ria desenrolando. Eu acabei fazendo um final fraco, pois n\u00e3o selecionei as op\u00e7\u00f5es corretas durante o game. Estou tentando agora (at\u00e9 a data desta publica\u00e7\u00e3o) jogar com um tutorial para verificar outros poss\u00edveis finais. Recomendo para quem gosta do g\u00eanero e curte est\u00f3rias de colegiais japoneses, como nos mang\u00e1s e anim\u00eas. Por\u00e9m, para os \"gamers\" em geral, fica dif\u00edcil recomend\u00e1-lo.\n\nochogeek.blogspot.com.br", "timestamp_created": 1502473620, "timestamp_updated": 1502473620, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497878", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34168588": {"recommendationid": "34168588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360719040", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499304312}, "language": "schinese", "review": "We need Chinese", "timestamp_created": 1502458278, "timestamp_updated": 1502458278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34147791": {"recommendationid": "34147791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294103805", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502372587}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is relatively old, but is surely classic. It goes wider and deeper than the CLANNAD animation. Many of the stories that were not clearly illustrated in the animation can be found in the game. Thanks to these playthroughs I can now fully understand the entire construct of the TV anime. Owning to the multiple 'route' mechanism which is commonly seen in visual novels, the producers must have found it difficult to convert it to an anime. But I must say they did a splendid job. Some people found the anime endings confusing. If that's the case and they still love CLANNAD, I surely recommend this game as it clearifies lots of the mysteries. Judged individually apart from the consequent anime, the game is absolutely the best of its kind and we love it as much as the anime.\n\nThe game has minor shortcomings indeed. First there are very few animations. The game is old so that's fairly acceptable. Second, Tomoya has no voice cast. I know for sure that they want the 'player' to be at the center of the stage but after watching the anime it's a little bit weird. Finally, we need fully Japanese support for subtitles and UI. There are many translations that just not fit and sounds pretty bizzare. For the game is initially Japanese, I do not see much difficulty in adding language support.\n\nIf you are new to visual novel and CLANNAD, I'd recommend the anime at first hand since it can be more appealing and vivid that the game. But if you seek a deeper dive and ask more about the detials, there you go!\n\nP.S. Another thing great about the game is that it contains no \u2019\u30a8\u30ed\u2019 things considering its genre.

Its just a run of the mill high school story for the first 3 hours (cant speak for anything after that since i did not want to continue). You have almost no input on the story, and even when you get a choise, it seams meaningless, like how should your friend say hello to you in the morning. I had such high hopes for this game, since i like anime, visual novels and have heard so much praise about this game, but i cant see what that praise is aimed at. The music is mediocre but forgetable, there is not that many different visual aspects of the game, and the story was quite repetetive (at least for the fist 3 hours). you wake up, skeep morning class, eat with you buddy, skip another class, talk to a randopm person, visits your buddy that have had some smakk issues, and go home to dream. Thats it, mix it up with another random person at the next morning and that about all of the difference i have had so far.  I you want a slow and calm story about a highschool boy that have some issues, go ahead.

His mother died when he was young and his father is seeking refuge in drinking and gambling. One day after a fight Tomoya hurt his shoulder and is not able to play basketball ever again. After loosing this last resort Tomoya avoids his father and doesn't care about his education and gets easily aggressive, so he now is considered a delinquent. But after meeting a strange girl on his way to school his life is about to change....\t\t\nBasically you have 12 different paths to follow (9 with girls, 1 yaoi, 1 helping your teacher, 1 helping a guy searching for a job). Most of those paths are extremely sad. It is said it's impossible not to cry (something I can confirm). After playing through the game you eventually unlock After Story. It contains another 3 paths (1 Family path, 1 Sad Ending, 1 True Ending) and - Warning - the sad ending is going to destroy you. It is one of the most saddest story I ever read/played.\t\t\nI watched the Anime and played this game back in 2008 (poorly machine translated), so I knew what I was in for. It still crushed me and I could only play 3 - 4 paths each weekend. For me it's a masterpiece and there can only be one rating: [i]10 of 10[/i]\t\t\n\t\t\n[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\t8\tof 10\nThe Steam Version has upgraded graphics, so you could even enjoy it now, 13 years after it's original release. There is a good amount of CGs (even with slight alterations for mood, etc.), every character has his distinct features and the backgrounds are beautifully detailed.\t\t\nSadly the animations are outdated, so they seem kind of strange within the higher res graphics. They are not really fluid and you are almost immediately reminded of the old age. The game also has a nice opening movie, which is perfectly fine as an introduction. Sadly they decided to hide the movie in the main menu, but you'll also see it at the beginning of After Story, making the introduction of the characters totally weird and wrong placed. Still for a VN it's [i]8 out of 10[/i]\t\t\n\t\t\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\t6\tof 10\nThe BGM is pretty straight forward. There are a few themes for characters and situations und a few alterations. The funny parts try to be lively, the sad parts are slow and moody. It is so clich\u00e9 it's almost boring. And after playing the full 50+ hours you are ether hooked or annoyed. There are iconic pieces you will probably remember and recognize your whole life (but only 2 or 3)... to be honest: the anime is way better in this regard and I wished they would have included things like the dango-song in this game. They ether wanted to stay as close as possible to the original or they simply didn't think about it and just focused on the translation.\t\t\nThe Seiyuu did a great job back then. Now maybe a little outdated and a little in need of getting used to, but still: Here in Germany there a way worse voice actors making a lot more money.\t\t\nFor the voiced songs: There is an opening, an insert, a general ending song and the true ending song. Of course all of them are in Japanese, but luckily you get a synchronized English subtitle. If you love J-Music you will love these songs and probably remember at least one of them every time you read the name Clannad. Everyone else.... well you can skip Opening and Ending if you really have to. Altogether sadly I can only give a [i]6 out of 10[/i]\t\t\n\t\t\n[h1]GAMEPLAY (BALANCE)[/h1]\t9\tof 10\nThe gameplay probably hasn't changed in the last 30 years or so. You have skip, auto and can scroll back, if you want to read something again. Additionally you can go back to a previously made choice if you don't like the direct results. You get a CG Mode, a Music Mode and you can even change your Name (also I have to advise against it!). A Scene Mode is missing, understandable but sad.\t\t\nThen there is one of the best ideas: Dangopedia. It has many Japanese specific term and every one of these terms is highlighted, so you can read the meaning behind it. For those who are not familiar with Japanese Media or Japanese culture it makes the game fully understandable and enjoyable. Sadly for an otaku like me it is sometimes very distracting to look up some English expressions to find the Japanese ones so I could understand the meaning behind it. For a English native speaker it's probably easier (you won't have to think in 3 languages after all xD ). Well, there are always improvements to be made, but it's a solid [i]9 of 10[/i]\t\t\n\t\t\n[h1]GAME CONTENTS AND PRICING[/h1]\t9\tof 10\nThere are 15 paths and a playtime of 50+ hours (I actually played 62h and skipped all previously read text). If you permit it, you can laugh, cry and simply enjoy the all day scenes and the love story. So stop whining! It\u2019s a full price of 46 EUR for this masterpiece. Most I***ts pay more for 4h games like the 100th CoD. If you don't want to pay this kind of money simply wait for a sale or buy the key elsewhere. It's simply unfair to whine about a fair, reasonable price and try to scam developers and translators out of their earned money by raising a witch hunt.\t\t\nFor those who can enjoy a Visual Novel the pricing is admittedly a little high, but more than worth it. The DLCs on the other hand are ridicules. I can't imagine why a digital manga and artbook would be worth 33 EUR and I probably never find out unless they are on sale for at least 50%. Overall pricing and contents of the game alone are [i]9 out of 10[/i]\t\t\n\t\t\n[h1]MISCELLANEOUS[/h1]\t7.5\tof 10\nLike most games these days Clannad has trading cards and achievements. There are 7 Trading cards containing 7 of the 9 female love interests. The pictures to the cards are a simple full body of the character and a short description. If you want, you can try to get a set, but I can't neither recommend nor advise against it. The badge itself has the right Lvl 5 story wise and a nice foil one.\t\t\nThere are 4 achievements you probably miss without a guide. Of course those are not grindy or anything (It's a VN after all), but they are really hilarious to get. The other 18 are straight forward story achievement (14 paths (the sad ending is not credited), prolog and 2 lights(needed for true ending)). For a Visual Novel the achievements are pretty much perfectly reasonable. Let's go with [i]7.5 out of 10[/i]\t\t\n\t\t\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\t8.25\tof 10\nAlso I personally want to give this game a 10, I tried to stay as objectively as possible. But in the end it's still  8.25 Points. I can fully recommend this game. If you have the money and enjoy this kind of games don't hesitate: Buy and Play it ASAP. Everyone else is free to wait for a sale or a price drop, but this game is definitely a must-have for this genre!\t\t\n\t\n\t\n-----------------------------------------------------------\t\t\n[h1]EDIT/ADD - obligatory fanboy comment[/h1]\t\t\nAfter reading a few \"not recommended\" reviews I have to add: This game is 13 years old! Of course there are better games and obviously key has more experience now and with Little Busters a slightly better game (IMHO), at least the uncut version. You also have to embark the story to really enjoy it. It was one of the best VNs back then and it is now more of a classic non eroge visual novel. Art style? Resolution? Dating Sim? Like the Anime?

It's not bad, but it's far from being among the best.\nLittle Busters, from the same studio, is better in every aspects.\nCan we say that it's an overrated game? Yes, despite its qualities.\n\nThis Visual Novel can deliver good stories (Tomoyo, Fujibayashi) as well as mediocre ones (Yukine, Kappei) and the rest (Kotomi, Fuuko, Mei...) is just average in regards to others Visual Novels.\nNote that if you play without following a guide, you might end on a badly written route and be left with a bad impression.\n\nAs for Nagisa, she's supposed to be the central female character. The most developped, the best written one, but she's not. She's obnoxious, her personality is boring and her way of talking too. You have to really fall in love with her to put up with her for five minutes.\nIt's a shame to fail such an important character in this story, since you don't care nor feel anything when she meets problems.\n\nAfter that, the After Story part is not much better. It's long and often boring, to the point that anything can happen and you won't care because you have no emotional bond with the characters, especially Nagisa.\nAlthough the psychological evolution of Tomoya follows a logical progression until [spoiler]the birth of his daughter  [/spoiler], what happens next is unbelievable, in the wrong way. It destroys the relationship between the player and the protagonist, making him do stupid actions, incoherent and \nout of character. It's hard to keep relating to him when he suddenly acts like a pr!ck. I understand why the writer did it [spoiler] the link with his father [/spoiler] but it's very badly written.\n\nAnd above all, there's a lot of junk. What I'm calling junk is all those hours reading nothing. For hours and hours, neither the story nor the characters gain anything. There's no progression. That's exactly the kind of junk that must be cut in a real novel. There's no reason to keep it in a Visual Novel. It feels like the game has been written to boast \"we've made a X hour long game with X characters!\" only that it's an example of what should be cut (some characters add nothing at all) and the game would have been better without those millstones.\n\nThe other game, Side Stories, makes a better job at telling its stories because it goes straight to the point. No fillers, no useless characters. If only the original Clannad had been written like Side Stories...\n\nI'm putting a red thumb on it, not because the game is bad, it isn't, but because for the same price and mostly for all the hours you'll spend on it, it's better to read another VN.\n\n-----------------\n\n\nDepuis le temps que j'en entendais parler en bien, il \u00e9tait temps de le lire moi-m\u00eame.\nEt ceux qui disent que c'est un des meilleurs VN n'ont s\u00fbrement pas d\u00fb en lire beaucoup. Ce n'est pas mauvais, mais c'est loin d'\u00eatre parmi les meilleurs.\nLittle Busters, du m\u00eame studio, lui est sup\u00e9rieur sur tous les plans.\nPeut-on parler de titre surc\u00f4t\u00e9, overrated ? Oui, malgr\u00e9 ses qualit\u00e9s.\n\nCe Visual Novel est capable de proposer de bonnes histoires (Tomoyo, Fujibayashi) comme de m\u00e9diocres (Yukine, Kappei) et le reste est juste dans la moyenne de ce qu'on peut attendre d'un Visual Novel (Kotomi, Fuuko, Mei...).\nDu coup, si vous jouez sans guide, vous risquez de tomber sur une histoire rat\u00e9e et avoir une mauvaise impression.\n\nQuant \u00e0 Nagisa, elle est cens\u00e9e \u00eatre le personnage f\u00e9minin central. La plus travaill\u00e9e, la plus r\u00e9ussie, mais en fait, non. Elle est p\u00e9nible, sa personnalit\u00e9 est fatigante et sa fa\u00e7on de parler aussi. Il faut vraiment \u00eatre amoureux d'elle pour la supporter plus de cinq minutes.\nC'est vraiment dommage de rater un personnage aussi important dans l'histoire, car du coup on ne ressent rien quand il lui arrive des probl\u00e8mes.\n\nFinalement, l'After Story ne rel\u00e8ve pas vraiment le niveau. C'est long et souvent fatigant. Du coup, il peut arriver n'importe quoi, on s'en fiche parce qu'on n'a pas de lien \u00e9motionnel avec les personnages, surtout Nagisa.\nEt si l'\u00e9volution psychologique de Tomoya suivait une progression logique jusqu'\u00e0 [spoiler] la naissance de sa fille [/spoiler], ce qui suit juste apr\u00e8s est illogique et d\u00e9truit toute la relation entre le joueur et le protagoniste, en for\u00e7ant des d\u00e9cisions incoh\u00e9rentes et stupides. Difficile de continuer \u00e0 s'attacher \u00e0 lui quand il agit subitement comme un abruti fini. Je comprends les raisons de l'auteur [spoiler] le lien avec son p\u00e8re [/spoiler] mais c'est tr\u00e8s mal amen\u00e9.\n\nMais surtout, surtout, il y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de d\u00e9chet. Par l\u00e0, j'entends toutes ces heures de lecture qui n'apportent rien, ni \u00e0 l'histoire ni aux personnages. C'est exactement le genre de truc qui doit \u00eatre coup\u00e9 dans un vrai roman, aucune raison de le garder dans un Visual Novel.\nOn a l'impression que le jeu a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit pour dire \"on a un jeu qui dure X heures et avec Y personnages !\" sauf que c'est un exemple de ce qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre supprim\u00e9 (certains personnages ne servent absolument \u00e0 rien) et le jeu en aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 meilleur sans ces boulets.\n\nL'autre jeu, Side Stories, s'en sort beaucoup mieux pour raconter ses histoires car il va droit au but. Pas de remplissage ni de personnages inutiles. Si seulement le jeu Clannad de base avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit pareillement...\n\nJe mets un pouce rouge, non pas parce que le jeu est mauvais, ce n'est pas vrai, mais parce que pour le m\u00eame prix et surtout toutes les heures qu'on peut y passer il vaut mieux miser sur un autre VN.", "timestamp_created": 1499352706, "timestamp_updated": 1499352829, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483585", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33266146": {"recommendationid": "33266146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385185292", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1514550136}, "language": "english", "review": "I've Been an avid Key fan almost my entire life and i've gotta say Clannad is easily and without a doubt one of my favorite visual novels (Awesome anime too!), beautiful artwork combined with vivid storytelling are just a few of the \"Key\" ;) things that make this a wonderful experience and worthy use of my time no matter how many times I decide to re-play it.

But there are a few things to consider if you're thinking of buying this:\n\n1. Even by Visual Novel standards this is extremely a long read, like between 100-150+ hours to complete so be so be warned if you prefer your VN's around the normal length of 30-50 hours.\n\n2. This VN is one of the first that made VN's popular in the West, but saying that this hasn't aged well as it did come out in 2004 and today's standards of what VN's are different.\n\n3. Even the most diehard fan of this VN would tell you the pacing in this is snail's pace so if you want to jump in, beware its a very slow burner.\n\n4. The Characters are all amazing.... Well expect Nagisa she is very irritating so it does affect the enjoyment of the \"true route\" and the After Story as she is the Canon love interest which is a shame as others like Yukine, Kotomi and Tomoyo suit so much better but oh well. \n\n5. Despite it's age this VN is still full of heart, charm and humour that still matches up well with today's standards.\n\nSo in closing if this was 2004 I'd give this VN a solid 8/10 but now in 2017 I'd give it a more realistic 6/10 due to it being just not as good as today standards like I mentioned above. But still is one of those VN's you have to read at least once as if you don't you're just a damn casual...

How wrong I was. What I found was far and away the most engaging and heartfelt story I have ever experienced. I absolutely love Clannad and cannot recommend it highly enough.\n\nClannad is a visual novel originally released in Japan in 2004. Voices were added in a 2008 rerelease. In 2015 it was given an official English release. It is regarded by the visual novel community as a paragon of the genre and one of the greatest ever.\n\nClannad has several different plotlines which can be read in almost any order. These plotlines are mostly love stories. The content and quality of these are what make Clannad a legend. Rather than pander to sexual fantasies, Clannad's stories aim straight at the reader's heart. Some of these hit really close to home for me. At multiple points, I had to stop reading for a few minutes to collect myself before I could continue. Some were so good that I had to go back and reread them again just a couple of days later.\n\nIf you complete Clannad, you will cry at least once. Accept this going in. If someone tells you they completed it without crying, they're a liar.\n\nIf you're still on the fence, then consider that I was once in your position. I was unsure of if I should even give this game a shot. I took the chance based on word of mouth. Now here I am gushing over it. One of the best works of fiction I have ever experienced.\n", "timestamp_created": 1496107958, "timestamp_updated": 1496107958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 184, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.937033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32016319": {"recommendationid": "32016319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316629454", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497334074}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[h1] key\u793e\u795e\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5982\u8fd8\u662f\u6b7b\u5b85\u5417\uff1f\uff01\t[/h1]\n\u81f3\u5c11\u6211\u662f\u5165\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1495965911, "timestamp_updated": 1495965911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494382", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32012373": {"recommendationid": "32012373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161104489", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478315724}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u597d\u8bf4\u7684\uff0c\u8fc7\u6765\u8865\u7968\u7684\uff0c\u6b20\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u5e74\u628a\u4ed6\u8865\u4e0a\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1495950073, "timestamp_updated": 1495950073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733681", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31959959": {"recommendationid": "31959959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015233938", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496258953}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438\u0439 (\u043d\u0435\u0442) \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0430\u043b: \"\u0427\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0430, \u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e 19\". \u0418 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043b\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0434\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e IRL.\n\u041f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b \u0441 \u0431\u00f3\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043a \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u044e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c. \n13 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430/13", "timestamp_created": 1495747055, "timestamp_updated": 1495747055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31958747": {"recommendationid": "31958747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140326594", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509669270}, "language": "english", "review": "The reason why I bought the Clannad vn was that Clannad was, and still is, my favorite anime of all time.

Cette histoire est devenue en quelques ann\u00e9es un monument, une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence du genre particuli\u00e8rement r\u00e9put\u00e9e pour le tourbillon \u00e9motionnel qu\u2019elle provoque. \nEn effet, m\u00eame pr\u00e9par\u00e9 psychologiquement vous passerez in\u00e9vitablement du rire aux larmes et il vous faudra \u00e0 mon avis un peu de temps pour dig\u00e9rer l\u2019ensemble et attaquer une nouvelle lecture. \nVous incarnez Tomoya Okazaki, un jeune d\u00e9linquant que vous suivrez dans son quotidien qui se passe la plus grande partie en milieu scolaire. Un scenario en apparence classique mais qui cache une histoire bien plus riche et complexe.\nLa recette de Clannad, selon moi, c\u2019est d\u2019abord des personnages extraordinaires, compl\u00e8tement atypiques pour certains d\u2019entres eux, parfois touchants et \u00e9mouvants, parfois dr\u00f4les en tout cas tous attachants. C\u2019est aussi, une histoire bien \u00e9crite pour chacun d\u2019entre eux avec un voile de myst\u00e8res qui se l\u00e8ve peu \u00e0 peu en toile de fond. Le tout saupoudr\u00e9 de belles images et de sublimes musiques.\nEnfin niveau gameplay, le jeu est tellement riche en choix qui ont une incidence (m\u00eame minime) que \u00e7\u00e0 le rend assez difficile surtout que certaines routes ne se d\u00e9bloquent pas de suite mais d\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 on d\u00e9couvre facilement de nouvelles choses \u00e0 chaque fois qu\u2019on recommence.  \n\u00c7\u00e0 peut ne pas convenir aux personnes qui n\u2019aiment pas les romances, les drames et histoires poignantes qui jouent avec vos \u00e9motions. \nPar contre si vous \u00eates amateur de ce genre d\u2019histoire visuelle, Clannad est parmi ce qui se fait de mieux, comptez pas loin de 100h de lecture que vous n\u2019oublierez \u00e0 mon avis pas de sit\u00f4t.\n\n[h1]En conclusion : [/h1]\nClannad reste aujourd\u2019hui parmi ce qui se fait de mieux dans son genre. Une \u0153uvre unique qui joue avec vos \u00e9motions comme nulle autre. Que ce soit les personnages, l\u2019histoire et philosophie qu\u2019elle v\u00e9hicule, l\u2019art et la musique, tout frise avec la perfection. Si vous faite partit des chanceux qui ne connaissent pas encore cette histoire je vous la recommande vivement !\n\n[b]Bilan : 10/10[/b]\n\n[h1]English summary[/h1]\n\u00ab Clannad \u00bb Still remains one of the best visual novel.  A masterpiece that plays with your emotions like no other. Whether it be the characters, the story and philosophy it conveys, the art and the music, all is close to perfection.

As a grown man, I'm not afraid to say how much I've teared up and cried at a lot of the character paths in Clannad, and it only gets better as you continue playing, learning to understand the concept of how choices you make in your lives could lead to much bigger and better things in the future. Although the anime did an impeccable job of keeping as much content in the series as possible, the Clannad Visual Novel cannot be topped for having such a lengthy emotional rollercoaster of alternative endings.\n\nI'm still not fully finished with all of the potential outcomes of this VN, and having currently racked up over 60 hours (currently) to this game, I can't stress enough how well worth this purchase was, even at the seemingly steep \u00a330 price tag.\n\nIn particular I was surprised with Kotomi's Arc in this Visual Novel, which was much more detailed than shown in the anime. It is probably my favourite Arc of all, and helped me be thankful for and treasure the closest people in my life, as well as changing my perspective on how I should live. If you are even slightly interested in the concept of this franchise, I wholeheartedly and undisputably recommend this masterpiece of a story.\n\nA key aspect of the game that set me off many a time were the soundtracks featured. These consist of some of the most beautifully crafted musical scores I've ever had the pleasure of listening to, and every time I hear them brings back events, Arcs and character quotes which made for the Visual Novel to be as memorable as it was. I applaud whoever created the \"Shining In The Sky\" and \"To The Same Heights\" Soundtracks; they are my personal favourites.\n\nIf I had to give any advice for playing the Clannad VN, I would strongly suggest that you take your time playing through it. Don't think of it as something you can speedrun through and still enjoy; treasure every moment of the Visual Novel, funny, awkward or emotional, and the events that unfold will really have a lasting impact on you, hopefully for the better.\n\nTruly the best story I've ever read.\n\n~\n\nEDIT: After truly having completed all there is to this game, I feel the need to add a finishing note to my review.\n\nFinishing the After Story, after so much pain and sadness, was such a rewarding and complete feeling. It made me finally understand what it means to love and treasure those close to you, and make the most of the short time you have on this world.\n\nFor anyone doubting continuing with the After Story as a result of it being too heartaching (I've been there) be rest assured that it's all in perfect timing to come back around and complete the missing pieces of the puzzle, allowing you to rest easy and feel blessed that you had the chance to experience something as unique as this.\n\nNothing comes close to what CLANNAD has done for me.", "timestamp_created": 1495307482, "timestamp_updated": 1501776130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31813756": {"recommendationid": "31813756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125985313", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512002397}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1495066390, "timestamp_updated": 1495066390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31800974": {"recommendationid": "31800974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146310129", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496709403}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5165\u624b CLANNAD\u4e5f\u5feb\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6708\u4e86\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u505a\u5c31\u542c\u8bf4\u8fc7cla\u5927\u540d\u4f46\u8fde\u52a8\u753b\u90fd\u6ca1\u770b\u8fc7\u7684\u4eba\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u89c9\u5f97\u5b83\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u4e0d\u8bf4key\u793e\u4e00\u8d2f\u597d\u542c\u5230\u7206\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u5427\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7ed9\u6211\u8425\u9020\u7684\u6c14\u6c1b\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u6709\u90a3\u4e48\u4e00\u79cd\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u600e\u4e48\u8bf4\u5462\uff0c\u5b89\u9759\u4e2d\u5e26\u7740\u4e00\u4e1d\u60b2\u4f24\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u3001\u3001\u3001\u3001\u603b\u4e4b\u8fd8\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff08\u5c31\u662f\u53ea\u6709\u82f1\u6587\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u8fd9\u4e2a\u534a\u6587\u76f2\u6709\u70b9\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5927\u81f4\u8fd8\u662f\u80fd\u770b\u61c2\u7684\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1495009655, "timestamp_updated": 1495009655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518116", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31710816": {"recommendationid": "31710816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054910186", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506018816}, "language": "english", "review": "IT'S A FUCKIN' MASTERPIECE, it's a MASTERPIECE pop the champagne! *POP*\nCampagne drinkin' tonight, baby!

"I am going to assume that if you have found this game's page, then it is incredibly likely that you have come here having watched the rather brilliant anime done by Kyoto Animation. You are probably wondering if the source material lives up to that high benchmark. The answer is an unequivical yes. The anime focussed mostly on Nagisa's route, and interspersed the other ones as mini arcs whilst still focussing mostly on her. In the visual novel, you get the chance to see each girl's individual route properly (some of which weren't even alluded to in the anime), with all romantic elements intact, and with none of the brevity which the anime had to use in its adaptation. On top of this, unlike the anime, you are seeing all of the events from Tomoya's point of view, with his own thoughts constantly on display. This serves to make him the best developed character in the entire game, and adds new dimensions to him that are simply not there in the anime. This in turn makes every heartbreaking moment that much more poignant. Make no mistakes, although Clannad is deeply rooted in \"bishoujo game\" territory, Tomoya is by no means a bland self insert character. When going through the various routes, you make the decisions for him, but his personality will still dictate what happens. This is refreshing since a lot of VN protagonists can be a little one dimensional.\n\nIn terms of value for money, having played Clannad for over 30 hours (at the time of writing), I have currently completed less than half of the game, so if you are wondering whether the price of this visual novel is worth it, the answer is an indisputable yes. In terms of value, there are very few things that will give you the same bang for your buck as this gargantuan visual novel. For those unfamiliar with visual novels, they are much less interactive than a game, but more interactive than a book. The game is 99% reading text with 1% decision making, so be prepared for a good long read when you download this, since according to statistics fetched online, it has about as many words as nearly two readings of 'War and Peace' (approx 1.25m words). Just sit back, relax, and let the story wash over you. Take your time, complete the game's 12+ routes. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry like a baby, and if you're like me it will find a special place in your heart.  If you loved the anime and you are a keen reader, then this is an experience you will never forget.", "timestamp_created": 1492777467, "timestamp_updated": 1492777724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688716", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31243569": {"recommendationid": "31243569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278409555", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501853660}, "language": "german", "review": "Obwohl ich nicht sonderlich begeistert war vom Anime...

A princ\u00edpio  voc\u00ea pode pensar que o jogo n\u00e3o vale o pre\u00e7o, que \u00e9 apenas mais uma novela visual qualquer. Pois digo que este jogo ir\u00e1 lhe render v\u00e1rias horas para completar parte da hist\u00f3ria, e muito mais para platin\u00e1-lo.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria do jogo (e do anime) gira em torno da conviv\u00eancia e dos problemas tanto do protagonista, como os de todos os personagens envolvidos. Voc\u00ea \u00e9 um estudante do terceiro ano chamado Tomoya Okazaki, e grande parte dos envolvimentos ocorrem dentro de sua escola e ao caminho dela. N\u00e3o se preocupe, n\u00e3o vou aprofundar muito para n\u00e3o gerar spoilers.\n\nOs gr\u00e1ficos foram muito bem trabalhados, nota-se na aus\u00eancia de serrilhados e nos detalhes presentes em cada aspecto do jogo. A soundtrack \u00e9 incr\u00edvel e h\u00e1 uma grande variedade de m\u00fasicas ao fundo, contudo eles focaram demais na soundtrack e acabaram esquecendo a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o sonora e demais efeitos. O carisma e representa\u00e7\u00e3o dos personagens est\u00e3o estampados em suas falas e nas express\u00f5es faciais.\n\nAssim como grande parte das novelas visuais, voc\u00ea far\u00e1 escolhas em determinados momentos que influenciar\u00e3o no desfecho do jogo. Grande parte das conquistas tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o determinadas pelas suas a\u00e7\u00f5es, sendo liberadas ao final de cada rota.\n\nAchei um tanto ir\u00f4nico o jogo apresentar dublagem em japon\u00eas, mas n\u00e3o apresentar legendas em japon\u00eas. Tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o h\u00e1 legendas para demais l\u00ednguas, apenas o ingl\u00eas est\u00e1 presente. Isso pode fazer o consumidor n\u00e3o adquirir o jogo. Levando em conta o seu pre\u00e7o, receio que os desenvolvedores deveriam trabalhar esta parte e focar um pouco no p\u00fablico que n\u00e3o tem dom\u00ednio da l\u00edngua inglesa.\n\n[h1]Possui[/h1]\n[list]\n [*] Steam Achievements\n [*] Steam Trading Cards\n[/list]\n[h1]Sugest\u00f5es[/h1]\n[list]\n [*] Adicionar legendas de demais l\u00ednguas para abranger o

Never before have I experienced that level of intimacy with fictional characters before, I truly felt like I had lived Tomoya's life, and that made the emotional moments of Clannad feel more personally impactful than any other story I've ever read. \n\nThis was my second re-read and it was just as amazing the third time.

Previously read text can be fast-forwarded to quickly see all the deviations a choice will bring.\n\t[*][b]Epilogue[/b] --- \"After Story\", a full-length epilogue route for one of the main characters, moves past the safe and comfortable school setting. All of the previous problems faced by the protagonist are made trivial as he confronts the harsh realities of life and gradually becomes more sympathetic as a character. The large time skips throughout the route can be disorienting, but they do not serve as a detriment to any of the most impactful moments. After Story is worth the effort to unlock and the full experience is enough to steal the show.\n\t[*][b]Characterization[/b] --- Characters can start off with seemingly unnatural personalities that will clash with the reader's enjoyment of the story when they act out in ways that make situations needlessly complicated. After going through the proper routes, the sequence of events and reasoning that led them to have such demeanors is established. By the end, disliking a character will not be due to poor writing, but the fleshing out of their backstories and beliefs.\n\t[*][b]Tone[/b] --- Tone is appropriate as the story develops, especially during After Story.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n[list]\n\t[*][b]Several character routes[/b] --- The majority of routes range from okay to great, but there are several that are uninteresting or come across as afterthoughts during the writing of the visual novel.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nMemorable characters and a story that's usually charming, unexpectedly comedic, and at times tragic.

But it's true that few engrossed me as much as Clannad, that I just couldn't put them down (even when I tried). It's not flawless, of course, and I can even understand why some downright dislike it, but it's truly a remarkable experience.\n\nAs often with these kinds of things, it's largely due to the characters. Every single one, with the exception of a few purely villainous minor characters, is very likeable. Not always right away, there were some that I found difficult to like at first, but at the end I was fond of all of them. Whether they are tragic, fun or just plain sympathetic, at the end I cared about at least every major character and found myself deeply invested in their stories.\n\nThese stories are pretty diverse, with the characters having their own personal struggle. Pretty much all of them (with a few exceptions) are family-related (as that's the overall theme of the VN), like a girl trying to achieve a big goal for her brother, even when that means putting her own desires aside, a little sister seeing her brother fallen from grace, doubting that he even cares about her anymore, another one hooking up her sister with the boy she loves, deeply hurting herself in the process, and of course the daughter that is wracked with guilt, when she discovers how much her parents sacrificed for her sake.\n\nAs typical for VNs, these stories are spread out over several different routes, with the main character often (but not always) entering a relationship with the central character. While they're largely independent, it's not rare for them to intermingle with each other and finishing some routes can cause changes in others. One route even only gets fully concluded when another is played after it.\n\nIn its structure, Clannad typically follows a certain formula, in which things are pretty light-hearted and rather comedic at first, introducing and developing the characters, only for things to go wrong soon after. It's very effective, as it takes time to make you really like and care about the characters, which makes the tragedy that befalls them all the more painful. Once hooked, it's hard to stop, as you really want to see how things develop and hope that everything ends (relatively) well.\n\nOnce all the main routes are finished (and certain choices have been made), a continuation of one route gets unlocked (appropriately titled \"After Story\"). This isn't just a mere epilogue or extra, but an important (possibly even the most important) part, of the entire VN. It's practically composed of several \"mini-routes\", that follow the same pattern as before. It's here that the story hits the hardest, with the most heartrending scenes of the entire VN. Some might find it even too much, but keeping at it leads to a rewarding conclusion.\n\nVisually, Clannad is... not impressive. The characters tend to look rather off and many might be put off by the overall style. But it's not that bad and one gets used to it after a relatively short time.\n\nWhen it comes to sound, Clannad shines much more. Even without knowing language, the speech really enhances the experience with VAs all voicing their characters nearly perfectly, to the point they hard to imagine without them. The only negative is that the main character himself isn't voiced. Which isn't unusual in VNs, but very glaring here, as he has a very defined personality and even the most minor characters got voiced.\n\nThe music is just great. It's actually one of the best points of Clannad and greatly supports every scene, whether it's funny, mysterious, dramatic or (and especially) sad.\n\nHowever, it's not hard to point out flaws. One of the most glaring aspects is that the plots are rather blatantly built for the sake of drama. Several things don't quite make sense, characters tend to act in rather odd ways and quite some issues could have been avoided rather easily. Depending on how much you can tolerate these things (it's hard to outright overlook them), they can hamper your enjoyment of the stories.\n\nAs typical, \"gameplay\" consists of several choices, some important, others not so much. It's not always obvious what's what and some routes are heavily influenced by choices that don't seem to have much to do with anything. For unlocks, several specific choices have to be made and, as mentioned before, two routes have to be played in a certain order. That makes it rather tricky to get the full story. Using guides may therefore be preferable.\n\nAnd of course, Clannad is pretty expensive. As much as I like this VN and as much content as it has, it's rather tricky to defend the full price, especially considering that it's nearly 15 years old by now. Of course, with Steam having sales rather often, it shouldn't be hard to get it at a better price. It's certainly more than worth the \u20ac20 I paid for it.\n\nOverall, while some might find it too melodramatic, Clannad is a really great VN with likeable characters and interesting storylines. I can only recommend to at least try it out.", "timestamp_created": 1488653797, "timestamp_updated": 1488653797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30303354": {"recommendationid": "30303354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158733256", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488579214}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my first review here on Steam. And I am writing this because this games has surprised me like no other game has done before.\nFirst of all I cannot really explain why I bought this game in the first place. I am no fan of mangas, I have never played a visual novel before and I am not sure I have spent as much money on a game before here on Steam. I think it was the many positive reviews that made me buy Clannad and a curiosity of how I would like a visual novel game.\nWell, that money was well invested! Clannad managed to conquer the number one spot of my most favourite games which had forever belonged to Mass Effect 2.\nThe stories are so well written, the characters so funny and/or cute, all with their pros and cons. The game keeps getting better with each story because the more of the scenarios you play the better you get to know the different characters and the funnier some scenes are since you understand certain things better.\nA lot of people in other reviews stated that they started crying at various points in the game when they reached particularly sad parts of stories. When I read that I thought this could never happen to me because I had never cried when reading before. But I have to admit there were indeed a few scenes in the game where I fought really hard to keep my tears back, the stories were just so heart touching and emotional. I find it even more important though to mention that the moments when I laughed out loud far outweighed those sad moments. There are so many hilarious moments I find it hard to believe. I can definitely say that I have never laughed more in any other computer game before.\nI am simply glad I bought this game. It gave me many, many hours of enjoyment. And in 2 or 3 years when I start forgetting the details of the stories I can well imagine going back to this game and reading some of the favourite stories again.", "timestamp_created": 1488581224, "timestamp_updated": 1488581224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30291287": {"recommendationid": "30291287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192044211", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495719167}, "language": "english", "review": "Story rich and more feels, recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1488529193, "timestamp_updated": 1488529193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30277927": {"recommendationid": "30277927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360788786", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499321307}, "language": "schinese", "review": "In my opinion: It's best story in the world.", "timestamp_created": 1488462799, "timestamp_updated": 1488462799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759765", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30275182": {"recommendationid": "30275182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054315189", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 6463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488444917}, "language": "english", "review": "Clannad is definitely one of the best visual novels out there. More than three years after watching the anime series, I finally found the courage to face this heart-rending story again. Compared to the anime, the novel proceeds at slower pace, making you really fall in love with all the characters and enjoy their individual routes.\n\nMy three favourite routes were Nagisa's (+After Story), Kotomi's and Tomoyo's.\n\nOverall, I have next to nothing to complain about. Due to the tons of content (easily 100+ hours), I can confidently recommend buying the game to anyone who is interested, even for the full price.\n\nFinal rating: 9/10 (my second favorite visual novel)\n\n(Next section contains SPOILERS, so proceed with caution)\nThe only thing that leaves kind of a bitter aftertaste is the way the true ending in After Story is handled. First, you have to go through all the traumatic experiences of witnessing deaths of both Nagisa and Ushio. Then, you have to return to the point when Nagisa was still alive, to collect the last light orb from Akio's sidestory. That, by itself, horribly disrupts the gradation of the story. With all the light orbs, you gain access to the true ending, which is supposed to be some kind of a final closure to the novel. My problem is that the true ending basically denies all that makes After Story exceptional: devastated Tomoya getting up from the pits of despair while being saved by the gentle smile of his daughter. I feel that just brushing off all the events following Nagisa's death with some hardly explainable deus ex machina kind of spoilt my feelings about the ending. The best closure to the novel would be for the mentioned miracle to save dying Ushio and let her grow up by Tomoya's side. This is the only reason I cannot give Clannad 10/10, which I think it objectively deserves.

I heard stuff about this and on that fateful day this was on sale so I got it. I guess it was fate that brought me here. So in that sense I kinda got this game for free.\n\nUpdate:\n\nPeople might be looking at the price tag and get scared of it and ask themselves why in the world you would want to grab this game when it is just a visual novel with a very scary price tag. The game is actually worth the full price. 40 hours in and I still have a lot of things to do to see the True ending. The game contains a fair amount of story arcs and depending on your reading speed and settings can last from 5 to 10 hours each story arc. Not to mention trying out different decisions and seeing how it turns out would further the game time required to finish everything the game has to offer.\n\nSo what exactly do you get for that price tag? You get a visual novel experience with multiple story arcs and I would say a fair estimation of getting all the content it has to offer can go from 80 to 100 hours. The game is not a dating sim and focuses more on the story aspect of certain people that you will meet. Playing them until the end of their storyline will give you a clearer point of view on who is who and what is going on in the world. As much as possible I would like to avoid discussing the story  since you would be doing  yourself a disservice if you wouldn't go and experience the story yourself. The game can be a hit or miss in terms of what you actually do in-game but suffice to say that the stories in the game are some of the best stories that I have ever seen in a visual novel to warrant that price tag.\n\nAs ambiguous as this review is, all I can really tell you is to take that blind leap of faith when you can and see what Clannad has to offer. I am no fan of visual novels but this game really changed all that. On one hand it made me want to try a lot of visual novels that might have stories as great as this one. On the other hand it doesn't want me to try anything else for the fear of every visual novel after this not going to surpass what clannad did.", "timestamp_created": 1487440773, "timestamp_updated": 1488613119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498237", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30003409": {"recommendationid": "30003409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256881618", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488202606}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c, \u043d\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u044f \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043a\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0438 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0430. \u042f \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043b \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0438. \u0422\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u044f \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e!", "timestamp_created": 1487407931, "timestamp_updated": 1487408058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596760", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29998175": {"recommendationid": "29998175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164171717", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510638606}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u65e5\u6587\u548c\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65e5\u6587\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cea\u70b9\u53d8\u7b11\u70b9\u3002\u3002\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u592a\u5931\u8d25\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1487384450, "timestamp_updated": 1487384450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29996066": {"recommendationid": "29996066", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994372073", "num_games_owned": 594, "num_reviews": 336, "playtime_forever": 5081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491272822}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Some of the saddest shit I've ever seen in a video game[/h1]\n\nYou play any route in this VN and it's really sad.

Sometimes the answer is obvious,  other times it's a coin flip. There's a convenient steam guide filled with the right choices.\n\nSince it's such a time-consuming endeavor to finish this game you'll be tempted to talk about the plot twists and arc conclusions with other people.

They paint a warm picture of humanity. Portray people as warm people who offer themselves in support of their peers. Conferring warmth. They conceive of conflicts and problems and death and sorrow as inevitable waves upon the tides of life, that are faced, battled, and overcome with unselfish love, genuine care. The warmth of human interactions. A warm world where amidst the inexorable hardships people are good, loving, kind.\n    A warmth that people, perhaps rightfully, deride as unrealistic.

Otherwise, they would have suffered an overwhelming defeat.\n\nEvery single route is packed with funny moments, slow-paced dialogues that show us in detail the development of the relationship, and the main reason this game became so famous: it's heartbreaking scenes. \nTo be honest, some parts are not even SO sad, but you still go into an abnormal crying because of the music. \nThat's also one of the best things of this game. When mixing some parts of this soundtrack with a not-so-sad escene, you cry. But when you do it with a truly sad scene, i swear the fucking tears become uncontrollable. If you appreciate good, long and tearful stories, there's no reason to hesitate to buy this game. \n\nThere is some people that get bored with slow paced stories, and i guess this game is not for them. Clannad is a very slow game, its script is huge and while it has a lot of funny, interesting, happy and sad escenes, there is also a lot of almost irrelevant dialogue, that would painfuly kill the kind of people who prefers to get into the relevant parts of the story faster.\n\n\nAnd please, DONT JUST WATCH THE ANIME AND IGNORE THE GAME. COLABORATE WITH THE ANIME/MANGA INDUSTRY FOR ONCE IN YOUR DAMN LIFE!\nBesides, it has a lot of altered scenes, and it is going to feel awkward to find out that every scene happens far before or after the anime told you. Also, it mixes all routes on one timeline... and you will see them for separated here.

Those games absolutely butcher the reputation and image of visual novels all around the world. I honestly cannot tell anyone (even in real life) that I play visual novels and I have to play them in steam offline mode because of bad visual novel reputation in general.\n\nThis game is NOT, i have to emphasize, IS NOT like those games. It has absolutely NOTHING in common with those pathetic excuses of video games.\n\nTHIS is what visual novels are all about.\n\nMasterfully written story and background music is very well done. Protagonist is really easy to relate to and he is a really interesting guy to interact with. The dialogue between him and the other characters is very well thought of. The stories themselves are also very well written, combining romantic comedy with some highstrung drama.\n\nThis game is so fun to read, it has the BEST side character of any visual novels that I know of (Sunohara) who is absolutely hilarious. It has has many scenes that get you thinking about a lot of things in life like how people who have given up on other people or the world think and personally for me... i can relate to lot of things in this game (I think the morals for the protagonist echo with mine) I wonder if its same for you reader but either way, this game is really well done.\n\nAnd you know whats the best thing about this game? It has absolutely ZERO erotic content and the game is still one of the best selling visual novels in japan by writing, music and voice acting alone.\n\nAll erotic games have going for them is the erotic scenes and everything else is crap. This game does NOT ride on the erotic scenes or anything of the like. None of the effort was wasted on making erotic scenes and it all went into the making of the game.\n\nI would really rather not spoil anything about this game but if you like visual novels, this is a MUST READ. It is absolutely one of the best \"innocent\" visual novels in existence right now.\n\nIf you like this review and buy this game, play it through and if after that, you like it, I highly recommend other KEY visual novels like Kanon, Air and Little Busters.

Snowfield is honestly one of my favorite song in videogames, making me cry because of the beauty of the scene it was involved in.\n+ Afterstory is my favorite 2nd half in a visual novel alongside Steins;Gate, evolving its themes to a much more family orientated setting as well as providing emotional heartbreak that no other game could ever provide except this one.\n+ The ending is amazing and the use of the \"orb lights\" is one of my favorite plot elements ever, being detailed enough for hardcore analysis on the role it played in the final moments of Clannad.\n+ The Illusionary World is absolutely genius.\n+ Another aspect I enjoy about the themes of Clannad is that they are family orientated and could honestly help anyone in need of advice on what to do with their life, offering many unique perspectives on certain ideals that are evident in the world we live in.\n- Art is charming however it is definitely not for everyone.\n- The game is on average 80+ hours, being one of the longest videogame scripts EVER!!!\n\nOverall Clannad was a 10/10 for me. I don't think I have experienced a story as great as this one since the original Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0. The way Clannad tells its story in such a simple but unique way, constantly evolving with time progressions is truly a thought provoking and \"valuable\" experience. I'd recommend this to anyone that wants to involve themselves in the \"Visual Novel\" medium as it is the best one I have ever played besides Steins;Gate.

I've watched the anime, and I loved the VN! If anyone wants to support Key Visual Arts (TM), or is a HUGE, HUGE fan of the anime, this is your game!\n\n[!SPOILERS BELOW!]\n\nPros:\n- All your favorites characters\n- You can follow your own paths, or follow the anime's path!\n- More than what the anime offered\n- Music like in the anime, but so much more!\n- Dialogue is very close to perfection\n- You'll love the characters in a matter of minutes after meeting them!\n- You can make your own choices\n- Multiple endings\n- Supports your computer greatly; little to no lag at all!\n- You get to name the main protaganist!\n- Hitting 'esc' will not close the game!\n- Has a encyclopedia to explain things you encounter in the game\n- Get to experience the events that took place in the anime, and other events that weren't in the anime!\n- Music is in High Quality, and is very memorable\n- Slow build up, but keeps you intact, and interested through-out the entire play!\n- Doesn't throw you into the main story right away, but lets it slowly build into it\n- Nagisa! \\(^-^)/\n\nCons:\n- Sunohara (HEY!!!)\n- Some dialogue can be confusing, but not greatly\n- Sometimes the dialogue feels like its been drug out, but not too much to cause issues\n- Have to adjust the volume settings of the music, character VAs, etc, but editing is pretty self-explanatory\n- You have to play through to be able to build up your encyclopedia, b/c you aren't giving them all right away; again, this isn't a grave issue, as it's common stuff if you've been watching anime for a while\n- Again, Sunohara (YOU'RE DOING THIS ON PURPOSE!!!)\n- Sometimes you can't choose a dialogue choice where you feel it's necessary, which gets a little fustrating\n- Japanese VAs only atm; this isn't an issue for me, but for others, eh...\n- Some events are exactly the same like in the anime, but there're some things different, so don't worry!\n\n\nI'm really enjoying this game, and I hope you all who're considering it enjoy it as much as I am, if not more!

Many of this game's tracks are about as iconic as the game itself, and most likely will keep ringing in your head for a little while. The intro song (from the trailer) will play if you wait at main menu for a moment.\n\nIf you are going for all the scenarios/achievements, you will be spending a great while playing this, at least if you follow the story each time without skipping. Although if you do that (like I have), the first parts especially will get a bit repetitive.\n\nAlso, the price is a bit high, though that probably depends on you. If you can get this on sale or for free, you should buy it. I recall getting this on sale, and thinking back, full price might have still been worth it. The Dangopedia, CG collection and music list please my inner collector.\n\nThis game will make you laugh and cry.

1494037766}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, first things first: I know it says I have less than two hours on this game, but that's because I usually play this game without internet. With that said, I'll get on with the actual review.\n\nThe short version:\nIf you like visual novels and crying, and you're fine with the giant eyes, play this.\nIf you've watched the anime and liked it, PLAY THIS. IT HAS SO MUCH MORE CONTENT.\n\nThe long version:\nI bought CLANNAD during a sale earlier this year. I'd watched the first season of the anime, but I wanted to finish the original version in its entirety before finishing the anime.\n\nAnd it was worth it.\n\nAlmost every route follows the same pattern: a bit of a rough start, then everything slowly but surely improves. But just like with a rollercoaster, right when you reach the top, a huge downward plummet. Right when it seems like there's no hope, though, a light shines through. Usually, the endings aren't perfectly happy, but that isn't how life works anyway. It might seem a bit repetitive, but somehow it never gets old. Afterstory also follows this pattern, although the plummet is even worse. Won't explain why, to avoid spoilers. Just see for yourself. I'll say this, though... they really know how to make the visual novel genre work for the story itself.\n\nBut anyway. The writing of this game is superb. The fellas at Key really know how to get you attached to a character, so that they can cause you extreme pain when they thoroughly break them. When the game isn't actively torturing you, it can also be very entertaining. There are a lot of hilarious, perverted, and usually both, scenes. I'm actually surprised at how many lewd jokes and scenes they threw into this. A lot of then weren't in the anime, so if you're here checking out the game because you liked the anime, lemme tell you, you'll find a lot of great content here. No hentai, though, (un)fortunately. There are also a lot of references to other media. Fuko's Doraemon carving, the stuffed Snoopy the gang were trying to get for Kotomi, Akio's Gundam collection... the list goes on. The art style might not be agreeable to some, but if you find it bearable, I urge you to stick with this for the sake of the story.\n\nIf there's one thing that I don't like about the visual novel, though, it's how some routes seem forever unlinked. I mean... although some characters seem to be all right even if you ignore their route, it seems some you're just abandoning. For example, the cat. It seems Misae will find out in both her and Tomoyo's route, but what about Nagisa's? Will the canon path have the cat forever unrevealed? And Kotomi.... will she NEVER meet her only childhood friend again? I just feel bad for them.

Manche, die dieses Review lesen werden, habe m\u00f6glicherweise den Anime gesehen, andere interessieren sich f\u00fcr Visual Novels und wieder andere sind vielleicht zuf\u00e4llig \u00fcber dieses Juwel gestolpert. Wof\u00fcr habe ich dieses Spiel nun also nominiert? Zweifelslos f\u00fcr die \"Ich weine nicht, ich hab' nur was im Auge\" - Kategorie. \nF\u00fcr diejenigen, die Visual Novels nicht kennen: CLANNAD ist kein Spiel im klassischen Sinne. Vielmehr ist es ein Roman, der durch einen Soundtrack, Hintergrundbilder und Charaktersprites unterlegt ist. Das einzige wirklich spielerische Element sind die Entscheidungen, die zu treffen sind und \u00fcber den Ausgang der Geschichte, \u00e4hnlich eines Abenteuerromanes, entscheiden.\nDas Spiel selbst ist ein zeitloser, allerdings auch bereits \u00fcber zehn Jahre alte, Klassiker des VN-Genres. Mit Gewiss \u00fcber 100 Stunden Lesezeit f\u00fcr alle Routen ist CLANNAD eine der gr\u00f6\u00dften mir bekannten Produktionen und erst seit kurzem auf Steam und offiziell ins Englische \u00fcbersetzt. Der Preis mag f\u00fcr ein so altes Spiel erschreckend hoch wirken und ist es nat\u00fcrlich auch. Doch ist es nicht die G\u00fcte des Produktes, die ihm seinen Wert verleiht?\nInhaltlich erwartet euch in CLANNAD die Geschichte Tomoyas, ein demotivierter Obersch\u00fcler mit Familienproblemen, der keinen Sinn in seinem Leben zu finden vermag, bis er eines Tages am Fu\u00df des H\u00fcgels, auf dem seine Schule erbaut ist, ein M\u00e4dchen trifft. Im Laufe des Spiels lernt Tomoya noch viele weitere Personen kennen und je nach den getroffenen Entscheidungen beeinflussen diese Personen sein Leben. Mit viel Humor, interessanten Einf\u00e4llen f\u00fcr jede Route und nicht zu \u00fcberbietender Emotionalit\u00e4t ist CLANNAD f\u00fcr jeden etwas, der einer entschleunigten aber tief bewegenden Geschichte nicht versagen kann.\nWer Tomoyas Geschichte(n) vollst\u00e4ndig genie\u00dfen will, sollte sich bewusst sein, dass daf\u00fcr (fast) alle Routen abgeschlossen werden m\u00fcssen, da die sogenannte \"After Story\" freigespielt werden muss. Hierf\u00fcr empfehle ich auf Steam oder im Internet einen Guide zu konsultieren.\nDie \u00dcbersetzung ist professionell gemacht und vermisst eine \u00dcberzahl an Rechtschreibfehlern und die Sprache wird dem Werk gerecht. Zus\u00e4tzlich hat sekaiproject ein Register eingef\u00fchrt, welches japanische Eigenheiten und Hintergrundinformationen zu Anspielungen bieten soll. Es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall beim Lesen dort einmal hinein zu schauen.\nZusammenfassend ist dieses wahrliche Juwel des VN-Genres sein Geld bis heute wert: die Geschichte ist zeitlos und kann sich mit der Hochliteratur unserer Zeit mehr als messen, ist dabei aber auch Unterhaltungsliteratur zugleich. Es ist vollst\u00e4ndig synchronisiert (Japanisch nat\u00fcrlich) und in dieser Ausgabe wunderbar \u00fcbersetzt. F\u00fcr jeden VN-Liebhaber ist CLANNAD auf jeden Fall ein must-have.

Every character felt so in-depth and made you feel like you personally knew them.\nThe anime (If you would call it the Nagisa route) managed to make me feel every explainable feeling at some point in time. It is also the only thing I've ever heard of to manage to have a happy, sad, tragic, and relieving ednging at the same time. I would be in no way surprised if the creator of Clannad majored in psychology and was a genius in the art of it.\nIf I had to give it an honest rating, I would say 10/10. \nIt is masterful in the art of a \"phychological living\" if that makes sense, as well as being in-depth and really making you honestly laugh and cry.\nI'm not sure how to format a review, or even if I'm qualified to review this, but those are my feelings.", "timestamp_created": 1479975854, "timestamp_updated": 1479975854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

quick-paced game. It's nice and laidback, but it will take you a long time to get through, and you probably will get bored at times. The pace can be pretty slow, especially if you're not using a guide, as there are so many wrong choices that don't seem like wrong choices. So I would recommend using a guide just to avoid frustration.\n\n Aside from that, once the pace picks up, this is a really great read. The characters are great, the drama is great, and the soundtrack is amazing and definitely worth a purchase if you can find it. The drama may be a little over-the-top at times for some, but if you take the time to get invested in the story and the characters, you will never forget it. I still think of some of the endings from time to time, months after I've finished the game, and I still get goosebumps when listening to the soundtrack. \n\n Definitely worth a play, but if you're not sure/not used to visual novels, I would try something cheaper first just to explore the format, or grab this on sale price..", "timestamp_created": 1479970554, "timestamp_updated": 1511423309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27053548": {"recommendationid": "27053548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096595812", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511523905}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e5f\u4e0d\u8bf4\u4e86\uff0c\u5148\u8fd8\u4e2a\u503a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1479970553, "timestamp_updated": 1511441203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27051056": {"recommendationid": "27051056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142318246", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479969589}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u6ca1\u54ed\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u773c\u775b\u91cc\u8fdb\u4e86\u70b9\u6c99\u5b50", "timestamp_created": 1479969858, "timestamp_updated": 1479969858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27048536": {"recommendationid": "27048536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311055381", "num_games_owned": 1495, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 5528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "last_played": 1514554113}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]For the anime fans:[/h1]\n\nIt has become my favorite Visual Novel - it is that good.

have heard people raving about it so there has to be something about it that's great right?\n\nThe first thing most people would say is \"it's a visual novel.  If I wanted to read I'd pick up a book (LOL)\" but really, there's more of a choose your own adventure aspect to it rather than merely reading a book from start to fiinish.  The second thing people would say is \"I saw the anime so there's no real need to play this\".  Maybe (sniff) Maybe.... but seeing the anime and knowing the story doesn't diminish the story in any way...in fact it may make it even better since you'll already have a fondness for a certain character and will want to do everything in your power to run through that character's path first.\n\nIf you HAVEN'T seen the anime, this is what you youngsters would call \"a feels trip\".  You tough types will want to play this with the doors closed so nobody sees you well up with tears in your eyes near the end.  Just tell them you're fapping and that's why you locked the door (sob).\n\nIt's a story that's got a little of everything in it.  Love, Friendship, Comedy, Tragedy, Struggle, Pain, Success? Only you can tell in the end...Even now I hear the theme song playing in the video on the store page and get a lump in my throat for various reasons. \n\nWhat? No... shut up... I stubbed my toe on the table walking in here... I'm fine.  Leave me alone, I'm trying to review a game in here.\n\nSheesh...people.\n\nAnyway, so the high points:\n[list]\n   [*] It has a really great story\n   [*] There are multiple paths so unlike the anime, you have to focus on one and play it through to the end\n   [*] But you'll WANT to play it again...there's a benefit to doing so beside merely seeing the other paths.\n   [*] The music is pretty emotional...even that stupid \u3060\u3093\u3054\u5927\u5bb6\u65cf big dango family song. It adds a lot\n   [*] All the original voices are in this game so if you've seen the anime you'll feel right at home and if not it'll feel just like the game when you do go see it.\n[/list]\n\nlow points:\n[list]\n   [*] Playing the game consists of reading and occasionally choosing something for the main character to do.  If you're looking for a real adrenaline rush then this isn't it\n   [*] Maybe in places it's a bit TOO emotional but it's still worth it.\n[/list]\n\nThat's it.. there's way more good than bad, and the bad isn't so much bad as it is just not socially acceptable for a guy to feel emotional about stuff like this.  But you know what? Fuck it... I voted this for the \"I'm not crying, there's something in my eye\" award and that's how it is.   If anything other than this wins that award, it's because they've never played this game.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1479957432, "timestamp_updated": 1479957432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32,

That's just the kind of person I am.\u201d - Nagisa Furukawa\n\nCLANNAD is arguably one of the most famous and influential visual novels out there. It's earned a cult following for sporting some of the saddest, most bittersweet stories guaranteed to pull your heartstrings and wring your tear ducts. Yet, it's not all melancholic gloom. The story is beautifully harmonised with cute moments of moe and romcom. The Kickstarter for CLANNAD's English translation fetched a whopping $500,000 USD, the highest on record for a visual novel as far as I know. That should stand as a testament to how many people loved the game, despite it being more than a decade since its Japan release.\n\nThe game follows a wide cast of heroines with numerous possible routes, including the soft-spoken introvert Nagisa, tomboyish prankster Kyou, studious beauty Kotomi and innocent loli Fuuko. Every character is memorable and unique in their own way. \n\nOne of the most contentious aspects of the game is its art. For most, it's something that they'll either love or hate. I'll admit that I didn't enjoy the art too much at first, having been spoiled by the anime studios of 2010 and beyond, but it eventually grew on me. If I had to describe the art I'd say that it's unpolished, but endearing, much like the art of Higurashi When They Cry.\n\n(Random fun fact: In The World God Only Knows, Katsuragi Keima's 2D waifu \"Yokkyun\" was based off Nagisa's artwork from CLANNAD.)\n\nAnother controversy was raised over the price of the game upon its Steam release. Commanding a $50 price tag for a game over 10 years old?! \n\nWhile the pricing is undeniably steep, what most critics fail to notice is that CLANNAD is the longest visual novel on Steam by far, with no titles coming close except perhaps Muv-Luv. The game easily takes 50 hours to complete, and I must applaud Sekai Project for coming up with a quality, error-free English translation of so much text. Also, the game was released in its entirety, and not in episodic/chapter format unlike numerous other VN titles on Steam, a practice which I'm very keen to support!\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed the anime (or even if you didn't), consider getting this VN for a much more fleshed-out story and some unbelievably immense Niagara Feels.\n\nThanks for reading till now.

Can't recommend enough, which is why I chose it for probably the only review I'll ever do.\n\nCompletely in love with this VN. I was skeptical because it was released in 2004, and is still a $50 game. but after much more hours played than shown here(I usually play in offline mode), I have come to the conclusion that I feel awful for not paying full price. The creators made so much content, and did such a wonderful job that I would consider getting it for other people. But definitely not during a sale.\n\nMy only complaint would be that there is a \"True Ending\", which while adorable and well written in itself, takes away from the other girls' endings based purely on the fact that there is only one you should end with. Even with this though, they do a very good job in making everyone's ending amazing, and stopping before the true ending opens will only hurt because you want more. \n\n\nArt 8/10- The art is definitely dated, and artists can do much better by hand. BUT considering that it was made in '04, and it fits the feel of the game with how silly it can be, and how well it defines the emomtions of characters, I will give it a solid rating.\n\nGameplay 9/10 - Little kinks here and there, but most of the quirks in talk are explained in the \"dangopedia\"(which even the name of the in-game dictionary connects to one of the characters)\n\nStory 12/10(or 5/7 if you're a memelord) - multiple times where I didn't get enough sleep for work because I didn't realize how much time had passed while bawling my eyes out or laughing so much. You definitely feel the full spectrum of emotions in this VN, you get a personal connection to many of the characters, and each story is long enough to be a seperate VN.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoy VNs, and are even remotely considering this game, buy it now. Don't wait for a sale, or you'll probably end up regretting buying it on sale like I did. My general standard is 1-2 hours of enjoyable gameplay per $1 spent, and even at full price, it well exceeded that.\n\n\nEDIT: Capitalizations, and a slight rewording for clarification", "timestamp_created": 1477131694, "timestamp_updated": 1479760022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508135", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26153650": {"recommendationid": "26153650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193974294", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500233872}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't finish this game yet [And didn't even reach the 15 % of this game] \nThis game had a REALLY REALLY Long story.......[And it a really really good too]\n\nSo if you guys are looking for visual novel that had a lot of story and a lot of routes....I recommend this game !!! \nIt really worth the price :)\n\n[It an old visual novel so don't expect the good art from this game.

If you eat up visual novels like candy, there's no reason not to think that you'll love Clannad, as most of these reviews are pointing out. But maybe you're like me and are a bit tired of outdated anime tropes taking up hours of your time for a simple misunderstanding, or because the girl is 'too embarassed'... well, honestly, Clannad has some of that too. Refreshingly though, it's really not that jarring nor frequent.\n\nLet's get the cons out of the way first, for a big purchase like this you should know what you're getting into if you have high standards. Obviously I'm in the 'you should buy it' camp, but there is still room for some eye-rolling. If you want to get every route in the game, there's a route with a creepy over-sexualization of a minor (nothing sexual happens, but she is sexualized), not to mention that route suffers from one of those obnxious over-the-top suffering scenes, where really a teacher should have been called. It's about the worst it gets though. Besides that, there are a few repetitive jokes, and semi-overt anti-gay sentiment (mostly, they say people are gay to make fun of them), and a lot of casual Japanese-themed sexism. It's not as bad as other games, but seeing as this came out early 00's, you probably shouldn't expect it to feel very progressive. The girls are pretty diverse and interesting, but every once in a while it throws in a line like, 'you shouldn't help me because you're a boy' which is like... meh, I 100% would have helped with her sewing, I'm not scared that thread is going to suck my testosterone dry... whatever. \n\nBut on the positives, this is a really fun game. The main character is fleshed out very well over time, and is refreshingly honest and straight-forward for the most part. He is lazing about going day-to-day without any real goals or meaningful relationships. There are tons of different paths you can go on, not just with different girls, but interacting with different groups of friends depending on how to act. It's very in-depth with its ability to bring several elements together based on your previous actions. It's interface is also probably the best I've seen, very easy to use and helps with whatever you need. \n\nIt's hard to describe 80+ hours worth of story and characters, while at the same time covering mostly just a month or so of time. This game feels professional, yet it can sometimes feel like you're just hanging out with your friends. There's lots of lessons in this game that resonated with me, and a lot of jokes that make me laugh out loud. I'm usually pretty stoic when I'm reading, so it was a pleasant surprise when it was able to make me laugh and cry. If you're like me, this isn't a crazy tearjerking festival, but it cetainly went far enough to make me tear up on the route I was most invested in. This is good though, because it means this isn't melodramatic. There are difficult things that happen, but they all feel very realistic and earned. \n\nTo me, some routes felt a bit forced at parts, or maybe they appealed more to a Japanese audience, but overall the stuff that worked REALLY worked. Even characters I hated at first became dear to me in their own way. Unlike most VN protagonists, I never feel frustrated by Okazaki. He was light-hearted, easy-going, and pulled a lot of pranks. He has tons of issues to work through, but probably ended up being my favorite character of the game. It's nice to have a protagonist who's a underdog, but still feels like he deserves being admired by all these girls. I'd want to be his friend too, and it's nice to see him get off his ass and find a reason to keep going. \n\nSo tons of varied content, realistic slice-of-slife with down-to-earth problems, doesn't take itself too seriously or poke fun too much, and professional interface and voice acting. It's probably not going to blow your mind like something with sci-fi or supernatural/horror, but you'll probably remember it for a really long time, like it was a school year of your own.", "timestamp_created": 1476474904, "timestamp_updated": 1476474904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504271", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26022021": {"recommendationid": "26022021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000457680", "num_games_owned": 1046, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476409225}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was beautifully written and emotionally gripping.

Then I played it....and played it...and played it.\n\nTo Begin with, the story is awesome.You will play as Tomoya and try to get throught the third year of highschool.You met many people with different characteristics. It's a nice piece of Slice of Life and got also a lot of Drama in it and the best thing is the romance which will grab your heart and will never let go of you.You're feeling the emotions of every single character.Fun,Sadness,Depression... you will feel everything and get the connection to the Character himself. It also isn't important which route you go, cause every girl has her own magnificent story.(I played the anime version first^^) \n\nThe next thing i want to mention is the number of possible routes. I think it's a fair amount and also you got many other funny choices. Cannot say to much about it cause i havn't played that many visual novels.\n\nThe music is just stunning. There were so many moments in this game when i stopped clicking just to hear the music.(But for real, who wouldn't listen to the Dango Daikazoku-Song ^^). Also you have the possiblity to listen to all the songs in the main menu,\n\nEverytime when a new artwork appeared my heart skipped a beat. All these fantasic pictures have brand a mark into my brain.They were full filling me.\n\nI'm also an achievmenthunter and was really happy when i saw that this game have some. They weren't to hard to get cause you just have to play all routes^^\n\nThis game is just a masterpiece and stand in nothing after the anime. I cried 3-4 times when I watched the anime and so did I when i played this game. Whats also very important is, is the fact that when you finished every route you can play the afterstory which is the best part of all=)\n\nI just can recommend it and if you don't play the game it's ok, but at least give the anime a chance^^\n", "timestamp_created": 1474056718, "timestamp_updated": 1474056718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25523193": {"recommendationid": "25523193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144505628", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494277640}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6c42\u6c49\u5316\u554a\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1474011095, "timestamp_updated": 1474011095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25521088": {"recommendationid": "25521088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093566319", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512841437}, "language": "english", "review": "Dehyrdation Simulator: 10/10 Would cry again\n\nJust buy it already.\n\nNo, but seriously Clannad is a great visual novel. If you're in the neighborhood for a good visual novel that'll bring you both joy and sadness look no further. Key did a fantastic job with this visual novel. For those who have watched the anime, like myself, I can say you will experience deja vu since the visual novel is what the anime is based on. That being said, if you enjoyed the stories in the anime you will enjoy the visual novel even more. Full disclaimer: Clannad's entire game isn't in the anime. A good chunk is, but many of the really great routes never come to life in the anime for continuity and time issues. You can fall in love with so many characters. I recommend following a spoiler free walkthrough. I just looked up \"Clannad Walkthrough\" on google and used the first result. It just shows you which decisions to make if you want to play a specific route. You will need to play some of the routes to unlock the after story, but honestly to get your money's worth play them all. It took me ~50 hours to do everything. Once you've played Tomoyo's route I recommend picking up Tomoyo After: Its a Wonderful Life when you got $20 to spare. I just finished it and it's AMAZING, I'll be reviewing it as well. \n\nThere are about 14 routes I believe. There will be some similarities to routes until you really reach the bulk on the content. Each route is good in it's own regard. I will say also that one character in particular isnt in the anime at all and that person's arc is especially good. \n\nI bought this game on an anime weekend sale on steam for $25. I know $50 is alot of money and although clannad is great it's alot of money. If you're a diehard VN fan you'll prob have no problem spending the money. I recommend wishlisting this game and waiting for a sale. \n\nIf you enjoyed the anime I recommend picking this up. If you hated the anime you probably will hate the VN. I was brought to tears by most of the routes and each route felt so great when I finished it.

It's a very down to earth story about one person's struggle to find his place in the world. I've watched the anime countless times and still do watch bits of it every now and again. Sure, the pacing in the novel is a bit different in terms of what you choose, but at the end of the day, who really cares? Just pick a choice that appeals to you and try to pursue your favorite waifu or something. Well, for those of you who are familiar with the anime, it's very likely you know what Clannad is already, but for those of you who don't know what Clannad is, the little description at the bottom of the store page should give you an idea of what it's about. You know why I like this protagonist? Simple. He's written in a way that he is first and foremost, a human being with a believable personality. A bit of a jerk, but a respectable if not somewhat relatable human being for the most part, not like some stereotypical, whimpy nice guy or some stupidly overpowered power fantasy almost every mediocre anime has. Now it comes down to whether or not you are willing to spend a bit of dosh on a dating sim. If you have any interest in dating sims or if you watched the anime and loved it, there should be no reason for you to skip the game, unless you're a filthy cheapskate who feels entitled that they should get everything for free.

Visual novels, such as Clannad, require a bit of a different taste, you need a fair bit of patience and also need to put up with the fact that at first glance, Nagisa looks like a skeleton, in my humble opinion, which ticked me the hell of as she is my second favorite character (Miyazawa's my favorite, obviously). For sure, playing the game is a great way to continue to immerse yourself into the Clannad universe, and it allows you to follow your own path and make friends with who you want, however, the mechanics and style of the game itself don't necessarily appeal to certain groups. I have friends who cried watching the anime, like me, however, did not enjoy playing the game. The plot of the game is fantastic, no complaints there, just prepare yourself for a bit of a different experience in how you interact with it in comparison to the anime and other video games. Just keep this in mind.\n\nI've always personally been impressed with Key and their ability to make games that have the ability to toy with your emotions. Clannad is no different, as a player, you follow your own semi-personalised route (see below), each with their own struggles and successes that tug at your heartstrings. The plotlines are deep and engaging and allow you to feel as if you have truly connected with the characters, each of whom have a well thought out personality and background that is reflected in the way in which they interact with the player character. For me, this resulted in my getting angry a lot at Sunohara (the player character's best friend) and yelling at my screen. The point is, you'll feel the emotions that the game is meant to convey, you'll wince, you'll cry, you'll laugh, the whole story is one wild emotional roller coaster. Clannad is a fantastic example of what a visual novel should do for you.\n\nFor a visual novel, the mechanics are solid and the Dangopedia answered virtually all the questions I had about any mentions of Japanese culture within the game. At times, playing the game can feel like a chore, as is typical of many visual novels (especially if you've watched the anime, as you know roughly what will happen), but I personally didn't mind to much as I was so engaged by the characters. \n\nThe sprites, for the most part, are relatively well done for a visual novel, except for Nagisa, in my opinion, which is an incredible boon. From my experience, games with characters that look nothing like they should (for example, a human should look like a human) are a bit disenchanting and a complete turnoff. The soundtrack is incredibly well done, I cannot stress this enough, I found it to be the aspect of the game that was most beneficial to the overall quality besides the actually plotline, which is to be expected in any game. With both of these things in mind, its easy to immerse yourself into the game.\n\nThat's it for me, if you made it this far, I congratulate you and I now reward you with a joke. What do you call a funny mountain? Hill Arious. Ba dum tsh. Anyway, I hope this helped you make a decision, no doubt I missed a few things, however, so I'd recommend you read some more just to get a better feel. I encourage you to buy the game, it's fantastic and a good example of what a visual novel should do. Even if you don't like sappy stories, you should still enjoy this game. And remember that you can always return the game if you're not satisfied, so there's no harming in trying it out and see if you enjoy it.\n\n-Resileus", "timestamp_created": 1472427284, "timestamp_updated": 1472427337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25208085": {"recommendationid": "25208085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082924357", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505432870}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr nices game, hab immer noch sehr viel Spa\u00df daran es zu spielen.

IT WILL TEAR YOUR HEART OUT and STOMP on it, throw a ninja star and punch it before handing it back to you just to rip it out again! This is a very emotional game.  And if you haven't seen the Anime, it is fine you can still play the game.[/spoiler] This is an emotional game and if you are not ready for it. I suggest you read about what KEY/Visual Arts are known for.\n\n     This game starts out a bit slow but the first few days determines what 2-4 routes you can take during the time. Based on your initial choices. However there are very important choices you must make to change the world of 2 girls. I will not reveal thier names but if you want to know read the walkthough. Please understand this, the game, is more in-depth than that of the anime. Although the same things happen, at least there is a chance of chasing a different girl than the anime female protagonist.\n\n     This game is tough to buy at $49.99 unless you are hardcore Visual Novel player. I played the other Key game on here Planetarium and it made me so so sad. And I do not even know why I wanted this game *while it was on deep discount* knowing how KEY is and you will NOT be disappointed if you buy this game at full price. This game has the Japanese Seiyuu (Voice actors) from the anime so if you watched the anime, you can throughly enjoy this game.  It will take a long time to complete. tl;dr [spoiler] My time on record is wrong, I left the game running by accident for 2 1/2 days went out of town, thought I closed it. So my time is more along the lines of 40 hours because I am doint muli-path this game.\n\n       For the multi-path, I am chasing 3 or 4 of the girls starting with the easiest ones to get, then moving on to the others. I am trying for 100% but I do not know if I can go through the game that many times knowing how it is. This game is the clean version of thier games (short Planetarium) Thier other games were more garnered to the late teens early adults.. So if you are looking for a echhie game this is NOT one of them. If you are looking for a tear jerker this is game for you. And if you like a huge Dongo family you can have it by just playing the game. :) (Joke with the story)[/spoiler] \n\n\nThis tear jerker of a game is worth the time to play.

Maybe buy it when it's on sale if you want to get it for cheaper, but seriously though, you need to support this game so more games made by Key can be released on here!\n\nFor the story, there are 10 main routes that must be completed before unlocking the 'main' story. These routes can be done in any order and many of them will send you on an emotional rollercoaster. I recommend playing one playthrough without a walkthrough, then using one to find out what the key choices are for the other routes, although this isn't that important to do so. Just be prepared with tissues. If you don't cry at least once, then you probably aren't human.\nEven with the emotional ride this game will take you on, there are plenty of comedy scenes to help lighten the mood throughout the game (mostly the early stages of a playthrough). The scenes with Sunohara and Akio are the best in my opinion.\n\nI rate this game a solid 10/10 and definitely suggest you buy it. Seriously. Buy it.

It was my first VN and I highly recommend it. If you are like how I use to be and typically play FPS, RPG, and RTS games but never gave VN a chance, Clannad is the VN to take the risk on. I promise that you won't regret it.\n\nIf you like anime at all I'm sure someone has recommended that you watch Clannad. IMO, the anime is really good but assumes you have some additional understanding from the VN. While both the anime and VN are Clannad, the anime and VN tell the stories slightly differently. In the anime, which I think is better understood if you play the VN, most of the routes are somewhat combined so all the characters make an appearance. Fuko's, Kotomi's, Mei's, and Tomoyo's routes are blended fairly well into Nagisa's story (however the anime doesn't do everyone justice, for example Kappei doesn't even make an appearance). In the VN by contrast, most of the routes are fairly separate from the various characters. The anime's and VN's stories are similar in that their primary route is Nagisa's but each approach the story differently. \n\nThe strength of this VN is that there is more dialogue, alternate routes, and information not provided in the anime. I also had some of my questions about the anime answered by the VN's explanations. That said, the VN is long and if you aren't into reading then you may prefer to just watch the anime as you will cry just as much watching the anime as you will playing this game. If you are like me however, this VN will have won you over to try other VNs (Edit: If you like Clannad you may like Fruit of Grisaia, another long multi route VN with a good story that can be found on Steam). I plan on picking up Tomoyo After in the near future (Edit: I later did and it is also good but short).\n\nTLDR: If you've never played a VN before give this one a chance. If you still can't be bothered to do that, at least watch the anime.

I then bought the After Story sequel.  The music was so good that I imported the game soundtrack and Anime opening CD sets from Japan as well as a PS2 copy of the game.  I have recently purchased the blu-ray version of the show.  All that being said this game is FANTASTIC!!!!  I love getting the anime story lines retold in much more detail as well as countless more stories that they simply could not fit into an anime.  You get to make key plot point decisions that sometimes really affect the way the characters interact and the events that unfold. I will HAVE to play through it multiple times.  The voice acting is also phenomenal and really, REALLY adds to the emotion you feel when experiencing the story.  The HD visuals are also MUCH better than I originally anticipated and look fantastic on a 1080p or higher screen.  There is a bit more foul language than I expected but that does not detract from the emotional impact of the stories you experience.  Also the new additions to this version such as the Dangopedia really make it feel new and fresh and provide explanations to some of the very-Japanese references.

It's a very heart touching story about family and self improvement. KEY has done a very good job here, especially Maeda Jun for contributing to approximately 75% of the scenario writing, as well as composing some of the music for the soundtrack. I currently consider this KEY's best novel, despite it being my second favorite.\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nAs Maeda Jun was responsible for a majority of the scenario writing for this novel, the quality in many routes remains consistent. I'm not certain which parts he did not write, but the other writers did a good job of not tracking off from the overall atmosphere of the novel as a whole, which tends to be seen when different writers work on different routes. \nMy only complaint is that there are certain elements in some of the routes that I find very hard to empathize with and blown slightly out of proportion in terms of dramatic effect when considering the situation, however this might not be true for everyone.\nThe true masterpiece, however, is in the After Story that is unlocked upon completing all the routes. This is where the novel shines, and this is where it will very likely leave a permanent mark on your heart, as it did with me.\n\n[b]Artwork:[/b]\nThe background art is very nice, and I can't find anything to complain about. The character art, however, is slightly off. The character artist for this novel is Hinoue Itaru, and I'm not a very big fan of her style. Characters' faces just look off. This is my opinion.\n\n[b]Soundtrack:[/b]\nOh boy, where do I even begin. Orito Shinji and Maeda Jun are a match made in heaven. I don't even know how to explain the soundtrack. It's hands down one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. Even without the novel, the tracks themselves are certain to provoke emotions, unless you hate music. A truly emotional and powerful soundtrack indeed.", "timestamp_created": 1468250747, "timestamp_updated": 1468250841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24244078": {"recommendationid": "24244078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069912836", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 3678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507579172}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the third Visual Novel I read. The first was exquisite. The second was mostly bad. For this one here I have ambivalent feelings but it's mostly... positive. Well, that doesn't say much if I added \"as in 51% positive\".\n\nWhat I like is the overall cuteness, the quirkiness of the characters and their chemistry. The protagonist is such a prankster and almost everyone is so naive, making them perfect victims for him. It's pretty heavy on the cheese sometimes. I don't mind it too much but there are some parts that get a little annoying, because it's drawn out and in your face.\n\nYou will get a ton of content with many, many voice samples. Don't be fooled into thinking you're done when you see the credits. This is a game that needs to be started over and over. A single character arc could take you 20 hours to complete and there are like a dozen of them. The sheer vastness could be daunting. It could take a lifetime to see everything. It needs to have a lot of content, though. The production density is very shallow so it has to compensate in the quantity department.\n\nThis may apply to a lot of Visual Novels, but in this case I find the imagery very lacking. It's not so much the art or character design but the massive use of recycled pictures. There is very little variety. It's missing images to support the actions that take place. Instead a lot is described through text.\n\nThe thing about CLANNAD that doesn't match my taste is the aimless, repetitive and incoherent structure. I understand that it's slice-of-life and that it's not plot driven by design. You have to invest a huge amount of time to get something out of it. By that I mean feels. The emotionally challenging parts are very sparse. There are a couple of chuckles along the way. It should be possible to achieve the same depth with less words. It feels tiring in a lot of places, because there is so much dullness.\n\nI had a hard time accepting the supernatural stuff. There is nothing to comprehend because of missing information and that seems contrived. Some of the romance also feels forced and uncalled for. It's not very cohesive or elegant to throw something in for good measure. What I genuinely dislike are the intermissions called The Illusionary World. I find them pseudo-poetic and pretentious. But you will only have to read them once, because they're identical every time.\n\nThe way you take character routes is also not very consistent. Assuming you are not using a guide then you will have no idea what went wrong when you reach a dead end that forces you to reload or start over. Some of the flags don't seem very logical, so you can't possibly know which of your earlier choices matter. It is literally impossible to see all the major narrative parts in one go and you will probably make some poor choices. Fortunately the save system is well cut out for this. And all the conveniences like skipping something previously read are a huge help.\n\nTo be completely frank, I think it gets worse the longer it takes. This may only be true for a few scenarios. You need to be very starry-eyed and easy to manipulate to not become cynical midway. All this kitsch and sweetness is hard too swallow, you might get diabetes if you're not careful. If you have the option, you're better off with the anime. It's not so much of a chore and the production value is considerably higher.\n\nIf you want an authentic Japanese Visual Novel with a reputation, this is the real deal.

I'd seen a little of the anime when it came out so long ago I didn't remember any of it, but all I had to go off of was that it was good. In action, CLANNAD turned out to be so much more than just \"good.\"\n\nYour choices will matter in large and small ways, and there are even hidden secrets throughout the game you might stumble on depending on your choices. The characters and stories are all rich and will pull you in, and by the end, you'll probably wish they hadn't when it's finally all over - because the moment you go back to the title screen with the realization that there is no more left is probably one of the biggest tearjerkers in CLANNAD, and make no mistake, there are many of them.\n\nThis is the kind of visual novel I wish people were playing more of, the kind of visual novel I wish the genre was represented by.

I bought this game while it was on a half-off sale because I had just finished watching the two anime seasons and immediately came to regard Clannad as the best anime I've ever watched. The anime made someone like me, who didn't even feel sad while watching various other emotional anime, cry for a whole day. Two days even. Maybe even three. Of course, when I finished it I just had to go get the visual novel.\n\nPurchasing the visual novel was a great idea. I know full well what I'm getting into when I go into most of these routes. Of course I do, I watched the anime, which covered a lot of these. However, it didn't feel any less emotional when they hit me. In fact, I've cried about things while playing that I didn't cry about while watching. I've done 5 routes in 50 hours, so that's about 10 hours per route for me. That's a lot of time I'm spending getting as much dialogue as I can from certain characters, and I end up getting more attached to the characters in the game than I did in the anime. I can't help but feel sad when it's time for the emotional punches.\n\nClannad is known for its sadness, and its sadness is something I couldn't resist myself, to the point of tears. However, at the end of the day, Clannad has always made me feel more happiness. Both the anime and the game have given me lots of happiness. The characters are all charming, the romance is adorable, and I find myself laughing like an idiot at some points. Sometimes I'll find out my mouth hurts because I've had the biggest grin for a while. I absolutely love the game's soundtrack, both the upbeat and the sad music.\n\nI don't dislike a single thing about this game, and I can only have more great experiences as I continue to play this past the 50 hour mark.

I would in turn latter watch other works that were based on or related to Key such as angle beats and learned of the games. In time I found myself interested in a kinetic visual novel named Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet (Which I am very interested in the movie coming out for it.) This at the time was one of the few games on steam with the anime style which I craved. It was an amazing Gem that I had found and I finished it on new years day as people were celebrating as I was to be blunt crying over a game. Around this time I found interest in these games and searched far and wide for a copy of games such as Clannad, with a few fake versions out there I lost interest in trying. I did still find interest in studying the game and Key. I then found out that OtakuUSA was putting ads out for the new English version of Clannad. My hype went up but I was not able to get to it till recently due to the sale prices allowing me more room for spending. After playing through a portion I had found the game to meet each quality the anime and their other works had given me to expect. \n \nMainly the characters are very interesting and become very charming to an extent as you play and feel as if you are in the game, it helps to add in your own name making them yell at you with your name (With san added) more interesting and comical to me. The art in comparison to the original version from japan has improved but not as much compared to the giant jump of other visual novels such as Higurashi, but this is mainly since the art was already very well done alike to their other works. The art also as I should note mainly focuses on giving the characters big chins which always reminds me of the game that was panned in the world god only knows called One Leaf that had the character Yotsuba Sugimoto with her big chin small face. \n \n Along with this the lines and story in general takes you around a natural organic line of emotions that allow for a human element to be felt. Another great inclusion in the game is the Dongopedia which allows non Japanese players to have a better grasp on what the characters are talking about which without it would probably be many lost jokes and poor understanding, it however would be hard integrate so much cultural understanding into the game in a more organic or natural form as it would both bog down the game with exposition and two cause many troubles with the story in general. I personally like the immersion of the game and would love a working naturally way to allow for this understanding but really the only way to get it is living there for sometime. \n \nFor the music it may at times feel off from what you expect, I am not sure if it fits with the tone or area always even know the music is lovable and amazing, it mainly gives me the feeling I am descending from the heavens or some magical place. It is amazing and I enjoy listening to it but the above remains true no matter how much I like it. At times it works out for some amazing scenes though, with the game Planetarian I felt the music often depicted how the scene was very well and allowed for alike amazing scenes though such as one where you watch the character aim his grenade launcher at a large machine.  \n \nThis game had in turn spawned many titles from makers inspired, wanting to do better, or to compete. In turn I played many games that clearly have inspirations but also can relate my past experiences to this game. I view many of these visual novels as experiences in general so its greate to be able to relate so many to this game which in turn means it is doing a good job at pulling both on my emotion and nostalgia. For example Nagisa Furukawa speaks about how she was unable to be at school due to her sickness, this reminded me somewhat of narcissus somewhat ( A more serious and more depressing case of sickness) which in turn made me feel even more sorry for her even know the situation was not as grave as in the other game.  \n \nFor a cute factor the characters are mainly cute thanks to their relatability, humanity, and conversations that allow you to bond to them, in comparison to acting cute and looking cute you have games such as Nekopara (Which when not on steam is an eroge and also has many hentai products.) Even know Nekopara is a fun and good game It lacks that bonding and relatability to the characters which make these as said earlier experiences. Clannad is mainly a clean fun and emotional story. It does not try to play to being about satisfying your wants and rather goes to telling a story that reaches the human element in us all and does so masterfully.  \n \nFor interaction there is a fair amount and can be considered a dating sim almost due to being a harem based anime game where you are most likely as a player trying to have one of these characters fall for you. These being called paths in the dating sim game genera. I would consider it a dating sim myself but very tame compared to others, the decisions are not as frequent as dating sims and the game mechanics are not based around dating such as other games like Huniepop and newer dating sim. The choice you make do lead you down paths still that can lead to love but the focus as said is more on story. \n \nSo lastly I would recommend this game mainly on it being an amazingly well written story, and with all its options it allows for a multitude of ways for this amazing story or stories to be told. I find most problems to be more comical then deal breaking and do not detract from the game at the slightest. Along with recommending this game alike recommendations would clearly be all the other Key studio's works both anime and game Planetarian being most notable, Keys anime and Manga are also amazing in story and art and if you find interested in this you may find interest in the all female group clamp and its  works. Even know their art is more stretched looking it is amazing.

Its very daunting when you first start, and if you dont have the time to use 80 hours to play this, then i would stick with the anime.", "timestamp_created": 1465340918, "timestamp_updated": 1467426205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23440527": {"recommendationid": "23440527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284064889", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469087436}, "language": "english", "review": "\u201c\u5ead\u6709\u6787\u6777\u6811\uff0c\u543e\u59bb\u6b7b\u4e4b\u5e74\u6240\u624b\u690d\u4e5f\uff0c\u4eca\u5df2\u4ead\u4ead\u5982\u76d6\u77e3\u201d\n\"There have a loquat tree in the garden, in that year when my wife died, I planted it by my hand, now it can cover the garden like a lid.\"\n                                                            \n                                                            \u2014\u2014\u300a\u9879\u810a\u8f69\u5fd7\u300b", "timestamp_created": 1465327825, "timestamp_updated": 1466409797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560599", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23429815": {"recommendationid": "23429815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103972401", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491106250}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e29\u6696\u4eba\u5fc3\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1465276430, "timestamp_updated": 1465276430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23426632": {"recommendationid": "23426632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278020701", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489296865}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best pieces of writing to ever exist.", "timestamp_created": 1465255969, "timestamp_updated": 1465255969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23419200": {"recommendationid": "23419200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115579595", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511024745}, "language": "russian", "review": "[b]dangodaikazoku.mp3[/b]__play\u25ba\n\n\u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0443\u044e \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0437\u0443. \u0418 \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0443. \u041a\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434 - \u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u0417\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443? \u0412 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0448\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0430 300 \u0438 \u0441\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0438\u043c \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c. \u041a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e. \u041f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043c\u0443\u0442\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0441 \u0442\u044f\u043d. \u0421\u043f\u043e\u0439\u043b\u0435\u0440: [spoiler]\u0442\u044f\u043d \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u0441\u0442[/spoiler]. \u0421\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e \u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e, \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u044f\u043d. \u041f\u043b\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0448\u044c, \u0440\u044b\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c. \u0425\u044d\u043f\u043f\u0438 \u044d\u043d\u0434. tenouttaten.

So much. Well, I love the story. As of writing this review, I've only been playing the VN for about an hour and half, but I've rewatched the show 3 times. It's so good. I cried (more like sobbed) the first time I watched it, then I watched it at my birthday party and all of my friends and I cried, then I rewatched it on my own and cried some more. Okay. By definition this is a harem. By definition. Arkada worded it best in his Kanon review, \"95% percent of all harem shows are there for a quick laugh, but are usually just a waste of time. VisualArtsKey take up the other 5%\", and that's really true. This story is BEAUTIFUL. The music is BEAUTIFUL. The art is BEAUTIFUL.  The ending is... Up for debate, but in my opinion it's BEAUTIFUL. But you know what's not beautiful? The fact that when I was finishing the show I was supposed to be sleeping, but I was crying so hard snot and tears were everywhere, and since I couldn't get up, I had to use my own dirty laundry to wipe the tears and snot from my face. I bought the show, I bought this, and I bought Side Stories, mainly for 2 reasons. 1, I love the story, and 2, I wanted to give Key all of my money for making this masterpiece. So yeah, whatever way you prefer, through the show or through the Visual Novel, experience this story, cry for hours, support the devs, and contemplate the ending.

I've completed the game using the pirated version because I did not want to spend $60 AUD on something I might not like. But after finishing, I immediately bought it from steam at full price without any hesistation. This goes to show how much I love this game.\n\nPlot-wise, this is a romance game and is split into 2 sections: a school arc and an after story (AS) arc. I'm not gonna say anymore because that's for you to explore if you decide to give this game a try :). But be warned, the feels train has no break once it starts and you'll be crying your eyeballs out throughout the entire journey.\n\nGraphics-wise, the art style might not suit everyone. I was taken aback at first but got used to it eventually. If you're like me, please stay with it. Don't let this stop you from playing. \n\nGameplay-wise, all you have to do is read and choose options. That's it. Be ready to read A LOT though. I remember reading someone's comment saying that the amount of words in this game is more than the entire Lord Of The Rings trilogy! \n\nSound-wise, this game has some of the most memorable, beautiful soundtracks I've ever heard. I've begun taking piano lessons just to play some of these tracks.\n\nLength-wise, this game is very long. I think it took me more than 150 hours to complete all the major paths and reach the true ending yet there are still some hidden paths and hidden dialogues waiting for me. \n\nOverall, I don't consider this a game. I consider it an experience. A life lesson about friends and family. This game literally changes my outlook on life. I've been gaming for more than 10 years yet never have I ever cried while playing but man this game managed to do that. \n\nMy only gripe with the game is that it's so hard to unlock AS and reach the true ending. It's practically impossible to complete this game without a guide (for me anyway). There are many guides floating around the internet which you can freely look at. I used these 2 (http://soukyuu.emevas.net/CLANNAD_guide.html) and (https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/921463-clannad/faqs/61132). They aren't mine btw. All credit (and my thanks) goes to respective authors.\n\nAnd that's it! I hope my review helps you decide. I sincerely hope that you'll give this game a try since I think it's something everyone should experience at least once in their life.\n\nP.S. As you may know there is an anime adaption. The anime is really good however imo it's nowhere near as emotional as the VN. Therefore if this is your first time experiencing Clannad, I'd strongly recommend the VN.

Triumphs, tragedies, insecurities, self doubt, the meaning behind living and dealing with death. You will laugh out loud, and if you really read this story and take things seriously, it's very likely to cause you to shed tears of sadness and joy several times before the end. \n\nIs it flawless? No, I think there are stretches that go on for a bit too long and some of the character specific routes resonate much better than others. The art is a little weak, but that can be forgiven due to the age of the title. Any complaint pales in comparison to the emotion the story can bring out in a person. It's really caused me to spend time reflecting on my life. \n\nAnyone who likes visual novels owes it to themselves to play this story, regardless of the cost of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1464045042, "timestamp_updated": 1464045042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502694", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23144268": {"recommendationid": "23144268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012875077", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 9229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491009463}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed playing through CLANNAD, each route is another amazing story about\nthe main protagonist himself and the character that the route belongs to.

Firstly, I can't really give a definitive review since my English is bad and grammar is hard, so uh take it with a grain of salt. \n\nAlright so we got the world reowned Visual Novel studio Key, the highly rated story of CLANNAD now available on Steam-o-roni.\n\ntldr; this game makes you wana cry and die \n\n(Sort of a \"full(?) review down there\")\n\nWhile I only have completed my first route which happened to be Nagisa route, it was a rollercoaster of emotions like everyone tends to say. I'm not over-exaggerating but it is really felt something right out of the box being that my only previous experience with Visual Novels is Katawa Shoujo(Which is hands down a great Visual Novel too[Shameless Plug]), let me just tell you for now that this isn't a generic short VN you find quite a lot in the Steam Store, while I won't say their bad they sort of lack in the story department.\n\n\nRighty, story then? How does it go? Well with Visual Novels the choices you make will determine which of the main heroines in the game that you'll be chasing or be chased at. Starting out with my choice I went with Nagisa the moment I layed eyes on her since the moment we were introduced at. Something about her stood out for me, and this goes without saying that she's friggin' adorable. It's hard for me to judge it's story since I started watching the Anime first then went into the game. In with the comparison there's some diferences here and there comparing the route and Anime took in the game's route.\n\nStory: 9.5/10\n\nGoing with the flow we have the art style while isn't \"modern\" to keep up with the hip kids it has its charm to it since it's quite fairly old dating back all the way to 2004's. So like this is kinda 00's era. As I've stated above while I've only completed 1 route so far which is Nagisa's path. Her CG's are great and well detailed in every-way possible with vibrant colors. It can definitely do better in this deparment but hey it's from the 2000's.\n\nArt: 8.5/10\n\nFor the music, I'm really astounded by how marvelous it is. The music really put me into the atmosphere in which scene it was depicting be it a a mundane class-lesson to a spur of the moment confession. I really don't have much else to say about this it's just great, fantastic, superb, not even words I can desribe the sound. With the most memorable sound track of mine to be \"Nagisa\".\n\nMusic: 10/10\n\nGameplay department? Well it's what you'd expect out of any Visual Novel realistically, you click, you read rinse and repeat. This ain't no triple A game where you run to Point A to Point B and blast enemies high off the earth and off to the moon with cool rockets looking guns. Standard click and read kind of thing. Did I forget to mention? The well layed out UI and settings makes it goes hand with hand.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nOverall I can say for sure is this is a must have for die hard Visual Novel dudes or dudette's out there. This kind of story telling, music and art style mixed so well that, well you can't help but roll up in a ball and cry the living daylight out of you. Just buy the damn game already dammit!\n\nOverall: 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1462291967, "timestamp_updated": 1511457850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score":

And the story with the twins, especially Kyou (the scary twin) is really well done in my opinion - you just have to make some hard choices either way.\n\nThe big question is always \"is it worth the price?\"  Well, I think the full price is probably worth it - think of the price of a movie ticket and add up the hours of entertainment - but if you can get it on sale (like right now 50% off!) then it's a great buy.  Exchange rate makes a difference for us non-US folks.\n\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1462041058, "timestamp_updated": 1462041058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0,

Eines vorweg, jeder der bereit ist stundenf\u00fcllende englische Texte zu lesen (was man an meiner Spielzeit sehen kann^^), bekommt hier die emotionalsten und traurigsten Geschichten die ich je erlebt hab!\n\nClannad ist ein Visual Novel. Dazu m\u00f6chte kurz erkl\u00e4ren die mit diesem Begriff nicht viel anfangen k\u00f6nnen. Deutsch hei\u00dft es ja etwa Bildroman und das ist ziemlich der Fall. Eine VN ist kein Spiel im eigentlichen Sinne sondern eher ein Interaktiver Roman mit vielen verschiedenen Standbilder die im Hintergrund das Setting zeigen sollen und im Vordergrund meist die Person steht mit der man das Gespr\u00e4ch f\u00fchrt. Das Einzige was als \"Gameplay\" vorhanden ist, sind die Entscheidungen die man ab und zu treffen muss. Diese k\u00f6nnen aber entscheiden sein f\u00fcr den Verlauf der Geschichte!\nSo ist es auch bei Clannad, je nachdem welche Entscheidungen man trifft, bekommt man bis zu 12 verschiedene Enden im ersten Teil des Spiels! Also f\u00fcr reichlich Lesestoff ist gesorgt.\n\nNun warum sollte man sich das \"antun\". Ich w\u00fcrde sagen man sollte sich das \"antun\" wenn der Anime einem nicht gereicht hat und mehr von Tomoya und co. erleben m\u00f6chte. Den der Anime fasst zwar grob das wichtigste zusammen, aber das ist wirklich nur an der Oberfl\u00e4che gekratzt wenn man bedenkt das man f\u00fcr die VN etwa 10 mal l\u00e4nger braucht! \nWenn das der Fall sein sollte, dann sag ich nur kauft die VN sofort, sie ist jeden Cent wert!\n\nWarum sie so gut ist versuche ich nun etwas n\u00e4her zu erl\u00e4utern.\nEs f\u00e4ngt ja immer harmlos und heiter an: Man spielt Tomoya der Drittkl\u00e4ssler an einer Oberschule ist. Zusammen mit seinem \"Freund\" Sunohara hat er eigentlich nur Faulenzen und Bl\u00f6dsinn im Kopf. Nur das bleibt nicht so. Im Verlauf des Schuljahrs trifft er je nachdem wie man sich entscheidet die unterschiedlichsten Personen kennen, die sein Leben St\u00fcck f\u00fcr St\u00fcck ver\u00e4ndern. Je weitere die Geschichte voran schreitet so emotionaler und auch oft traurig wird sie in der Regel. \nDas liegt zum einem an den Texten die an den wichtigen Moment so gut geschrieben sind das sie dich regelrecht im Herzen treffen. Nach meinem Empfinden werden wirklich immer die richtigen Worte getroffen das sie dich so mit nehmen das man es fast nicht glaubt.\n\nDas Ganze wird noch von einem richtig guten Soundtrack unterst\u00fctzt das du dich dann gar nicht mehr halten kannst.\nJa, am Ende einer Storyroute sag ich mal, hab ich meistens heulend vorm Bildschirm gesessen. Und das liegt nicht daran das ich nahe am Wasser gebaut bin. Alle m\u00f6glichen westlichen Geschichten ber\u00fchren mich zwar auch ab und zu aber ich kann mich nicht erinnern jemals zuvor so im Wasserfall geheult zu haben! \nUnd wenn es nicht der erste Teil des Spiels es schafft euch zum heulen zu bringen dann wartet nur auf den zweiten Teil \"After Story\". Der setzt nochmal dem ganzen die Krone auf! Wer dann nicht heult, tja der hat kein Herz!!!\n\nEgal genug geschrieben erst einmal, ich lege es euch nochmal ans Herz und spielt dieses Spiel! Weil am Enden von allem sind es nicht mehr Tr\u00e4nen der Trauer sondern eher der Freude. Weil ein Happy End hat es dann doch, soviel sei gesagt. Die ganzen Stunden mit dieser VN war f\u00fcr mich wirklich ein Erlebnis!\n \nPS: Um euch unn\u00f6tiges herumprobieren mit den Entscheidungen zu ersparen, benutzt am Besten gleich eine Komplettl\u00f6sung. Weil ich hab es am Anfang einmal f\u00fcr mich selbst versucht und wenn dann eine wichtige Entscheidung nicht getroffen wurde, landet ihr im Hauptmen\u00fc und seht das Ende nicht. Also um euch wirklich viel Zeit zu ersparen, benutzt sie.

This review isn't going to be about the quality of the story itself, (other reviews have done it better then I can) but rather about the translation coming from the original fan translation for the full voice version.\n\nSekai I feel did a mostly good job with the translation. Those who played the original fan patch knew that the translation really fell apart as you got deeper in, with afterstory being extremely hard to understand at times. While it was a rocky start at launch, after a few patches I can happily say the translation is of great quality. While I did notice some errors here and there (the game being as huge as it is, to be expected) they weren't constant enough to really notice. For example, I only noticed one in afterstory, and given the context it might have been intentional. My only gripe is that you could tell they took a few liberties with the translation. For example \u201cFurakawa Bakery\u201d is translated as \u201cFurakawa Bread\u201d, a change from both the fan patch and the subs for the anime. (unless my memory is failing me) I also noticed \u201cHamburger\u201d was changed to \u201cSalisbury steak\u201d as well as other small things. I can only really recall once instance where these minor changes really bothered me though and unless you're like me and have both read and watched this story too many times, you'll will prob not notice.\n\nTo me, however what really sells the 50 dollar price tag in the updated assets. While I agree that some of the CGs come off as deformed, the HD assets were still nothing short of an upgrade for me. So while some deformed CGs came of as more so, the ones that looked good already looked REALLY good. Some of them looked so good in HD to me that I felt like I was looking at them for the first time. Some of the music tracks have also been remixed and in my opinion, sound better then the original. It's small, but these updates really made the experience feel fresh to me.\n\nWhile I feel Sekai should have waited longer to proofread everything at launch, I'd say 99% of the errors have been fixed since and as it stands, this is the definitive version of CLANNAD for those looking for play the VN. I've watched the anime 4 times, read the visual novel twice, and backed over $150 to the kickstarter so if it wasn't a good product, I would have been pissed right off. I'm glad to say that I\u201dm not dissapointed and I'm really glad to have taken the 4 or so months it took me to re-read this monster. If you're looking to read the VN I can safely say, despite the price tag, pick up this version over the fan translation. That or wait till a sale and pick it up then, as any fan of visual novels owes it to themselves to at least try this timeless classic.", "timestamp_created": 1460960248, "timestamp_updated": 1460960248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22351205": {"recommendationid": "22351205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129175684", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64, "last_played": 1514010710}, "language": "english", "review": "Tears.

He has no mother, his father is an alcoholic, and every day is miserable for him. His only friend is an annoying idiot, and he's constantly late to school. Despite all this, he still lends a helping hand to those who need it, and never expects anything in return. That all begins to change when he meets a girl named Nagisa, which kickstarts a bunch of changes in his life that (depending on the player's choices) proceed to lead him to blooming relationships with old friends, new faces, and help the people around him achieve happiness.\n\nThe other main part of the story is the \"Illusionary World\" which is sometimes an intermission between certain dates in the story. The Illusionary World segments focus on two characters, a single girl and a doll made out of junk, and it takes a long time (read: a lot of reading) to figure out who they are. Not every route goes through the whole thing, and some stop earlier than others.\n\nWhat really drew me into this story was its world and characters. Everyone in this game feels like a real person, with very strong characterization and development. As Tomoya (and by extension the player) grows to know these people, I wanted to help them with their problems, I wanted to see them get their happy endings and overcome their hardships. The only exception to this rule is Tomoya's best friend, Sunohara. I generally found him grating, and had the serious urge to skip through most of his dialogue (which I couldn't resist doing at quite a few instances). But even Sunohara, annoying as he is, still has a lot of depth and tons of great moments.\n\nAnd it's not just the story and characters that drew me into this game's world, the music and voices were a huge help to the experience. This game's soundtrack is simply phenomenal, from the calming title screen music, to the somber pieces during the emotional scenes, and the upbeat sounds of the silly scenes. The music perfectly fits whatever is happening, and I wish I had the money to buy the soundtrack, it really is that fantastic. The voices are all perfectly delivered. Everyone sounds the way they look (if that makes any sense), and they make the emotional scenes all the more powerful. The voices are only in Japanese though, but that isn't too much of a detriment, and I'm a dub person.\n\nThe visuals are okay, I wouldn't say they're anything spectacular, and it might take some time to get used to everyone's eyes being so freaking far apart. Some of the CGs also look a bit weird, especially the first one you see, but it isn't too detrimental. It can also be annoying to some that the game isn't in widescreen, but it seems every visual novel has that \"problem.\"\n\nAnother nice feature is the Dangopedia, which is basically a helpful tool for people who don't know all the culture differences and references, which is really helpful. However...\n\nAs much as I recommend this story to people, I don't think this is a beginner's VN, especially for its price. $50 (or equivalents) is a [i]really[/i] steep price for a game that is essentially nothing but reading with the occasional choice (Some routes have more than others) to see how the story plays out. I'd recommend trying out a freeware or at least very cheap VN (like [i]Katawa Shoujo[/i]) to see if this kind of game is for you before considering buying this.\n\nGranted, this is well mitigated because assuming you don't skip anything, this game is about 80-100 hours of reading, and it's a really good read.\n\nI spent 48 on this game during the holiday sale last year, and I have no regrets about it. It may not be for everyone, but if you want a truly emotional and touching tale, then you can't do much better than [i]CLANNAD[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1459711318, "timestamp_updated": 1460068495,

It's an all time favorite of mine. I own original DVD's including After Story, I bought official soundtrack available in Japan ( which was WAY too expensive to get... but I really liked the songs so it was worth it ). Also I played it OFFLINE hence very little time is displayed on Steam.\n\nI was hesitant whether to buy Clannad on steam, most reviews were not helpful or honest and written by fanboys/girls. I didn't want to pay 29.99 GBP for the story that I already knew, music that I heard countless times... and yet I bought it. I bought it to support Key, I would like them to release more of their Visual Novels here on steam. \n\nThat being said I do feel dissapointed. Don't get me wrong the art style is ok albeit a bit dated but in HD. Story is the same as anime and it seems like everything is there BUT here's where the experience sucked for me. \n\n* Small spoilers ahead *\n\nThere are some new routes and jokes that weren't present in the anime which is great BUT those that are similar to anime lack visual impact and motion. Let me explain : Tomoyo kicked some bullies on motorbike which looked awesome in anime. They added cheesy spectator view and made her look badass. \nIn this Visual Novel the only thing you get is Okazaki looking out of the window only to comment on what is happening. Yeah that's it. \nNext example : Remember when Sunohara wanted to join the drama club? Okazaki had thought : If this was and RPG... Then in anime we had cool RPG hud displayed and all three options chosen. While in VN there is only text... yeah. It doesn't deliver the impact that anime has. \nThere is more examples like this so VN feels a bit poorer in that aspect. \n\nOK,OK someone might say : OH BUT(T), VN has more content! MOAH CONTENT! More jokes and it expands a bit more of the story! \n\nNow calm down you tit. Yelling doesn't make your argument helpfull. Yes it does have a little bit more than anime but I found out that in some routes like FUKO it doesn't really expands ANYTHING. It's the same thing that anime had! SAME FLIPPING THING. Same ending except you get LO! Two different CG... and slightly different dialogue. \nI've seen it in anime. It does not add anything to my experience. \n\nYou know, I'm not caomplaining. I could look pass those points that I have stated. After all it's and old Visual Novel with a new paint on it. It's a classic so I guess I'm being picky BUT there is one thing I will not back down. CHOICES.\n\nYep you heard me. Choices the game gives you. \nWhen I started playing Clannad I wanted to go with Tomoyo route. Oblivious to the fact that her route * SPOILERS * is blocked... Yep you heard me. I ended up with a bad ending. You need to do FUKO and MISAE routes first to get to Tomoyo route. WHY? I felt so angry that I have to do two routes I didn't really wanted to do... In the end you have to pretty much stick to anime's path to get in the general direction. When I started the game I didn't know I had to do Fuko and Misae first. The game DOESN'T TELL YOU. You must magically figure it out by failing... \n\nSo I went with Nagisa for a while ( in anime eventually Tomoyo shows up ) and I thought there will be a branching to Tomoyo route BUT NO. It won't show up. Instead I somehow got myself on Fuko route WTF? That wouldn't be half as bad however I didn't do everything PERFECTLY ( all the choices have to be JUST RIGHT ) and I messed up her ending... Didn't get to wedding day. Only to CG scene. \n\nTo sum it all up. WHY OH WHY, game dev's thought it would be a great idea to set up mines on players route only to watch them fail over n over again. There is around 50 + choices to make in Fuko's route. If you miss important ones YOU ARE DONE. You won't get the happy ending. Sometimes its easy to guess but other times you find yourself puzzling what the heck did I do wrong?! I wish the game valued my time a bit more. Game devs 1, player 0. GG. \nI like choices but at least after failing couples of times give me hint. Highlight important choices or something. Because it will get confusing and furstrating to waste time.., trust me. Anime in that regard is just a pleasantry. \n\nIt's not a standard Visual Novel. You need to invest time and after many fails I recommend using a Walkthrough... hopefully spoiler free one. \n\nSo can I recommend the game? Yes to those who haven't seen the anime but for those who have anime WAIT for the price drop. Save yourself frustration. \n\nI heard that Tomoyo's After is being worked on which is great. I hope KEY will release it on steam.

This visual novel was originally released at Apr. 2004, intended for all ages, no H Scenes.\n2. Around 2 million words written by original authors. Approximately 70 hours of playing is needed for clearing all routes. Also 2 million words is not uncommon for big releases.\n3. Galgame, including CLANNAD, IS NOT like Huniepop, dating after a few words and bed things within a few days. 30 minutes of casual talking and nothing happened? Geese, you can't date a girl within 30 minutes unless you are f*cking rich or have a really big john.\n4. Critisms have been around Hinoue Itaru all the way until Little Busters in 2007. And beautiful CGs for hand job? Come on, this does not belong to Key's artwork. Sorry.\n5. For me, owning an genuine copy of CLANNAD is just showing my love. And for newbies, CLANNAD is NOT EASY TO PLAY and CAN BE FRUSTRATING. But Planetarian is recommended for newbies, also a artwork done by Key. It's just a 2-hour visual novel, also on steam.\n6. CLANNAD is different from most galgames. If you purchased it and not planning for a refund, go try clear a route, and then you can find Tips, and go all the way along to the end, and enjoy the true end of the story.\n7. CLANNAD has no R18 contents, more than 15 routes, complicated requirements to clear a route, most of the time spent on casual talking, imperfect drawing, BUT tops a lot other galgames at ErogameScape.\nAre you sure you still want it? Then I say go for it.

Clannad will make you laugh\n2, Clannad will make you cry\n\nThe second point is why this visual novel is so legendary. Clannad won't just make you cry, it'll make you bawl your eyes out and sob uncontrollably. It's the hardest I've cried in 10 years. But it may take a long time to get to that point because for the most part Clannad is a lighthearted and genuinely funny VN. It's a game that you have to allow time to tell its story and enjoy it along the way.\n\nClannad is structured into two parts: the main story, and After Story, which is unlocked after completing the character routes in the main story. The main story is similar to a dating sim, but just saying it's a dating sim is like saying baseball is a game where you hit a ball. It goes far beyond just romance and touches on themes like loss, family, nostalgia, change and the cycle of life. Each female character has her own unique route that is the length of a visual novel by itself. This allows for exploration of each character's personality and struggles and touches on a theme unique to that character. In that way, Clannad's main story is much like a box of chocolates, each one to be savored in their own way. Some routes are very lighthearted throughout and only have a bit of sadness at the end, while others will completely rip your soul out. It's a very cathartic experience overall.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game other than having a few parts that felt dull is that some of the routes are a bit too well hidden and tough to get on your own. This makes getting to After Story, and especially its true ending, difficult and frustrating unless you consult a guide. It's a real shame because After Story is not just something that was tacked on, it's the completion of the game and the telling of its most powerful message. You'd be doing yourself a great disservice by not seeing this story to the very end. So don't feel bad if you have to use a guide, I know I had to.\n\nOne more note: this VN has an excellent soundtrack, each theme perfectly conveying the emotions they're going for. By the time you finish, Nagisa's theme (Dango Daikazoku) will move you to tears when you hear it because of the overall connection you have with this character and Clannad in general.\n\nTL;DR - Clannad will make you feel alive. There's a very good reason why this VN is so highly-ranked and has a dedicated cult following despite being over a decade old. When people say Clannad can be a life-changing experience, they're not kidding.

Add all of it together and you get something that'll last for ages.\n\n10/10\nIf you enjoy games that have a good story and enjoyable, beautiful visuals, you'll enjoy Clannad.", "timestamp_created": 1455673462, "timestamp_updated": 1455673462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21234524": {"recommendationid": "21234524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195257379", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495268617}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u53ebCL\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4e0d\u7ba1\u591a\u5c11\u94b1\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u4e70\uff01[strike] \u8d85\u8fc71000\u5c31\u7b97\u4e86...[strike]", "timestamp_created": 1455557127, "timestamp_updated": 1455557127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21229677": {"recommendationid": "21229677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149552163", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507277755}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u70ba\u4e86\u4fe1\u4ef0\uff0c\u4e5f\u70ba\u4e86\u674f\u6bbf\uff0c\u9019\u5f35\u6211\u8cb7\u4e86\u3002\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u9054\u6210\u662f\u5fc5\u9808\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1455541940, "timestamp_updated": 1455541940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21228451": {"recommendationid": "21228451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208658955", "num_games_owned": 1052, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 4807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491002056}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u770b\u4e86\u4e24\u904d\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6625\u8282\u7279\u60e0\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5165\u4e86\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u662f\u4fe1\u4ef0\uff0c\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u8bf4\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u662f.133\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\u4f5c\u4e3agalgame\u8fd8\u662f\u771f\u8d35\uff0c\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u82f1\u6587\u63a8\u8d77\u6765\u771f\u8d39\u529b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u8865\u4e01\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u80fd\u5410\u69fd\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4eba\u8bbe\u5417\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1455537181, "timestamp_updated": 1455537181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21209478": {"recommendationid": "21209478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140237676", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470470901}, "language": "schinese", "review": "dango~dango~\u82f1\u6587\u5543\u5f97\u597d\u7d2f~\u56de\u5fc6\u7740\u52a8\u6f2b\u7684\u60c5\u8282\u8fde\u8499\u5e26\u731c\u52c9\u5f3a\u770b\u5f97\u61c2\u5427=.=", "timestamp_created": 1455465005, "timestamp_updated": 1455465005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.997145", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21203231": {"recommendationid": "21203231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139838848", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490960725}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5199\u4f5cCL,\u8bfb\u4f5c\u4eba\u751f\n\u679c\u7136\u8fd8\u662f\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u79cd\u5b89\u9759\u7684\u8bb2\u6545\u4e8b\u7684GAL\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6545\u4e8b\u5df2\u7ecf\u6709\u8fc7\u592a\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u53bb\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u53c8\u80fd\u5426\u4ece\u4e2d\u611f\u609f\u51fa\u5c5e\u4e8e\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4eba\u751f\u5462\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1455447952, "timestamp_updated": 1480218929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21198771": {"recommendationid": "21198771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083981400", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513261966}, "language": "english", "review": "It has been a long time since the last time I played this game.

1455122778}, "language": "english", "review": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\n\nI barely know where to start with this one, but I guess it should begin with this: if you're looking for a romantic, emotional rollercoaster that goes beyond everything you expected and leaves you exhausted but hugely satisfied, buy this visual novel.  And if you're put off by the price, let me explain to you why it's totally justified.\n\nOh, and by the way, if you haven't seen the anime, you can play this game and still understand everything, so don't worry.  If you've seen the anime, you'll only fall even further in love with the characters and the struggles each one goes through.  I saw the anime first and found it very touching, but even having seen it, this visual novel totally blew that experience away and gave me a million new reasons to love Clannad.\n\nWhat I love about this visual novel is that you can play it both casually and seriously; if you're just interested in dating a bunch of different girls and unlocking the funniest achievements, you can do that.  It has some seriously hilarious moments and hidden bonuses that are great on a casual level without you needing to get bogged down with the emotional baggage of the story if you really don't want to.  However, if you want to throw yourself in at the deep end and experience everything, you are going to be there for a LONG time.\n\nThere is SO much content in this visual novel to keep you replaying and replaying to get every CG, every hidden scene, every possible outcome, every piece of music...  it's almost endless.  Unlocking every achievement and completing the full game's true ending requires a HUGE amount of work; you'll need to play through every route until you unlock what is basically a second visual novel on top of what you just played - and then play that a few times, making little changes at the right moments to unlock that incredible ending you've been searching for.  It may sound off-putting to have to do so much, but believe me, it's worth it.  I won't expand fully for spoiler reasons, but the second you lose your heart to this story... you will not rest until you've brought happiness to that girl.  You will tell yourself that getting an okay ending is satisfactory enough and that you've played it enough times now to leave it alone...  but you'll keep coming back.\n\nI cannot fully tell you how personally invested in the story I became, and how every time I loaded up the game, I convinced myself that I had to keep going until I found the solution to gain that ending.  I actually felt responsible.  I must have clicked over a million times and I lost count of how many times I cried, but by the time I was finally finished, I felt so happily exhausted and strangely vindicated as a human being.  'It's just a game', they always say, 'it has no bearing on real life'.  But I don't think I need to convince most of you guys that games are one of the greatest mediums for life lessons and inspiring moments that make you change your view on life, and Clannad does that.  Clannad made me realise how much I want to help people.  It made me realise that you should never give up on anything, no matter how hard it gets.  When you play this visual novel, you will feel such a yearning in yourself to make the bitterness in yourself and the people you love go away...  and you'll have the power to do it.  I know all of this will probably sound like wanky bullshit to some of you, but I just can't articulate how deeply Clannad moved me as a person.\n\nIn closing, Clannad is brilliant on many levels, and if you think you can handle the feels, you should dive headfirst into it right now.

BUY IT NOW! I don't have as many hours in this game as Fallout 4, but I feel like I'm playing this game longer than it. I'm a really huge fan of Fallout 4 (yes, even though it's not as good as Fallout 3 or New Vegas, I can look past the flaws and enjoy it.) Enough about fallout 4 though.\n\nThis is the only visual novel I, personally, will play and won't stop for hours. I've tried to play the F2P ones on Steam. But their stories are kind of meh. Now, let's get going with the reivew;\n\nClannad is a visual novel originally made by KEY studios in Japan. Sekai Project translated it this year into english. In this novel, you play (I guess it counts as playing, i don't really know how you would catagorize it) as Tomoya Okazaki, a deliquent in his third year of high school. He skips class, falls asleep, and doesn't really care about a whole lot of things. But one day, he meets a girl named Nagisa Furukawa. From there, you can choose how the story will move on. I won't say anything else, because spoilers.\n\nThe characters in this game are very likable.  In my current play-through, I haven't met two characters, and I didn't complete one of the arcs, but that's just how I played what was given to me. Some of their personalities are very believable and EXTREMELY likable maybe even lovable. You will get very attached to all of the characters, no matter how little, or long you may speak to them. \n\nIt plays just like an other VN, so not much to say there.\n\nThere are two settings in this story; the real world, which takes place in japan (the setting for a lot of slice of life anime, vn, manga, etc. apparently) and the secon done, The Illusionary World. The real world is where most of the story takes place and where things are the best. Personally, every time I saw that the story took me to \"The illusionary World\" I didn't enjoy playing it as much. Now it is a neat sub-plot, but not as much fun. You don't get any choices, so you're basically just reading a book, but with nice pictures, a nice soundtrack, and on a computer. \n\nArtstyle is nice. It's different. But nice. I like the design of the characters. Their eyes are the size of watermelons, but that's what makes them neat, and in some cases a little bit cute (not trying to be a weeb or anything). \n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful, even though there are only like 4-5 songs that you can clearly hear at every part of it. But the songs you do hear. HOLY SHIT! Soooo goood. During the emotional scenes, the song refelcts that. \n\nAll-in-all, I HIGHLY recommend this to any anime fan. ESPECIALLY those who have seen Clannad and Clannad ~After Story~. I give Clannad, a 9/10. The only downside to this game is the music, and the illusionary world segments. I just didn't enjoy those segments, now that's my opinion others will feel different. And the other downside is the music, you hear like the same 3 songs 95% of the times. 2 other songs 4% of the times. And the remaining 1% are songs you hear like once or twice, or during certain sections, certain converstions, and certain arcs, and if you don't play your cards right, you won't hear them. \n\nAlso, I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY *HIGHLY* watching the anime. It's very good.

Nov. 2015 der Visual Novel auf Steam in Englisch zu erhalten.\n\nWer nicht wei\u00df was ein Visual Novel ist, das ist ganz einfach ein interaktive Romanen mit Interaktions Funktion f\u00fcr mehr bei Wikipedia reinschauen (Japanische Adventures)\n\nWas man hier alles erf\u00e4hrt kommt zum teil auch im Anime vor aber nicht alles, es gibt z.B. Routen die garnicht im Anime vorkommen und so leider weniger tiefe geben aber das st\u00f6rt nicht so sehr find ich.\n\nWas ich auf jedenfall hier am Game so toll finde ist das es sch\u00f6n erz\u00e4hlt wird und der Soundtrack immer zur Situation passt, Die Hintergr\u00fcnde sind auch alle liebevoll gemacht und auch das Charakter Design stimmt, was auch immer wieder lustig ist das so gut wie immer ein Charakter aufs Maul gekommt und das nur aus puren vergn\u00fcgen.\n\nDie Story kann man sich denken es gibt immer 2 bis 3 entscheidungen die man w\u00e4hlen kann um die Geschichte vorzuf\u00fchren wenn man alles richtig macht kommt man zu dem Ende das man haben m\u00f6chte wie z.B, die Nagisa Route oder die Kyou Route und jedes ist dann anders mit Emotion belegt aber die St\u00e4rkste ist die die man Freischaltet die \"AFTER STORY\" wenn ihr die habt haltet eure Taschent\u00fccher bereit.\n\nAnsonsten Preis leistung meiner meinung nach ist gerecht es hat ein

All of them are commonly kind though, to an extent where you will want to support them or help them no matter what.  \n\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nCharacters: 10/10\nSoundtrack: 10/10\n\nPersonal visual novel score: 9.2/10\nhttps://vndb.org/u40815\n\n{ note; I finished reading this visual novel outside steam release }", "timestamp_created": 1452076525, "timestamp_updated": 1505583426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20346655": {"recommendationid": "20346655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008937040", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504848102}, "language": "english", "review": "visual novel is easy as hell to mess up in, but the story is extremely engaging and immersive.  i reccomend saving A LOT or else you'll be left frustrated trust me....\n\ni give this visual novel a 10/10 and i meant it.", "timestamp_created": 1452076380, "timestamp_updated": 1452076380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500618", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20336194": {"recommendationid": "20336194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121806970", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506799463}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, Of curse i liked it, but it turn bored, in some forms\nu know??\nWell i like how the story flows around Tomoya Okazaki, and his frinds we all know that\n(Spoiler Alert)\nBut it seem to start to be boring, when u try to finish al the routes to unlock the ''After History'' u know like the April 23-25\nThere are the same lines over and over again, nothing changes, but after these days the lines of the story change's a little bit\nand i'm not mad at this game, i loved it, but i hated that part of the game\n\n8.5/10\n\n(Sorry for ma english, i tried my best)", "timestamp_created": 1452035240, "timestamp_updated": 1452035240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20323692": {"recommendationid": "20323692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083009007", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452591513}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't cry but I swear there were damn ninjas cutting onions somewhere while I was playing this game. \n\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1452003437, "timestamp_updated": 1452003437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 90, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673818", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20320601": {"recommendationid": "20320601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097132580", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451724074}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6700\u8fd1\u5728\u8865\u756a\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u5c31\u4e0d\u591a\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f88\u826f\u5fc3\u73a9\u4e86\u597d\u4e45\uff08\u867d\u7136\u662f\u6309\u7740\u653b\u7565...\uff09\u73b0\u5728\u674f\u7ebf\u8fd8\u6ca1\u8fc7..\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u770b\u7684\u5f88\u7d2f\u963f\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1451995027, "timestamp_updated": 1451995027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20315397": {"recommendationid": "20315397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056070051", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513394026}, "language": "english", "review": "Watched the anime and it was probably my favorite so I picked this up as soon as it was realeased.

You either like them or you don't. CLANNAD is massive with tons of choices which matter... but it's also very expensive.\n\nI'll rather say things about the technical aspects of the \"game\":\n- There's a checkbox in settings, \"Make this program run more slowly in order to make other programs run faster\", by default it is off. The only difference I can see is that when off, the game will hog 100% of one processor at all times. When turned on... the game takes virtually no processing power. LIKE IT SHOULD AS AN IMAGE AND TEXT DISPLAYER. So, make sure to check that.\n- The game seems to have massive issues with Steam Overlay at the moment. There are many resolutions and scales (the game has scaling for 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%) where the Overlay simply won't show up. If you come across this and want to use the Overlay (useful for screenshots etc.) try changing resolution and/or scaling and it might pop up... while lagging terribly. Still seems to work, at least for me.\n- Otherwise, the game is rather barebones as far as settings go. It has the basics (like turning off voices per character, text window background color changing, etc.), but it lacks some stuff like being able to turn off the custom mouse cursor. Which is, to be honest, slightly infuriating, as the \"click point\" of the cursor is on the lower left, rather than upper left like it is just about everywhere else.\n- The save system is pretty cool as it allows you to write memos on each save file, which is really useful considering how the game has - probably without exaggeration - hundreds of choices which actually matter (not just \"pick this option or you get a bad end\" options, but options which determine what girls you'll meet. Some girls will even interact if you've met them both, whileas some will prevent you from going to see another girl (like the class rep stopping you from skipping class, where you'd meet another girl)). However, it completely lacks an auto-save function, which would be somewhat useful... even though it'd need to record 10-20 saves to be useful. Oh, and the system also allows you to move or delete saves with ease, which always nice to see.\n- The load system, unfortunately, doesn't show you any message backlog after loading a save. If you're coming back to a save after a while, you might be completely lost at what point of the game you're at because of this.\n- Dangopedia is pretty cool, though if you're a complete weeaboo you probably don't need it to explain what a kotatsu or bento are. Really useful for people new to the genre. Though, chances are such people would pick a cheaper title to start with...\n\nPS. Kyou best girl, but has the worst route.

I really did.\n\nOther visual novels I had completed before this are YU-NO and the Muv-Luv trilogy (not to mention countless real novels), and I fully expected this to be superior to those two due to dealing with something as serious as family and coming-of-age themes in a realistic setting. I waited over half a year for the Steam release and instantly bought this when it arrived. Well, having reached the True End after 50 hours of reading, I have to say I was disappointed. It was extremely difficult for me to enjoy the story because it's riddled with so many dramaturgical blunders, the major ones being:\n\nCartoony characters and forced drama.\n\nMost of the cast is made of generic moe/harem characters, and not very good ones at that. There's a Shy Clumsy Girl, a Tsundere, a Kind Woman, a Manchild, a Dumb Comic Relief Friend, and so on. Many of them don't behave even remotely like real, complex people do (with a few wonderful exceptions like Yoshino and Tomoyo). The worst offender is Nagisa Furukawa, who is the first girl the main character meets and the main love interest, and the likability of whom the After Story section relies on. To put it bluntly, she is an imbecile. She acts like a five-year-old, never achieves anything by herself, constantly needs support from the protagonist Tomoya, doesn't have interesting chemistry with him, and is just plain useless. The last straw for me was this: At the moment when she - who is supposed to become the president of the drama club she wishes to recreate - revealed that she had never even SEEN a play before, I instantly lost EVERY SINGLE BIT of remaining sympathy I had towards her. Hence In After Story, [spoiler]when she dies of childbirth, all I could think of was \"Good riddance.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThe pacing is also far too slow relative to the amount of actual story content. Most of the time is spent on these so-called \"slice of life\" sections, which are supposed to develop the characters, but are mostly filler in actuality. The result is that the plot takes ages to get going. After Story is not much better for the first few hours: Tomoya starts life as an adult, getting a job and his own apartment and so on. Aside from an admittedly good mentor-apprentice relationship, this part is not told in a particularly engaging way, it just... happens. Slowly.\n\nMost of the routes in School Story (first half of the VN) follow roughly the same formula: Tomoya meets a new character, many hours are spent getting to know their gimmicky personality, then Sad Stuff happens, and finally Tomoya fixes everything. Maybe we learn their parents are dead, or maybe something unfortunate is about to happen to them. Real drama comes from CHOICES: it grows naturally from elements of the plot such as the protagonist trying to attain an objective, interactions between characters with possibly differing goals and worldviews, mistakes they make due to weaknesses in their personality, and difficult decisions and consequenses. The \"drama\" in Clannad on the other hand usually comes from the authors forcing misfortunes onto the characters (Muv-Luv Alternative is also highly guilty of this) and appeals to the lowest common denominator, the prime example being Kotomi's backstory. I believe the problems of the drama come from the mindset the stories are made in. You see, Key, the maker of Clannad, is a company that specialises in producing these things called nakige, \"crying game\" - that is, games that are supposed to make you cry. There's nothing surprising about the \"sad\" stuff once you can fully expect it due to the genre, and it's even more ineffective when I couldn't care about most of the characters. It's just poor melodrama and feels shallow and exploitative.\n\nOne of the most famous, supposedly tear-jerking scenes happens near the end of After Story and deals with Tomoya's relationship with his father. Well, after 45+ hours of waiting for that payoff, I found that it resolved it in an incredibly contrived and anticlimactic fashion. Tomoya basically [spoiler]has a sudden epiphany after a talk with his grandmother (whom we've never seen nor heard of before, making her a deus ex machina) and decides to become a better person[/spoiler], just like that. (And there's some crying thrown in to make it more \"moving\". Jeez.)\n\nThe themes and lessons taught in Clannad are safe and inoffensive, aimed at making the reader a better person. \"You should be considerate of your family and the people around you.\" \"Hard, honest work pays off.\" \"You should accept that things don't always go the way you want and must look on the bright side.\" \"You should search for a better solution in situations that at first don't seem to have one.\" And so on. I gained very little from these as they were either something I myself already had figured out a long time ago or even some cases fundamentally disagree with. In real life I've dealt with far more complex and nuanced social situations than I encountered in Clannad.\n\nWith all this this complaining, you could get the impression that I think Clannad is bad. Not quite. While I find it incredibly overrated, it does have plenty of redeemable qualities. There are well-written characters and routes (Tomoyo Sakagami's, Mei Sunohara's and maybe Kappei Hiiraki's), and there are demonstrations of good responsible behaviour and life wisdom here and there. Tomoya has beliavable, interesting relationships with Tomoyo, Yoshino and [spoiler]Ushio[/spoiler]. Youhei Sunohara is a good source of slapstick and comic relief.\n\nIn the end, I felt I had most of my time wasted and wish I had watched the much shorter anime adaptation instead, and I recommend you do just that. Or maybe you will enjoy this more than I did, who knows.\n\nEDIT: I found these insightful articles on the Internet that discuss much more in-depth than I the weaknesses and strengths of Clannad (based on the anime version). Beware as they contain spoilers.\n\nhttp://wrongeverytime.com/2013/04/27/clannad-a-critical-overview-on-character-development-dramatic-structure-and-thematic-dissonance/\nhttps://subtlechaos.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/why-clannad-is-overrated-in-the-form-of-a-review/\nhttps://subtlechaos.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/why-clannad-after-story-is-also-overrated-in-the-form-of-a-review/", "timestamp_created": 1451569491, "timestamp_updated": 1482832440, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 222, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454696", "comment_count": "19", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20145862": {"recommendationid": "20145862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126320905", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497703828}, "language": "english", "review": "This VN is incredibly good!

For several years now he has been a delinquent with no goal after school ends, but after a chance meeting his life begins to change. How it changes is up to you as you make the choices of his life in this massive Visual Novel.\n\nClannad is absolutely massive. Don't go into this VN expecting to be done in a few hours. Well, perhaps you can finish a single path in a few hours (depending on your reading speed), but if you really want to dig into the game, it's going to take you much longer than that.\n\nI personally found Clannad extremely slow to start off, but once it got to the later parts of each story path, it really picked up. Once it does start to pick up, your emotions are going to get hammered as the story takes a lot of turns. That said, the slow ramping up parts made it really hard to read for me.\n\nI do recommend Clannad in general, however the story does start off a bit slow. The asking price is also extremely high for most (though considering how much content you are getting, I do feel the price is justified), so if you're on the fence about getting this then you may want to just try and wait for a good sale.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a key for review by the publisher.", "timestamp_created": 1451342936, "timestamp_updated": 1451343988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556274", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20031775": {"recommendationid": "20031775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094402110", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456651413}, "language": "english", "review": "It's incredibly easy to reccomend this game.

Nicht nur das der Anime gro\u00dfartig war, nein das Spiel ist es auch.\n\nIhr schl\u00fcpft in die Rolle von Tomoya Okazaki und erlebt seinen Alltag \u2013 seine Schule und seine Familie, die nur aus seinem Vater besteht\n\nAls Visual Novel verkauft sich das ganze Spiel zwar, aber man kann selbst einige Entscheidungen f\u00e4llen. Man sitzt also quasi davor und liest und sieht was geschieht. Klingt langweilig? Nein, ganz im Gegenteil, dank der Synchronisation, fast aller Charaktere ist es sehr gut geworden.Vor allem hat mir gefallen, dass die Synchro komplett in japanisch ist. F\u00fcr mich als Anime Liebhaber ein gro\u00dfes Plus f\u00fcr das Spiel. Das einzige Manko, was ich hierbei sehe ist, dass leider der einzige Charakter der nicht vertont wurde, der Protagonist ist.\n\nFalls man allerdings sagt \u201eIch brauche die Synchro nicht\u201c da kann man ganz einfach alle Stimmen ausschalten oder man kann auch jede Stimme einzeln ausschalten, falls man nur bestimmte haben m\u00f6chte.\n\nGut in Stimmung kommt man auch dank der wunderbaren Musik des Spiels, sie ist die Original Musik aus dem Anime und verzaubert, wie auch schon dort die Leute. Die Hintergr\u00fcnde sind sehr gut gemacht, so das man verfolgen kann, wo wir uns gerade befinden.\n\nWas mir pers\u00f6nlich sehr gut gefallen hat, ist das sogenannte \u201eDangopedia\u201c ein kleines Wikipedia im Spiel integriert, was bestimmte Begriffe erkl\u00e4rt wie zum Beispiel Bento. Wenn ein neuer Begriff vorkommt, den man nicht kennt kann man einfach in das Dangopedia schauen und wei\u00df bescheid. Und falls man mal etwas vergessen hat, kann man jederzeit nachschauen was das nochmal war.\n\nAn der Story gibt es nichts zu meckert die ist genauso, wie wir sie aus dem Anime kennen, aber ein paar kleine Nebenszenen haben sich schon mit eingeschlichen, was mich sehr freut. Allerdings muss man Englisch beherrschen, falls man der Geschichte folgen will, denn leider gibt es das Spiel bisher nur auf Englisch. Ich finde das nicht weiter schlimm, aber manch einer sieht das vielleicht anders.\n\nDie Ausdr\u00fccke der Charaktere hat Sekai Project super hin bekommen. Manchmal musste man schon lachen \u00fcber das Gesicht was jemand gemacht hat.\n\n\n\nAlles in allem ist das Spiel wohl eher nur was f\u00fcr Liebhaber des Animes, oder f\u00fcr welche die Animes m\u00f6gen.

It shows purpose, fulfillment and satisfaction can be attained and at the same time it teaches people that the most unexpected things can sometimes come from the most unexpected person. It will show just how far an ordinary man will go just to help his friends and family. \n\nClannad has many different arcs that are just as good as the last, the choices you make throughout Clannad can alter your entire experience, it has a beautiful story and many touching moments, those who are looking for drama, romance and slice of life genre look no further for Clannad is exactly what you are looking for.\n\nWhat truly sets Clannad apart from other visual novels is its clear representation of emotions. I would highly recommend this VN to anyone, it is well worth the money and has a very enjoyable story, it has excellently designed characters which are so incredibly believable; specifically with their personalities, as you keep reading the VN you will notice changes with each character, and you will come to love each and every one of them. \n\nOverall to be honest this VN is a must own, I believe that most people will be able to relate greatly with Clannad. \n\nI hope that this review has helped you in your decision in getting this VN and I hope you will enjoy the whole experience as much as I have; there is also a second VN that you should check out if you enjoy this one that being [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/ALlEN_KlNG/recommended/420100/] Clannad Side Stories[/url] I have also done a review on it if you wish to read my thoughts on it.\n\nI will finish by saying; Clannd is not only my favorite thing on steam but the anime adaptation is my favorite anime of all time, if you are so inclined I'd recommend you go check that out too; happy reading :3\n\np.s.

Und gerade das macht es umso eindrucksvoller, wenn das Spiel ohne viel drumrum trotzdem auf ganzer Linie \u00fcberzeugt. Die Geschichte ist unglaublich tiefgreifend und h\u00e4ngt stark von den Entscheidungen des Spielers ab. Die Dialoge (die letzendlich Hauptbestandteil des Spiels sind) sind stets abwechlungsreich gestaltet, und unterhalten einen entweder auf humorvolle Art und Weise oder nehmen einen emotional total mit. Unfassbar interessante Charaktere, die man im Laufe des Spiels immer besser kennenlernt sorgen daf\u00fcr, dass man die ganze Zeit auf neue Wendungen trifft und ein gro\u00dfes Interesse an den Entwicklungen der Personen hat und gespannt ist neues von ihnen zu erfahren.\n\nDie vielen m\u00f6glichen Entwicklungen und Enden der Geschichte sorgen f\u00fcr sehr lange Spielzeiten und motivieren zum weiter spielen mit anderen Entscheidungen in der Geschichte. Ebenso ist es m\u00f6glich eine After Story (bekannt aus dem Anime) freizuschalten, indem man alle relevanten Enden spielt, und die sog. \"Light Orbs\" sammelt. Somit bietet das Spiel einen enormen Umfang, der einem langanhaltenden Spielspa\u00df garantiert.\n\nDie musikalische Untermalung ist absolut grandios und zu jeder Situation passend und stimmungsvoll. Auch sind alle wichtigen Charaktere in japanisch vertont (abgesehen vom Protagonisten selbst). Optisch sind die Charaktere sehr sch\u00f6n gestaltet und wirken dadurch sehr lebendig.\n\nAls Fazit kann ich dieses Spiel jedem weiter empfehlen, der Fan des Animes ist, keine Abneigung gegen Visual Novels hat und \u00fcber halbwegs gute Englischkenntnisse verf\u00fcgt. Sicher kann man sagen, dass es sch\u00f6n gewesen w\u00e4re, wenn es die ein oder andere Animierte Szene im Spiel geben w\u00fcrde oder \u00e4hnliches, aber gerade dadurch, dass das Spiel so einfach gehalten ist und trotzdem \u00fcberzeugt, l\u00e4sst es zu einem Meisterwerk werden.", "timestamp_created": 1450040913, "timestamp_updated": 1450040913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19662351": {"recommendationid": "19662351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003922093", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464559789}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1449960139, "timestamp_updated": 1449960139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454257", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19655107": {"recommendationid": "19655107", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992676992", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490316794}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing a fandubbed version of Clannad waaay back....\nDamn game....

While the translation from Sekai Project is far from perfect, it is more polished than the fan translation that is available on Internet*. And Sekai Project really made an effort to make this the best CLANNAD release ever, including extras not available in the original PC release like voices, HD asserts, Dangopedia and Archivements.\n\n*: Sekai Project seems to have fixed most translation problems in the original release. I didn't personally replayed this game yet (again), so I can't say for sure, however it seems that Sekai Project really wants to make the best release of Clannad ever.\n\nIs it worth the $50? Yeah, it is a step price for a visual novel. However, visual novel are more like books than games, and the word count number for CLANNAD script [url=http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_longest_video_game_scripts]is bigger than the whole Harry Potter series, or almost thrice as big as The Lord of The Ring trilogy[/url]. So I think it is a good price, considering the effort to translate everything. Just FYI, this is my second playthrough of this VN (the first one was using the fan translation). I finished all routes and did all archivements, using a walkthrough so I wouldn't waste too much time going nowhere in the story, and my reading speed is pretty average. So around 100 hours is a good average of time that you will spend reading through everything.\n\nAnd like lots of reviews already said, yeah, you're going to cry. However, not only about the sad things, but from small piece of happiness that occurs in the progress of the story. This is a VN for everyone, it does not matter if you're a man or women, child or adult. This is my second time playing it (the first one was the fan translation 3 years ago) and I still cried for different reasons.\n\nIf you never heard of CLANNAD before, just play it. Don't bother watching the anime or reading the manga adaptations first. It is not that they're not good, the anime at least is very good (I never read the manga), however it does miss some of the small details that makes this work awesome.

Unlike a lot of visual novels the choices you make are not always easy and honestly I found myself really struggling to choose sometimes. \nTomoyo forever holds my heart.\n\n10/10 Would cry again.", "timestamp_created": 1449802657, "timestamp_updated": 1449802657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19608833": {"recommendationid": "19608833", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969112280", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450559318}, "language": "english", "review": "Onion Cutting Simulator 2015", "timestamp_created": 1449782536, "timestamp_updated": 1449782536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 560, "votes_funny": 1137, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835461", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19607498": {"recommendationid": "19607498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115466768", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467408068}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr sch\u00f6ne Geschichte bis Jetzt gut Gemacht.\nLeider nur auf Englisch/Japanisch es hilft aber enorm den Anime zu kennen.\nEine Deutsche Version (Untertitel) w\u00fcrde den Spiel Spa\u00df f\u00fcr mich noch mehr Steigern und andere Leute sicherlich zum Kauf verleiten.\nF\u00fcr jeden Fan ein Muss.\n\n\n\nNachtrag:\n\nIch will das spiel in 4k haben!", "timestamp_created": 1449778707, "timestamp_updated": 1454348618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19589132": {"recommendationid": "19589132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165593842", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450021147}, "language": "french", "review": "Makes me cry, and cry, and cry, and thinking about life and sentiments. \n\nMany hours to play and havin fun, I really like the scenarios and the arts-scenes are beautiful.\n\nJust sit down, launch the game and listens the ost !", "timestamp_created": 1449693282, "timestamp_updated": 1449693282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504294", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19583240": {"recommendationid": "19583240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131175544", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 7751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492158443}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game because I want to be a Fuko-Master\n\nFuko-chan <3", "timestamp_created": 1449671880, "timestamp_updated": 1449671880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19581290": {"recommendationid": "19581290", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998203861", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451750949}, "language": "english", "review": "The Steam release is my second playthrough of the game - the stories are still amazingly powerful, and I'm only a fraction of the way through the amount of content here.\n\nThoroughly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1449663515, "timestamp_updated": 1449663515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19578714": {"recommendationid": "19578714", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964921064", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449089394}, "language": "english", "review": "Only tough guys cry when playing CLANNAD.", "timestamp_created": 1449645980, "timestamp_updated": 1449645980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19578244": {"recommendationid": "19578244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084559482", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450160415}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't let the expensive price haunt you. Though $50 is a lot of money for game, much less a visual novel, it is definitely worth it. Clannad is one of the greatest visual novels of all time. If it helps you, go see the anime if will help make up your mind wether this is worth the buy (anime only covers one route). \n\nPlot - 5/5 The plot can be slow as sometimes one single day in the visual novel can take half an hour or more to finish. But it is worth it, as it has an amazing plot. Especially After Story. Anyways, the visual novel has many routes, and if you've watched the anime, basically every girl has a route of her own. There are also some other routes other than the waifu routes. There is also unlocking After Story, which takes a lot of time. So this visual novel isn't a quick 3-10 hours - it will probably take over 100 if you want to finish all routes and clear the game. You will also get many choices throughout, not leaving you to just watch without actually doing anything. Many choices are important, and can sometimes lock you into certain routes.\n\nArt - 4/5 Some may not like Clannad's unique artstyle. At first I was unsure but quickly got used to the interesting artsyle. Sekai Project also did a great job of improving the quality of the overall game. Backgrounds are great, as they actually include people in them and there is some variety to some backgrounds. (e.g classroom has a few backgrounds depending on the time of day)\n\nSound - 5/5 The soundtrack for Clannad is amazing. Each song can easily fit the mood and current scenario. It is also a pleasure to listen to. It was also a nice bonus for Sekai Project to get the original voice actors from the anime (excluding Tomoya).\n\nCharacters - 4/5 Each character gets their own moment to shine. Almost all characters have a route, and each character has a unique personality. Most are very likeable as well. \n\nOverall - 5/5\nGet this game if you are a fan of Clannad, or if you want a nice visual novel to play. Highly recommend. If you are not able to get it at the price it is at, it is definitley worth getting the game on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1449642330, "timestamp_updated": 1449835622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820772", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19578162": {"recommendationid": "19578162", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969450259", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464476287}, "language": "english", "review": "As a fan on anime, manga, light novels, and visual novels, I'm well versed in many forms of these Japanese mediums.  But playing through Clannad will always be one of my most precious memories.  With an incredibly well-balanced plethora of genres, this VN has something for everyone.  Comedy, tragedy, mystery, romance, action, drama, etc..  On top of that, the visuals are stunningly beautiful, and the voice actors and actresses did a fantastic job.  The storylines are amazingly deep and interesting, and you can't help but fall in love with all of the characters.  And you can never go wrong with Jun Maeda being in charge of the musical direction.  The only bad thing I can say about it is that there are a few minor spelling and grammar mistakes.  Other than that, it is a flawless work of art.\n\nKey Studios is famous for their visual novels, and by playing through Clannad, you will understand why.  Whether you've played hundreds of VNs or you haven't played a single one, I highly recommend Clannad to anyone and everyone.\n\nSound:10/10\nVisuals: 9/10\nStory: 10/10\nTranslation: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1449641642, "timestamp_updated": 1449641642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19577481": {"recommendationid": "19577481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063150481", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481351041}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm really enjoying this game. The characters are great, and their stories are emotionally heavy and beautifully told.\n\nI don't have a lot of prior experience with visual novels, but this feels like more than just a Choose Your Own Adventure book. It feels like there's stuff going on in the background no matter which areas of the story I choose to explore for any given playthrough. For example, I'll play through one game, and catch a glimpse of something another character I'm not spending my time with is up to. Then I'll play through a second time, focus on that character, and get their backstory. Then I'll play through a third time, do stuff with another character, and see, yet again, another facet of that first character's story. It's really interesting.\n\nA lot of people complain about the $50 price for a visual novel. I do expect that price will go down after a while and agree that it should, But for me, it was worth it to pay $50 to ensure this beautiful localization even exists (I got it through the kickstarter).

I would HIGHLY recommend following the Clannad walkthrough guide on the Kazamatsuri web site. Without it, you may be hard pressed in figuring out what it is you're supposed to do. This game is basically like reading a book with added audio and soundtrack. Also, you must complete the game numerous times (while altering your choices) in order to experience all the routes. The first route for me (baseball route) was nothing special imo but it works as a good introduction for all the characters in the game. The proceeding routes from there are impactful personal stories of each of the characters. It is also important to note that while the game is not exactly a fantasy genre, it does employ fantasy elements such as the orbs of light that you collect as well as the Illusionary World (all of which become relevant in After Story). After Story is considered to be the \"main\" story and is unlocked after collecting 8 light orbs obtained throughout different routes. (The skip diolouge function makes this much faster to get through). \n\nI personally loved the story telling of the game and the emotional ride was unforgettable.

Prepare for the feels--snickers at the witty and sarcastic humor, \"aww\"s at the cute moments scattered throughout, and the waterfalls of tears during some of the sad moments (but being the manly man I am, I managed to make it through without crying. Yep. Nearly 40 hours without shedding a single tear...am I even human?) It's probably going to be one of the longest games you play, with about ~1.29 million English words. Granted, this number might not mean much but here are some other works for comparison:\n\nGrisaia no Kajitsu: ~1 million\nThe entire Harry Potter Series: ~1 million\n4 book Twilight series: 591,434\n4 book LotR series: 550,147\nWitcher 3's script: ~450,000\n\nSo basically what I'm trying to say is this: CLANNAD takes you for a ride on a rollercoaster of emotions for a long, long time. Out of anyone else I know, I have the shortest playtime with around 33 hours of actual playing. It's also praised as being one of the best visual novels of al time. I think I've made my point pretty clear, but the only obstacle stopping most people from buying is the steep $50 pricepoint. However, this game will probably take you 50+ hours to complete (I mean every route, every achievement) and paying less than a dollar for each hour you enjoy doesn't seem like too bad a deal. \n\nHopefully I convinced you to buy this game, or at least consider it! If you're still on the fence about this game, feel free to add me as a friend or message me any questions about CLANNAD/suggestions for my review!

[h1] But was it worth your money? [/h1]\nAfter spending a lot of time reading it, my answer is: [b]Yes[/b], it is. Or maybe [b]No[/b]. It depend.\n\nHaving played the game long time ago, both in its native alchemical moonrunes language (because PSVita is dying on western market) and in fan-translated by based Doki, I still find myself coming back reading this novel again and again and enjoyed it everytime. [i][u]Especially[/u][/i] Tomoyo's route.\n\nTalking about the Sekai's translation, I gotta say that I'm a bit disappointed at some point and wish they just stick with the Doki's original translation. I'm not saying they're bad, maybe it was just me being nostalgia with the old Doki's translation but Sekai need to stop doing re-translation of an already fan-translated visual novel. Overall though their (re)translation is good, not great. Most people will be okay with the translation though, but I know some people will complain.\n\nAbout the content of the game itself? You'll be in for a deep, long and full of suffering treat that you'd better say that the amount of tissue in your room is from masturbation and not from (manly) tears. The arts is undoubtly outdated and overstayed its welcome but then again this is a [b]RETRANSLATION[/b] not a remaster. I wish that Sekai Project get their hand on Siglus and port the whole CLANNAD there but I guess VisualArts hasn't released the SDK for public yet and Sekai Project is being treated like an outsourcing developer (thus why, if you haven't heard yet, VisualArts is going to release Harmonia, Tomoyo After and Little Busters! under their own flag, not Sekai Project's). The art might gets on the nerve for some people, I myself to be honest cannot stand Nagisa and Ryou because their design is just too weird for me (ROACHHHH) but bear with it for the journey you have will be worth it in the end.\n\nSoundtrack is top-notch as expected of Jun Maeda and Shinji Orito, from the low of melancholic to the high of happy, it has everything on store for you that ready to kicks in at the right time. I have the soundtrack on my iTunes and from the playcount apparently I have played most of the soundtrack of CLANNAD and Tomoyo After around the average of 600 times. My favorite gotta be Roaring Tides and Light Colors, and the vocaloid version of Over.\n\nFor the story it doesn't have to be explained in this review as CLANNAD is pretty mainstream, but for those who never got around to read the VN nor watch the anime, the story for each heroines varies and I'm sure each one of them has their own entertaining moments just right for any type of people. Ofc [spoiler]Nagisa dies at the end of CLANNAD[/spoiler] is obligatory for everytime CLANNAD is mentioned.\n\nFor those who already watched the anime or confused of where to start for CLANNAD, [u]READ THE VISUAL NOVEL FIRST[/u]. I cannot emphasize this enough to everyone whenever they asked about this question. [b] Always [/b] read source material. Granted, this is a translated source material, but one who cannot read alchemical moonrunes cannot complain, can they?\n\nSo to answer the question that many have asked, [b]Does this game worth its full price of $50?[/b]\n[b] NO [/b]\nOnly grab this visual novel if it's on sale below $40 or [b] ONLY [/b] buy it if you are a fan of CLANNAD/Keyfags. Or, you know, you have lots of money to waste. If I can be honest myself, for digital download of CLANNAD it should be around $35~$40. That's the reason why I was the early bird backer for CLANNAD so I can get it for only $30.\n\nNow give me Tomoyo After and Rewrite on Steam already VisualArts/Key, I have waited for this day to come for a long, long time ago.\n\n[h1] I'm a Tomoyofag btw.

Clannad definitely has the best story and superb soundtracks of all products by Key.\n\nThat being said, I have not yet played the English-translated version, the above review is based on my past experience playing on Japanese version. Do not let the high price tag defers your decision to purchase this game, with the amount of content you are buying in, it is totally worth its $40 marks. \n\nLastly, if you have not yet read the novel nor watched the anime, just take it slow and enjoy the flow of the story.

I can only imagine how much longer others have been waiting compared to me. \n\nPlaying the VN takes some time to get used to if you are used to watching it in crisp 1080P on blu-ray before this and the anime had much better drawn characters but the VN gets it's point across to you quite well, only having been in the game for a little under 2 hours now and I have already seen a fair bit of content I have not seen/read in the anime! The VN has all the tracks you know and love from the anime as well. I look forward to seeing the paths of the character relationships as the game progresses and look into getting Okazaki with the other girls and seeing how that plays out, however I think we all know which pairing is the best xD ( dango? )\n\nAs a Clannad Fan, I would give this a 9/10 ( More of a personal preference, kind of a tough one since I know this VN is actually from 2004 but me personally just going from the blu-ray anime to this kind of annoyed me but 9 is still great, the resemblence to the anime is very good with the exception of some minor details at times but the asking price of $50 is high in my opinion for an old game which isn't quite on the same level of visual quality as Tales Of Grisaia for example ) \n\nFor people who have yet to watch or know pretty much anything about this series I still highly recommend you get this VN, but if you want better value purchase copies of Clannad and Clannad afterstory on blu-ray then buy this later on when hopefully the price drops some so you can get yourself into more Clannad content as I am currently experiencing! :3", "timestamp_created": 1448415595, "timestamp_updated": 1448417042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19259245": {"recommendationid": "19259245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097725655", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485376862}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "O jogo est\u00e1 excelenete, a interface est\u00e1 bem polida e os comandos est\u00e3o \u00f3timos.\nA trilha sonora \u00e9 muito boa e os gr\u00e1ficos em HD est\u00e3o bem n\u00edtidos.\nA arte \u00e9 muito bonita mas em alguns momentos a face dos personagens parece um pouco desleixada, mas pelo que parece, foi o estilo de arte adotado pelos produtores da obra.\nO melhor de tudo s\u00e3o as hist\u00f3rias do jogo.\nCada rota \u00e9 \u00edmpar e vale a pena participar dela.\nSegundo o que foi contabilizado, o jogo chega a ter 300 horas continuas de hist\u00f3ria.\n\nEstou dando altas garglhadas com as \"trollagens\" do \"Tomoya-kun\".\nCom certeza eu recomendaria esse jogo aos meus amigos e afirmo que ele valeu cada centavo.\n\nEnfim, 10/10.\n\nObs:\nAlgo que eu acho que faltou foi o menu de \"extras\" com as cenas e as artes dos personagens. \nNesse sentido, preferi o menu de Grisaia no Kajitsu que cont\u00e9m at\u00e9 os cap\u00edtulos da hist\u00f3ria que voc\u00ea j\u00e1 jogou.\nTamb\u00e9m senti falta de ilustra\u00e7\u00f5es na Dangop\u00e9dia (mas gostei muito do nome kkkk ^^)\nPara quem for jogar, prepare-se para chorar no After History.

CLANNAD was the VN that got me hooked on VNs and I wouldn't have started with this genre if it wasn't for CLANNAD. That being said, I can't express just how happy I am being able to play the game on this platform.\n\nNot only do I have the chance to experience the story with a terrific translation, the addition of the dangopedia, HD resources, and refurbished BGMs makes it feel like a whole new experience. This experience is something that I never imagined that I would be able to have while playing CLANNAD.\n\nAs such, I highly recommend CLANNAD to visual novel fans, anime fans familiar with the series, and even adventure gamers who enjoy games such as The Walking Dead. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did when I first played, and as much as I will over the next few weeks that I pour my life into this game.", "timestamp_created": 1448358537, "timestamp_updated": 1448358537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19247092": {"recommendationid": "19247092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070476977", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448372398}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5c45\u7136\u8fde\u65e5\u8bed\u5b57\u5e55\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\uff1f\n\n\u8fa3\u9e21\uff01\n\n\u73a9\u4e86\u51e0\u5206\u949f\u4e4b\u540e\u624d\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b9e\u82f1\u6587\u5b57\u5e55\u4e5f\u633a\u5e26\u611f\u7684 \u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd8\u662f\u66f4\u60f3\u73a9\u65e5\u8bed\u5b57\u5e55\n\n\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u8eab\u6ca1\u5565\u8bf4\u7684\u4e86\n\n\n\n\n\u6e1a\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u6b4c\u4e00\u54cd\u8d77\u6765 \u6211\u5c31\u5c0f\u58f0\u8ddf\u5531\u8d77\u6765\u4e86 \u55ef \u5728\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u91cc\n\n\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8bf4\u70b9\u6709\u8425\u517b\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\n\u8fd9\u53ea\u662f\u4e2a\u7c89\u4e1d\u5411\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u5982\u679c\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u559c\u6b22cl\u52a8\u753b\u800c\u60f3\u4e70\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4f60\u5931\u671b\u3002\u60f3\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u4f53\u9a8c\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u901a\u5173\u6240\u6709\u652f\u7ebf\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f88\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5f88\u5927\u7cbe\u529b\uff08100h\u4ee5\u4e0a\u662f\u80af\u5b9a\u8981\u7684\uff09\u3002\u800c\u4e14\u6700\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u5feb\u611f\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u6ca1gtaol\u4e00\u628a\u62a2\u52ab\u6765\u7684\u591a\u3002\u8d2d\u4e70\u9700\u8981\u614e\u91cd\u3002\n\n+1\u515a\u8bf7\u65e0\u89c6\u4e0a\u9762\u8fd9\u6bb5\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1448358035, "timestamp_updated": 1448595581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541971", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19246745": {"recommendationid": "19246745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198231154168", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453185227}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best visual novels ever created, Clannad has an absolutely breathtaking story and enough content to keep you enthralled for a long time.

take that into account with this review.  CLANNAD is a long-form visual novel that primarily details the life of delinquent high-schooler Tomoya Okazaki during his last years of school and his interactions with the people in the small town he lives in.   It's a comedy and drama mix, full of a hilarious and endearing cast of characters that you'll love to laugh and cry with.  It remains a poignant and enduring work today as a testament to the importance of \"family,\" the impermanence of life, and the consequence of choice.  Great, upbeat songs that can get easily stuck in your head, accompanied by glorious somber pieces that encapsulate the feelings on screen. The art style is a bit of a turn-away for me personally, but it still has great backgrounds and is at least consistent in what it depicts.\n\nOn a more technical level, this game is a fairly traditional branching-path bishoujo game.  On a surface level you would expect this to be a very fanservice-heavy, \"compliment girls to advance relationship\" kind of setup, but for CLANNAD the dating sim elements are very toned down, there are no sex scenes, or really even any fanservice.  Certain routes even follow some of the male characters, who in my opinion are by-and-large much more interesting than some of the more archetypical/tropey female cast members.  Thankfully the more important characters seem to have the most screentime and longest routes.  \"Gameplay\" exists solely to continue the story in various directions, based on a few small options that lead the main character in a certain direction (for instance one involves simply going to talk to someone you see outside a window).  Most of the actual character interaction is done without player input, so don't expect much heavy moralizing on choices. Specific to this English version of the game is the \"Dangopedia,\" which explains some of the more culturally-specific aspects of Japan, namely things like food, holidays, school life, etc. that us Westerners might not immediately understand.  And finally to those worried about the steep price, please note that CLANNAD is the eighth largest video game script in the world, and clocks in at 1.4 million words, almost a time and a half that of the ENTIRE Harry Potter franchise.  \n\nIf you like to laugh, cry, and overall become emotionally attached to a great cast of characters, CLANNAD is a great entry into the visual novel genre, and works well in distancing itself from the more questionable aspects that could keep people away from them.  Though if I could recommend anything to you, it would be the anime. :)", "timestamp_created": 1448344761, "timestamp_updated": 1448344761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19245446": {"recommendationid": "19245446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031537407", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 8204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500909339}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great VN and it's good tho for 60 NZD that's rather steep and it's great having the dangopedia and achievements and the over arcing story is amazing overall tho other than that the games fukin amazing (i've completed the fan translation before hand) i think i'm gonna lose another month relearning routes mixed with my slow reading and having to re-read things", "timestamp_created": 1448344377, "timestamp_updated": 1500950009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19245436": {"recommendationid": "19245436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025427955", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448430341}, "language": "english", "review": "feel a feel", "timestamp_created": 1448344312, "timestamp_updated": 1448344312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19245322": {"recommendationid": "19245322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063208027", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469077349}, "language": "english", "review": "Dango.", "timestamp_created": 1448343528, "timestamp_updated": 1448343528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19245294": {"recommendationid": "19245294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093957128", "num_games_owned": 6036, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491192243}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u6ca1\u6709\u597d\u8bf4\u7684\u4e86\uff0c\u4e70\u5c31\u5bf9\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1448343327, "timestamp_updated": 1448343327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625080", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19245079": {"recommendationid": "19245079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088567164", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448341660}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u591a\u8bf4\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u6ca1\u63a5\u89e6\u8fc7\u8fd9\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u4f60\u4e70\u4e86\u4e0d\u5403\u4e8f\uff0c\u63a5\u89e6\u8fc7\u7684\u5c31\u5f53\u5145\u503c\u4fe1\u4ef0\u5427", "timestamp_created": 1448341757, "timestamp_updated": 1448341757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19245068": {"recommendationid": "19245068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045306584", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448341559}, "language": "english", "review": "Click start.\nMusic begins playing.\nAlready out of tissues.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1448341683, "timestamp_updated": 1448341683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 912, "votes_funny": 969, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851826", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19244993": {"recommendationid": "19244993", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981389856", "num_games_owned": 878, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448693379}, "language": "english", "review": "i cri evrytiem ;_;\n\nIt's definitely worth getting the VN if you enjoyed the anime, as the story in the VN is much more detailed.

After a year of anticipation and throwing almost all my money at the Kickstarter campaign, our beloved Clannad is here! All you VN lovers should already know that Clannad is a universally-acclaimed masterpiece. But for those who don't know much (or anything) about it, know this: it's one hell of a rollercoaster ride. Clannad will have you laughing, crying, happy, angry, and a whole slew of other emotions. In fact, Clannad (both the anime series and the VN) is the only story that has truly made me empathize with the characters and relate to it in my own life. I dare say it to be a life-changing experience if you open your heart.\n\nWhile Clannad is almost always described as a romance game, there is so much more than that. While there is a lot of romantic material, Clannad offers an endless ocean of life lessons around family, friends, overcoming hardship, making excruciating decisions, dealing with change, and much more. Clannad really made me take a deep look into my own life and helped me overcome many personal barriers relating to my own family and friends. It has positively influenced my outlook in many areas of my life and I will forever be grateful for it.\n\nEven if you don't think you would enjoy it much, do yourself a favor and pick it up. And if you already previously played it, buy it on Steam! Compared to the original Full Voice version, it has so many new enhancements that warrant playing it again (as if the story alone wasn't enough!). The HD assets, Steam achievements, and Dangopedia are all big bonuses to me. The only things missing are trading cards and emoticons.\n\nAnd lastly, join the Clannad steam group for all your Clannad needs! We're active and very friendly and love discussing all things Clannad (as well as other games, anime, etc.). You could say we're Steam's very own Big Dango Family! Also, if you ever want to talk about Clannad, feel free to friend/message me!

Developed by KEY back in 2004 who are well known for works such as Air, Kanon & Little Busters and the well known anime Angel Beats comes a beautiful story of family and friendship that I think we can all learn a little from. This visual novel is packed with 80+ hours of content, an interesting & funny set of characters, a story that will make you think about your own life and a soundtrack that brings a tear to my eye every time I hear it.\n\nIf you have ever seen the anime or enjoyed any of KEYS previous works I urge you to read the visual novel, not only does it add a lot more to the story than the anime but with this release you get HD assets and the Dangopedia to help understand those cultural terms that might not make sense to the western audiance making this the most complete release of the game to date.\n\nIf you are a fan of the drama/slice of life & romance genre I recommend you give CLANNAD a go, you will smile, you will laugh, you will love & you will cry.\n\nP.S bring some tissues, you

I cant believe its taken so long to get to this point and have had lots of different choices to make, does this mean I can go way off the main story line of the anime if I so wish? I dont know not looked into it to be honest. All I will state right now is, the development team have done a great job on the HD remastering and the music giving me that nostalgic feel and has made feel the rush when I first watched this show. I did think the price was steep, but after seeing the size of this game I can honestly say it justifies the cost entirely . Finally I love the dangopedia, a databank thats keeps hold of all the words or phases you come along your journey and explaining them in detail once you come across them.\n\nAs of right now I can recommend this to anyone who loved the show or likes a heartfelt romance, If youre unsure about it, go and watch the anime as I really believe this story should be viewed by all  (PS buy some tissues).", "timestamp_created": 1448325339, "timestamp_updated": 1448398660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19242510": {"recommendationid": "19242510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142346635", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511798223}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ffa\u305f\u3061\u306f\u767b\u308a\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u3002\u9577\u3044\u3001\u9577\u3044\u5742\u9053\u3092\u3002\n\u5bf9\u8fd9\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u611f\u60c5\u592a\u6df1\uff0c\u60f3\u4e9b\u4ec0\u4e48\u90fd\u5199\u4e0d\u51fa\u6765\u3002\n\nPros\n1.\u8fd9\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\u662fClannad\uff0c\u8fd9\u5df2\u7ecf\u662f\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u4e86\n2.\u5df2\u9ad8\u6e05\u5316\uff08\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5c45\u7136\u4e0d\u662f16\uff1a9\u7248\u672c\u7684\uff09\n\nCons\n1.\u5b9a\u4ef7\u592a\u9ad8 \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2aGalgame\u5356\u7684\u4e5f\u592a\u8d35\u4e86\uff08\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5145\u503c\u4fe1\u4ef0\u4e0d\u8d35\uff09\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u6211\u53ea\u80fd\u8bf4 Shut up and take my money\n2.\u6ca1\u6709\u65e5\u6587\u539f\u6587\u7684\u9009\u9879\n\u661f\u4e4b\u68a6\u5df2\u7ecf\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u65e5\u6587\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8bf4\u4e86\u5728\u8003\u8651\u4ee5\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u52a0\u5165\u65e5\u6587\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5c3d\u65e9\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\n\n10/10 \n\n\u6700\u540e\u5e0c\u671bKey\u793e\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e5f\u80fd\u5c3d\u65e9\u767b\u9646\u5230Steam\u4e0a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1448325231, "timestamp_updated": 1448325231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735082", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19242468": {"recommendationid": "19242468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111771847", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448324445}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "O visual novel est\u00e1 excelente!

However, if you do not wish to die, you can instead be allowed to live and make a happy life for yourself. But instead of execution, your punishment will be to have your happy life collapse around you, with you being forced to watch those you love and care for most die before your eyes without being able to do anything to help them.\n\nSo dislikers, what will you choose as your punishment?\n\nAnyway, CLANNAD is one of those classic VN's that, until now, has never been officially translated. It did recieve a critically acclaimed anime adaptation, and if you have seen that you can basically look at this game as being the \"unabridged version\". This game is quite old now (2004), so some might find the art a little odd, but the story itself is superb and at the core of why this game, and the anime that spawned from it, are considered among the best ever made.\n\nAs for the price tag... it is pretty damn steep. Too steep some would say for a VN, and I'll respect the decisions of those who decide that the current 50$ cost is just too much for what is essentially a story game with some voices and anime drawings. But there is one thing I do have to say about the cost: This is one of the largest game stories ever created. I don't know for sure, but around 80+ hours is the generally accepted figure given for how long it takes to beat this game. That means, at a price of $50, you will be recieving ~96 minutes of game for every dollar you spend. It might be a visual novel, but that is still a hell of alot more bang for your buck than most Triple-A game releases these days.\n\nFor those who do choose to buy and play this for the first time having had no exposure to either this game or the anime before this... enjoy the ride. It's a long one, but very very much worth it.

Clannad tells a deep story that unlike 90% of visual novels on Steam, doesn't value fanservice more than story and character development. \n\nIn terms of presentation it's great. The artstyle may be hit and miss to some people, however there is a charm to the aesthetic, even if it's a bit odd at first glance. The HD remaster definately improves the quality of the images, when compared to the resolution of the standard edition of Clannad. The music is really good and helps to set the mood of the scenes being shown and the voice acting is very good, even if the protagonist isn't voiced like he was in the anime.\n\n Clannad is an incredibly long visual novel, in fact it's one of the longest visual novels available. Each route in the first half of Clannad takes around 5-12 hours to complete, depending on the route and reading speed.\n\nThe second half of Clannad, which unlocks after completing all the routes of the first half, is easily the greatest part of the visual novel, even if mostly because most of the impactful moments happen during that half. In total Clannad probably takes around 100+ to complete fully. \n\nI will say that it probably wont be everyone's cup of tea. There isn't much violence or sexual innuendo in Clannad, as it's focused primarily on telling a captivating romance story. It's a very family oriented story, as that is the main theme of the visual novel.\n\nif you are interested in Clannad, there is also an anime adaptation that faithfully follows most of the routes (although omitting some of them completely, even omitting an entire character.)\nOverall if you enjoy visual novels, I can highly recommend Clannad.

Clannad blends a fun slice of life school setting with emotional drama and romance. Combined with a stellar soundtrack and pretty CG this makes the formula for a great game and a lot of tears. Those looking to only complete a couple of arcs might see that the high price isn't justified and should wait for a sale as I don't see 8 hours of gameplay is worth. Those who are commited to reading everything the game has to offer will be rewarded with one of best stories ever written with about 100 hours of content.\n\nClannad is about Tomoya Okazaki, (or whoever you name the MC) a teenage boy who is struggling to find meaning in his life with his high school days slowy disappearing. One day on his way to school, he meets a strange girl, Nagisa. He sees her attempting to motivate herself to go to school and keep moving through life as well as talking to herself, asking herself how to move forward when everything changes. Tomoya befriends her and the visual novel revolves around Tomoya and his adventures with him and his friends in this slice of life novel. I really don't want to spoil anything and recommend you play if without any spoilers. If you didn't watch the anime I highly recommend playing this first and then watch the anime after.\n\nClannad has one of the best original soundtracks ever, beautiful art and CG, and one of the bests characters and stories for a game. If you're looking for a waifu game you'll like this game, but the game gets more deep than that after multiple arcs and playthroughs. Each main arc generally revolves around a girl and each arc has it's own story and not a variation of the same story. You can pour about 100+ hours into this game just to experience every arc and every arc is different with different characters focused on and the main plot and driving action being different. This is almost like 10 novels in one, so there replay value after you finish an arc is huge. I recommend this for anyone looking for a visual novel or want to start reading visual novels\n\n-The characters are extremely lively and unique. From your best friend, to the the boys dorm manager. Most of the characters you will end up liking by the time their arc is over. Some of the character arcs are lively fun and full of laughter and some will ultimately make you sob. The overall story is beautiful and I think everyone should experience every arc including the After Story arc which is unlocked after finishing every arc. Even after finishing the main After Story, you'll need to play it a couple more times. And every time you do you'll need more tissues.\n\n-Gameplay is you basic visual novel gameplay. There are very few interactables and even those are simple. You get to make A LOT of choices though. These choices aren't your typical go hang out with waifu B to end up with her in the end. The choices you make impact the game a lot and some arcs require specific actions to complete and you might get a \"bad ending\" as a result which might turn people off. I recommend a guide if you get stuck because it'll be fustrating to get \"bad endings.\" But try to play the game without spoilers. If you watched the anime then go ahead and use a guide. The anime grazed through the arcs pretty fast so there's still a lot unexplored content for you to go through even though you know the main plot. At it's best, you're laughing at all the shananigans and hi-jinks you and you're friends get into. You'll also be crying because the writing allows you to connect with almost all of the characters and you'll generally feel for them. At it's worst which is rare, you'll be reading long passages where nothing significant is happening or you're reading over a passage you already read. (Skip previously read text feature, helps a bit with this) Overall, reading this novel is enjoyable and I found myself changing who's my favorite girl each time I finish an arc.\n\n-The music sets the tone for the game very well. Each track sets the mood of the situation almost perfectly and it intensifies the experience. Clannad is has one of the best OST in video games and is up there with TWEWY and Persona 4\n\nClannad changed my life. I got into visual novels when I was about in middle school and this novel helped me find meaning in life. I recommend this novel to anyone who was like me, who went to a new school and didn't know anyone and anyone who struggles to find a reason to keep going or don't know what they're going to do with their life. I generally recommend this game to everyone. I gaurentee it will affect your life in some small way. \n\nOverall I give this game a 10/10. The beautiful music and CG along with a well written story make this one of the best visual novels ever.", "timestamp_created": 1448315175, "timestamp_updated": 1459233893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516149", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19240520": {"recommendationid": "19240520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028168513", "num_games_owned": 1281, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448323487}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u542c\u4e86\u5feb2\u5c0f\u65f6 \u6f6e\u9e23 \u4e86 ......\n\n\n\u633a\u591a\u670b\u53cb\u8bf4\u6ca1\u4e2d\u6587\u6ca1\u65e5\u6587\u6587\u672c\u73a9\u6bdb\u3002\n\n\n\u55ef...\u8fd9\u7b97\u4e8b\u5417\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1448314842, "timestamp_updated": 1448321255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735065", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19240387": {"recommendationid": "19240387", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970450904", "num_games_owned": 461, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507573310}, "language": "english", "review": "No, this is not a game featuring an Irish band. Or Enya.\n\nCLANNAD is a popular Japanese visual novel that was originally released in 2004, developed by a company called Key. Having been translated to English by fans in the past, this is the first official English release, courtesy of a Kickstarter started by Sekai Project in 2014. This iteration includes HD visuals (which I believe are from the PS3 version), Dangopedia (to explain Japanese terms, culture etc.) and Steam achievement support.\n\nI am not going to say very much about the story at all because it is extremely spoiler heavy, so beware of looking up almost anything to do with the series if it is new to you. It is difficult to specify an exact genre, but drama, romance, slice of life and supernatural all fit rather appropriately.\n\nThe Steam tag of \u201cStory Rich\u201d could not be more apt. The word count of CLANNAD surpasses a number of books (combined) in classic literature. That does not automatically make it great, but this volume of text feeds and gives flavour to the many rich and different story arcs and endings that are available within the game. This means there is well in excess of over 100 hours if you want to read and see absolutely everything. CLANNAD is not a kinetic visual novel so this means gameplay requires you to make many decisions throughout the game which will impact the story.\n\nThe story is an emotional rollercoaster like no other and never falls short in the \u2018feels\u2019 department. As a result, I would struggle to see how the game and story could not have an impact on your future outlook in life. Yes, it\u2019s that good.\n\nCharacter development is of the very highest calibre and you can simply not help but admire and love all of the different characters; feeling and sympathising for them as they suffer through various trials and tribulations. There are of course, some stereotypical characters traits, but character individuality is strong and always shines through.\n\nThe graphical style is excellent with plenty of variation in computer graphics (CG) throughout the game. Environments are colourful and vibrant which fit well to the various settings and key points in the game and some are nothing sort of stunning. Having said that, I do personally still prefer the art style from the animation by Kyoto Animation in comparison to the art in this game; even though it is the original source material.\n\nCLANNAD is lavished by a soundtrack which, in my opinion, is the best feature of the game and one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Jun Maeda crafted some of the most beautiful music ever written to fit both the ups and downs of the game. There are so many wonderful tracks, with outstanding piano pieces such as \u540c\u3058\u9ad8\u307f\u3078 (To The Same Heights) and \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u3066\u306e\u3072\u3089 (The Palm of a Tiny Hand). There are many other great tracks composed by other staff at Key, such as \u7a7a\u306b\u5149\u308b (Shining in the Sky) and \u6f6e\u9cf4\u308a (Roaring Tides), but again \u2013 a big warning about spoilers when seeking these out, because the Internet and YouTube in particular, is flooded with them.\n\nI spotted a review online once which quoted: \u201cCLANNAD is the greatest story ever across all genres and media\u201d. I couldn\u2019t agree more with this and the fact that the Kickstarter smashed its stretch goals is no coincidence.\n\nVisual novels are (finally) breaking through and gaining popularity in the west so I can understand some people might stumble across this and be highly apprehensive given the price point and type of minimalistic gameplay that a visual novel usually involves. Therefore, if you are not convinced enough to buy the game then, please; at least do yourself a favour and go and watch the animation (the one by Kyoto Animation). After 40+ episodes your transformation will be complete and you will then come back to buy and enjoy the game.", "timestamp_created": 1448314318, "timestamp_updated": 1465145152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649016", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19240209": {"recommendationid": "19240209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016085707", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449584937}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u591a\u8bf4\u4e86\uff0cg\u80d6\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5b85\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1448313590, "timestamp_updated": 1448313590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602280", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19240149": {"recommendationid": "19240149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044766735", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495273143}, "language": "english", "review": "ART: 10/10\nVOICE ACTING: 10/10\nSTORY:10/10\nHonestly  ive watched the CLANNAD anime countless times and have fallen in love with it before i even knew the game exists.

Expect to have major feels :3\n\nThis game is worth the 50 dollars, I know 50 dollars seems like a steep price but take it from me, It is well worth it, I have been a fan of Clannad for 5+ years, and this game is worth 100 dollars in my opinion. \n\nThe soundtrack is awesome, The songs on the Clannad soundtrack are absolutely incredible, trust me this is amazing.\n\nIf you aren't convinced, go watch a youtube playthrough, I know at least one guy played the original VN to completion with no commentary, can't remember his name, lets play clannad is what you should look up, but don't watch the entire thing you should play it yourself ;). I also highly recommend the Anime I actualy stumbled upon clannad by accident 5+ years ago and actually watched the after story first not knowing there were 2. Watch Clannad then After story for the complete effect. \n\nThank you Sekai Project for bringing this to Steam you guys rock!

Through the course of the visual novel Clannad with over 8 heroines for you to choose from to build a relationship with However, there are also 3 other characters, one of which doesn\u2019t appear in the anime those three aren\u2019t really relationship choices but it is more about finding out more about whats going on in the world of Clannad. In total, there are over 11 routes in Clannad. Being themed around family, friendships, bonds, and relationships.\n\n[h1][b]The Story[/b][/h1]\nClannad starts off in a dream like world where everything appears to be covered in snow. This world is called the Illusionary World. There is no life in this world, except for one young girl and a robot made out of junk.\nThe story quickly shifts to the real world and get to see the world of Clannad through the eyes of Tomoya Okazaki an emotionally distant delinquent student, a student at Hikarizara Private High School. After losing his mother in an incident and subsequently falling victim to an abusive, alcoholic father. Unable to play basketball after that fight, Tomoya becomes a student that just hate the thought of school, showing up late to class and not trying in the classes he does show up to become a \u201cnormal\u201d thing for him. He spends most of his time at Youhei Sunohara\u2019s dormitory. Tomoya Okazaki who have a friend, provably his only friend, Sunohara, a blond and is very energetic who is also a delinquent, that is Tomoya\u2019s best friend. Together, the two scrape by school, coming to class only during lunch break, and then sleeping through all of his other classes, and on some days just outright skips school all together.\nOne day, being late for school, Tomoya comes across a girl who wears the same uniform as him. She is standing at the bottom of the hill leading to the school trying to motivate herself to go to school. Together, Tomoya and the girl, who we find later is named Nagisa Furukawa who is repeating the year due to a severe illness, enlists Okazaki to help revive the school\u2019s drama club. With nothing much else going on in his life, Okazaki agrees to help, making friends with many other students in the school along the way, and overcoming all of the different problems and challenges that they face. From there, the story branches out into many routes.\n\n[h1][b]Routes/Comedy/Progression[/b][/h1]\nAll of the routes in the main part of the game are balanced very well with humor matched with strong drama, the routes/characters are well written. Kyou is brash, loud, and quick to anger often flinging a dictionary as a weapon. She mirrors Tomoya in many ways as she does show a softer side with how she treats her twin sister, Ryou, and her pet, Botan. Fuko is hilarious with her love of star fish and her suspicion that Tomoya is, \u201ca strange person\u201d. Kotomi, a genius, is very innocent and harbors an obsessive fear of bullies. Those are just a few of the colorful and interesting personalities you will come across while reading Clannad. And finally Nagisa\n[i]Nagisa, loves Dango, but has very little self-confidence. Her interactions with Tomoya vary from sweet and cute, to serious, In that sense, she feels very real. She may act childish, but she is in fact very mature,insecure, and lacking confidence in herself.[/i]\n\nThe comedy in Clannad is hilarious, the drama is what makes it an unforgettable experience. Many characters have experienced death or suffered emotional trauma in the past, or might be struggling to carve out a new identity. Kotomi\u2019s route, and Fuko\u2019s route stand out in the first part of Clannad as two of the strongest stories. Both deal with heavily with the family theme, and coping mechanisms to tragic events. (I can\u2019t say much here because spoilers..)\n\nWe also learn more about the Illusionary World and the two inhabitants of it. by playing through Clannad. The story of the Illusionary World is advanced slowly, and in the After Story, it finally plays a very important part of the story as a whole.\nWithout After Story, Clannad is a cute, bittersweet visual novel with some very good moments and a great story. With After Story, Clannad becomes something different. It becomes a valuable experience that you will never forget.\n\nThe character development is probably ONE of the best I\u2019ve ever seen in a story, the pacing is not too fast or too slow, and the emotions that this story extracts out of you are just unbelievable. As you play through the Visual Novel, you will get attached to the characters very easily because of the character development that Clannad brings to the table. Most of the characters are dealing with issues and many times you will be able to relate to them.\nOverall it is a very memorable experience, with all the build up that the Visual Novels offers and then after some time you will start to feel many emotions that the characters in the Visual Novels and\u2026 Tears will start flowing down your face. Unless your heart is ice.\n\n[h1][b]Sound and Music elements and Visual elements[/b][/h1]\nWhat makes Clannad great is, the soundtrack. The soundtrack list is very huge, having over 45 different music, 4 of them are vocal pieces. All of the soundtracks are memorable and are perfect in setting the mood of the game having the ability to alter your mood just through music and making you shed a tear. Ranging from from silly to energetic music, to slow, atmospheric songs, that will make you feel time around you has slowed down to a standstill and you\u2019re just indulging in the beautiful music. For those who have watched the Anime, when you start the Visual Novel with the in game menu you will be hit with nostalgia in an instant because that is what happened to me, it\u2019s like everything replayed in my head in that instant just by listening to the soundtrack.\nAmong all my favorite is, Roaring Tides, I really love it so much it is a really a beautiful soundtrack very outstanding.\n\n[h1][b]Visual Elements[/b][/h1]\nThere are new features to clannad 1 of them being a HD Upgrade: All visuals have been upgraded to 1280\u00d7960\nDangopedia that is exclusive to the english version, the Dangopedia is a Encyclopedia that is a handy refrence tool for understanding aspects of Japanese tradition and pop culture.\nAchievements, Clannad has achievements that are steam supported! There\u2019s also an in-game menu to review your achievement progress.\n\n[h1][b]To Sum Up[/b][/h1]\nI would highly recommend anyone to read this Visual Novel because giving this a miss means you are really missing out. In fact you are missing a very valuable experience, it will change how you view your world completely. Clannad has a story with a message, a message of showing the importance of family, friends and more.\n\n[h1][b]Atogaki[/b][/h1]\nThe Art, The Story, The Music, The Characters in this Visual novel is just amazing. The characters surpass any Visual Novels in terms of growth, complexity, and how I am able to connect to them. Clannad is a masterpiece(kamige) in both story telling and character development. A thing i did not mention is that Clannad also changed how I viewed people around me in fact it changed me quite a lot it, because it teaches me to be appreciative to people and appreciate the things you have because no matter how bad you think your situation is there is always someone is out there alone and lonely suffering in a situation far worse than you. It also showed me that people, no matter the ambitions or situation, can live a happy life. It showed a simple yet happy life, it showed that everyone has issues they need to learn from and overcome. Clannad showed me the strength of family, and the weaknesses of it at the same time. It\u2019s a story that everyone can relate to.\n\n[url=https://azusantiara.wordpress.com/2015/11/16/clannad-review/]Click here for the full review steam has a word limit sadly[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1448309279, "timestamp_updated": 1448309279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 222, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.880278", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19239103": {"recommendationid": "19239103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026061252", "num_games_owned": 1601, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449044491}, "language": "english", "review": "For the past 10 years, I\u2019ve been a fan of the (popular) anime adaptations of Key\u2019s various work including Kanon, Air, Clannad, Little Busters, and Angel Beats. Although I was aware that both Kanon and Air started out as games (Visual Novels), I actually never bothered to play them, especially since they were in Japanese. Even in the recent years, with fans releasing English patches, I never had an interest on playing their respective visual novels. However, having the opportunity to play my first visual novel ever, I figured it would be best if I give it to what gave birth to one of my favorite series of all time\u2014Clannad.\n\nClannad originally released in Japan on April 28, 2004, becoming Key\u2019s third visual novel. Since then, the game quickly turned into one of the most notable series in the company\u2019s lineup of visual novels. Following the wave of Visual Novels officially releasing in North America, the company decided to work with publisher Sekai Project and finally bring the game to the west via Steam for many fans of the Visual Novel community to enjoy.\n\nRead More: http://www.japanator.com/review-clannad-pc--34545.phtml\n __\n\nTL;DR\nHonestly, if you liked the anime but never tried the Visual Novel, then please, do yourself a favor and TRY the Visual Novel. \n\nI've never been so happy to relive this adventure in its original form. The fact that there's so much stuff that didn't get covered in the anime, not to mention that you're in control of the story is definitely refreshing. If you cry yourself out like a little bitch like myself like in the anime, then prepare to cry yourself out some more like a little bitch during the visual novel.\n\nI really love Clannad.", "timestamp_created": 1448309204, "timestamp_updated": 1498860283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 156, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.829487", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19239002": {"recommendationid": "19239002", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995140839", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 9856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499598615}, "language": "english", "review": "CLANNAD is one of the most well-regarded visual novels in the world, boasting an epic 80-120 hours of content; about twice the size of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It starts off at a very slow pace with lots of light-hearted comedy, but once you begin getting involved with each of the characters' individual conflicts, the story ramps up into some gripping emotional storytelling, sometimes sprinkled with a tinge of supernatural intrigue. The character routes are very worthwhile in their own right, but the true value of CLANNAD is to be found in its final route: After Story. It doesn't matter how emotionally hardened you think you are; After Story will hit you like a sledgehammer with its relentless emotional impact, and you won't come out unscathed.\n\nSo, yeah, CLANNAD is kinda cool. Changed my life / 10.\n\nYou can read my full review at Kazamatsuri below:\nhttp://kazamatsuri.org/clannad-review/", "timestamp_created": 1448308846, "timestamp_updated": 1463088767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 796, "votes_funny": 71, "weighted_vote_score": "0.885377", "comment_count": "39", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39419160": {"recommendationid": "39419160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118853077", "num_games_owned": 539, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 10765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498527642}, "language": "english", "review": "Review originally posted [url=https://www.backlog-assassins.net/posts/9bjwoal]here[/url].\n\n9/10\n\nFinally, after one billion years I have finished CLANNAD.\n\nOkay, not literally. And most of that \u2018playtime\u2019 is inaccurate, too, I tend to leave VNs running all the time so their playtimes get inflated, but this is a HUGE fucking VN. It is ENORMOUS. It\u2019s probably the longest I ever played, not counting the two When They Cry series. For retailing at 50 US dollars, it had better deliver, and - oh boy - it does.\n\nThe joke is that CLANNAD is one of the touchstones of Japanese visual novels, and it will make you cry. The joke is true. I rolled my eyes, thinking, \u2018yeah, okay, buddy, whatever\u2026\u2019 but it got me. This friggin early-2000\u2019s dated-ass ugly-looking VN could NOT POSSIBLY be good, right? But jesus christ, it is. It\u2019s a pure slice-of-life dating-sim, but the storylines for each main girl are very in depth, with a huge after story about the \u2018main girl\u2019 unlocking that goes through marriage, living together, and even having a child. It\u2019s mainly lighthearted, but that\u2019s only to prime you for the feelings to hit - and when they hit, they hit hard.\n\nWhat\u2019s nice is that these feelings are genuine and varied. Each emotion beat is distinct from each other, and with a good fourteen or fifteen arcs, at least ONE will be close enough to your heart to pierce it. Striving to overcome your own past or your body\u2019s weakness, forgiveness, finding your family, trying to achieve a simple honest life and never giving up hope - there will be something that will push your buttons.\n\nIt\u2019s a VN for VN-lovers, though, and it\u2019s far from perfect. It\u2019s VERY dated, not just in its references and technology (which is actually kind of nostalgic) but also in its weird awkward sexual humor and it\u2019s absolutely awful \u2018joke\u2019 arc about the protag suddenly turning gay for his best friend. It\u2019s art is\u2026. frankly, awful, a relic of probably the nadir of the standard anime style, with huge, goopy, melting eyes flowing down right past their noses.

Clannad is a slice of life visual novel, that deals with romance, past hardship, family and the ever changing world around the characters, and how it either changes their lives for the better or worse. While some may say there are pacing issues i disagree, the writing for this visual novel, is inuitive and allows for the development of  the characters and attachment to characters for the reader.\n\nThis is a long visual novel if you wish to fully complete it, it took me over 50 hours (some repeated text skipping) and may take other's longer depending on your reading speed. This may put off  some casual visual novel readers but, i assure you it is well worth the effort to get the fabled true ending and enjoy the enriching experience that clannad provides. This is a highly emotive visual novel and as you will no doubt read is full of feels/emotion in other reviews. This is indeed true and there are many moments that may bring you to tears as the scenario writing paired with the musical scores seek to jerk tears from you. Do not be put off by this though, as there are also moments of joy, humour and inspiration, as the characters face sad truths and situations that are very much a part of many people's daily lives.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with aspects of Japanese culture, there is a useful dangopedia that will provide an explanation for some of the words that are used in a visual novel, which i found useful in developing my own knowledge of Japanese cultural practises, food and folklore. The characters themselves provide a wide scope of different personalities, each different to the others which have been shaped by their experiences so far. Comparrisons can of course be drawn to anime tropes this is not a massive problem as it merely represents the many differerent personalities we may all exhibit and is written so as not to be unrealistic.\n\nSo overall i would recommend Clannad due to it's enriching storylines, character development and musical scores that provide a life enriching experience, that will likely leave a lasting impact upon your perspective of life, and the many troubles that both ourselves and the characters in the novel face, in the unpredictable, tumultous, joyous and challenging journey that is life. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1515932693, "timestamp_updated": 1515932693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39328072": {"recommendationid": "39328072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314951542", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 94, "last_played": 1515921981}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e2d\u6587\u3002\nWe need Chinese.\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u8a9e\u306f\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\n", "timestamp_created": 1515903111, "timestamp_updated": 1515903111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39197155": {"recommendationid": "39197155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053283243", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 10050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 576, "last_played": 1515594665}, "language": "english", "review": "This Visual Novel was truely amazing, I spent so many hours reading and enjoyed every one of them.

It's a very heartwarming route.[spoiler]The tanzanite didn't make an appearance. Umu.[/spoiler]\n\nKyou's route- Ah...I feel ya Okazaki-kun. By the way, 'PREPARE FOR HEARTACHE'. Trials ahead.[spoiler] A triangle relationship... I'm very confused on how to feel about this one.

It's so bittersweet that I can safely say that its well written.[spoiler] So, that means that the Shima that younger Misae spoke all that time is the cat itself? Then, it makes perfect sense[/spoiler]\n\n--3rd Edit\n\nKoumura's route- Well, for the longest time... I thought I'm on Nagisa's route(I'm not btw), so I was quite shocked by the ending. It was a great ending. Inspirational and nostalgic.\n\n--4th Edit\n\nYukine's route- I went this route before( when I feel pirating is not something wrong, obviously I avoid doing that now), so not much to say. Although I do remember I reaally like this route. Now? It feels nostalgic(ah, I graduated huh?)...\n\n--5th Edit\n\nTomoyo's route- Holy... Tomoyo's the best girl. I definitely think that. If a girl like her exist, then I guess I can be liken with Okazaki-kun. Best of regards, myself and yourself.\n\n--6th Edit\n\nKotomi's route-I want to keep her. I want to protect her. Trust me...you will feel the same. This one topples Fuko's route in making me cry.\n\n--7th Edit\n\nSunohara siblings' route- This one is enoyable but not excellent.

The game focuses on life and romantic relationships with 0 erotic content.   It is an \"All ages\" visual novel which is perfectly fine by me.\n\nThe game follows a day format which works fine for the primary story but for some of the branches you can tell that they did their best to fill in the days where not much happened.  For me, this turned into a feeling of disinterest where I needed to put the game down for a bit and come back to get reinvested.\n\nDon't misunderstand,  I love the game and recommend it to anyone who takes visual novels or reading seriously. However, it is a long game.   I believe the game is reported to have over 1.3 million English words in the script.  Which put it at 30% more than the 7 Harry Potter books combined and more than the Bible.\n\nWhat I am getting at is that it isn't 2 hours pick up and put down thing.  If you buy it you're getting your monies worth for sure but if you hate reading or are expecting any sort of erotic material you will be much sad.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonally,  while this is a high tier visual novel to me.  It doesn't feel top tier and although I played through this prior to the anime with no information going in... Unlike games such as Fate, I felt that the extras from the visual novel didn't expand on the story as much as it  could have.   The anime brings a lot of life and expression to a very solid story in a much more digestible format. Since the story focuses primarily on the people and not on some larger over-arching plot... expression and personality are so very important.\n\nThis is coming from a person that almost always believes in source material over adaption because most of the time something is lost in the middle. As well as someone who has enjoyed visual novels for many years when even completely clean VNs were seen as smutty due to some of the related material in the genre.\n\nSomething else worth talking about is the art style is not for everyone.  This is a visual novel from early 2004 and it looks like it was made in the late 90s.  Characters tend to look a bit off and while not an issue for me as suspending disbelief is a part of any partaking in fiction.  I have had many people comment to me asking about \"What is up with the art\". \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is also a dark undertone to a lot of the story in the visual novel specifically with the protagonist that maybe requires some knowledge in psychology to really feel out but... without spoiling anything I just don't feel like the visual novel version of the protag is a good person really and on deeper reflection many of the plot points that are billed to you as positive have some very uncomfortable undertones when looked at closely.  Not that there is anything wrong with creating a character that is complex but it sort of betrays the narrative a lot of times in the context of the plot itself.  However, that is a nitpick about a character and not to be confused with the quality of the product.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall this is a very solid although, sometimes slow visual novel.\nPlan to read this over a longer period of time as it averages out to around 80 hours or more depending on reading speed to get everything out of it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMake up your own mind.\nDanielJMWaters", "timestamp_created": 1515089921, "timestamp_updated": 1515089921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555170", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39038570": {"recommendationid": "39038570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074532432", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1516136859}, "language": "english", "review": "Even if visual novels have never interested you before I really think this one will, it has made me want to live life to its fullest and never let anything go to waste so it is definetely worth the \u00a330.

However, you're gonna notice how I have over 70 hours in this game. And you're going to average out to around the same if you're aiming for all route/achievements/scenarios like I did. So if you can't spare 3-4 days worth of your tears on this beautiful game, stop reading this now, back out of this game, and go find another VN that'll satisfy your short attention span, because this game clearly isn't worth your 50$. If you're still here, congratulations. I'm going to praise this game like no tomorrow.\n\nAs a forewarning, I used a guide for this entire game to ensure good endings for all routes, and I read fast: even that didn't save me in the sense that I spent the equivalent of 3 consecutive, non-stop days to getting all achievements in this game. I even skipped a lot of the cutscenes after finishing my first route and that wasn't enough to spare me from the neverending story this game offers. However, I did not achieve 100% CG mode or 100% Dangopedia, and I probably won't be bothered to go back to do them, so I'm much more satisfied with a 77 hour run. Without further ado, let's go on to the game.\n\nTHIS IS A VERY STORY DRIVEN GAME. This isn't your average VN by any means. You take control of Tomoya Okazaki, a deliquent 3rd year, who is on his last year of primary school and is about ready to graduate high school with his lousy but very lovable and comedic deliquent friend, Youhine Sunohara. One day, while you're walking late to school as usual one April morning, you meet a girl you've never seen before named Nagisa Furukawa at the bottom of a hill that directly leads to the high school, seemingly onlooking the hill like a ferocious, complicated challenge. She seems shy, anxious, and naive, but despite his rather harsh personality, Tomoya reluctantly agrees to walk up the hill with her to the high school. Thus begin their friendship: Nagisa wants to rebuild a drama club that disbanded last year, and it's literally up to you if you decide to help her rebuild the club or let her do it alone. If you do decide to help her, you must face hardships that is forming a club, holding meetings, finding members, advertising the club itself, and even performing a play (based on a fairytale) at the school's Founder Festival. But along the way, you make countless memories with both Nagisa and Sunohara, and meet many new people, both in and outside of school, who become your friends, and will do anything to help Nagisa's dream of revitalizing the drama club come true. THAT IS THE BASE, SPOILER-FREE STORYLINE, IT CAN AND WILL CHANGE BASED ON THE GIRL YOU DECIDE TO ROMANCE.\n\nThe amount of story this game has is enough to keep you up at night- this game has kept me up multiple nights until 6 am EST just to finish a single route. This game has more routes than you can think of. And you have to literally work for all of them. If you're going in blind your first try like I did, chances are you may not even meet half the girls you can \"romance\" much like I did until I searched up a guide. I got the bad ending my first run through, so don't feel bad if you did as well. I didn't use a guide, so I went with my wits and made choices based on what /I/ would do. However, upon getting the bad ending, I was at loss about what I did wrong, so I used a guide for the rest of the game. That did not deter my enjoyment for this game, though!\n\nSpeaking of choices, this game is heavy on those. Your choices heavily depend on what route the game takes you. So, essentially, one single choice can lead you astray from Nagisa's path and put you in Kyou's/Ryou's path. It's literally that simple. Think of it as Mass Effect: your choices literally matter on the path that you take. Some choices are more important than others: one will directly affect what route you go on, others don't make as much of a difference in any given route. That's what makes this game have replay value if you're an achievement whore like me, or if you just like very story-drive game. It's a beautiful game that knew where to put its money. Gorgeous music, ungodly speechless artwork, and storylines to haunt you for days and keep you up at night, this game is clearly a must-have for VN fanatics and collectors everywhere. You'll feel for every character and the music captivates each scene flawlessly. I related with Nagisa and Kyou the most while I fell in love with Kappei, Tomoyo, and Tomoya's father. Kyou's theme is the best music in the game hands down in my opinion.\n\nHowever, with every good game, it also has its many flaws: this game is no different. I won't go over every single detail I'd like to nitpick at, I'll keep it pretty minimal. Remember when I mentioned replay value earlier? Well, this game forces replay on your ass if you want the true ending, which is why you'll see some people like myself have ridiculous hours tagged into the game. If you want the true end, you're going to have to play the game's main storyline a total of 8 times, (13 if you decide to do every route) and get 8 lights by the end of it. After you get 8 lights from the routes + doing Fuko and Nagisa routes (they are required as they are canon), After Story will be unlocked. You then have to play After Story THREE (3) TIMES to get the true ending. In total, this can average out anywhere from 50-100 hours, if you decide to read all the dialouge. Of course, you can argue that VisualKey did this to pad out the story as much as possible, and to make you work for such an ending, but it kinda drags that I have to skip 90% of the route just to get a light orb to get the true ending. In the end, Nagisa's and Fuko's routes are the only two that matter for After Story's storyline, but the other routes have to be played solely for orb collecting.\n\nRyou's route also rubbed me the wrong way. If you approach that route, you find out that Ryou has shyness and troubles socializing. While I understand the irony of \"she's the class president but she has troubles talking\", it rubs off more as a overbearing cliche after a while than simple character development. While Ryou did have her good moments, more notably towards the very end of her route, her shyness and social issues became more of a simple annoyance than cute or adorable. It made it look like while they were giving light to the situation of those who suffer it, it only make it worse by making it look like they tried to glorify or beautify girls who suffer anxiety and diffiiculties in socializing. This is coming from a woman who struggles with both general and social anxiety. Social anxiety is not cute. No one is going to save you 24/7. I felt like her whole gimmick of being overbearingly shy and socially awkward was to make Kyou, Ryou's slightly older twin sister, look like the strong, protective sister when even that got old and rather frustrating real quick to deal with. It was cliche and typical, and I felt like they could've made Ryou's route more bearable and understandable for those who don't suffer immense shyness or social issues, and gave Kyou more of an excuse to protect her sister other than the fact that she can't handle the slightest of situations that aren't part of her comfort zone. In a real world setting, Kyou would be doing far more harm than good for Ryou. But this is just a video game, right? I know I seem triggered by something annoyingly meant as entertainment, but it bugged me and made that route very uncomfortable and very unenjoyable for me to sit through.

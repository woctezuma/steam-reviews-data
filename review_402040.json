La corsa \u00e8 assente e si pu\u00f2 solo camminare, ma visti gli spazi limitati ci pu\u00f2 anche stare, mentre un pelo pi\u00f9 fastidiosa \u00e8 l'assenza di una fonte di luce che non siano quelle predefinite, visto che spesso negli angoli poco illuminati sono nascosti degli oggetti fondamentali per proseguire, e non sono sempre visibilissimi.\n\nAlcuni oggetti si possono combinare con altri, mentre una buona percentuale \u00e8 assolutamente inutile e finisce nell'inventario solo perch\u00e9 s\u00ec (o per l'achievement di raccogliere tutto, immagino).\nNotevole invece il senso di progressione, con indizi che non sono mai troppi n\u00e9 troppo pochi: sta a noi capire quando le informazioni in nostro possesso sono sufficienti per risolvere un determinato enigma o quando invece al contrario \u00e8 meglio cercare ancora. Gli enigmi sono tutti pi\u00f9 o meno intuibili con gli indizi forniti dal gioco, con un paio pi\u00f9 tosti che richiedono perlomeno una paginetta di bloc notes per appuntarsi le cose. \n\nLa durata \u00e8 tutto sommato legata all'abilit\u00e0 di ognuno nel risolvere questi enigmi e di interpretare gli indizi a sua disposizione, ma in generale direi che la prima volta si attesta sulle 2-3 ore buone, compresa qualche mezz'ora in cui si sbatte la testa contro il muro perch\u00e9 non si capisce come proseguire.\n\nMolto graziosa la grafica e anche i pochi brani che compongono la colonna sonora, buona anche la traduzione italiana dei vari articoli e degli indizi.\n\nSe vi piace il genere degli Escape the Room e titoli come The Room/The Room Two o altri eccellenti esponenti del genere in Flash (come Sagrario's Room Escape, ELEMENTS o VISION), allora apprezzerete anche questo, anche se forse il prezzo pieno \u00e8 un po' eccessivo per un paio d'ore di gioco.

There's no incentive to 100% the hotel, and the only 'secret' in the game you can find is with one boring, single, irrelevant action in the final room.\n\nAs a product in a vacuum, though, it's EXTREMELY high quality, with a gorgeous setting, stellar atmosphere, and a plot that's so weird and goofy that it speaks well for the 80s time period the game takes place in. The game is something of a thriller/drama exploration, and I think the only truly scary section was the second room you access. I really like this; it reminds me of those ancient first-person exploration/escape games I played in the 90s that have a similar foreboding tone to them.\n\nThe puzzles are GREAT - I'm a dumbass who wanted to clear the game so I cheated on the last one, but they're all solid thinkers that reward you for taking in your surroundings and putting thought into your choices. Which makes it all the more frustrating the entire game screeched to a halt for that awful, awful loop maze. It also has some replay value; about 3? Of the puzzles have randomly generated results, so you can feel like you're working through something every time you replay it, which would be perfect for a game with multiple endings, but with this linear snapshot of a game, I don't understand why they bothered.\n\nThere's no 'meh' option, so I'll go with \"if it's not on sale, don't bother\".", "timestamp_created": 1496457571, "timestamp_updated": 1496457571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721740", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31784983": {"recommendationid": "31784983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363766231", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501420801}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc778\ub514\uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub77c \uae30\ub300\ub3c4 \uc548\ud588\ub294\ub370 \uac00\uaca9\ub300\ube44 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc88b\ub124\uc694 \ub0b4\uc6a9 \ud37c\uc990 \uc0ac\uc6b4\ub4dc \ub4f1\ub4f1 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1494932841, "timestamp_updated": 1494932841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31493313": {"recommendationid": "31493313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257581255", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493730033}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u901a\u5173\u6492\u82b1~\u5f88\u4e45\u6ca1\u73a9\u5230\u8fd9\u4e48\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684\u89e3\u8c1c\u6e38\u620f\u4e86\u3002\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662f\u6050\u6016\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u5f88\u6709\u5e26\u5165\u611f\uff0c\u4e0a\u6765\u5c31\u5236\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u60ca\u609a\u7684\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u73a9\u5230\u540e\u9762\u53d1\u73b0\u5185\u5bb9\u5176\u5b9e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8eroom\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8c1c\u9898\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6bd4room\u66f4\u6709\u903b\u8f91\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u5f88\u5f3a\u3002\u753b\u9762\u5f00\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u8fd8\u7b97\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6655\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u623f\u95f4\u91cc\u592a\u9ed1\u4e86\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u771f\u7684\u6015\u6015\u7684\u3002\n\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u5c0fbug\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u8fdb\u5165\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u4e4b\u524d\u6539\u8fc7\u7684\u97f3\u91cf\u6761\u6ca1\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u97f3\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u5374\u56de\u53bb\u4e86\u3002\n\u5267\u60c5\u8bf4\u5b9e\u8bdd\u6ca1\u6709\u5b8c\u5168\u770b\u61c2\uff0c\u6211\u8111\u8865\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5267\u900f\u9884\u8b66\uff1a\n[spoiler] \u7537\u4e3b\u88ab\u9009\u4e2d\u505a\u836f\u7269\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u51fa\u5dee\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u88ab\u5f04\u6655\u8fd0\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u6240\uff0c\u9192\u6765\u4e4b\u540e\u7ad9\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u4f2a\u88c5\u6210\u65c5\u9986\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u91cc\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u88ab\u4eba\u76d1\u89c6\u7740\uff0c\u4ed6\u9700\u8981\u5728\u836f\u7269\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u89e3\u5f00\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8c1c\u9898\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u5426\u9002\u5408\u771f\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u89e3\u5f00\u8c1c\u9898\u901a\u5173\u6210\u529f\u5c31\u4f1a\u88ab\u5173\u5165\u5458\u5de5\u5bbf\u820d\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u7fa4\u5b97\u6559\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u8bd5\u9a8c\u670d\u52a1\uff1f [/spoiler]\n\u8c1c\u9898\u8bbe\u7f6e\u96be\u5ea6\u9002\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u653b\u7565\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u786c\u618b\u4e00\u4f1a\u4e5f\u80fd\u89e3\u5f00\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76ee\u524d\u8fd8\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u653b\u7565\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u7a7a\u4f1a\u81ea\u5df1\u5f55\u4e00\u6bb5~~~\n\u6749\u679c\u4e0a\u53ea\u8981\u5341\u5757\u94b1", "timestamp_created": 1493666346, "timestamp_updated": 1493731123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31275354": {"recommendationid": "31275354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017908034", "num_games_owned": 533, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492782307}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a great little game.

Lots of items to find, though not every collectable item is necessary to progress. Thankfully, there are fairly few \"MacGyver\" puzzles, and instances of combinable inventory items generally make sense. There are also scattered papers that you can't keep but that you can read to reveal context to your situation.\n\nVisual quality is nice. Good textures, good lighting, good particles. Several of the areas are in total darkness, but the light switches are easy to find.\n\nA bunch of the achievements are easy to miss, including some that involve solving certain puzzles in the fewest number of moves without a mistake and at least one that is totally up to dumb luck. It's a little disappointing to have to replay the game to clean up the achievements, since puzzles don't really have much replay value.\n\nI got through it the first time in about 2 hours, which is honesly pretty hefty for a room escape.

I played it on my TV, and so because of TV gamma (albeit adjusted for games), I found myself fumbling around in the dark quite often, as most of the game is quite dark.  That said, The Guest is in no way a pixel-hunt.  All the necessary interactions are sufficiently lit to complete them easily.  (Pixel-hunting is about needles in brightly-lit haystacks, though, not thumbtacks on an unlit carpet.)  The puzzles are all well-hinted and comprehensible, and there are just enough interactive distractions to make the environment enjoyable.  I found myself wondering whether there was a \"happy\" ending when I completed the game, and unfortunately, the save I created when I realized I was near to the end did not allow me to backtrack far enough to explore and find out whether that was the case.  I checked out a few gameplay videos and everyone seems to have the same ending, so if there's another ending, I don't think most folks have found it.\n\nMy complaints, few as they are:  The story is underdeveloped.  Bits of the story make little intrinsic sense, like the \"dizzy-pills\" episode.  (Some folks complain about the \"maze\", but it's easy to solve and I think it works well.)  The ending is rushed and seems bolted-on.  The hints during most of the gameplay that attempt to explain the player's predicament are thin and ultimately unsatisfactory, which I think led to my feeling that there must be another ending.  The audio is good, but the game really could have used an actual soundtrack, at least in some places (the record player worked nicely, however).\n\nMy complaints are minor, however, and I would gladly pay for another similar game from the same developers.", "timestamp_created": 1485150655, "timestamp_updated": 1485150655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540230", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29428500": {"recommendationid": "29428500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210441627", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467574761}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Interessante.

I did have to use an online tool to solve a particular word based puzzle but that's because I just suck at word based puzzle in general. It felt satisfying.\n- The puzzles kept me engaged.\n- The story is decent, character development present although 'light'.\n\nThe bad:\n- Bit glitchy (think doors that close on their own, object that reset themselves everytime you move about, etc)\n- Performance is poor for this type of game (Macbook pro 15\" with dedicated gpu, core i7 and 16gb ram was running at 20fps on 7320p mid-setting). Remember that 'the room' on Ios runs 1080p 60fps on a... phone.\n- It's very short (3.5 h but you can probably race it in less than 20m if you know the solution to all the puzzles)\n\nI would say for a few bucks, if you like the genre it's definitely worth it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1480295217, "timestamp_updated": 1480295217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27884537": {"recommendationid": "27884537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319829972", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480279406}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, this game is far from what i've expected. I bought it just to see and i got by surprise. This is a very intersting puzzle game with some tension building mechanism. However, if you are looking for something scary (like i was), forget it. This is, like the subtitle says: Exploration Game... with some INSANE puzzles.\n\nI don't finished it to 100%, there was a lot of items i didn't use during the gameplay, and i confess that i've had to search for some help on Youtube to solve some puzzles and to know what to do next. In the end was a very satisfying experience. I played it with Portuguese-BR subtitles and it was awesome (not that i needed it, but i wanted to try it to see if the translations went well, and it was perfect.)\n\nAnother thing, do not expect a CGI ending scene, there's not. Most of the conclusion of the game is suggestive only, but you can get the right idea in the end.\n\nConclusion: The Guest is a \"quick\" game with puzzles that were coing to melt your neurons and you will feel dumb for not seeing the solutions of it. I expect to have a sequel or prequel, the game deserves it and i most certainly would be pleased to go through it. I will play it on a near future to try to solve all the puzzles that i didn't solved. (Yes, it is possible to end this game without finish all the riddles.)\n\nPROs: You don't need a state of the art computer to run this game. The graphics are awesome and the atmosphere of the game is claustrophobic. Voice acting is superb.\n\nCONs: I would not classify this as a con, but some puzzles are so insanely difficult and (maybe) clueless.

Realmente es bastante complicado darle un voto negativo a este juego porque como tal no hace nada mal, pero eso no quiere decir que lo que hace lo haga muy bien tampoco. \n\nThe Guest es b\u00e1sicamente un juego de puzles, y por b\u00e1sicamente entendamos toda la palabra en su conjunto. Este juego no es una aventura ni nada que se le parezca, ya sea de un modo u otro. Si ya jugaste al maravilloso e impresionante The Room pues es pr\u00e1cticamente lo mismo, pero ojo, en lo que se refiere a su planteamiento jugable. El resultado de The Guest, a\u00fan no siendo malo, est\u00e1 a mil a\u00f1os luz de The Room.\n\nEn el juego comenzamos despertando en una habitaci\u00f3n de hotel, con nuestro equipaje a\u00fan sin sacar de la maleta y un mont\u00f3n de dudas en la cabeza. Miremos donde miremos no hay salida de esa habitaci\u00f3n, y tendremos que ponernos a buscar por todos los recovecos de la misma la manera de poder agarrarnos a algo que ofrezca cierta luz a nuestra oscura situaci\u00f3n. Mientras vamos explorando, iremos descubriendo cosas, y esas cosas provocar\u00e1n que la habitaci\u00f3n vaya ganando en tama\u00f1o mediante paredes falsas o puertas cerradas que conseguimos desbloquear. Y para conseguir todo esto debemos ir solucionando puzles de diferente \u00edndole mientras avanzamos.\n\nEsto es The Guest, no hay m\u00e1s realmente. Como puedes ver es muy similar al planteamiento de The Room pero el planteamiento de los puzles, su variedad, el acceso a su resoluci\u00f3n y el modo en el que se presenta la historia ya es otro cantar. \n\nCierto es que The Room no es un juego de puzles complicado, es m\u00e1s ameno y vistoso que otra cosa, pero s\u00ed ofrece ciertos retos bastantes interesantes. The Guest por su parte ofrece buenos puzles en algunas ocasiones, pero el problema es que son ca\u00f3ticos en la mayor\u00eda de las ocasiones, poco inspirados por lo poco que motivan a solucionarlos y en ciertas ocasiones su resoluci\u00f3n es cuanto menos poco justa con respecto al jugador. En resumidas cuentas, sus puzles son aburridos, o al menos, bastante menos interesantes que los vistos en The Room.\n\nLa historia que el juego nos presenta puede que tenga buena culpa de ello. En un primer momento es bastante interesante, con ese ambiente noir de novela negra, pero luego cae en un sin sentido que no hay por donde cogerla. Y no porque no tenga \"cierto sentido\" al descubrir todo el asunto, es que est\u00e1 p\u00e9simamente contada. El salto argumental es brutal y no se respeta lo m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo un arco medianamente coherente. Eso bien podr\u00eda ser algo bueno si la sorpresa argumentativa fuera convincente o llamativa, pero lo cierto es que eso no pasa, muy porobablemente porque los puzles poco inspirados y ca\u00f3ticos hayan acabado ya con la paciencia del jugador.\n\nSin embargo, eso no significa que el juego sea malo ni mucho menos. Es un juego que est\u00e1 \"bien\" sin m\u00e1s. Creo que el mayor problema que tiene es que te presenta algo realmente interesante al empezar y luego, mientras avanza el juego, no consigue mantenerlo y cae en una suerte de cap\u00edtulo de Black Mirror. S\u00ed, Black Mirror est\u00e1 muy bien, y es alagador, pero a la vez es algo malo por su incoherencia. El juego quiere parecer llamativo y atractivo, y lo consigue. Quiere aparentar cierto grado de surrealismo, y al principio lo consigue. El problema es que todo eso luego cae estrepitosamente y al final nos quedamos con un juego de puzles que a\u00fan no estando nada mal, no es tampoco ninguna maravilla.\n\nEl juego como tal no dura mucho, 4-5 horas a lo sumo, y el precio no es muy elevado. A\u00fan as\u00ed recomiendo una buena oferta para tan poca duraci\u00f3n. Dura m\u00e1s o menos lo mismo que cualquiera de la trilog\u00eda The Room, pero cuesta como el doble. Si no tienes ning\u00fan The Room y te gustan los juegos de puzles, ni te lo pienses. C\u00f3mprate antes los The Room pero de calle.

Gameplay takes place in quite small areas, but each area has many items to discover - some of which are needed for the puzzles, some provide background information and tell a mysterious story about a missing person.\n\nThe puzzle design is varied and engaging. Often you have to first find several missing objects, then add them to the puzzle, and then solve a minigame. Other puzzles require combining the correct items in your inventory. The game provides many clues, and the difficulty was (at least for me) right at the sweet spot where you really have to think, and feel a sense of accomplishment when you find the solution, but never totally get stuck. (One puzzle got me stumped because a ring had to be positioned correctly, and looked correct even when it was rotated 180\u00b0 away from its target position, but I eventually got past that.)\n\nThe interface highlights objects that you can interact with, which gets rid of the annoying \"click everything in case it's usable\" gameplay. You can turn that feature off if you find the experience more immersive without it. The rest of the interface isn't stellar, but gets the job done. It could be more obvious that there is a second inventory page if you picked up many items.\n\nI found the story engaging, interesting, and well-paced. You keep finding more information, and the game invites you to build your own theories, which I enjoyed a lot. Unfortunately though, it all completely breaks down when the game ends. Instead of actually solving the detailed mystery that they built up, the devs basically show their players the middle finger and impose a \"wtf\"-type ending on their game that renders 90% of the previous information completely irrelevant. One can't help but wonder why that detailed mystery is even there. It does not get solved or elaborated on - the ending simply [i]discards[/i] most of the game. On top of that, it puts the main character in a rather undesirable situation, so it does not even feel satisfying.\n\nGraphically the game seems solid for in indie adventure game. There is some good use of lighting. Textures look a bit washed out, and some of the models are a bit crude, but hey - for an indie adventure game that has a focus on good puzzles, this is all completely adequate. Voice acting was on the same level - not great, but not really bad either, so it didn't detract from the game. Some of the writing showed that the devs aren't native English speakers, but I've seen way worse.\n\n[h1]I recommend the game to adventure fans due to the excellent puzzle design and well-crafted atmosphere. Just don't get too invested in the story, because the ending throws most of it in the garbage bin anyway.[/h1]\n\n.\n\nSide notes:\n\n1. There is a music puzzle that will cause problems for deaf people - you may have to ask someone else for help with that one. It is randomized, and you only have three attempts to solve it before it randomizes again, so you cannot just look the correct sequence up in a guide. If you're just tone-deaf, then you [i]should[/i] be able to solve it, since the interface allows infinite experimentation and checks before you commit your solution. I often struggle with music puzzles myself, but had no problems with this one.\n\n2. Achievement hunters should brace themselves for a potentially frustrating experience. One achievement requires you to solve a maze puzzle (with lots of walking) on the first try, but it is randomized and apparently has no clues. You'll have to reload and replay it until you happen to get lucky and guess all choices correctly, the chance for which is 1/16. Another achievement requires you to restart the game if you've taken too many turns in a certain puzzle, reloading does not help. And there's also an achievement for finding all objects, but its counter does not update correctly, so it's hard to check whether you missed something.\n\n3. As usual, don't draw conclusions from my displayed playing time. I often let games idle while I do other stuff or sleep. I also played through the game several times to get the achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1477277896, "timestamp_updated": 1477278823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541410", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26190967": {"recommendationid": "26190967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082991005", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477263276}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, takes about 90 minutes to play through.

You wake up in a hotel room that's locked. You don't remember how you got there. You find some puzzles to solve, most of which require you to use items you find across the room to solve them. Solving a puzzle leads to other puzzles to solve etc.  'The Guest' an ok game, worth playing if you don't expect too much, but not at full price. If you're into the genre, I recommend picking it up when it's discounted by 50% or more.\n\n[h1]The puzzling[/h1]\n\nMost of the puzzles are pretty clever and well-executed. Sometimes they vaguely reminded me of the quality of the puzzles of the game The Room, which is a huge compliment. The Guest clearly aspires to be as good as The Room and other games that set the bar. It does not succeed but it doesn't fall flat on its face either. The puzzles are challenging, visually attractive, non-repetitive and they reflect the atmosphere of the adventuring aspect of this game i.e. the mystery of what's going on.\n\n[h1]The adventuring[/h1]\n\nThe Guest is a puzzle game first and foremost. But it has some adventuring elements, too. This means you'll be exploring the hotel room you're in and be picking up items to use either on things in the room or on each other in the inventory, to create new items that can be used on things in the room. There is also a story being told while you explore and solve puzzles, but don't expect too much story, it's certainly not a narrative driven adventure game. I appreciated the story, however basic and surreal, for what it was.\n\n[h1]Steam related thoughts[/h1]\n\nSome of the achievements are pretty challenging, which always adds an extra layer to games and especially to puzzle games. One of the achievements seems bugged for me (Houdini) but 4.2% of the users have it, which is more than the usual percentage of achievement cheaters, so I'm not sure why it won't trigger for me. \n\nA warning to conclude: the achievement for the labyrinth (you need to complete it without failing) is completed by pure luck. So save before using the telephone and reload to do the labyrinth again and again if you want the achievement. Do not trust the so-called guide you'll find here on Steam, it's a (bad) joke. If you look at the final part of the 'guide', you'll see the author put some letters in the middle of seemingly random words in capitals.

Die Atmosph\u00e4re ist sch\u00f6n gemacht gerade was die Umgebung und die Ger\u00e4uschkulisse angeht. Gerade neu ist da zwar nichts dran, aber es hat einen gewissen Charme und weckte mein Interesse. Auch die Story rettet da am Anfang vieles, da man einfach nichts wei\u00df. Es gibt keine Aufgabe, kein Ziel und man wei\u00df lange nicht, was das alles soll. Auch die sch\u00f6ne udn bedr\u00fcckende Grafik erfrute mich.\nAndererseits ist da die K\u00fcrze des Spiels. Bei dem Normalpreis von 10 Euro ist es mit 2 oder 3 Stunden Spielzeit und einem nicht vorhandenen Wiederspielwert nicht gerade toll, wobei ich es zum Gl\u00fcck nur f\u00fcr 5 Euro kaufte. Wer dieses Genre mehr spielt, d\u00fcrfte sogar in wesentlich weniger Zeit durch sein. Hinzu kommt die f\u00fcr mich zu ungenaue Steuerung und die Simplizit\u00e4t vieler R\u00e4tsel. Die meisten Kombinationen von Gegenst\u00e4nden sind hier v\u00f6llig normale Dinge, auf die wohl jeder kommt. Die station\u00e4ren R\u00e4tsel mit den \u00fcblichen Hebeln und Kn\u00f6pfen wirken manchmal etwas lieblos in die Landschaft gepflanzt. Der zweite Teil der Story wirkt dann f\u00fcr mich etwas abstrus und ich bin nicht sicher, ob ich es verstanden habe, denn wenn ja, bedeutet es, dass es nicht viel Sinn ergibt. Die Anfangs erw\u00e4hnte Hilflosigkeit macht sp\u00e4ter mir keinen Spa\u00df mehr. Ich wei\u00df auch nach 1 Stunde nicht, was ich soll und wo ich nun mittelfristig hin will. Ich l\u00f6ste einfach ein R\u00e4tsel nach dem anderen und spontan kam der Abspann.\n\nF\u00fcr 10 Euro finde ich es zu kurz und das Wiederspielerlebnis zu gering.

Lo que encontr\u00e9 fue lo m\u00e1s parecido a entrar en una [i]sala de escape[/i] de \u00e9sas que est\u00e1n tan de moda ahora. Para los que viven en la [i]deep Spain[/i] explicar\u00e9 lo que es: se trata de encerrarte en una habitaci\u00f3n donde hay que buscar pistas y resolver acertijos para conseguir escapar antes de que acabe el tiempo y te suelten a doce Testigos de Jehov\u00e1 a dar por saco ah\u00ed dentro con la p... revista \"Atalaya\" y \"\u00a1Despertad!\", que adem\u00e1s, si te limpias el ojal con ellas te lo dejan m\u00e1s pintarrajeado que la cara de un payaso. En \"The Guest\" comenzaremos en una habitaci\u00f3n de hotel a finales del siglo XX. No sabemos qu\u00e9 ha pasado, as\u00ed que es probable que pill\u00e1semos una buena torrija anoche. Por la habitaci\u00f3n, aparte de puertas cerradas, encontraremos objetos y puzzles que tendremos que ir combinando entre ellos para avanzar hacia el final.\nDurante todo el juego, la intriga va en aumento, ayudada por el desconocimiento de lo que ha ocurrido. Iremos encontrando recortes de prensa que nos dejar\u00e1n confundidos, pero seguros de que ha pasado algo muy malo. La historia no es lo m\u00e1s destacable del juego. Es cierto que no esperaba complejos personales, reencuentros con el pasado, sutiles met\u00e1foras y dem\u00e1s parloteo de cineasta, as\u00ed que bajo mi punto de vista, la historia es perfecta para lo que \"The Guest\" nos quiere contar. Nos va ense\u00f1ando un poco al mismo tiempo que nos genera nuevas inc\u00f3gnitas,  y eso que, adem\u00e1s, tiene alguna sorpresa guardada para dejarnos con el culamen torcido.\nLos puzzles tienen un nivel de complejidad perfecto. Todos me costaron un poco (no demasiado) hasta pillarles el truco. El aspecto t\u00e9cnico es muy bueno. Tanto los gr\u00e1ficos como el sonido, se disfrutan. Las habitaciones est\u00e1n muy bien recreadas, y podremos disfrutar de una buena m\u00fasica en el juego. La jugabilidad es muy buena y \u00e1gil, aunque no me gust\u00f3 que los objetos en el inventario fueran tan diminutos, pero vamos, que tampoco es para ponerse a llorar. Despu\u00e9s de jugar al \"Megalomania\" en MegaDrive con el mando aquel, ya puedo con todo.\nComo muchas veces os comento el precio, en \u00e9ste tambi\u00e9n os digo que los 9'99\u20ac me parecen algo caros, pero no un timo.

Fair graphics, good atmosphere and sound. I'd recommend it in the first place...\n\nCONs\n...then there come the bugs.\nI purchased the game in March but had to put on hold due to the many problems I got at the first two runs. My only hope was a patch. And it arrived in late April. But despite the patch the bugs are still there.\n\nMajor issues:\n- The game starts with a blank screen and a solid cursor. (Not moving.) ALT+TAB and other tricks aren't helping. The only thing I can do is CTRL+ALT+DEL then select e.g. Task manager from this Windows menu. So I get back to the desktop. Now if I switch back to the game, turns out that it is running. I can play.\n- Same for exit. Blank screen with a cursor. CTRL+ALT+DEL, Task manager and I have to end the process.\n- The game is unresolvable for me. I had to look up a complete walktrough gameplay video and turns out there are things missing on my machine: the \"congratulations\" sound recording. (It is silent for me.) The red lights on the ceiling.\n\nMinor issues:\n- For example: I can reach the \"This dosen't seem to be...\" note without opening the drawer.\n- The game freezes for long seconds sometimes, which kills the mood.\n- No save game slots. Combining one game slot (progress) with achievements that require advance in-game knowledge is a bad thing. Do you think I will re-play the whole game just to achieve a badge? No way. (Sorry if there are multiple save slots. It is not working for me as it falls under the first major issue.)\n\nAltogether, by my heart I'd recommend this game to the adventure/puzzle/exploration lover community, but there are many similar out there with much better game experience.

The puzzles were varied and interesting, engaging more than just visual senses in some cases. No puzzles felt recycled or poorly thought out, but some were a little frustrating at times. Overall, the puzzle difficulty was just right for someone like me who doesn't play puzzle games super often.\n\nGraphics/sound are really nice.

No tardas mucho en notar que esta habitaci\u00f3n no tiene puerta de salida, por lo que muchas preguntas se vienen a tu mente \u00bfD\u00f3nde estoy? \u00bfC\u00f3mo llegue aqu\u00ed? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 estoy aqu\u00ed? Si encontrar\u00e1 la forma de salir... \u00bfEstar\u00eda m\u00e1s seguro afuera? Solo tu curiosidad e ingenio pueden darte las respuestas.\n\nEn esta oportunidad encarnaremos al Doctor Evgueni Leonov, con una perspectiva en primera persona. La jugabilidad es completamente instintiva y simple, ya sea usando mouse y teclado o joystick, pero debo admitir que el sistema de navegaci\u00f3n de los men\u00fas con este \u00faltimo es un tanto desorientador al principio, luego de la primer mitad de hora se vuelve aceptable. A los pocos minutos de comenzar la aventura nos encontraremos con los primeros puzzles, algunos de ellos consisten en buscar determinado objeto, combinarlo con otro y utilizarlo en alg\u00fan lugar en concreto, y otros son para pensar detenidamente y prestar atenci\u00f3n al entorno para resolverlos. Tal vez sea necesario tomar nota de lo visto para no complicarnos. \n\nLa resoluci\u00f3n de los puzzles es completamente l\u00f3gica, otros nos har\u00e1n buscar minuciosamente entre los objetos del inventario (los cuales pueden examinarse rot\u00e1ndolos). La frustraci\u00f3n en este videojuego es totalmente proporcional al nivel de ingenio y paciencia del jugador, pero no es imposible de completar. Si bien The Guest recuerda m\u00e1s al videojuego The Room, no posee objetos fuera de lo com\u00fan con montones de recovecos, por lo que no ser\u00e1 muy dif\u00edcil encontrar las piezas que conformar\u00e1n nuestro inventario.\n\nLa ambientaci\u00f3n es un gran acierto y un apartado muy trabajado. Cada una de las habitaciones est\u00e1n muy bien detalladas con un aspecto l\u00fagubre que, por malas costumbres, nos har\u00e1n creer que en cualquier momento ocurrir\u00e1 algo que nos deje sordos o maldiciendo por lo que resta del juego. Pero no ocurrir\u00e1 tal cosa porque The Guest apuesta por la exploraci\u00f3n y los puzzles, y esto hay que dejarlo claro desde el vamos porque los avances dan entender que se trata de un videojuego del estilo de Layers of Fear, por poner un ejemplo. La iluminaci\u00f3n es aceptable con una oclusi\u00f3n ambiental bien lograda, un ejemplo de ello se hace presente en el primer escenario, donde podremos ver part\u00edculas de suciedad en el aire y en otro muy concreto donde la luz del sol da sensaci\u00f3n de calidez.\n\nUna propuesta simple e inteligente que engancha desde el primer instante. Puzzles ingeniosos y una experiencia muy interesante. Y he aqu\u00ed el gran tema de discusi\u00f3n del game: la duraci\u00f3n. Puede ser terminado en 3 o 4 horas aproximadamente, pero es m\u00e1s que suficiente para lo que quiere mostrar. Lo justo y necesario sin irse por las ramas en el intento. Si te gustan los videojuegos de acertijos y resoluci\u00f3n de puzzles, The Guest es una compra m\u00e1s que recomendada que vale cada uno de sus $9,99 d\u00f3lares. Team Gotham sin dudas ha demostrado ser un estudio muy prometedor.\n\nLo Bueno:\n- Gran ambientaci\u00f3n\n- Puzzles inteligentes y bien incluidos\n- Relaci\u00f3n calidad/precio\n\nLo Malo:\t\n- Nula rejugabilidad\n\nPuntuaci\u00f3n Final: 8", "timestamp_created": 1461439387, "timestamp_updated": 1461439544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22543244": {"recommendationid": "22543244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142169528", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461266740}, "language": "english", "review": "Still playing it, but I will say that it's a fun game.

Estos espacios pueden ser tan grandes como un universo\u2026 o tan peque\u00f1os como una habitaci\u00f3n.\n\nEl juego de Team Gotham es un Escape The Room, pero es una evoluci\u00f3n completa de los juegos originales que se creaban en flash. La premisa es b\u00e1sica: te despiertas en una habitaci\u00f3n y descubres que est\u00e1s encerrado ah\u00ed y necesitas resolver una serie de puzles cada vez m\u00e1s complejos hasta conseguir escapar de la \u00e9sta. Sin embargo, The Guest tiene dos cosas de la que adolecen todos estos juegos: estilo y ambientaci\u00f3n.\n\nLa ambientaci\u00f3n en este caso es un contexto: eres el cient\u00edfico Evgueni Leonov invitado a un congreso en Massachussets que pasa la noche en un hotel. En un estilo a lo Gone Home controlamos a un hombre que apenas tiene interacci\u00f3n propia en el juego (salvo por la necesidad de buscar medicinas, el personaje es un mu\u00f1eco sujeto a nuestra voluntad) y le guiamos de un lado a otro en busca de la verdad.guest_letter_steam_ES\n\nAs\u00edmismo, seguimos la historia de una cient\u00edfica desaparecida a trav\u00e9s de recortes de peri\u00f3dico que encontramos de cuando en cuando.\n\nPor otro lado, el estilo es lo que le da identidad al juego. No solo es bonito y realista, sino tambi\u00e9n es oscuro y serio. La habitaci\u00f3n es muy oscura y se siente como una ratonera desde la que te observan. El juego te anima continuamente a seguir adelante al desbloquear nuevas piezas, textos y zonas pero no te quita la sensaci\u00f3n paranoica de que hay algo m\u00e1s, algo no est\u00e1 bien (otra vez recordando mucho a Gone Home). Adem\u00e1s las notas que van apareciendo (e incluso la televisi\u00f3n) refuerzan esta sensaci\u00f3n.\n\nAn\u00e1lisis completo:

There was a distinct feeling of unease for me as I tried to figure out what was actually going on. Early puzzled do a good job of slowly ramping up.\n\nThe game is lovely (although I did need to play with the brightness due to bloom - but that's a personal issue), and I found generally played well as far as being able to manipulate objects. \n\nCons:\n\nTowards the end, some of the puzzles felt obtuse to me. I eventually had to go to a guide to find the answer to one that was required for game completion. While I finished the game, part of that was diminished a little to me since I KNEW that there were two puzzles that were left unsolved. This does mean I'll play it again, but not for the reasons that I would normally like (branching paths/morality choices). \n\nA note to any players who have a hearing imparement: There is a single puzzle that is tone based and is randomized. This has been mentioned as an accessibility issue for hearing impared players (or those who are just tone deaf) in the community, but as of that time I'm writing this I don't believe that it's been addressed.", "timestamp_created": 1459732114, "timestamp_updated": 1459732114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519841", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22213012": {"recommendationid": "22213012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044248081", "num_games_owned": 1434, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459662745}, "language": "french", "review": "Bon jeu pour son ambience et ces enigmes.

Vamos a an\u00e1lise!\n\nThe Guest \u00e9 um jogo de aventura, puzzles e tamb\u00e9m explora\u00e7\u00e3o. Sobre o enredo do jogo voc\u00ea vai acordar em um poss\u00edvel quarto de hotel e ao longo do jogo vai coletar notas que v\u00e3o detalhar mais sobre o enredo do jogo ao jogador. O enredo logo de cara j\u00e9 demonstra ser bem escrito, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 complexo ou de dificil entendimento. Ele \u00e9 um enredo simples que tenta de alguma forma manter o jogador preso ao jogo e eu diria que ele consegue fazer isso muito bem j\u00e1 que junto aos puzzles o enredo \u00e9 o ponto chave do t\u00edtulo e que conta com um final bem bacana e bem explicativo, as notas que o jogador pega ao longo do jogo acabam por deixar o jogador sempre atento ao enredo e sobre o qu\u00ea est\u00e1 se passando no quarto de hotel. Descobrimos mais sobre o cientista (personagem) atr\u00e1ves de notas tamb\u00e9m. Tudo muito bem feito e \u00e9 um dos pontos altos do jogo.\n\nSobre os Puzzles, eu diria que The Guest funciona de maneira exemplar e que todos os puzzles foram muito bem pensados pela desenvolvedora, alguns s\u00e3o extremamente complicados (o uso de guia \u00e9 quase necess\u00e1rio se o jogador n\u00e3o quer ficar por horas trancado em algum puzzle) j\u00e1 por outro lado, temos puzzles que s\u00e3o bem faceis de se concluir. O problema \u00e9 que muitos destes puzzles s\u00e3o pura tentativa e erro, como o puzzle do labirinto onde o jogador fica por minutos e minutos andando em circulos at\u00e9 achar o local certo, \u00e9 chato e parece que foi feito mais para aumentar o tempo de jogo do que qualquer outra coisa.  Mas no geral os Puzzles s\u00e3o o ponto mais alto de The Guest junto ao enredo, s\u00e3o perfeitamente bem feitos e complexos. Jogadores que n\u00e3o tem paciencia para este tipo de jogo e est\u00e1 jogando mais pelo enredo pode pedir ajuda para outros jogadores j\u00e1 que muitos ficaram trancados em diversas partes do jogo. Ao final de tudo eu acho que o foco de The Guest \u00e9 este, quebrar a cabe\u00e7a a todo instante.\n\nA ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo \u00e9 espetacular, tudo no jogo foi perfeitamente bem colocado e conta com um level design primoroso, o cen\u00e1rio \u00e9 completamente lotado de detalhes e o jogador vai ficar admirando por um bom tempo. \n\nOs gr\u00e1ficos no geral s\u00e3o \u00f3timos, a ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo \u00e9 muito bonita e por ser um jogo feito na engine Unity voc\u00ea deve estar pensando: Como fica a programa\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo? muitas quedas de FPS? negativo! The Guest em 90% do tempo se comporta de maneira exemplar na sua programa\u00e7\u00e3o. Parab\u00e9ns a desenvolvedora por utilizar a Unity de forma exemplar.\n\nA trilha sonora e o som ambiente e trabalho de voz s\u00e3o espetaculares, tudo funciona de forma perfeita e o som ambiente \u00e9 muito bem feito. Ao longo do jogo temos algumas m\u00fasicas tamb\u00e9m. \n\nThe Guest \u00e9 um jogo curto e voc\u00ea pode facilmente terminar ele em (3 - 5 horas) \u00e9 claro que se voc\u00ea for atr\u00e1s das conquistas pode demorar mais tempo.

The puzzles are fairly easy, or can be brute forced without much difficulty, and there are lot of loose ends with no real lead up or resolution, and the twist is unexpected but akin to finding out at the end of Myst that the main character was a Lizardman, out of nowhere and lacking any real connection to any of the previous elements.\n\nI never actually knew or cared about why I was Leonard, why a game set in 1986, of all times, has some futuristic trappings, and while you get to see a glimpse behind the curtain of the room trap, it goes no further than that and you're railroaded all the way, barring some obscure hidden puzzle.\n\nPuzzle solving at it's core is hunting for random stuff in the dark, and most of them are red herrings, so much so there's a cheevo for grabbing all the crap, which makes inventory management a little hard. I wish I wasn't being so dead honest about the nature of this game, it is nothing but finding junk in the dark, and finding ways to turn on the light so you can find said junk, and then using it to solve a puzzle. \n\nI guess a good way to put how the ending makes me feel, is that I didn't really feel indoctrinated- Bioshock and White Night made you realize that you'd been playing to someone else's rules all along and hadn't noticed it, whereas this game's antagonists have a very low bar for conversion. I guess if you can solve random puzzles that have no interconnection or deeper meaning, you're okay enough for them, I guess? \n\nWorst part is that if there's room for multiple endings, and I just got a bad one, two puzzles are so full of tedium, the lazy maze I could have coded in my sleep, and the one involving rotating 3D objects to form a 2D puzzle, which are slow, and imprecise, I'm not even interested in going back to the beginning to try something new, which I doubt exists, as the game is very linear. Even found a bug when I hit \"continue\" after beating the game that had me back in the locked room, with buggy access to my inventory, and forced to sit through the unskippable credits again.\n\nSave up your money and maybe try something a bit more groundbreaking, like Layers of Fear or something.", "timestamp_created": 1458531482, "timestamp_updated": 1458531482, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21955924": {"recommendationid": "21955924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077157970", "num_games_owned": 1332, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458495182}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1] The Guest  - Analisis [/h1]\n\n\n[h1] Introducci\u00f3n.  [/h1]\n\nAl momento de adentrarnos a un videojuego, sabemos qu\u00e9 habr\u00e1 por delante, y que es lo que debemos esperar del mismo. Pero, sin embargo en el debut de la independiente desarrolladora espa\u00f1ola Team Gotham, no sabremos a ciencia cierta que hallaremos (omitiendo sus  puzles). \nSeguramente muchos pensaremos que estamos ante una cl\u00e1sica experiencia de terror al m\u00e1s estilo P.T. (La nost\u00e1lgica y aterradora demo jugable de Konami), otros seguramente le hallaban cierto parecido al reciente Layers of Fears. \nPero no es ninguno de los casos, en The Guest estaremos sobre una aventura con cierta dosis de drama y suspenso pero sin abarcar los g\u00e9neros de los t\u00edtulos mencionados arriba. \n\nEn esta experiencia encontraremos que la narraci\u00f3n y los puzles van de la mano, se complementan uno al otro, eludiendo por un momento las cl\u00e1sicas y conocidas f\u00f3rmulas de Room Escape que conocemos. Para intentar crear una experiencia m\u00e1s personal y propia, que logre mantener incentivado al jugador, no solamente por sus llamativos puzles, sino tambi\u00e9n que intente generar expectaci\u00f3n y llenar de dudas su recorrido. \n\n[h1] Un Limbo Terrenal [/h1]\t\n \nLa misteriosa aventura nos transporta a la piel del Doctor Evgueni Leonov, quien se encuentra tendido sobre una d\u00e9bil cama, al lograr abrir sus ojos, vislumbra lo que parece ser una anticuada habitaci\u00f3n de motel. \nConfundido y desorientado por tan claustrof\u00f3bico lugar, bajo los fuertes y ensordecedores golpes de la puerta junto a la cama, se pone en marcha para encontrar respuestas.\nPero al solo hecho de avanzar sobre este enigm\u00e1tico escenario, su cabeza instant\u00e1neamente se atenuara de dudas, \u00bfQue  estoy haciendo aqu\u00ed?, \u00bfQu\u00e9 es este lugar?, \u00bfPorque es tan dif\u00edcil hallar una salida?, \u00bfEstoy realmente solo? Preguntas que llevaran a matizar su propia existencia, ideolog\u00eda y creencias, y est\u00e1 en sus manos encontrarle un sentido a tan misteriosa traves\u00eda. \n\nYa sea en los recortes de peri\u00f3dico hallados sobre paredes, cajones y mesas o mientras solucionamos un puzzle, la narraci\u00f3n e historia se ira diluyendo a cuentagotas, hasta llegar a su abrupto e interesante final.\n\n[h1] M\u00e1s que un Puzzle.

Cada uno de estos claustrof\u00f3bicos escenarios se encuentra alimentado por una intensa cantidad de elementos con los que mantener bien equipado nuestro casi interminable inventario, \u00edtems \u00fatiles para resolver futuros puzzle, aunque tambi\u00e9n habr\u00e1 otros meramente est\u00e9ticos, que solamente acompa\u00f1a y llenan de vida su discreto marco artistico.\n\nSi nos adentramos en sus perspicaces puzles, nos encontraremos con algunos din\u00e1micos que intentan generar y crear las mec\u00e1nicas iniciales, que ser\u00e1n explotadas al m\u00e1ximo m\u00e1s adelante. \nSi bien durante los primeros momentos de la aventura, no intentan ser lo suficientemente complejos como para mantenernos pensando durante horas, \u2013 y con eso detener nuestro viaje \u2013 \nMientras avanzamos por su misterioso universo, hallaremos algunos acertijos sutilmente calculados y rebuscados, donde seguramente sea necesario tomar la cl\u00e1sica libreta, marcar, anotar ideas y mezclarlas con otras, para as\u00ed lograr ver la luz, ante tal oscuridad que supone quedarse con la mente en blanco.\n\n[h1] Respetar a los jugadores.

It's atmospheric but it's also abstract.\n\nHope this helps?", "timestamp_created": 1458393107, "timestamp_updated": 1458393107, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504790", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21922918": {"recommendationid": "21922918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161954077", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458392346}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0441 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f. \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043a \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e.\n\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0443. \u042d\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u044f \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e.", "timestamp_created": 1458392768, "timestamp_updated": 1458392768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499903", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21910578": {"recommendationid": "21910578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291190782", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463612043}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una mezcla de misterio, suspenso e intriga perfectamente combinados, dando como resultado un juego con muchos acertijos y puzzles (algunos no tan f\u00e1ciles de resolver) que entretienen hasta el \u00faltimo segundo del juego!\n\nLo disfrut\u00e9 demasiado y lo recomiendo al 1000%", "timestamp_created": 1458336257, "timestamp_updated": 1458336257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21900174": {"recommendationid": "21900174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088188117", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458458785}, "language": "english", "review": "Though interesting, I found it more frustrating than fun.\nThe \"puzzle\" weren't logical and basically boiled down to trial and error in many cases.\nControl is clunky at best which made it even more frustrating.

A thumbs-up feels too enthusiastic, and a thumbs-down feels a bit unfair.\n\nThe Guest is a mixture of escape-the-room, point-and-click, walking simulator, puzzle, and mystery. There are also elements of suspense and sci-fi, and the combination of all these works pretty well overall. The controls weren\u2019t [i]too[/i] clunky, but they could stand some refining. I will note that I experienced two technical problems, one of which could have been game-breaking. Also worth noting is that I was unable to save the game once I reached the latter half. Since I finished it that evening, it didn\u2019t really matter to me. But if you plan on spreading this game out, beware. The Guest only takes about 3-4 hours to complete, though, so finishing it in a sitting is feasible.\n\nI absolutely love when games are atmospheric, and The Guest is just that. From the sound effects to the lighting to the graphics, The Guest captures a certain atmosphere and doesn\u2019t let go of it. Having said that, atmosphere is this game\u2019s strongest point; on other fronts, it felt a bit lackluster. I enjoy a good puzzler, but I felt that these puzzles were at once too difficult and too mindless. I solved a couple of puzzles by more or less clicking randomly, and that\u2019s just not satisfying. There\u2019s one puzzle in particular (under the bathroom sink) that just did not make sense to me, even with the in-game \u201cguide\u201d to it. Maybe that\u2019s just me being a dummy, but I would have never solved it without checking a walkthrough. The puzzles worked pretty well mechanically, but from a player\u2019s viewpoint they were not very intuitive. They were mostly tedious, and I had a few moments of: \"Am I supposed to know what to do here?\". I find it hard to say that a puzzle game is objectively good when the puzzles just aren\u2019t what they should be. With a little work, though, Team Gotham could make some really lovely puzzles.\n\nStory-wise, I felt a bit cheated. There's a fine line between mysteriousness and vagueness, and The Guest unfortunately crosses over to the wrong side of that line. There are questions about the world and characters and plot that we just don\u2019t get answers to. The material is undoubtedly [i]there[/i], it just isn't brought to its full potential. The premise is gripping, but it's not fleshed out as much as it should be, leaving players with more of a skeleton than a meaty game. Truth be told, I really do want to see a sequel to this game, where the puzzles and controls are more refined and the story is more prevalent and better developed. If Team Gotham makes a sequel, I\u2019ll be playing it. And if I\u2019m not mistaken, The Guest is their first project; for a first project, this is a solid and respectable effort. (And if you\u2019re into achievements, there are some easy ones and some hard ones. I enjoyed the achievements a lot, even though I couldn\u2019t get some of them.)\n\nIn the end, The Guest left me wanting more. Sometimes for the wrong reasons, sometimes (maybe mostly?) for the right ones. I\u2019ve chosen to give this game a thumbs-up because I did overall enjoy my experience, and I appreciate this game for what it is. I feel a bit disappointed in it, and I can absolutely see its fault, but it\u2019s not bad. If you\u2019re willing to take a $10 risk, buy The Guest. You might be disappointed, but you\u2019ll probably be appreciative.

From The Room to Submachine and every free Flash game in between - if it has intriguing, logical puzzles then I'll be glad to play. A room escape with an intriguing story line and detailed graphics? Hell yes, I'm sold.\n\nThe puzzles were... fine. None of them really challenging for a seasoned puzzle addict, more a case of hunting around for the bits you need and putting two & two together. Solid, but not spectacular. Mechanically, they were extremely well implemented, and integrated into the world, and for that I do congratulate the developers - the influence of The Room is clear. One in particular - involving aligning markings to form a pattern - was elegant and truly innovative.\n\nBut the game falls down hard in the extras that it promises. Without wishing to spoil anything, I found the writing to be clumsy, tired and directionless. It starts as a mystery and smudges seamlessly into the worst of tired tropes, without really making any sense in between. The puzzles and the story don't mesh together in any way - you're told what the arbitrary challenges were for, in-world, but at the same time they're presented as far deeper and more insidious than they are. (Using blunt sinister thematic keywords as passwords is sitll arbitrary - change the theme to Lovecraftian horror and replace the puzzle answers with \"DAGON\" and \"RLYEH\" and nothing is lost, see?)\n\nThe writing, in short, was a thin thematic skin and nothing more. Which would've been easy to brush off if it hadn't been such a clumsy cultural throwback too. It was like a Mcarthyite fever dream. 1984 for kids. Given the rich detail of the assets and lighting, the theming was all the more jarring.\n\nThe other big problem was the mechanical immersion. Having the game be first-person is such an interesting and unusual tool for puzzle makers (cf The Witness, Portal, Perspective, FRACT) that, sadly, only ever served to get in the way of this game. Stumbling around furniture in the dark isn't tense or fun, it's just annoying. Not being able to see properly into drawers & cupboards makes the object hunting a chore. Both these problems are nonexistent in room-escape Flash games, but are introduced by using first person perspective. It was a bold move that didn't pay off.\n\nAnd the labyrinth, my god, the labyrinth.\n\nThe labyrinth really exemplified the problem I had with this game. It wasn't fun. It wasn't challenging. It wasn't tense. It didn't communicate anything about the character, the world, the game mechanics, it wasn't a puzzle or a significant storytelling device, it was nothing. Nothing but a tedious 5m+ trial-and-error walk through a blocky corridor, rendered in quite pretty atmospheric lighting. I just don't see what the developers were trying to achieve or communicate through that device. I don't see why they thought it was a good idea. It was an incongruous, boring intermission.\n\nIt was a gimmick, not a new or clever one, and it made no sense, didn't tie in thematically or mechanically to anything else, did nothing but frustrate and distract. What was the point?\n\nI played the game through in a couple of hours, and enjoyed the puzzles well enough in spite of the problems I've stated. But while I could've played the puzzles quite happily for another two hours, the theme, the 1st-person mechanics, the writing, all would've annoyed me more and more. It ended when it had to, and left no impact in the process.\n\nThe developers clearly have real talent with regards to building a solid, pretty, functional game, and I hate to imagine that this review might discourage them from pursuing that. They have good ideas, solid mechanical competence, and I want to see more. I just feel like they never had anyone sit down with a critical eye and ask them, \"What is this bit for? What are you trying to accomplish there? What are you hoping to make the player think or feel? Do any of these elements support each other, or are they just thrown in to fill the gaps?\" Some good writing and creative direction could've turned this game into a little gem, but it's not a gem. It's coal. Solid, functional, unexciting - burn it up and it's gone, leaving nothing behind.\n\nI'm not angry, just disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1458013602, "timestamp_updated": 1458013602, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833102", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21844597": {"recommendationid": "21844597", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999696258", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458003452}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like the scary/puzzle games or room-escape type games, I HIGHLY recommend this one.

Habitamos el limitado universo que el (creador) nos da y nos limitamos a utilizar las acciones que nos han sido proporcionadas para lograr avanzar dentro un contexto cerrado e inamovible. Somos los invitados a un universo personal, una yincana digital que valora nuestra destreza con puntuaciones, y logros mientras nos recompensa con nuevos escenarios. The Guest, desarrollado por los madrile\u00f1os Team Gotham, opta por el ejemplo m\u00e1s paradigm\u00e1tico de esta relaci\u00f3n entre creador y jugador, un room escape que huye del concepto tradicional centrado en la b\u00fasqueda de objetos m\u00e1s resoluci\u00f3n de puzles y se centra en ofrecer cuatro horas de pura atm\u00f3sfera que har\u00eda las delicias del Lindelof de Lost.\n\nEn The Guest encarnamos al cient\u00edfico Evgueni Leonov, quien llega invitado desde su natal Volgogrado a un congreso en Massachussetts, donde se alojar\u00e1 en un agradable hotel hasta el comienzo del evento. Ah\u00ed es donde el t\u00edtulo comienza situ\u00e1ndonos en la piel de un desorientado Leonov a las 4:23 de la ma\u00f1ana escuchando unos golpes en la puerta de su habitaci\u00f3n.\n\nLos chicos de Team Gotham han decidido dividir The Guest en un circo de tres pistas en el sentido m\u00e1s amplio del t\u00e9rmino, pues lo aplican tanto a nivel argumental como de mec\u00e1nicas y localizaciones. El objetivo principal es algo tan b\u00e1sico como conseguir abrir puertas, pero pronto se iguala con la necesidad de comprender nuestra situaci\u00f3n mientras se abre una nueva l\u00ednea de investigaci\u00f3n relacionada con una cient\u00edfica desaparecida. A esta bifurcaci\u00f3n de objetivos ayuda una disposici\u00f3n no lineal de puzles que se complementa con la acertada decisi\u00f3n de permitirnos recoger todo tipo de objetos, sean o no \u00fatiles para nuestros objetivos. De este modo la investigaci\u00f3n de la trama se realiza mientras intentamos averiguar c\u00f3mo resolver el dichoso puzle que nos tiene atascados, evitando utilizar grandes revelaciones como recompensas, al menos hasta el tramo final.\n\nDesde que empezamos a hablar de The Guest, y de esto hace ya dos a\u00f1os, siempre ha orbitado la referencia de 1408 de Stephen King como parte de la inspiraci\u00f3n para su creaci\u00f3n. Ignoro hasta qu\u00e9 punto el relato corto del de Portland ha servido como apoyo en la creaci\u00f3n de la trama (no dudo en cambio de su validez promocional), pero personalmente me alegra que no tenga demasiado que ver con el relato original. El ejercicio de King, y sobretodo el de la pel\u00edcula basada en el relato, se acomoda en tren de la bruja enmarcado en un \u00fanico espacio (y aqu\u00ed volver\u00e9 ahora) mientras el protagonista no es m\u00e1s que un mero espectador presa de la ira sobrenatural de lo que le rodea. The Guest huye de este planteamiento y se esfuerza en ofrecer una atm\u00f3sfera pausada que en casi ning\u00fan momento se deja arrastrar por la sorpresa f\u00e1cil ni el efectismo videoclipero, lo cual tiene m\u00e1s m\u00e9rito al circunscribir todo el desarrollo a tres escenarios dentro de la misma habitaci\u00f3n, lo cual me recuerda que ten\u00eda que hablarles de eso.\n\nLas limitaciones t\u00e9cnicas asociadas al videojuego cl\u00e1sico tuvieron como consecuencia que todos interpret\u00e1ramos la superaci\u00f3n de cada una de estas limitaciones como un logro a desbloquear. De este modo se ha perpetuado una especia de \u201cy yo m\u00e1s\u201d en el que el derroche num\u00e9rico se fomenta sin objetivo. Da igual si hablamos de la extensi\u00f3n de la ciudad del sandbox de turno, el n\u00famero de veh\u00edculos a conducir en aquel juego de carreras o la cantidad de horas de juego que promete aquel RPG. N\u00fameros vac\u00edos convertidos por la gracia del gamer en diversi\u00f3n. Esta interpretaci\u00f3n heredada de unos tiempos en los s\u00ed ten\u00eda sentido, se ha ido perpetuando hasta que la llegada de LO INDIE ha impuesto una nueva limitaci\u00f3n no basada en la t\u00e9cnica, sino en el dinero, donde cada hora de desarrollo cuenta. The Guest es pr\u00e1cticamente perfecto en este sentido. Maximiza sus recursos para componer un relato que funciona en un entorno m\u00ednimo que sin embargo nunca se entiende como algo negativo. Habr\u00e1 quien eche en falta m\u00e1s habitaciones o escenarios, pero me extra\u00f1a que alguien pueda afirmar que eso es algo que perjudique los objetivos del t\u00edtulo.\n\nEs evidente que en Team Gotham han entendido de qu\u00e9 va esto. The Guest asienta sus mec\u00e1nicas sobre el clasicismo mientras se preocupa por exponer en cada detalle sus variadas referencias de cultura pop. Personalmente echo en falta un poco m\u00e1s de atrevimiento en el tramo final cuando la trama se acerca a su conclusi\u00f3n, momento en el que quiz\u00e1s hubiese sido interesante ahondar en el asunto que plantea. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de esta consideraci\u00f3n personal, lo que tenemos es un debut s\u00f3lido como una roca que debe servir para afianzar al estudio y permitirles cierta tranquilidad en su pr\u00f3ximo proyecto.

Comienza nuestro an\u00e1lisis de The Guest.\n\nNos situamos en la habitaci\u00f3n 297 del t\u00edpico hotel de los a\u00f1os 80. Nuestro protagonista, el doctor Evgueni Leonov, es el que se encuentra aqu\u00ed. Nuestra \u00fanica misi\u00f3n es sencilla, descubrir qui\u00e9nes fueron los responsables de que nos qued\u00e1semos atrapados y salir de la habitaci\u00f3n mediante la resoluci\u00f3n de distintos puzles. Parece que alguien intenta jugar con nosotros o ponernos a prueba de una siniestra forma. En este t\u00edtulo, veremos como este personaje tendr\u00e1 que luchar consigo mismo para lograr salir de all\u00ed. The Guest hablar\u00e1 de temas contrarios que de alguna manera u otra acabar\u00e1n compartiendo caminos, la ciencia y la religi\u00f3n.\n\nMovi\u00e9ndonos por primera vez en el juego, no podemos pensar en otra cosa que en recolectar objetos. Al tratarse de un juego de exploraci\u00f3n, deberemos de inspeccionar cada rinc\u00f3n de esta habitaci\u00f3n, de lo contrario quiz\u00e1s no tengamos las herramientas suficientes para seguir adelante.\n\nEl inventario no tiene fin, con esto os queremos decir que no necesitamos preocuparnos por si cogemos demasiadas cosas, no nos encontramos en un survival. Adem\u00e1s de esto, disponemos de la opci\u00f3n de combinar objetos. Esto ser\u00e1 indispensable para resolver los distintos puzles que nos encontremos a lo largo de nuestro recorrido. Quiz\u00e1s haya alguna combinaci\u00f3n que cueste caer en ella, pero no hay tantos objetos como para no intentar unir dichos objetos uno por uno hasta que funcionen, simplemente aplicaremos el sentido com\u00fan. Esta caracter\u00edstica a\u00f1ade un plus al esfuerzo que necesita el usuario para pasar al siguiente puzzle, pero no demasiado no os preocup\u00e9is, ya que como comentaremos m\u00e1s abajo, la progresi\u00f3n de la dificultad es sencillamente sublime.\n\nJunto a las utilidades y herramientas que nos vayamos encontrando en el juego, tambi\u00e9n nos toparemos con distintos recortes de peri\u00f3dico que ayudan a adentrarnos en la trama y la ambientaci\u00f3n.

I usually write lengthy reviews but I think a shorter one will suffice.\n\n\nThe Guest is a puzzle game in which you are stuck in this room and in escence have to find a way out.   Along the way, there are plenty of puzzles that will require you to either use outside items or use logical thinking.   The range of difficulty is from fairly easy, to fairly difficult.  Nothing is impossible, and there are plenty of red herrings, but as long as you remember the very basic clues that are given, then you should do well.  There are plenty of things to grab that you will NOT use, so that can be tricky, and some of the challenges in the later part of the game, can take quite a bit of thinking.\n\n\n\nAnother thing that I should bring up, is whether this is a horror game or walking simulator.   In short, it is neither.   It is not a horror game becauase outside of the early on 'bathroom scene', there are no scary parts to it.  Creepy?  yes very much, but once you restore power to the room and turn on the lights, then things seem less scary.   As for walking simulator, there is not that much walking outisde of one section in which you might find yourself walking a LOT more than you would like. Outside of that, there just isn't much walking needed.\n\n\n\nVisually the game is a stanard Unity type of game so its nice pretty 3d visuals that run very smoothly.   Voice acting is minimal and even then its not that bad I suppose.   Music is minimal.   There are a few odd bugs though.  I got trapped on one puzzle and couldn't exit out of the puzzle, and another time, I had the control key display, stick to my screen and would not remove itself until I reloaded the game.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, this game is a good 3 hour or so puzzle game that is well worth it IF you do NOT cheat or use outside sources.  As it stands, there is only one person I think who has finished it but he takes quite a while to do.  Everything in the game, is possible to do if you read the clues, use simple logic, and semi-complex logic.    My only gripe aside from the few bugs, is that the ending is, nice but cliche although maybe it could lead into a sequel (although doubtful).

However this game alternates perfectly those pauses and feedback moments, so you don't feel too much lost and at the same time they don't tell you \"monkey, IT'S THERE\". \n\nThe atmosphere is very nice too, the lights and shaders make it even better and the music and sound keep you uncalm all the game along. There are two moments where the music changes: the first one is an amazing song which I really enjoyed (I searched it later on the internet to download it) and the other one is a classic one.\nThere is also a scene so beautiful that I would like to print a screenshot and put it on the walls of my bedroom.\n\nGlobally an amazing game.

They can be easily solved with just a little more thinking, plus it's always helpful to keep a small notebook beside you for notes, just in case.

Massachussets? Massachusetts - that one is right, no red squiggles.\n\nFull disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nThis is a tough one to review because... well, it's hard to talk about a game with an enigmatic story and puzzles without inevitably pissing in someone's bowl of cornflakes. Suffice it to say you are a heavily medicated doctor trapped in his hotel room in Boston.\n\nAnd it's a pretty darn nice room if I do say so myself. Spacious, plenty of chairs and couches for guests, a record player and television set... the bathroom has a nasty leak but otherwise if this were a hotel review, I'd give it a 4/5 - just short of perfect since I'm being held there against my will. I have to dock points for that.\n\nIt's your standard point n' click adventure game: pick up random things, combine them, smash them together, etc. What's cool about it is you can walk around all first person-like, and that freedom of movement, coupled with the creepy atmosphere, definitely kept me on my toes. There's nothing outright frightening so far... just the overwhelming sensation that I'm being watched, judged.\n\nAnalyzed.\n\nPuzzles are good and varied, and the game provides clever hints assuming you're paying attention. And the graphics are nice. Not great, not dated, just nice... there's no physics to speak of, or other characters that I've encountered - just the hotel room, so it's hard to screw that kind of thing up. The sound design is great though, definitely worth mentioning! Heavy footsteps, rainfall, creaks and leaks, all adds to the sense of dread and loneliness. Finally the story... hasn't really captured me just yet. Yes it's mysterious, but it's too mysterious and, thus far, entirely reliant on note fragments and newspaper articles. \n\nBut I have to finish it! I'm currently stuck on this particularly perplexing puzzle.

Se trata de un juego de EXPLORACI\u00d3N en el que tenemos que buscar objetos, resolver puzzles, ir adentr\u00e1ndonos en la historia... Bien es cierto, que para adentrarnos en dicha historia vamos a tener que estar pendientes de bastantes detallitos, desde papelitos a cosas simplemente colocadas por el mapa o peque\u00f1as frases.\n\nComenzaremos tirados en la cama de nuestra habitaci\u00f3n y alguien tocando a la puerta. Los primeros detalles que veremos es sobre quien somos, a donde \u00edbamos y \"por qu\u00e9\" estamos en un hotel y no en nuestra casa. Desde este punto se desarrolla la historia al completo. \n\nHablemos un poco del gameplay y los puzzles, el elemento principal del juego. Est\u00e1 todo sumamente bien adaptado para que tengamos que inspeccionar a fondo cada rinconcito de cada habitaci\u00f3n que encontremos en el juego, puesto que tenemos un inventario infinito y podemos recoger todo cuanto veamos (No todos los objetos son realmente \u00fatiles, pero est\u00e1 bien robarte el champ\u00fa del ba\u00f1o xD), gran parte de estos objetos nos ayudar\u00e1n a resolver los puzzles. Algunos confieso que son un pel\u00edn obvio el c\u00f3mo combinarlos o como actuar con ellos, otros simplemente tendremos que inspeccionarlos para obtener la pista que nos ayudar\u00e1 a solucionar los puzzles. Todo esto lo haremos en primera persona con el t\u00edpico control wasd + rat\u00f3n. \n\nDe lo que si quiero hablar un poco m\u00e1s en detalle son los \"puzzles\" de los cuales en serio solo me he tomado un par... digamos que los m\u00e1s especiales, puesto que tampoco quiero spoilearos el juego. Pero la gran mayor\u00eda de cosas a hacer son \"tareas algo simples\" y \"predecibles\". Ojo, tambi\u00e9n puede ser que esto sea por mi experiencia en comerme el tarro con puzzles en juegos de este g\u00e9nero, ya que he conocido gente que si le ha costado solucionar alguno que otro bastante \"simple\". Y esto en el fondo, no es algo malo, de esta manera pueden disfrutar la gran mayor\u00eda de jugadores, a diferencia de The Witness donde uno acababa frustrado por no encontrar la soluci\u00f3n. As\u00ed que un poco a manera de resumen digamos que este aspecto lo lleva bien, pero en lo PERSONAL hubiera preferido comerme algo m\u00e1s el tarro para encontrar soluciones :P\n\nSi hay algo que me ha gustado por encima de todo, es la ambientaci\u00f3n \"oscura\" que tendremos durante casi todo el t\u00edtulo. Sin duda esa iluminaci\u00f3n junto a la musiquita que acompa\u00f1a, hace que sea una experiencia m\u00e1s inmersiva que otros muchos t\u00edtulos, adem\u00e1s de que en ocasiones me he acojonado esperando algo \"en la oscuridad\".  Sin embargo, algo que me ha disgustado un poco ha sido la duraci\u00f3n, que a mi no me ha llegado a las 2h de juego (S\u00ed tengo 6h, pero porque me puse a rejugar para buscar \"secretos\" y hacer logros varios).\n\nEn resumen: Es un juego interesante que merece la pena darle una oportunidad. Es una experiencia interesante que vivir y bueno, seguro que m\u00e1s de uno se muerde las u\u00f1as intentando resolver alg\u00fan puzzle o se pierde en el laberinto... (gui\u00f1o gui\u00f1o codo codo). Adem\u00e1s es espa\u00f1ol joder, apoyemos la industria! :P\n\nOs dejo un gameplay como de costumbre:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ15OMpQgBg", "timestamp_created": 1457625290, "timestamp_updated": 1457625651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741603", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 286, "total_negative": 70, "total_reviews": 356}}

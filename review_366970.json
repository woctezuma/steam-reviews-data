Mighty Switch Force takes place in an almost cyber-punk setting reminescient of Robocop crossed with Rockman.\nSomehow, the backdrop of city lights and towering buildings does little to detract from the overall charm of the cartoon-like character designs, which I personally love.\n\nMighty Switch Force's gameplay is outwardly kind of like a scrolling action-platform game. Deep in its core, however, there's much more puzzle solving than action. The unique gimmick is based around the main character's ability to toggle specific background objects into the foreground or to do the reverse, hence the name, \"Switch Force.\"\nThe game manages to sqeeze just about all it can out of this core gameplay concept, introducing a variety of different blocks that behave in unique ways. It isn't a particularly long game, even counting the optional stages, but it's very satisfying while it lasts.\n\nThe first of my only two complaints I have is in regards to the game's hit detection; it's pixel-perfect in all the wrong ways. Patricia is actually a few pixels larger than her art on a few sides, especially in her jumping animation. The result is the game has a very bad habit of deciding that the edge of one of the aglets on Patricia's shoelaces was slightly overlapping part of the shading on a nearby block that is entering the foreground, sending her smashing headlong into the screen and sending the player back to the previous checkpoint. \nThis is funny, charitably speaking, maybe twice. After that I started to get the impression that the game was out to get me.\n\nThe other annoyance, for me at least, was the game's health system. Being hit by some obstacles and enemies causes Patricia to lose a heart and flicker for a few seconds, while taking damage from other hazards causes her to fall off the screen and return to the previous checkpoint. The inconsistency gave the game an unpolished feel.\n\nNothing in those two drawbacks would ever stop me from recommending this, though.

For example, after rescuing Marion from her bar towards the start of Raiders of the Lost Ark, you'll run through a section where you work along a snowy cliff side, take on some Germans and eventually head out of the area. Similarly, the temple at the end of the Last Crusade has much more than three tests to pass, with plenty of mostly non-deadly puzzles to complete before you get to the Grail. This all works well in terms of how the game plays as well as its pacing, and most all of the segments are fun, though there's certainly a bigger separation between game and films than what we saw with the LEGO Star Wars titles.\n\nThough there's obviously a lack of Force powers this time around, Traveller's Tales has once again done a good job of providing distinct character groups. Indiana Jones' whip always comes in handy, and he's the only one that can open a number of the game's sections thanks to its numerous uses. Thugees, the bad guys from the Temple of Doom, are able to \"talk\" to statues of Kali and open up secret areas, while people with manuscripts, like Henry Jones Sr. or Elsa, are able to decipher hieroglyphs and open other secrets. Some characters come with shovels or wrenches, which allow them to dig up objects or fix broken items.\n\n\ufffc\n\nFights with armed enemies can be a nuisance when all you have is your fists.\n\nThe cool thing here is that aside from Indy's whip (or a tiny character's small stature), you're able to find all of these items in-game to help you solve puzzles. So even if you only have Junior and Willie at your disposal, you'll be able to dig up treasure if you can find a shovel nearby, or you can work with hieroglyphs if you can find a book. There are plenty of areas that won't have these things lying around, requiring that you come back in Free Play to unlock more goodies, but the puzzle variety is able to be mixed much better throughout the game thanks to the ability to pick up and use items.\n\nAdding a bit more character to the main cast are phobias that a couple of them have. Indy, for instance, is afraid of snakes, while Willie is scared of spiders. Both will cower in fear when near them, so you'll need to use another character to either clear the way or go ahead and solve a puzzle without them. It's a small touch, but one that works well to bring about some of the characters' traits from the films to the game. Since the characters don't really talk though, Short Round lacks his funny quips and just winds up being short. Oh well.\n\nA somewhat big difference between the Star Wars and Indiana Jones LEGO games is the focus of combat. While most characters either had a lightsaber or blaster in the Star Wars titles, the combat in LEGO Indy is largely hand-to-hand. You can pick up guns that enemies drop, but they're only good for a few shots before they expire. While this is mostly fine, it can be a little frustrating when there are a group of armed enemies on-screen and you have no choice but to repeatedly jump while running at them in order to try and dodge their shots.

If you play the game just to reach the end, you'll probably find it too easy. The fun in this game is doing these stages absolutely perfectly. Some of the stages can take up to 20 tries, and it's not trying to figure out the path, it's just doing everything perfectly. I feel like some of the Hyper levels have stages with 2-frame windows on certian tasks. I could be wrong, but expect that kind of precision from this game.\n\n\nMy porno review: 5 blonde prisoners escape from prison and it's up to the female police to stop them and make them wash your car.", "timestamp_created": 1484275023, "timestamp_updated": 1484275023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29074595": {"recommendationid": "29074595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160758838", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497794761}, "language": "french", "review": "Pas mal\nJeu sympa avec des graphismes magnifiques, une soundtrack g\u00e9nialissime par le grand Jake Kaufman et des puzzles pas si faciles ! :) \nPoints faibles:\n-Protagoniste manquant de personnalit\u00e9 \n-Absence de sc\u00e9nario, progression trop lin\u00e9aire niveau apr\u00e8s niveau \n-Interface du menu principal vraiment pas conviviale et trop simpliste \n(au fait ne vous attendez pas \u00e0 un shantae du futur y'a aucun rapport si ce ne sont que quelques bruitages sfx !)", "timestamp_created": 1483750095, "timestamp_updated": 1483750095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28895618": {"recommendationid": "28895618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113230725", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483260165}, "language": "english", "review": "It looks nice and plays well.\nThe best things in this game are the presentation, good soundtrack and artstyle.

It's pretty standard as platformers go, with a limited range of abilities and unique obstacles, but the level design is so heavily varied and the actions you perform feel exhilarating enough that it never got stale. The stages always find different intricate ways of using the elements they introduce, yet remain pretty straightforward in terms of finding your way around. It's an easy game to learn and control, pretty kind about health and checkpoints, and will certainly challenge you at times.\n\nI will say, though, that it's a pretty short and linear game. There's a modest selection of levels, so if you really sit down and play through, you might have this done in just a few hours. The latter half consists of hard modes of previous levels, but they reconfigure enough to give them their own identity while remaining familiar to the originals, so there's still a fair amount of added variety and challenge there.\n\nThe par times will definitely keep you a lot more busy. They'll test your reflexes, accuracy, and familiarity with each level layout and feel great to complete. That said, however, certain minor issues with jump and crush damage thresholds that are negligible when playing the levels normally can become really inflated and punishing in this scenario. Don't get me wrong, par times are still really fun if you want something intense. They're fulfillingly difficult, and the goals you need to reach are cunningly defined.\n\nOverall, I would very much recommend picking this up! There's easily enough to do here to be worth $10. Just go into it knowing that you probably won't spend thousands of hours on it. Still, everything that's here is a lot of fun, feels really good to perform, and is worth your attention while it lasts.", "timestamp_created": 1480557265, "timestamp_updated": 1493836880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28087209": {"recommendationid": "28087209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184816558", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480466913}, "language": "english", "review": "It's weird why I got this game because one of the OST's was featured in project M and that sparked my interest in MSF.

Hyper Drive Edition[/h1]\n\n[url=http://revistayumecr.com/analisis-pc-mighty-switch-force-hyper-drive-edition/]Leer rese\u00f1a completa en Revista Yume[/url]\n\nWayForward nos ha extendido un c\u00f3digo de Steam para jugar Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition en PC. Antes de comenzar quiero mencionar que este juego primero llegu\u00e9 a jugarlo en Nintendo 3DS y qued\u00e9 encantado con el nivel de desaf\u00edo y todo el entorno presentado; ahora tendr\u00e9 la oportunidad de experimentar esta aventura nuevamente pero desde PC y con gr\u00e1ficos much\u00edsimo mejores que los experimentados en WiiU.\n\nBueno, la historia es realmente sencilla pero eso se debe a que el juego es meramente de puzzles y plataformas. Somos una polic\u00eda llamada Patricia Wagon y nuestras rehenes, las hermanas Hooligan se han fugado de nuestra prisi\u00f3n debido a que el autom\u00f3vil de seguridad donde iban se estrell\u00f3. Nuestra misi\u00f3n es muy sencilla: atraparlas a todas y ponerlas tras las rejas de nuevo.\n\nSi hablamos de jugabilidad, es la misma que experimentamos en el Nintendo 3DS. Claro, esta vez es en PC pero los controles son realmente sencillos y tendremos los mismos comandos para movernos, saltar, disparar y cambiar los bloques con nuestro casco. En realidad este juego tiene controles perfectos, en ninguna de las versiones que llegu\u00e9 a jugarlo tuve problemas y m\u00e1s bien son realmente f\u00e1ciles de aprender.\n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos en esta entrega est\u00e1n mejorados hasta su m\u00e1xima potencia. De hecho los colores son sumamente agradables a la vista y la tasa de frames es incre\u00edblemente estable, el juego corre muy fluido y saca al m\u00e1ximo la potencia de una PC. Adem\u00e1s, para quienes somos un poco m\u00e1s consoleros y nost\u00e1lgicos, el juego tiene la opci\u00f3n de jugar con \u201cPixel Patricia\u201d la cual es nada m\u00e1s ni nada menos que la versi\u00f3n pixelada de nuestro personaje. No se ve tan bien como lo esperaba, pero no deja de gustarme para jugar ya que me recuerda a la versi\u00f3n de Nintendo 3DS.\n\nComo era de esperar el juego no tiene efecto 3D, pero eso es lo de menos si lo pensamos. Todo est\u00e1 mejorado, incluida la banda sonora que ha sido remasterizada y suena incre\u00edble. En realidad, el compositor Jake Kaufman hizo un excelente trabajo con este OST, es de mis favoritos.\n\nAunque podremos pasar los 16 niveles originales, m\u00e1s los 5 extras que igual recibimos en las versiones para consolas en unas 2 horas o un poco m\u00e1s; el juego tiene una rejugabilidad incre\u00edble porque al terminar el juego desbloquearemos los niveles \u201cHyper\u201d. Son las mismas versiones pero remezcladas y m\u00e1s complejos que los originales.

Hyper Drive Edition is a fun little platformer that branches out mostly in the Nintendo area of consoles, but has come to Steam for a neat release as well. I personally quite like this game and its related franchise, as well as the developer company themselves, so fair warning, I may be slightly biased. Please don't let that deter you from purchasing this game, however!\n\nLet's start with the gameplay. It plays well, and doesn't take much to run. The player controls one Patricia Wagon as she sets off to capture, capture, and capture again the Hooligan Sisters, making use of large blocks that switch in and out of the game's playing field, making up a majority of the puzzles and action in the game itself. The concept is relatively simple enough, and is put to use pretty well. Along with that is fairly standard platforming mechanics, with Patricia carrying a gun to shoot enemies with as well, altogether making a pretty good gameplay experience in my opinion.\n\nAs for graphics, this is a two-dimensional platformer that uses sprites, but it looks good. The version of this game on Steam and some Nintendo consoles titled Hyper Drive Edition feature redone sprites of most everything in the game, in a nice and smooth artstyle. There is an option to turn Patricia Wagon, and only her, back into the pixelated version seen in the first versions of the game. \n\nIn terms of sound and music, I very much like the soundtrack of Mighty Switch Force! Composed by Jake Kaufman, or virt, it's a lovely electronic mix soundtrack, and is available to download for free or pay what you wish on Jake's bandcamp. Admittedly I believe the sequel's music is ever so slightly better, but that can be found in the little spinoff game also present on Steam. As for the sounds themselves, overall the game has good sound design. Patty's voice doesn't get annoying, and the rest complement the actions that occur.\n\nOverall, I find the game great, if a little short perhaps, but still worth the price! If you do purchase and do like this game, I recommend obtaining another entry into its franchise, Mighty Switch Force! Academy, also available currently exclusively on Steam. If you like this type of game, I'd also suggest looking into the Shantae franchise! If I missed anything, please leave a comment below.

Hyper Drive Edition also has replaybility, because of the addition of personal best scores for timed levels and a speedrunning option, as well as the normal story mode, and even a harder difficulty level for hardcore gamers. \n\nMost gamers will be able to find something to enjoy here.

Hyper Drive Edition is an HD remake of the original version, developed by WayForward Technologies, that was released for the 3DS on Nintendo's eShop back in December of 2011, Originally, the Hyper Drive Edition was released on the Wii U 2012 before finally being released on Steam in June of 2015. The game is a puzzle platformer that is centered around a female cyborg police officer named Patricia Wagon and her  goal of tracking down female convicts, avoiding enemies/traps and making it back to safety in a variety of levels. Each level has a set number of female convicts and a time to beat (but not required) if you're looking to earn the various achievements the game has to offer.\n\nTo complete your task, Patricia can run, jump, shoot and alternate the level terrain with her helmet, changing platforms and opening up new paths to get her where she needs to go as quickly as you can. Along side her trusty sidearm, you can use the helmet for clearing out enemies and defeating them by trapping them inside the disappearing blocks. Each level is scattered with enemies, bombs, landmines, spikes and other traps. Patricia has limited health, which is displayed as hearts on the screen, though you can re-fill the meter by collecting floppy drives, which apparently she says are \"delicious\". Go figure.  Each hit reduces your health meter by one and restarts you at the nearest checkpoint, while each tasty floppy disk increases it by the same. Losing all your health will cause Patricia to restart the level.\n\nAside from the main levels, there are also bonus stages and \"hyper drive\" levels, which essentially are the original ones, but more difficult to complete. \n\nThere is little else to this game, as it doesn't stray far from the standard puzzle platform elements. I loved it and was glad to have took a chance with it. The game can be a tad frustrating at times with some of the more difficult levels and sometimes your character seems to die from blocks that she isn't touching (when you change their planes of view with her helmet), but other than that I didn't find any issues with the game. It's a solid platformer with limited, but cute voice work and lovely animation. I have a special place in my heart for that \"ugly dog\" as they called it that served as the game's checkpoint system. \n\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n\n[list]\n[*] Animation - I fell in love with the art style and character design.\n[*] Music - I loved the music. It's pleasant, but not distracting. \n[*] Controller support. I always played with one and it always worked fine. I used an XBOX controller.\n[*] Achievements - Most of the achievements aren't terribly difficult with practice and patience except for a couple hard ones.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n\n[list] \n[*] Some complaints have been mentioned for how short the game is, though I felt the length wasn't an issue.\n[*] Replayability - There is some for those looking to 100% the game, though once you do, there won't be much reason to go back to it.\n[/list]\n\n\nOverall, Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition is a fun puzzle platformer with an adorable art style and a moderate learning curve. I loved most everything about it and would recommend it to anyone seeking a new puzzle game to play, It can be tough, but I never felt it dipped into being unfair or frustrating.

Things to keep in mind before you decide to buy this because you will deal with frustration at times like I did.\n\nMy frustration comes from not being able to see far enough to your next destination forcing you to take a leap of faith and memorize through trial and error (a few levels).  The next issue is only having three health (chances) to spawn back from a checkpoint, if I used them up I would have to repeat the entire level all over again which sounds fair but really is frustrating.\n\nJumping, timing, switching is the sum of the game, not much shooting but at times needed. My advice if you do decide to pick this up, wait for a discount.\n\n- 16 campaign levels\n- 5 bouns level                           \n- 16 hyper levels\n- 5 hyper bonus Levels", "timestamp_created": 1453186252, "timestamp_updated": 1453287557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20500352": {"recommendationid": "20500352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022867745", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452997822}, "language": "english", "review": "Proved to be quite a challenge at higher levels, but still pretty damn fun, finished it in one 7 hour sitting\n\nDeliciousThighs/10", "timestamp_created": 1452664308, "timestamp_updated": 1452664308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20499934": {"recommendationid": "20499934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182768942", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452661110}, "language": "english", "review": "Remastered 2d graphics and additional levels to upper the challenge on the game.

Hyper Drive Edition\n\nDurante un tresferimento, delle detenute sono riuscite  a evadere dalla custodia. Per casualit\u00e0 o per premeditazione Il mezzo nel quale le donne si trovavano al momento dell'incidente si \u00e8 ribaltato, a seguito di una esplosione.  Le denute sono ormai delle fuggesche, ricercate, ma non dalla  polizia, non da un agente normale ma da una Pacificatrice ciberneteica di nome Patricia Wagon. Il suo compito non \u00e8 semplice e non \u00e8 breve. La Wagon dovr\u00e0 seguire le loro tracce, in tutto il pianeta, per riuscirle ad arrestare e riconsegnarle nelle mani della giustizia.\nMighty Switch Force ! Hyper Drive Edition \u00e8 il quarto capitolo della serie \"Might Switch Force\", sviluppata dalla software house sud  californiana indipendente, WayForward con sede nella magnifica citt\u00e0 di Valencia.\nQuesto titolo \u00e8 attualmente disponibile per Nintendo Wii U e per PC attraverso Steam, dove \u00e8 integrado con il sistema degli Achievemnt, del Cloud, delle Classifiche, delle Carte Collezionabili e di BigPicture. Infatti Might offre il supporto completo per il controller.\nDopo l'avvio del titolo e l'ingresso nel menu principale dopo le schermate iniziali, si constata senza troppa difficolt\u00e0, che Mighty Switch Force Hyper Drive Edition \u00e8 sviluppato nativamente per supportare il controller. Anche se, avviandol'action puzzle con mouse e tastiera collegati, le icone, mostrano ugualmente la grafica dei controlli delle voci del menu per i controller. Come in quasi tutti i platform, le impostazioni grafiche permettono solo la selezione della risoluzione, la modalit\u00e0 di esecuzione e la luminosti\u00e0.\n\nIl parziale incontro di 2d e 3d\n\nAnche questo titolo, come la quasi totalit\u00e0,  utilizza la vista ortogonale laterale unita alla sezione laterale,  per la rappresentazione dell'ambientazione, suddivisa in tre livelli paralleli. Gli elemetni, compositivi marginali, dei contorni e delle aree sezionate si trovano nel livello uno. Il medesiomo livello nel quale sono posti gli elementi bidimensionali che descrivono l'ambiente costruito e l'ambiente naturale come palazzi, auto, alberi, ponti, piattaforme che sono inseriti di prospetto frontale e laterale. Anche il personaggio, i nemici e gli oggetti con i quali interagiamo sono collocati nel livello uno.\nNel livello due \u00e8 posto lo sfondo di primo grando con edifici, alberi, mentre nel terzo livello \u00e8 posto lo sfondo di secondo livello con lo skyline marginale della citt\u00e0, con montagne nel fondo, con i quali aumenta il senso di profondit\u00e0 dell'ambientazione.\nLa protagonista, come le fuggitive e nemici che si incontrano lungo questa ricerca, sono a differenza dell'ambientazione, tridimensionali, ma  con la posizione obbligata di profilo, che li differenzia, ma allo stesso tempo li unisce con la rappresentazione, in due dimensioni di questa realt\u00e0 virtuale dalle tinte cyberpunk.\n Anche se unisce elementi sci-fi e cyberpunk, l'ambientazione, risulta, poco ispirata e poco varia. Man mano che si avanza, si denotano sono piccoli cambiamente, che riguardano, gli ostacoli e lo sfondo del terzo livello.\n\nUna sirena per controllarli.\n\nIl paesaggio lungo il cammino del nostro inseguimento, non \u00e8 solo pattugliato da esseri cibernetici o mutanti che intantano a farci del amle, ma \u00e8 anche costellato  da ostacoli, che tentano di intralciarci. Questi ostacoli, sono rappresentati da casse di metallo, container con apertura elettronica, blocchi di roccia, muri e celle di lancio. La maggioranza di questi ostacoli pu\u00f2 essere materializzata o disattivata, attraverso l'azionamento della sirena. Con un impulso azionato piagiando sul tasto \"x\", orgina un lampo concentrico, seguito da un suono secco, come un gancio che si chiude, provvede alla funzione descritta. Le casse possono essere utilizzate per raggiungere e catturare una fuggitiva, per oltrepassare fosse con acuminati spuntoni metallici, oppure sono ideali per eliminare alcuni nemici scomodi, basta che il malcapitato si all'interno dei contorni della sagoma trasparente, per materializzare nuovamente la cassa ed eliminare la minaccia, schiacciandola contro il vetro del monitor del giocatore ;D ,  si l'effetto che hanno voluto dare gli sviluppatori \u00e8 questo. Se non si \u00e8 veloci, pu\u00f2 capitare in alcune circostanze di rimanere schiacciati, contro il monitor, in prossimit\u00e0 di questi ostacoli, perch\u00e8 \u00e8 richiesto di giungere su una piattaforma, dalla quale si giunge, solo ad esempio, da tre casse l'una sull'altra, \u00e8 dunque, necessario smaterializzare le casse una per volta. I container elettronici, sui quali si trova il nostro personaggio non si smaterializzano, in alcuni casi \u00e8 necessario attivarli prima di smaterializzarli. Se hanno la spia rossa non si smaterializzano, se \u00e8 verde lo diventano, per cui per raggiungere determinate aree \u00e8 necessario pi\u00f9 volte ripetere queste operazioni, con anche una velocit\u00e0 elevata.\n\nCorrere, saltare, precipitare e schizzare come proiettili.\n\nPatricia, pu\u00f2 correre ( ma con solo una velocit\u00e0 ) e saltare, per superare degli ostacoli, ma non pu\u00f2 accovacciarsi. Questo perch\u00e8 non sono stati posti degli elementi di ostacoli per inserire anche un'altra abilit\u00e0 motoria. In alcuni casi \u00e8 sufficente smaterializzare l'oggetto per passare oltre. Altre aree della citt\u00e0, hanno delle celle di espulsione che si attivano quando il personaggio ci finesce all'interno dopo una smaterializzazione. Nell'istante successivo si aziona, e si viene lanciati o sparati in alto, in basso, a destra e a sinistra. Per avanzare, \u00e8 anche necessario utilizzare una serie di queste celle, che necessitano di molta velocit\u00e0 per essere smaterializzate e materializzate. \n\nLa miglior arma \u00e8 il canto della sirena.\n\nCome gia preannunciato nei paragrafi precedenti, la sirena pu\u00f2 essere utilizzata come arma, con la quale eliminare i nemici, attirandoli nelle cavit\u00e0 del pavimento o del suolo e schiacciandoli con la materializzazione delle casse. Si possono all'insaputa dei nemici, farli capitare nelle celle di espulsione, come ad esempio per le \"bombe camminanti\", che si possono lanciare contro una parete di pietra per romperla e passare oltre. Ma non abbiamo come arma in dotazione solo la sirena, infatti possiamo ricorrere anche a una pistola, che pu\u00f2,  agnentare un nemico, e che  contro quelli corrazzati, li pu\u00f2 spingere verso una cavit\u00e0 nel terreno e schiacciali con le casse materializzate. Durante le pause che si possono verificare per osservare l'area attorno a noi, pigiando il tasto \"c\", possiamo osservare Patricia che si toglie il berretto con la sirena, sfoggiando una lunga capigliatura castano chiaro mossa che gli sfiore le spalle, mentre si passa la mano sulla fronte e si ascuiga il sudore.\n\nCommento.\n\nGraficamente il titolo recensito, si presenta gradevole, la protagonista \u00e8 ben caratterizzata, ma l'ambinetazione risulta, come detto, monotona, poco varia e la nostra Patricia ha alcune limitazioni fisiche. Il titolo punta sulla velocit\u00e0 dell'inseguimento, per cui non troviamo boss da sconfiggere. Completando i vari livelli al di sotto del tempo indicato, si possono sbloccare ad esempio degli aspetti per la protagonista, come la skin rossa  a 32-bit del capitolo precedente. Il che forse pi\u00f2 rendere appetibile il superamento dei tempi di comletamento.\n\nIa recensione la trovate anche qui : http://www.vgnetwork.it/recensioni-pc/mighty-switch-force-hyper-drive-edition-50068/ con i relativi voti, pro e contro.", "timestamp_created": 1452017257, "timestamp_updated": 1452017257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.940886", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20281489": {"recommendationid": "20281489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067636703", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496419496}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I have played in a long time that isn't a sonic game.", "timestamp_created": 1451885711, "timestamp_updated": 1451885711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20249599": {"recommendationid": "20249599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000797544", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453361981}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774\uc804\uc5d0 Wii \uc600\ub098, Wii U\uc600\ub098... \ubb34\uc2a8 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud68c \ube44\uc2a4\ubb34\ub9ac \ud55c \uacf3\uc5d0\uc11c \ud588\uc5c8\ub294\ub370 \ud0ac\ub9c1 \ud0c0\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc88b\uc9c0\ub9cc\n\uadf8\ub0e5 \uc2fc\uae40\uc5d0 \uc0ac\ub294 \ub9db\uc774\ub77c \ud574\uc57c\ud558\ub098... \uba85\uc808\ub0a0 \uce5c\ucc99\ub4e4 \uc2dc\ucf1c\uc8fc\uae30 \uc88b\uc740 \uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1451815851, "timestamp_updated": 1451815851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20223234": {"recommendationid": "20223234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049402635", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488719748}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] This game saved me from shitty \"normie\" MOBAs and competitive Chernobyl [/h1]\n\n[b]This game, this god damn game, threw me back to the good old singleplayer arcade-ish games so much when i found it[/b]\n\nin mid 2014, i found this majestic soundtrack, which had multiple melodic lines and amazing coordinated tunes which reminded me of retro so much i couldn't not look the game up.\nThe game was also retro, puzzle platformer.

Patricia Wagon easily became one of my favorite video game protagonists. Seeing this version on here, I didn't know what to think of it at first. It looked about the same, just with different graphics. I decided to buy it in hopes that I'd be just as satisfied. Thankfully, I was. This version still has the same charm as it's always had. \n\nI'd recommend this game for those who like a challenge. It combines strategy (puzzles) with speed and action.

The music is astounding and fun to listen to as you're completing the levels. \n\nNow\u2014if you've been convinced, of course: go and serve some justice!", "timestamp_created": 1450522532, "timestamp_updated": 1450522532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19597051": {"recommendationid": "19597051", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991875201", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 173, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452068249}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc6b0\uc8fc\uacbd\ucc30?\uc774 \ub418\uc5b4 \ud0c8\uc625\ubc94\ub4e4\uc744 \uc7a1\uc790! \uac89\ubcf4\uae30\uc5d4 \uc561\uc158\uac8c\uc784 \uac19\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e4\uc0c1\uc740 \ud37c\uc990\uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \n\n\ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc561\uc158\uacfc \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \ub9de\uac8c \uc2a4\uc704\uce58\ub97c \ubc14\uafd4\uc8fc\ub294 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uac00 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4. \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uacfc \ubc1c\uc0ac\uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc801\uc808\ud788 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574\uc11c \ub9f5 \uacf3\uacf3\uc5d0 \ud769\uc5b4\uc838\uc788\ub294 \ud0c8\uc625\ubc94\ub4e4\uc744 \uba39?\uc73c\uba74 \ub41c\ub2e4. 10\uc5ec \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0 \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\ud55c \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcfc \ub54c, \ud37c\uc990\uc801 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub294 \uadf8\ub9ac \ub192\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc810\ud504\ub791 \uc2a4\uc704\uce58 \ud0a4\uac00 \uc790\uafb8 \ud63c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \ubc14\ub78c\uc5d0 \uc5b4\uc774\uc5c6\uc774 \uc8fd\ub294 \uc77c\uc774 \ub9ce\ub2e4.

MSF has 16 regular and 5 bonus stages, plus unlockable remixed versions of levels after you clear all the regular and bonus stages.  Game handles well and the controls are simple.  You can jump, shoot, switch and that's it.  You're always at max speed so there's no need to hold a button to run, which is always a plus.  Art is nice and clean and the soundtrack by Jake Kaufman is up-tempo and catchy.\n\nGameplay-wise, there's no fat.  No cut-scenes, no dialogue, no tutorials.  It feels very acadey in this sense, as most levels are designed to be beaten in a couple of minutes and are fairly compact.  There are a few variations to block-switching, but nothing too hard to grasp outside of initially figuring out how red/blue lock blocks work.  I hate red/blue lock blocks.  \n\nEach level's goal is to solve puzzles to find the five hooligan sisters scattered about.  You're not likely to find yourself annoyed at finding a missing sister since the game has a handy \"pointer\" system that directs you in the location of the nearest sister.  It's a simple thing but it helps keep the pace up.\n\nThe only two negatives I can see for this game are length and the last level.  Clearing the 16 normal and 5 bonus stages probably won't take more than 3-4 hours for most people.  The replayability comes from trying to \"low-score\"/speedrun the levels in the fastest amount of time.  If you're into that, you just added a lot of extra gameplay.  You also unlock a sort of easy mode gun by beating the game that lets you play through a number of levels in a different manner. \n\n I'm much more about quality of gameplay over quantity, so I'd definitely rather play a 3-5 hour game that's really fun like MSF than a 12-25 hour game that's kind of okay.  If you have a \"I need x amount of gameplay for every dollar spent\" mentality, you'll probably find yourself cringing at the idea of paying 10 bucks for a short game like MSF, but if you don't think like that, you'll probably be happy with a full price purchase if you like puzzle/platformers.\n\nOnto to the second negative, the last level of both the regular stages and bonus stages are pretty bad and do the terrible video game thing of taking the primary gameplay mechanic of a game and flipping it out its head.  Throughout the game, you have complete control of block switching and playing mostly compact, short stages.  For whatever reason, WayForward thought it was good idea to make the finales really long and with an automated switch mechanic.  There's also much more a focus on fast-twitch platforming and I could see people who are more interested in the puzzle part of puzzle/platformer giving up in frustration.  It also doesn't help that MSF has an archaic life system that really rears its head during the finales.  It's very annoying to get near the end of the level only to suffer a cheap death, and there are truly cheap deaths near the end of the finales, and have to start over from the beginning.  Then again, WayForward had a dumb life system in DuckTales, too.\n\nIn short,\n+ a fun, nice-looking puzzle/platformer with a good soundtrack and replayability if you're into speedrunning levels.\n- the last levels of both the regular and bonus modes are difficult in way the rest of the game isn't, and a short overall play time if you just one-and-done each level.", "timestamp_created": 1436844535, "timestamp_updated": 1436844993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16995507": {"recommendationid": "16995507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010088361", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475518035}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT : Originally, I did not recommended this game for its lack of content (16 missions + 4 bonus stages). I now see there are like twenty more levels I can play.

The artstyle is cute.\n\n- Sound & Musics :\n\nAwesome tunes, Jake Kaufman is a genius.\n\n- Gameplay :\n\nThe mechanics are fun, but underexploited... and in fact, the whole is underexploited. The ideas implemented were good, and it will test your patience & your skill. I would have loved a game with the same kind of mechanics that would go deeper with it.\n\n- Storytelling :\n\nunexistent. Not necessary for this kind of game.\n\n- Length : \n\nNope. This is where the game drops the ball : you have 16 levels you can beat in under 5 minutes, and when you beat the last boss (which is very very easy) you have 5 bonus stages. The game is very very short, and too short for its price, I'd say...\n\nCONCLUSION :\n\nIt's a good game, with some good ideas. But for its length... I'll recommend you wait for it to be on sale. I cannot recommend it with so little content, which is a shame, because the game works and is very fun.\n\n\n...

It's mostly a platforming game although it quickly goes into puzzle territory thanks to its mechanics.\n\nThe story is more of an excuse-plot so you're not going to find a deep storyline here, not like it's really needed though as the gameplay is quite engaging. Basically you're a cop named Patricia Wagon and your objective through 95% of the game is to capture 5 different sexy prisoners scattered across the stage. To do that you have a pellet gun (That is mostly used to break some blocks or detonate bombs) and the ability to switch \"dimensions\" which causes transparent blocks to become tangible and viceversa. The switching is what helps you move through most of the stages and solve puzzles.\n\nControls are quite simple, one button to jump, one to shoot, one to switch dimensions and one extra button you can hold to move the camera and scout the nearby area before moving on. Physics are great and the game is pretty fair when it comes to level design so whenever you lose is mostly your fault although be prepared for the latter stages as you'll need quick reflexes to get through many of the puzzles. Note that unlike most platformers holding or pressing the jump button has no difference, you'll still jump the same height.\n\nThe game has a total of 16 initial stages and upon finishing them you'll then have to go through 5 more bonus stages. If you finish those then another whole batch of 16 stages + 5 bonus stages will become available. Thers are FAR harder versions of the previous batch with remixed music, colors.\n\nThe game looks quite short at first but if you're willing to go towards 100% completion then you can sink 10 hours into it with ease as each stage has a PAR time to beat and beating them all requires you to master the mechanics of the game. In fact, playing the game just to beat it and not caring about the PAR times greatly reduces the overall experience.\n\nWorth mentioning again: The soundtrack is AMAZING.", "timestamp_created": 1436591899, "timestamp_updated": 1436591899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.367580", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16985189": {"recommendationid": "16985189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013424767", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511394820}, "language": "english", "review": "Mighty Switch Force!

There are 42 levels, each with wonderful level design and all can be cleared in under 5 minutes, some in under 30 seconds.  This is one of those games where half the fun is speed running levels and going for the fastest times.

Hyper Drive Edition.  I've only played just over an hour so far, and if the level count is any indication I'm about half way through the incidents (incidents being levels).  I don't know if there is more, but the level count seems a little bit light.\n\nIf I were to summarize the rest of this review I would say this game is very well done, and I think it is a good game, but because of the nature of the game play I don't much care for it.  If I had known what it would be like to play before hand, I wouldn't have bought it.\n\nAt its core, this is a puzzle platformer, which I think is the genre it's tagged as.  It's a very well done game, but I do wish there was a way to distinguish between timing puzzle platformers and other styles.  This one is a timing platformer, with many bits reminiscent of the barrel cannon sequences in the old Donkey Kong Country games.  However, while I enjoyed those back in the day, I'm not a big fan of these ones.  \n\nThe basic controls are that you run, jump and shoot much like you would in something like a megaman game.  However, shooting the bad guys isn't the focus.  The focus comes from a button that switches the state of things on the screen, which you can do whenever you want.  When a thing is switched off it is effectively not there.  If it is switched on it is a platform you can stand on and will block anything from walking past.  If you switch them on while something (including yourself) is standing in front of it, that creature will be killed with an amusing animation of them smashing into the screen of your monitor.  \n\nThe first puzzles you'll come across feature you needing to switch the platforms so that they are physical when you land on them.  This will often need to be done while you're in the air, having jumped from the last platform you switched on.\n\nAnother thing you'll find are launcher blocks.  If anything is standing in front of them when they get turned on that creature (or yourself if it's you) will be launched in the direction of the arrow.  These are the sequences that reminded me of the DK Country barrel cannons and they have come to feature quite prominently.  You need to time your switch changes so that when you're flying through the air you get caught in another launch block that will launch you in the right direction.  Often times your target block is not visible from where you're launching from and you'll either need lightning reflexes, or to try again and again until you get it right.\n\nThere is a system of checkpoints and lives.  You have three \"lives\" when you start, and you can never have more then three.  Each time you get hit you lose a life.  If you land on spikes or activate a block while you're standing in front of it you lose a life and respawn at the last checkpoint.  There are pickups you can find to restore one life heart at a time.  Checkpoints come in the form of little dogs that you walk past, and you can activate then as many times as you wish, but you'll only ever have one checkpoint active at a time.  If you exhaust your \"lives\" you are booted back to the main menu to begin the level again.\n\nAll in all, it is a solid and well made game.  I just don't care for the gameplay, and that is more about me then it is about this game.  If anything I've described sounds like fun to you, you should buy this.", "timestamp_created": 1435728674, "timestamp_updated": 1435728674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16818669": {"recommendationid": "16818669", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992116785", "num_games_owned": 380, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435692929}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun and fast-paced puzzle platformer with a simple tile switching mechanic that gets increasingly complex as the game goes on.

Hyper Drive Edition[/b][/u][/h1]\nFrom the same people who brought Shantae and DuckTales Remastered among other great platforming titles we have Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition. If you are familiar with any of previous titles that should tell that you are in for a good platforming experience. \n\nMighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition is a puzzle platformer with some action elements. While killing enemies is a big part on the game, it focuses a lot more on finding the five Hooligan Sisters on each level and to do that you'll need to smart up and use a combination of thinking and reflexes to finish most levels, which are called Incidents here.\n\n[h1][u][b]Jump, shoot and switch it up![/b][/u][/h1]\nThe controls in this game are fantastic. They are precise, responsive and whenever you get hit or make a mistake you'll hardly feel like it was the game's fault. From jumping to shooting everything is as quick as you can react.\n\nAs the name of the game implies there's a lot of switching here. You do it to activate or deactivate platforms ranging from the common usage to avoid hazard or overcome obstacles to the not so common use of killing enemies by literally throwing them on your screen, but watch out; you can do it to your own self if you are not careful with it.\n\nAs you progress through the game the level becomes harder and more intricate with some of them being really challenging, especially if you are aiming for the Par Time. The difficulty curve is steady but it never feels like it spiked in any level, whenever you are presented with a new obstacle, the game makes sure to give you a chance to test it to understand how it works.\n\n[h1][u][b]For both people looking for a casual experience to people looking for challenges[/b][/u][/h1]\nJust like Mighty Switch Force! Hose It Down!, Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition gives you a nice and gratifying experience when playing the game as you'll feel great when you overcome that puzzle that was getting you stuck. And if that is not enough for you there are Par Time challenges which requires you to finish the level as fast as you can. Most of the Par Times are not very generous and a single mistake will force you to start all over again in a lot of cases.\n\nThere are several other challenges for achievements in specific levels that can be also very difficult to do. Something perfect for those who may think this game is too easy.\n\n[h1][u][b]Hyper Drive exclusive levels[/b][/u][/h1]\nIf beating the Par time isn't enough challenge for you, how about doing it in even harder versions of the levels you just did?\n\nHyper Drive Edition features bonus levels and once you finish them you'll unlock the Hyper version of all levels (i.e: Hard difficulty). Unlike many lazy developers, WayForward changed considerably most of the levels and you'll notice right away as soon as you pick any level to play.\n\nThe game will non-verbally, non-written say the gloves are off by making the very first level, the one you probably laughed at, a good deal more challenging forcing you to use platofrming techniques and finesse in execution that was only demanded from you in the last levels of the game.\n\n[h1][u][b]Graphics and music[/b][/u][/h1]\nMighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition has cartoony graphics of the highest caliber. The animations are fluid and extremely pleasant to the eyes and you can also have the option to turn the protagonist into her older pixel-modeled version which is just as well animated. This shows the carefulness of WayForward's craft and for those who don't know: animation, especially from pixel-art, can be VERY difficult and time consuming to do.\n\nThe music is something worth noting. Jake Kaufman (same composer from Shovel Knight and Shantae series) did an extraordinary job with it, sometimes you may just pause for a moment and forget about that clock ticking just to hear it. Now, how many games does that to you?\n\n[h1][u][b]All in all[/b][/u][/h1]\nThis game is amazing. I've longed to play it since 2013 and had very high expectations from it. Unlike other titles it wasn't a letdown and so far it's been a great experience with its charming graphics and great soundtrack and the good dosage of challenge from level to level.\n\nMighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition is considered one of the finest games of its genre (even though it's quite underrated) and for the right reasons. It's a game that can be difficult but enough to make you go for it even more, not shoo you away.\n\nIf you enjoy platformer with puzzle elements or are looking for the first game of its genre, Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition is definitely worth trying, especially since it's rather cheap.", "timestamp_created": 1435344974, "timestamp_updated": 1480354697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16724241": {"recommendationid": "16724241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093282773", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442487320}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u8131\u8d70\u3057\u305f\u56da\u4eba\u9054\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u51fa\u305b\uff01\n\n\u7a81\u5982\u5927\u7834\u3057\u305f\u8b77\u9001\u8eca\u304b\u3089\u6b21\u3005\u3068\u9003\u3052\u51fa\u3059\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30d5\u30fc\u30ea\u30ac\u30f3\u3092\u8ffd\u3046\u3079\u304f\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u982d\u8133\u5e73\u548c\u4e3b\u7fa9\u8005\u306e\u30d1\u30c8\u30ea\u30b7\u30a2\u30fb\u30ef\u30b4\u30f3\u306f\u30b2\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30e2\u30a2\u4f0d\u9577\u3068\u5171\u306b\u60aa\u304c\u6804\u3048\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u3078\u635c\u7d22\u306b\u5411\u304b\u3046\uff01\u4eca\u3053\u305d\u6b63\u7fa9\u306e\u529b\u3092\u884c\u4f7f\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\n\n\u30d7\u30e9\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u8fd1\u672a\u6765\u7684\u3067\u91cd\u5de5\u306a\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30ef\u30b4\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u306e\u88ab\u308b\u3078\u30eb\u30e1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30a4\u30ec\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u52d5\u3055\u305b\u3066\u4e16\u754c\u3092\uff13D\u306b\u5909\u5316\u3055\u305b\u305f\u308a\n\u6642\u306b\u306f\u3001\u672c\u6765\u306f\u5012\u3059\u3079\u304d\u6575\u3092\u9006\u306b\u6709\u52b9\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u56f0\u96e3\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u307e\u3059\u3000\u982d\u3092\u50cd\u304b\u305b\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\n\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4e2d\u306b\u6d41\u308c\u308bBGM\u306e\u30af\u30aa\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u304c\u9ad8\u304f\u3001\u300cShovel Knight\u300d\u3084\u300cShantae and the Pirate's Curse\u300d\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u3082\u624b\u639b\u3051\u305f\u300e virt \u300f\u3053\u3068\u30b8\u30a7\u30a4\u30af\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30d5\u30de\u30f3\u6c0f\u304c\u4f5c\u66f2\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3000\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\uff01\n\n\u6700\u5f8c\u306b\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306a\u611f\u60f3\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u30ef\u30b4\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u3082\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30d5\u30fc\u30ea\u30ac\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u3082\u30e4\u30d0\u3044Kawaii\u3067\u3059\u3000\u3053\u308c\u3060\u3051\u3067\u3082\u306f\u3084\u4f55\u3082\u8a00\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306f\u7121\u3044\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\n\n\n\u8ffd\u8a18\uff1a\n2015\u5e7407\u670821\u65e5\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u56fd\u3084\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306e\u8a00\u8a9e\u3082\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\n\u300c\u30aa\u30fc\u30a6\u3001\u30ef\u30bf\u30b7 \u30a8\u30a4\u30b4\u30ce\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 \u30e0\u30ba\u30ab\u30b7\u30a4\u30c7\u30fc\u30b9\u3001\u30ef\u30ab\u30ea\u30de\u30bb\u30fc\u30f3\u300d\u306a\u4eba\u3082\n\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u306e\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30d1\u30c6\u30a3\u304b\u3089\u8a00\u8a9e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3092\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306b\u5909\u66f4\u3059\u308b\u3068\u697d\u3057\u304f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\n\nWayForward \u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3055\u3093\u9054\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306b\u611f\u8b1d\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1435342255, "timestamp_updated": 1437569727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701294", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16723554": {"recommendationid": "16723554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016432675", "num_games_owned": 864, "num_reviews": 329, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439327712}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I]  Puzzle Platformer Fans[/i]\n\n[u] Summary: [/u]\n\nWayforward is one of those companies that impress me with pretty much everything they put out lately, and this is no exception. The solid gameplay and fantastic level design and progression is the star here, as the reuse of elements and mix of them up makes every level feel new and interesting. The HD upgrade is definitely appreciated for this 3DS port, and the game runs fantastically on pretty much all levels, and I love the animation quality and the characters designs. Honestly, when it comes down to it, there's not a lot I can really say that really doesn't work for the game as a whole: everything works together to make a solid experience. It's not a GOTY candidate by any means, but it's definitely a game that puts enjoyment as one of its core experiences, and I can't argue against a game for less then 10 dollars that delivered on almost every level. Definitely worth a pickup for the puzzle-platform lover, and even for those who may not like the genre regardless.\n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video First Impressions: http://youtu.be/fy22p7S-Fh4 [/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Gameplay is fantastic all around. Great implementation of controls on top of simple yet solid gameplay makes for an enjoyable experience.\n[*] Level design and progression is done fabulously. Even with using the same mechanics, it changes things up and mixes them around so well that you don't even notice, and the progression curve on that is exactly what you want: not to steep, but not to shallow. The strength off the game.\n[*] The upgraded visuals and animations make the game come to life. I love the designs of characters, and in particular the animations stand out in just me having the character sit there and just enjoy watching them. \n[*] The music is a highlight, complimenting the levels in high energy, and it's clear that the composer knew the game inside and out.\n[*] Game runs rather well overall with no hiccups in performance, and at a high frame rate. What little options that are there is what you need for a game like this.\n[*] Replayability is high with ways to improve your runs time wise.\n[*] Love the inclusion of the old pixel sprite as a playable character. \n[*] All of the above is combined well together, and nothing distracts from any other element.

It's a simple mechanic that is all done with the press of a button but as you progress the stages and blocks become more varied and difficult. When switching blocks the others that are already physical will disapear, some blocks are needed to be used as cannons and some can be altered by stepping on them. The puzzles won't leave you stumped but do excpect some challange. The game is more about it's arcade like time attack then it's puzzle solving and nothing illustrates this point more than the superb soundtrack created by Jake Kauffamn (Virt) who creates a highly intense, hyperactive 16 bit score a kin to the Megaman series. (seriously go get his album it's even free on his website but give him something you won't regret it).\n\nThe PC version throws away the pixel art from clean animatied sprites and a much higher resolution that makes the stages pop with colour and vibrance in a techno city.

You play a  futuristic cop out to arrest some... strangly cute convict ladies, though to be honest the game is very light on story and you pretty much have to look it up online for more details, a bit like an old skool game. This platformer's levels are short and sweet, with light puzzle game elements and a mechanic to make platforms in set postions appear and disappear, to jump on, launch or crush enemies with (or yourself!). The latter half of the game requires quick decisions and reactions, but the overwhelming majority of the game is fair, with deaths being more down to your mistakes than any cheapness. \n\nThere's plenty of adjustment settings to choose from in terms of sound levels and game resolution. The menus level select you use is almost like phone games such as angry birds, but dont worry! That's a good thing and a deliberate design choice, as once you play the levels through the first time your next goal will be trying to finish each as fast as you possibly can. The replay value is a bit like Super Meat boy only less brutal.... mostly...\n\nThe dance music used on this game adds a hell of a lot, often making you want to go faster than is safe to do so if you really get into it. I'm kinda curious how the experience would be with all music turned off.\n\nThe only thing that might mess with some people is Virt's music in this game. If you like platformers, my advice here is check the soundtrack online to see if you like the style of that too, if it sounds like your kind of thing go for it! If not then... turn the music off I guess?\n\nMighty Switch Force all in all is an either love it or hate it kind of game.

Checking the Steam store everyday in hopes to see it. And the day has finally arrived! I'm a fan of Wayforward's Shantae series so I was eager to jump into their other games.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nIn Mighty Switch force, you play as the aptly named Patricia Wagon after what appears to be a prison transport vehicle crashes and releases all of these blonde female prisoners in short shorts, miniskirts, and low cut dresses. And taken from both the background and the stages itself, the game appears to take place in a dystopian like universe or more like the Chemical Plant zone from Sonic 2\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nThe game is in short, is a puzzle platformer. As you progress through levels, you use Patricia's ability to alter reality, bringing blocks and other items in existance and taking others out. All the while, capturing the escaped prisoners and taking out the occasional baddie with your laser pistol. You aren't actually given a tutorial and your just thrown right into the game after starting the first level and getting a quick cutscene that stages the story. Patricia can only take three hits, so if those three hearts get depleted, it's back to the stage selection screen for you. Fortunately, you can restore her health by eating...floppy discs? She says yum so she must be eating them for whatever reason. \n\n[u]Levels[/u]\nAll the levels are rather unique, introducing a new mtheod to solving puzzles with each stage, along with an amazing soundtrack that are unique to each individual stage. And each stage having a bit of replayability due to their being a par time to see how fast you can complete it. And after playing a few levels, it seems rather difficult to accomplish, at least from my perspective.\n\n[u]Artstyle[/u]\nI felt like I needed to mention this. I can't get over Wayforward's artstyle and feeling the need to praise it whenever given the chance. It's phenomenal.\n\n[u]Negatives[/u]\nThere are a few bad things to say about this title, as I mentioned before there's no tutorial. Whether you see this as a good thing or a bad thing, it's entirely opinion. But I honestly prefer some sort of introduction to Patricia's ability to bend reality. Granted there are few controls so not much to get upset over. And there really isn't much of a story which I think is rather unfortunate considering that their Shantae series is brimming with life and a story with witty dialogue that's sure to be remembered. While the only dialogue you'll be getting here is \"Justice is Served\" or \"Checkpoint\"! \n\n[u]Verdict[/u]\nIt's a honestly a rather fun enjoyable game that's easy to jump right into.

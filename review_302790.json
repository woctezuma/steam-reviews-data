solid game and it costs about 2 euros so i can't recommend enough giving it a try, i kindo think it is going to be short tho, because i played about 1 hour and i'm at 50% completion, so keep that in mind.\nThe bosses in this game are very well made, they remind me of Mega Man, and the gameplay feels intuitive and fluid, it has secrets sprinkled around the map and the music is how PewDiePie put it in his wisky video \"very nice\".\nI was disspointed when i got to play shovel knight, i didn't like it that much, but this is what i have wanted for a long time.\n\nA platformer that is, very cute, and really good.

it before Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. i feel like the lower price tag may be incentive to do that. even if you go in expecting it to be lesser than a sequel just to get a taste, it still doesn't hint at the huge gap in quality between the two games. that being said, this game's short length and overall quality still makes it a fun game to check out after being spoiled by Momodora 4. it's a blast of charming platformer fun with that same unique Momodora world that doesn't overstay its welcome. this is for the best, because the mechanical design is already somewhat limited. things like the bosses stick out like a sore thumb, with barely any attack patterns and feeling like an obligation rather than an inspired part of the experience. anyway, it's a very likable game. just try and play Momodora 4 first, in case you find this one a little too insubstantial.", "timestamp_created": 1508689940, "timestamp_updated": 1508689940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0,

The gameplay was fine but more of the same and I found a way to break it without really trying. So I just played on hard cause there wasn\u2019t a normal mode. I got the items that increases damage when you have low health, make your charge attack longer, and add poison to your charge attack to kill every boss within seconds pretty much. Sound and Music is nothing special. The visuals are really good though, everything is really pretty to look at. It\u2019s a quick game but there\u2019s tons of secrets I guess, I didn\u2019t find any I don\u2019t think but I would want to go back and play it again to find them while trying a new playstyle, so replayability is good.

Great art and animation, very atmospheric music. Generic story, horrible gameplay.\n\n\nAs for the story, makes no sense, is not properly telegraphed to the player, no reason for it to be there really. The game is also sexist technically. Every character is female, not a single male human character. Why, probably because none of the developers were homosexual, so what pubescent wants to devote time to something that isn't a waifu candidate for them.\n\n\nOn the gameplay side.\n\nYet another two dimensional game where touching, some, enemies hurts the player. So in a game where the player can only attack with short range melee, and both the player and many enemies move quite fast, you also take full damage if you touch the enemy. Some enemies, most enemies. It's great, when half the difficulty is trying to hit a target that is running at you while you run towards it without simultaneously ever making direct contact with it.\n\nSome other random obnoxious elements include, having to skip through a bosses dialogue every time you go to fight it. Having to fight a boss then complete another area all without saving. Having it so that dying flat resets the players progress back to the last checkpoint, this including boss fights, item pick ups and mini boss fights. Having a secret alternate entrance to a boss fight, the secret entrance having multiple possible ways to get into it all but one leading to instant death. This secret entrance, when you finally get into it after over ten minutes of trial and error; and replaying the map to get back to that point, literally leads the player to a boss they will fight if they just progress two more screens ahead; these screens not even having any real threats in them anyways. \n\nWhat a pointless, stupid waste of time that was. What was the actual point developer, you made a shortcut to a boss which skips the player over a checkpoint in the process; this shortcut requiring obscene effort to use even though it handicaps the player. Whoever designed that, incompetent. Utterly incompetent. Should not be a game developer.\n\n\n\nIn general, the best way to play this game is to equip the item that heals for each kill, equip the item that increases defense and invulnerability frames; and then just rush spam everything. That's it. Not only does it work, but it is more effective then actually trying to be methodical because so many obstacles spam the player and require stupid amounts of precision and luck to counter; it's better to just ram through them with invulnerability frames while healing from the kills.\n\n\nMany enemies have very little telegraphs for their attacks, many enemies have projectiles with hyper tracking, many enemies have attacks with oversized hit-boxes. It is so overbearing, it's better to just spam through. This works, and is highly suggested, for beating the final boss as well because they are literally just all of the above in boss form.\n\nProbably the best part is the bosses. They have either one attack, or two attacks. Fighting them is literally just trial and error pattern memorization mixed with human error. Better yet, almost all of them are generic humans. Better yet, the humans are so small; the players attacking visual effect is so large, and the bosses damage recieve splash effect is so large; while attacking the boss it's almost impossible to see it. So you can't even tell when it starts attacking, which often it has little telegraph for anyways, because all the visual effects block it. Bosses also have so much health, and the player attacks so fast that mashing the button is mandatory to fight bosses. Which again, constantly keeps the fighting particle effects active which constantly obscures the actual boss besides being spammy and annoying to uphold in general.\n\n\n\nWasn't fun, at all, because the options are; play recklessly and actually progress through shear brute force, or try to be methodical and actually fight but take triple more damage because the combat system is spammy so not spamming back just leads to you getting hit a whole lot.\n", "timestamp_created": 1503499643, "timestamp_updated": 1503499643, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.089820", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34407988": {"recommendationid": "34407988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261620635", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506086016}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7f8e\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u5f88\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6d41\u7a0b\u5f88\u77ed\u4e0d\u8fc7\u51b3\u5b9a\u503c\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u94b1", "timestamp_created": 1503374564, "timestamp_updated": 1503374564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34368427": {"recommendationid": "34368427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060900573", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503218035}, "language": "english", "review": "Cheap and short, you can play through this in 20 minutes or less if you just run through it but the first time around you I guess an hour.

If you wish, however, you can spend the $2 to get this game.\n\nI got Momodora III because I was very interested in getting Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight and I wanted to try out this game first. While I am still interested in getting Reverie Under the Moonlight and I DO recommend this game, it didn't feel like anything that spectacular at times.\n\n[b]Combat:[/b] The combat is very basic and apart from spamming your melee attack or shooting a few ranged attacks, there's not much you can do in terms of combat.\n[b]Characters:[/b] The characters weren't that memorable because they are introduced very quickly and are rather rushed. The story isn't a key part of this game, however, so that can pass.\n[b]Soundtrack:[/b] While the soundtrack to this game isn't as amazing as Shovel Knight's or Undertale's, I enjoyed it. The music was, at times, very relaxing. My favorite track was the track to the final level in [spoiler]Hell. The music makes you feel so utterly depressed and pointless. It went extremely well with the snowy and barren landscape and it really asks the question- What is Hell really like? Is it the sensation of burning with other lost souls or is it a cold, lonely landscape that you can never escape?[/spoiler]\n[b]Bosses:[/b] Most of them weren't really that interesting or engaging. The combat is very basic so it the bosses can all be defeated the same way.\n[b]Artstyle:[/b] The artstyle is extremely cute and I really love it. The enemy and NPC designs are very cute and unique and I love it. This is probably the greatest part of the game. This is probably what compels most players.\n\nAlthough I've been complaining a lot, my final complaint is about the final level. I put a spoiler notice when I talked about it before, and I'll do that again.\n\n[spoiler]The level in Hell felt kind of ruined by all the random monsters and the boss encounter before the final boss, the Goddess of Death. I felt like the level would have gotten its point across a lot better if it had been without monsters and had been the player simply walking alone through a bare landscape. I personally think it would have been better played out if the player just walks by themself through a landscape with, perhaps, dead monsters or NPCs appearing on the ground in a few select spots. When they reach the final boss, they kill them and the game ends. But, then again, this is just me being picky.[/spoiler]\n\nOkay, so... What did I enjoy about the game?\nWell, I thought the atmospheres were very nice and, like I said before, I thought the soundtrack was very relaxing. The NPCs were, while rushed in their introductions, at least likeable. The game doesn't give you a defined purpose, which is nice. You can make any predictions or guesses, which I wish more games would do sometimes. You can also occasionally find secret items, which I wish there had been more focus on. The game feels like 25% of a Metroidvania style game. The artstyle is, as I said before, wonderful. You can tell the developer obviously put a lot of time into it and that's what I admire most about the game.\n\n\nOverall...\nSure, I would recommend Momodora III. No, it's not the greatest game I've ever played, but it's worth playing and is a nice way to pass an hour or two when you're bored.\n6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1500996045, "timestamp_updated":

Having played through the first two one after the other I was excited to see how 3 would improve on 2 considering the huge jump in quality from the first to the second but I feel like that didn't happen here. \n\nPros: \nx Dora is cute! \n\nx The animations are very nice, definitely better than the previous two\n\nx The colors are very vivid and areas a lot more varied than before\n\nx Multiple bosses instead of just an endgame one\n\nx Having bosses do dark souls-y large, damaging but telegraphed attacks is neat, though I feel like it doesn't work like it's supposed to\n\nCons: \nx Almost entire removal of all metroidvania elements. No more map or hidden health items, or a secret thing you have to get to get the good ending\n\nx Around halfway or 3/4 through the game I got sick of it and decided to just rush through everything to progress...and it worked\n\nx Holding S to shoot feels a lot more awkward than pressing up S, which made me rarely want to use projectiles (though perhaps this was on purpose?)\n\nx I found that most bosses could easily be beaten by just standing next to them and spamming attack while tanking any damage...and this is on the normal difficulty\n\nx It feels like I missed a lot but apparently I got 89% completion so I guess not! Though seeing the npcs again definitely would've made things less confusing \n\nx No more upgrades like double jump or dash, just items that I feel like didn't so much to mix things up when equipped\n\nx Explosions kill you in one hit! This is a bit hard to get used to when they are normal attacks for some enemies\n\nx Money bounces obnoxiously and falls through platforms, making it difficult to get all of it unless you waste an item slot on the money magnet\n\nx The last boss felt pretty anticlimactic, I only figured they must be the last one while I was fighting them because they had multiple forms\n\nx Reaaaaaaaally bad framerate drops for little reason.

It is the third game in the Momodora series, but you do not have to play the other Momodora games first. I recommend you buy Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight instead of this game if you haven't played it. Reverie under the Moonlight is the fourth game in the series, but it's a prequel and doesn't require you to have played the others. If you've already played Momo IV (or it doesn't interest you), then I recommend you play the first two Momodora games first. They're free; play them first! Now onto actually talking about Momodora III.\n\nMomodora III's combat system is a lot like the system in Momodora II. The combat system mainly consists of melee attacks. Enemies also drop money which you can use to buy items to improves your character. The 'ceremonial fabric' item is incredibly overpowered, especially in hard mode, so don't use it because it will ruin the experience. The combat feels much better than in Momo II. The gameplay is fun, and the bosses are cool. It's a little easy at times, but I definitely still found it enjoyable. The game's graphics are very nice and colorful. The music is good too. My biggest complaint is the game's story. It features some NPCs I liked, but there's no real point where the story is explained to the player. Towards the beginning, you meet a girl named Mariel; she is the only way the story is explained in the game. You should know this so you don't spend 1/2 the game waiting for a proper exposition. The steam page does a better job at telling you the story than the actual game. There is an online manual (http://www.rdein.puyovs.net/manual.html). If you go there, you can read the story and about the characters; I recommend you read it before you play. Momodora III was pretty short and didn't feel like it had a real beginning, middle, or end. The game is linear (like Momo 1 but unlike 2 and 4). There are lots of secrets, and getting all the achievements is fun and not too hard. I recommend it if you've played 1 and 2 and enjoyed 2. Personally, It's worse than 2, but it's still fun and improves on a lot of things which weren't the greatest in 2.

Castlevania that I have found to be really enjoyable. There are a total of 6 levels that should take 5 to 10 min. to complete, each have their own enemies and boss battles. You only have 2 attacks in the game, a standard slashing move and a charge attack. Both seem to do the same amount of damage so it ends up your strategy on how to take out enemies. \n\nThroughout the levels you will come across chests that will give you currency to buy items from a shop that can give you an edge in combat. You will get currency by defeating enemies (certain enemies drop more than others).  There are some secret areas as well as a level that will give you special items or a lot of currency. \n\nSo if you want a Castlevania inspired game with good level design and no BS enemy placement that can take you around an hr. to beat I recommend this game.

I'm not too sure on the story, but again, I haven't played Momodora I or Momodora II. So maybe those games cover the pieces. You actually do meet Kaho from Momodora IV (and presumably, an earlier Momodora?) and help her with some shenanigans. There's a mini-story where you can save/kill a fellow Kahonese pilgrim. I usually try to save her but I'm not the best at beating the bee boss so of my three play-throughs I only saved her on my 37 minute run. \n\nGraphics are simplistic but nice. Enemies can be a pain. Especially the ones with bombs. I think bombs do damage every frame after they explode, so I got instagibbed by bombs a few times without realizing what was happening. What annoyed me the most is that when you attack, you're locked in place. Playing games in... the current year, in almost every game I've ever played I've been able to move and attack at the same time or at least to some degree. There's also no roll button which I tend to favor over jumps (because muh invulnerability frames). \n\nSo Momodora III feels like it was designed to be a speedrun game. It has six bosses (if I recall correctly) and it can easily be finished within an hour. My first playthrough took me... 1 hour? The second 37 minutes and the last, an hour again. Just depends on which bosses ruin your day. A perfect run can likely be done within 20 minutes, including the time travel section. The characters have limited interaction, though there seems to be a bit of a sidequest if you want the \"good\" ending. I won't spoil the endings, but I will say that there's not much of a difference in terms on content and it's pretty easy to get both endings in a single play session. \n\nOverall, the game wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. I did genuinely get engaged in some of the boss fights even if I was annoyed that I had no roll button. The game's a little too easy though. You can obtain an item that doubles your damage shortly after the first boss and you can increase your basic attack's damage after the fourth boss. I don't feel like the enemy setups are terribly interesting and at some points seemed outright unfair. I'd say that this is a case of you get what you pay for. It's a $2 game (at the time of writing). It's worth it. It certainly makes the sequel seem far more valuable in comparison.", "timestamp_created": 1484226501, "timestamp_updated": 1484226501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428647", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29072250": {"recommendationid": "29072250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080565172", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483749603}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Momodora \u00e9 1 Indie game estilo Metroidvania com uma bela Pixel Art e uma OST cativante.

It was mapped to X or Y, Tho i changed it to a shoulder button, so i could change them in battle,\neasilly, Dont get me wrong, i only did this in the final boss, and even then, it was probably still kinda unnecesary, and pretty much nothing else, Im not saying its bad, Simple can be fun, and if it still is refreshing, it pushes the industry further, tho i will talk more on that later.\n\n\nPros:\n-The combat against normal enemies is fun, and if you really have good control over your characters movement, you can pass them and just run, and take very few hits.\n-You can pick from two characters: I mean, they dont change at all in gameplay, but its nice.\n-Multiple difficulty settings: You have Casual, which, really? for seeing the story? there isnt much story, and its not like the game is that hard in Easy, that i would call normal, Start here, And hard, that i would call madness, you take TWICE the damage, and have 3/5 of your health in easy, The first boss kills you in 2 hits.\n-New game+: When you get certain ending, you can play new game+, Is cool, you keep items from previous play, (Except for the keys) and have another item slot, that, ill say its pretty unnecessary.\n-Beautifull pixel art, and soundtrack\n-The bosses are GREAT, but...\n\nCons:\n\n-The bosses are fun until you get the pattern, the dont telegraph their attacks, they just repeat the 2 or 3 attack they have eeevery time, The final boss is an exception, beacuse it has various phases, but overall meh.\n-Some of the achievements feel stupid, they arent necessarly bad, but feelm i wont talk much beacuse i dont have a food answer, just how i feel.\n-The game is kinda short, i mean, I love short games, mainly beacuse i abandon the long ones, Not beacuse i dont have time, its just that if feel burned out, But even then it felt short, I wanted more.\n-A few enemy and trap placement kill you in one thing, and that is kinda dickish.\n\nOverall i really liked the game, and even if it isnt that original, its great for 2 dollars, The two first Momodoras are free on the web, and im aiming for triying them, and im also aming for the sequel, Reverie Under The Moonlight, Probably going to use some christmas money on it and other titles i wanna play.\n\nEDIT: One of the tags is anime, And apart from the artwork... what why how who, the game is cute, not anime, or atleast thats my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1481294195, "timestamp_updated": 1481294299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28229678": {"recommendationid": "28229678", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970992996", "num_games_owned": 614, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481079094}, "language": "english", "review": "it's a pretty fun game and the art is pretty cute, but unless you take your time (which you won't for reasons i won't specify), it can be quite short (15 minutes short), especially depending on the way you play it.\n\nit's also a massive improvement on momodora, although i wouldn't necessarily call it an \"improvement\" on momodora ii as they're quite different games.\n\nanyway, it's really cheap, so why not.", "timestamp_created": 1481079544, "timestamp_updated": 1481080274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28222844": {"recommendationid": "28222844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198234053152", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508426958}, "language": "english", "review": "Momodora 3 was a very short game.

I don't remember any of the bosses either now, actually. It has the standard structure of every 2D platformer ever made. it tries to have a little bit of everything, but it all averages out to a mediocre experience.

The controls are simplistic to grasp at; you have your standard movement, slash button, charge for special attack, and menu buttons to equip accessories you find during your playthrough. \n\nThe game allows you to choose two characters, which does not seem to affect the already bare-boned story that's in place. For anybody that's played a platformer, the controls, mechanics, and gameplay are self-intuitive; avoid obstacles/, take damage from foe on contact, slash foe X amount of times to kill, falling off = death, respawn at last checkpoint. The usual. At certain points throughout the game, you are required to battle a boss monster, which has a health bar quite larger than your normal NPCs. The bosses start simple with singular attack patterns and develop more as you progress during the game, never becoming overly complex, and easily readable after two-three tries. \n\nThe platforming component was fairly simplistic; no overtly complicated tricks or puzzles, just regular platforming, trying to ensure that you don't die or else you'll respawn at your last checkpoint. Some enemy placements right in front of cliffs cause for a slightly frustrating time for the impatient player, but nothing that isn't easily overcomeable. Basic, average, but smooth/tight. Meets a standard.\n\n[u]Immersion[/u]\nThe music, background, and artwork are eye-catching and immersive with the layering of images to create a more deep environment. The lasting power isn't much and the visuals are likely not to be remembered beyond the first few days after playing the game.\n\n[u]Summary[/u]\nOverall, I was able to play through the game twice in less than 2 hours. The game doesn't require much for a 100% completion, and there isn't much playability after the first playthrough except for completion purposes.

Soundtrack isn\u00b4t any special either but it does do the job well, it gets the right mood corresponding with the current level.

To summarize it all, i enjoyed the game a lot but i was sort of dissapointed by the fact that the game is so short.

Granted, don't go in expecting the breadth and depth of gameplay and challenge that something like Cave Story offers. This is a short but sweet platforming experience that will net you a handful of playthroughs if you follow the typical pattern of doing a blind playthrough, one masochistic hard run and then focusing on getting the reasonable achievements. \nThe graphics are pleasant and nostalgic, the soundtrack is particularly fantastic and the gameplay is tight and satisfying. \n\nIn terms of the story these are the games that appeal to me the most, ones that don't shove the entire plot into the players face from the get go and instead leave the player initially clueless, requiring them to explore, speak to NPC's that offer snippets of information in a natural way, read item descriptions, etc. Truthfully there is very little substance here storywise, which is expected from a game this short, but it leaves plenty of room for the player to draw their own conclusions and just generally muse on the characters and the state of the world, which helps fill the time while you're flying through the levels mercilessly slaughtering anything that isn't a friendly NPC with your leaf. \n\nMy one caveat is while the boss fights are varied in both the designs and attack patterns, it's simply too easy to stand next to them and continuously wail on them until they die. Certainly this becomes more difficult on hard due to having less health or by not using certain items but it's still feasible. Granted some of the bosses move regularly and in a way that mitigates this but they could have all used an extra attack that heavily punishes standing still and continuously spamming. The addition of a flying boss that forced the player to fully utilize their ranged attack with small windows of opportunity for melee damage would have been beneficial in the sense of adding some diversity and increasing the value of certain items for at least one boss fight. Regardless, all the boss fights were reasonably enjoyable. \n\nAll in all if you are a fan of platformers, you'll enjoy this and for the price there is really no excuse for not trying it.

You have discrete levels, but can teleport back and forth between them at any save point. At the end of each, a boss awaits. Not only are these powerful enemies more frequent than in prior entries, they have much more interesting patterns and better hit detection. They're more fair, and much more fun.\n\nWhile it lasts, this is a top-tier game, but it's extremely short. Though no platforming master, I was able to beat the easier scenario in under three hours.

Overall it's a great journey and if Momo3 is your first, grab 1 and 2 (like many have said before me) before you consider buying 4 just to get the full experience.

Despite its simplicity and brevity, [i]Momodora III[/i] positively throngs with variety; the painterly vistas, fine chiptune soundtrack, and whimsical enemy roster are constantly shifting, and there are even a couple side-missions wedged in there -- one of which is a hidden boss, no less!  The story of this and the other games interlock, but the narrative is still fairytale-vague; there's enough detail for atmosphere and series branding, with the rest left up to your imagination.  That's fine with me, though.  I've always loved the \"rustically cosmic\" viewpoint of fairytale and myth, and if it's good enough for me, it's good enough for you!\n\nThe physics were okay in the previous games, but one thing I really love about [i]Momodora III[/i] is that Dora and Momo have a real sense of weight to go with their speed this time around.  They don't hop in unswerving Castlevanian trajectories or anything, but there's a fine heft to their little pixel bodies.  You feel like you are actually steering kawaii lumps of tireless, monster-bashing meat, not flicking around passionless digital ghosts that would feel perfectly satisfied in either state of inertia.  This game has nailed it where too many indie platformers falter!\n\n[i]Momodora III[/i] is the very model of a low-cost neoretro platformer.

I was expecting this to end before it will even begin. What I've got in reality changed my view on simplicity, and made me fan of these series already feeling like a kid in front of NES once again. \n\nLets start with things which welcomed me in first place. Momodora 3 gives a warm heartful feeling instantly when you see it in motion, amount of details put into pixel art is great here. These are very simple details like: bowing when you interact with shrines, or dirt appearing when you fall from greater distances stunning you for a second. Game is complex with amount of items, secrets, locations and all these are changing the play-style. Although everything ends up quick I cannot say bad word about it. I was trying to get angry on hardest difficulty when I was diyng like garbage. But I couldn't, just the opposite.

In hard mode, you die in 2 hits. You have to play carefully and strategically. The level design means you have to stay on your toes and can't cheese everything, even when you've unlocked some powerful item combos - with the exception of the 5x damage item, which serves as an easy mode for boss fights and can be avoided to preserve the challenge. \n\nMomodora 3 brings nothing spectacularly new, but it delivers a memorable good time for very cheap.

Momodora reminds me a lot of Cave Story, and in a good way. Like Cave Story it uses pixel graphics to paint a beautiful and varied enviroment, has a great soundtrack, tight controls and people refer to it as a metroidvania for some bizarre reason. I never understood that line of reasoning: Metroid is a metroidvania, Castlevania: Symphony of The Night is a metroidvania, Bunny must die is a metroidvania, Cave Story is an Action Platformer with some light exploration elements and so is Momodora III. Having said that, like Cave Story it is a good Action Platformer with some light exploration elements, it's also fairly challening. Oh yes, by the end of the game I was certainly no stranger to the purple-haired lady on the Game Over screen. Fortunately the game offers three difficulty options: Casual, Easy and Hard. This coupled with shops, pickups and plenty of hidden treasure means that the player has all of the means possible to make the game as easy or hard for themselves as they want.\n\nAt first, the story in Momodora III seems mostly non-existant. You spawn in front a small shrine and you go on to steal a key to open a door to move on, there isn't even so much as a quick exposition for the player. There's a quick description of the backstory in the manual along the lines of: \"Demons from hell are attacking your village, go do something about it.\" but it really doesn't give much. However, there's definitely a greater narrative in the works and there are a lot of things going on that the player is never shown unless they go through the effort to look for it. Maybe there's more in the previous games that would help the player understand what's going on, I honestly don't know.\n\nThe game has two playable characters: Momo and Dora. As far as I can tell there really isn't any difference between the two of them gameplay-wise. Okay so, playing as Dora gets you a shop where there normally wouldn't be one for Momo but the item sold can be gotten for free in the very next level, so why even bother?\n\nOverall though, I don't have anything real bad to say about Momodora. Well... okay except for one thing: It's short. I mean Really short. The game can be completed in about 30 minutes and that's counting side quests. My first playthrough clocked in at a little over half an hour I believe (not counting time between deaths). Although, depending on your point of view this could be a good thing, The game is great for speedrunning and even if it's only 30 minutes it is definitely 30 quality minutes with nice graphics and a beautiful soundtrack.\n\nIf this sounds up your alley I can definitely recommend Momodora III.", "timestamp_created": 1454775207, "timestamp_updated": 1454775207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20965447": {"recommendationid": "20965447", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965669165", "num_games_owned": 834, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458148409}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't play the others Momodora, yet.\nBut after playing this one I really want to get familiar with the background.

My friend suggested it to me, and having both beaten and enjoyed it, I can say that it was worth the price.\n\nMomodora III is an action platformer, pure and simple. No puzzles, no fetch quests, no level system: just action and platforming. The player is given two different characters to choose from, along with a wide variety of upgrades and power-ups hidden throughout. The gameplay is simple, but effective.\n\nIt's the style of the game, however, that really makes Momodora worth playing. The simplistic 8-bit graphics are vibrant and well-animated, with lush, ethereal environments to explore.

It falls short on some aspects but, overall, it's really enjoyable and worth the price.[/b]\n\nAs many have already mentioned, this game looks heavily influenced by cave story, so if you enjoyed it, you might want to give this a try.\n\nHowever, despite looking a lot like it, this game isn't as good as cave story. I loved this game, but I'll start with the cons.\nThe history is generic, the characters are not that unique, the 2 playable characters are exactly the same (same attacks, health, everything) and the game is really short (took me around 1 hour to clear it for the first time). Not to mention that most of the bosses only have 2 attacks and huge HP, so it gets boring. \n\nNow that I got that out of the way, let's get to why I do recommend this game. It may be a simple game, but the price is fair for what it has to offer, and it's really fun. There are 3 difficult levels: Casual, Easy and Hard (casual can be skipped, since the health regen it's absurd to the point that not even the last boss can outdamage it). Some events can be triggered with different actions, so you will most likely lose something on your first playtrough, giving it more replay value. The level design is not that impressive, but it's good and there's a couple of hidden passages that you may miss if you don't pay attention. For the completionists, it's also easy to get every achievement.\n\nIf you want to try Momodora I and II before playing this you can get it for free on this site: http://www.bombservice.com/games.html\n\nAs far as I know, rdein is a brazilian developer and momodora is one of his first games, which is really impressive considering the quality of this game, so I'll certainly be looking forward to his next games.", "timestamp_created": 1451846803, "timestamp_updated": 1497906877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496436", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20239736": {"recommendationid": "20239736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095983534", "num_games_owned": 942, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512596404}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomiendo este juego porque a mi me pirran las plataformas, mucho, siempre escucho a mis colegas o amigos cuando de juegos plataformeros se refiere y, adem\u00e1s, dif\u00edciles; dif\u00edciles de esto que romper\u00edas el mando si no llega a ser porque lo quieres mucho (y no podr\u00edas comprarte otro).\nTeniendo en cuenta mis gustos, no es de extra\u00f1ar que recomiende este juego, porque tiene justo eso: Buenas plataformas y una dificultad incre\u00edble.

But for all that, I find myself wondering if my time and money were well spent - its short length (less than 2 hours on my first playthrough, on Hard) isn't a negative by default, but Momodora's gameplay is soulless.\n\nThere's plenty of classic platformers around Momodora's length, but these encourage careful progress, skillful play and an understanding of stage layout and enemy behavior. In short, they're worth revisiting, and become more satisfying when one understands its intricacies. One quickly realizes that Momodora doesn't ask for anything so strenuous. Here, players can just make a mad dash for the next healing point (3 screens away, guaranteed), save, and do it again until the end. Stages and enemy placement and behavior are as simplistic as they come, and bosses attack slowly (usually with one heavily telegraphed attack). There is no difficulty curve - if you can get through the first five minutes, you'll make it to the end.\n\nSo Momodora will take less than two hours of your time, and less than five dollars out of your pocket. You'll see some pretty pixel graphics and have a soothing soundtrack (in ogg format) stashed in the game files, but the game you play will probably be forgotten by the time you head to the toilet. Is it worth it? The obvious wasted potential poisons the experience of the game itself - this could have been quite good, but when the credits came around I wondered if the developer was more interested in making the assets than the game. I recommend against it - I have enough games in my library that I certainly could have spent the time on better games.

On more than one occasion I would fall off a single-block ledge because there is a very slight ice-slidy stop, but it's nothing frustrating, Unlike the explosions. I hope whoever designed the bombthrowers and bomb-fish be put in time out for making them a one-hit kill. The bosses are rather simple, but still very snazzy, particularly the badass Bell Keeper.\n\nThe graphics and sound are, as you can imagine, designed to be cutesy and endearing, and indeed they are quite the squee material, but there is a sort of brutal, almost tragic honesty to bits of this game. The death screen is particularly egregious: a shriek, a flash of red, and a cut to black. Yikes. Several other aspects of the world, spoilers notwithstanding, had an impact that speaks a volume of the game's bittersweet style with barely any words.\n\nAs for length, I will say frankly that this game is very short. The mere three hours I have were all it took to complete every achievement(yes I was playing on easy, shut up). I was kind of begging for a \"normal mode\", as there was either easy, hard, or casual. Maybe some of the difficulties might be Japanified.\n\nThis is a great game, its style is something I would like to see more of(even in the game itself, incidentally).

As the name says this is the third Momodora game but the only one to be released on Steam while the previous two installments can be downloaded and played for free. In this game you play as Momo or Dora, two priestesses sent to investigate events surrounding the village of KoHo.\n\nTo start of, this is one of those games that can\u2019t be judged by cost. Most people might think of this game as a below-average indie platformer but they are in for a surprise. Momodora III is one of the best hidden gem platformers I have played in recent years along with Cave Story.\n\nOne of biggest attractions of Momodora III is the simple pixelated graphics which I am biased towards so my opinion of the graphics will differ from the you, the reader. The environments of each stage are polished to the brim and each stage has its own unique atmosphere conveyed to you by its appearance and enemies. The character sprites look top notch for a 2D game and each enemy is graphically different from the other. Though there isn\u2019t much dialogue in the game, the designs of the characters give them some life, especially their different attires.\n\nAnother important aspect of platforming games is the soundtrack, which Momodora III excels at. There aren\u2019t words to describe the music other than it is simply beautiful. Each stage has its own music to go with it and all of them are jaw dropping to listen to. The music just gets you immersed into the game and flows well with the atmosphere it's trying to convey, further enveloping the player.  Soundtrack isn\u2019t something that I pay much attention to but this game does it so well that I just had to include it in the review. \n\nThe gameplay is quite basic for playformers of this day and age. You have to traverse through areas as your specific character, jumping and moving on platforms to make it to the end of the stage while avoiding obstacles. Each stage has its own specific set of enemies and their abilities as well as appearance correlate with set stage. In order to counter these enemies you have 2 types of attacks, normal and ranged making for a simple yet enjoyable combat system.\n\nYou also have item slots which you can customize depending on the stage or your play-style. Items can be bought or found in different stages. Like most platformers, after you reach the end of a stage you face a boss. The bosses have their own attack pattern and by memorizing these patterns they can easily be beaten. The bosses are very memorable because of their uniqueness.\n\nThis game also has three difficulty settings Casual, Easy and Hard so you can choose the one that you most prefer. On the easier difficulties you start with more hearts and items, on Hard it is vice-versa.\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is that it is really short and I am giving special emphasis on its length as it is possible to beat the entire game in 30 minute! However, with its cute graphics, fun gameplay and cost of $4 Momodora III deserves a recommendation from me.", "timestamp_created": 1450197006, "timestamp_updated": 1482178157, "voted_up": true,

The mechanics are simple and familiar, the boss fights entertaining in the classic platformer sense, and the music has that catchy simplicity of the digital soundtracks of yore. Several achievements add a bit more for you to do if you are unsatisfied with the short play time, but it's priced appropriately for the time you'll spend with it. Rather than really seeming short or sparse, it's just that there's very little filler in the game. Setups are rarely repeated, so you're running from new thing to new thing at a brisk clip.

I have nothing but compliments on those aspects. They put me right into the right mood and into the world they built.\n\nThe gameplay is where things get a little fuzzy. Platforming is good. All the right elements are there, the character size, the camera system, speed, platforms size and distance. Everything comes together nicely and jumping around is fun and challenging. \n\nThe level design (or room design?) has its highs and lows. Sometimes you enter a room and a couple of steps ahead there's a spike pit. Seeing how fast the character move this is a very easy death right there. You just entered the room and is still pressing the dpad, you fall over simply because you didn't have time to process the room layout.\n\nMinor nitpick: The first screen of the game tells you to press A to start (as in the xbox button). I am using one so that's nice. But after that is all arrow keys this, shift button that.\n\nCombat is the main problem I have. Even some ingredients that made platforming great are getting in the way of a good combat system. The character speed and size on screen, combined with the range of melee attack, forces you to get uncomfortably close to the enemies at the same time making that very hard. A wrong touch at the dpad and you are taking contact damage or too far to do any damage. Add to that a ridiculous amount of screen shake, projectiles flying around, ghost companion, and the confusion is all set. I find myself squinting at the screen the whole time to find my character and it's just not enjoyable. \n\nHonestly I'm finding it hard to get over the combat aspect of the game. I keep closing the game and then opening again, because everything else is so engaging. I only played for 40 minutes, and I don't know if I'll keep playing.\n\nSo, reiterating: I'm not such a great fan of the game at the moment.

The soundtrack is great, the person who did this, did an amazing job. \n\nI'd also like to mention you find numerous little items you can buy or find while playing, take each one for a test drive to see if you like the item, and what it does. They all offer neat little perks like reduced damage, healing when you kill enemies, and one changes your attack animation into something longer reaching and cooler looking.\n\nGot a \"New Game +\" option at the end, and it warned me:  \"Things will be a bit different this time\". Hopefully a bit more challenging but not too much, I enjoyed the casual and fun gameplay alot. Highly recommend this game for anyone who was born in the 8-bit era like me. Just don't expect a challenge, there is none that I know of. Play it for fun and you won't go wrong.\n\nUpdate:   Came to check and see if I had reviewed this game because my memory sucks and I couldn't remember. Yes, yes I have. \n\nThe New Game+ offers no challenge over the original playthrough and if anything, having all the items and skills from the previous playthrough lets you absolutely slaughter it as if you were a God. Not saying that isn't fun because it totally is. Just, there's no challenge to be found in New Game+'s. \n\nAlso, buy this game. Seriously, if you like 8-bit retro games and platforming, buy it.

S\u00ed\nEs un juego esticamente maravilloso, muy semejante al estilo de Cave Story, el dise\u00f1o de los personajes es muy bonito y tambi\u00e9n el sistema de inventario es muy curioso.\n\nDispones de 3 slot y vas consiguiendo objetos que te seran \u00fatiles cuando los lleves equipados (o no tendr\u00e1n ning\u00fan efecto cuando los tengas equipados) y tu haces tus combinaciones; \u00bfQuieres da\u00f1o? Quiz\u00e1 optes por mejorar tu ataque a distancia. \u00bfQuieres aguantar m\u00e1s golpes? Quiz\u00e1 te equipes con una botella de hada y el anillo protector etc, etc.\n\nLos bosses son los tipicos que repiten un patron hasta la muerte y son bastante faciles de memorizar, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed hay algunos que son bastante desafiantes (y a veces frustrantes la verdad). \nSacar todos los logros no es dificil si consigues asimilar el control rapido, lo cual es el unico punto negativo que le veo, o al menos ami no me ha llegado a convencer.\n\nEl ataque es unilateral y tienes que permanecer quieto durante la animacion de este, si saltas de una gran altura tu personaje se queda \"clavado\" en el lugar donde caes durante unos segundos, hay momentos en los que parece que el suelo esta echo de cera y los enemigos, combinados con el enceramiento de los niveles, puede frustrarte durante unos minutos hasta que consigas matar al bicho o... vayas corriendo sin mirar atr\u00e1s y recibir un poco de da\u00f1o.\n\nEn resumen; es un juego de 8-Bit, plataformas bien logrado, con un control un poco tosco y unos logros que puedes tomarte como desafios personales y te llevaran, no s\u00e9, 4-5 horas conseguirlos todos, quiz\u00e1 algo m\u00e1s.

So, it sort of makes it easier. In this game, you gotta find out a lot of things by yourself. Such as finding some hidden items, finding some hidden areas, and knowing what works best and what item combinations fit your play style.\nThe game is short, to the point where someone beat it in less than 7 minutes. With that being said, its not surprise the stages are short. If you know what you're doing, you can easily beat the game in a short period of time. If it's your first time and you're a scrub (like me) it might take you a while.  You don't have to rush though. It's nice to take the time to explore, try to find items, kill enemies or just enjoy the soundtrack. (which is great, you can buy it on the composer's bandcamp.)\nSince the stages aren't too long, the bosses must be difficult and take a while to beat, right?\nUhm, not exactly.\nThe bosses were quite easy for me on my first time playing, some not even hitting me. It just depends on your skill level, or if you know what the bosses do. Some people say they're hard, I say they're quite easy. The story isnt really explained all too well in the beginning, since the game is short there aren't many ways the game directly tells you what the story is, aside from the good ending of course. Some bosses have a very simple pattern, some have attacks that are easy to avoid. Some are harder than others. Heck, even some of the earlier bosses are more difficult than the later ones. \nThe achievements and speedrun records will keep you busy. Try to get both endings, try to speed run. Heck, it even changes stuff up a bit and you can do a pacifist run. Aside from the exploring you can, trying to 100% it, or just trying out new item combinations that you didn't before, this game will keep you busy. You can waste so much time just trying to beat your own records, or even attempting to beat the speed run record.\nI'll try not to spoil too much, so lets get ahead and finish this already somewhat long review. \nMomodora III is a fun, short, simple, cute, time-consuming, and amazing game. I would recommend it, even at like five dollars. Sadly, there's not much content if you just want to beat the game. I would definetly recommend getting Momodora III and at least beating it if you enjoy platformers, or if you want to get introduced to platformers. \nIts difficult to give this game a rating, since I love it so much.

And what I mean by this is that when you jump to another platform you don't slide off of it by .5348958349054 mm and die, like in some certain platformers I have played before. \n\nPaired with an amazing soundtrack and cute graphics, after beating the game it really left me wanting more, and by this I was really wanting more on the premise of the plot and story. The downside to this game lies in its brevity, however as a balance to this its small price tag is definitely worth it.\n\nOverall what really makes Momodora III a great game to play is its simplicity, however it is not simple. It has the perfect combination of challenge, variety of items, and skills. On top of that I just love super kawaii pixelated graphics and good music.

The controls are tight and responsive and if you die it is your fault. There is no time limit so you can take your time and slowly defeat enemies and learn the layout.\nThe story is that Death has turned evil and Momo or Dora, being shrine maidens, must purify her. Momo or Dora must battle her minions through various stages with huge boss fights to defeat Death. The cool thing is whenever you die you will see Death laughing at Momo or Dora. \nMomo and Dora both have an extremely short reach with their melee weapon, but it goes into an arc. They also have a ranged attack and Momo and Dora both control the same from what I saw. The enemies are not difficult but serve as cannon fodder for money. You need money to buy items from vendors or you can find them after a boss fight or in a secret treasure chest.\nThe game does not support two players, the boss fights are simple when you learn their patterns and the game is linear, too linear. Once you know the layout you can zoom through the game in under 30 minutes.  I also wish that Momo and Dora had different colored weapons and a different ranged shot. All these can be overlooked and still be enjoyed.\nTo sum it all up, I whole heartedly recommend this game to people who are looking for a new experience or just want to test out their platforming skills. It is worth your money and you are guaranteed to like or love it. I will be looking forward to the other games in the series.

If you are into the kind of retro like graphic, then this game is perfect for you. And the background colouring changes shadow to create the illusion of distance truly makes the game graphical beautiful. \n\nGameplay:\nBefore I played the game I read a review of someone having trouble in the game, so I decided to play it on Hard. I spend some time learning the attacks one melee and one ranged, simple yet a great move to avoid over doing the attack part. There is a great mix between using melee or ranged attack instead of just one being completly broken. Enemies are unique and interesting, learning patterns will be required in some rooms in order to move on. Now boss fights! They have certain abilities that really classifies the boss makes it unique and on hard you have to learn the attack patterns which is a huge plus! Instead of just being able to cheese the fights. Movement is smooth and easy going you won't find any problems there.\nAll in all gameplay is really great and well thought of!\n\nSounds:\nThe sounds are great and you won't get tired of them, even if you have to spam attacks. The sounds are retro too and makes for a fun/enjoyable game.

Visit a variety of really cool environments, and bask in the glory of it's beautiful soundtrack.  Really, as a game soundtrack collecting veteran of over 18 years, I can't recommend this game enough, it has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.

It still has a lot of soul and extremely cute pixel art, and there are some cool secrets to find. It could use a little more content, though. If this game spent a tad bit longer in development it would've been a gem but as it stands its pretty much comparable to Momodora 2, just with a lot more polish.\n\nThe combat is fun with the different items that augment your character, the music is great and not as chiptune-y as you'd expect, and the boss fights are interesting (although somewhat derived from other games, I'm lookin' at you Prismriv-I mean Arabella Sisters). This game is extremely fun to speedrun, and it is fairly replayable because you are bound to miss many of the secrets and hidden items. There are also two characters. I played with the hard character because the easy one was a little bit too powerful in comparison. I didn't wanna cheese the bosses at all.\n\nAlso, to the devs: the Arabella Sisters fight has problems when you take out the white one first. You can be completely barred by projectiles due to their random patterns when they come out, and then you get hit by the purple beam attack because you can't jump over the huge wall of purple bullets. That's pretty cruel. \n\nOnce I noticed this, I just killed the purple one first because the white one is seriously a pushover in her second phase, and so is the purple one in her first phase. This is kinda imbalanced. And yes, I know that you can redirect the bullets by jumping. That sometimes isn't enough. Unless I'm missing something (I never tried to attack the bullets to cancel them, so maybe I'm just stupid for not doing that), I see it as a problem.\n\nOther than that, I give it a momo/10\n\nAlso, HellkiteDrake made some music for this game.", "timestamp_created": 1420425503, "timestamp_updated": 1501374573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13807417": {"recommendationid": "13807417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043867984", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420397441}, "language": "english", "review": "Sadly enough it's a short game, but that doesn't mean it's bad.

There's a large handful of items that you can equip three at a time that affect your attacks and your characters' abilities. With these you can make your character [i]outright broken[/i], or a one hit wonder. The game can be played as you like it, and if Momo is too hard for you, you can play as Dora instead, who has one extra heart, seems to do a bit more damage and starts with the Dream Ring instead of having to find it. I've also heard people say this game is short (as Momodora games always are) but it took me about nine hours to finish doing everything and getting all the achievements, which I'd call reasonable for a game like this. Just running through once though? Yeah it won't take long.\n\nThe bosses were all somewhat basic as usual, some even reusing patterns from Momodora II, but I still thought they were pretty fun. The areas are all vibrant, unique and visually sharp, the graphics are as smooth as always and the sound design as well, however I'd say I enjoyed Momo II's soundtrack a bit more.\n\nOn the downside though this game has [i]way[/i] too many instant kills, pits and spikes sure, but also bombs. Explosions are a one hit kill and this gets frustrating later on when a lot of enemies have bombs. The slightest misstep in some areas can send you into a pit or explosion immediately, sometimes right after a room transition. It doesn't really add to the difficulty either, as checkpoints are usually nearby anyway.\n\nI also didn't care for the secrets. I really did enjoy finding the secret boss and how it was done in general but I found it all by accident absentmindedly and I wouldn't have if I hadn't just gotten lucky. There's also an achievement for saving a character before she dies that I frankly had to look up because I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do (one item having a massively misleading description didn't help either).\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed this game, it's a lot better than the previous games and shouldn't be judged by them alone.\n\nbuy momodora 3", "timestamp_created": 1415224768, "timestamp_updated": 1415224768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787272", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12786687": {"recommendationid": "12786687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014494496", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415109365}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, sweet, and fun. The pixel art is gorgeous and clean, with excellent use of color. The soundtrack is fantastic, but it unfortunately doesn't appear to be available for download anywhere. Difficulty and level design are, for the most part, very well considered. There's enough optional collectables that power up your character in different ways that you can tailor the difficulty to whatever degree you prefer. The game can be Dante Must Die-hard or Kirby-easy; it's all up to you. Level design is very Clasicvania-esque in that it expects you to take things somewhat slowly and to carefully consider your approach to navigating obstacles and fighting the common enemies. Boss fights are fun and well designed, but have a little too much health for how simple their attack patterns are. Though, as mentioned above, there's an item you can abuse to make boss fights ridiculously easy. Replay value is going to stem entirely from how much you enjoyed the game. It offers a New Game+ where you keep your items, but as far as I could tell nothing really changes between the playthroughs (though feel free to tell me I'm wrong). But that's okay. It's short and fun enough that I can definitely see myself busting out Momodora III on a rainy day. It doesn't offer any real incentives for a replay, but neither did any of the classic titles it's clearly inspired by.\n\nIf you're a fan of classic Mega Man, Castlevania, or Cave Story then consider picking this up.

Momodora II was a very fun and cute Metroidvania that was short and had some fun bosses. It wasn't an amazing thing like Bunny Must Die is, but it was worth my time. So anyways, Momodora III.\n\nI bought it. The first thing I noticed that the start level was a straight shoot with nothing interesting about it. Then the rest of the game was the same thing. No more exploring. This means that it just ends up being simple level design with basic enemies in them. In terms of movement, there is no double jump in this game. There is also no real mobility skills. This means as a platform it is massively lacking. As the levels are much more linear as well, there is nothing to really explore. The backgrounds look nice enough, but it is just basic level design.\n\nThis brings it up to the combat. Easy mode character is stupid easy, with the ability to tank enemies without a care. Hard mode character does need to be more careful. However, for both of them, due to the very simplist nature of how you attack in this game with the lack of fun movement, it is boring. The boss fights tend to have all of three moves each. Basic enemies will have one to two. I know the Momodora II had the same issue, but it felt longer than this and the map itself did bring some exploration.\n\nThis review is a bit over the place, but the core thing is this.

While some may be disheartened with the change I was more than happy with the almost arcade-like progression making it an incredibly addictive and easy to pick up game that still retains all of the depth and flair of it's predecessors.\n\nThere are still plenty of secrets strewn about the various levels for you to explore for and you'll have more than enough game-changing equipment to find for your journey, the platforming is precise thanks to simple controls, and the combat is lightning quick with a choice of split-second slashes or charged bullets for more strategic situations. The game can be very challenging, especially with the harder choice of sisters, since the enemy placements are very well thought-out and require some fast-thinking to deal with unharmed and the bosses will require lots of fast reflexes and coordination with their almost [i]Megaman[/i]-like patterns.\n\nFans of future-classic indie favorites such as [i]Cave Story[/i], or [i]Noitu Love[/i] will be instantly attracted to the visuals as there is a lot to adore here from the cute and offbeat cast of characters to the lovingly crafted backgrounds all with a touch of that nostalgic old school flair. The soundtrack carries the same retro appeal with it's soothing melodies that change and intensify with each new area, all-in-all creating a package that any fan of old school indie platformers should not be able to resist.\n\nThe game is a short but sweet experience with lots of amazing creature designs and lore to learn.

Momodora III has two playable characters, Momo and Dora, which both have their own difficulty level. Momo is HARD mode, and Dora is EASY mode.\n\nThis game is filled with merchants, and although fairly linear it does have multiple endings, and the music and graphics are great! However it is a pretty short game (I clocked in at about an hour and a half on my first run through), but after beating the game you can essentially start with a \"New Game+\", where the levels are slightly more challenging and you get to keep your items from your last run.\n\nThe only attacks you get are your sword and a letter that you throw. Your attacks are upgradable though through merchants scattered through out the levels. There is also a 'summon stone' for sale, that once equipped will summon a Ghost Girl that will aid you in your quest; while she can act rather \"Tails\" like at times, wandering off cliffs frequently, she is very useful for fighting bosses and the Mario style ghosts which stop and go invisible when you're looking their way.\n\nThe main challenge of the game is learning the basic patterns of the enemies, and avoid falling objects while jumping over spikes. Your standard retro platformer fare.\n\nAnd As far as the story goes, there isn't much to it, and for the most part it is mostly inferred through sparse brief dialogues with NPCs, and a couple events. The story could be easily summed up in a couple sentences, honestly.\n\nI only have 2 complaints with this game. The first one is that it starts in Windowed mode (at least on my machine.) Adventurously I remedied this for myself by seeing what the F keys did - you can switch to fullscreen mode by pressing F4; however it would have been nice if the game had a menu option that either told you this or switched to Window modes for you.\n\nMy other complaint is that once you're playing the game, you can not go back to the main start menu without exiting the game first. It's not too big of a deal, but it would be useful. Also it's a little quirky how you exit the game while playing: you must first hit escape, followed by F1.\n\nOverall, this is worthy, and highly polished successor to the first two Momodora games (which are free from the developer's website!) So if you enjoy games like Cavestory or Legacy of the Wizard, you should buy this game!

That's it. However, there are many ways to make the game play by your own rules. The game features a great deal of unique items to tailor your playstyle. Just from the first couple levels [small item spoilers], I found a speed ring that doubles your speed and damage intake, a sentient clone item, a life leech on kill item, a money magnet and many more.\n\nThe game has quite a bit more if you take some time to explore it. There are secret nooks and crannies all over the place that nets you new items and all the story within the game are laced into the dialogues of the npcs. \n\nAll the bosses after the first one offers a decent amount of challenge with different attack patterns for you to recognize and projectiles coming from every which way for you to dodge.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like the powerful feeling combat from games like Cave Story and Vlambeer games [Nuclear Throne/Super Crate Box], then Momodora is right up your alley.\n\nHere's a video first impression for those interested:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anhFy4YqSWk", "timestamp_created": 1404265873, "timestamp_updated": 1404265873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578245", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11007565": {"recommendationid": "11007565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059872694", "num_games_owned": 659, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466462775}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Momodora III \u00e9 obra-prima, um game obrigat\u00f3rio para quem gosta de jogos cl\u00e1ssicos.

The controls are simple, and leaves the player a lot of room to decide how to defeat a boss or get through a level. You can buy equipable items at one of the few shopkeeper locations, but even these won't make a big difference when it comes to facing a boss. Overall, the game gives you quite a bit of a challenge.\n\nThe music is pretty good too, really fitting. Hellkite Drake brings a wonderful addition to the music, complementing Elektrobear from the previous installments. That said, Momodora 2's album was great also. You should check it out.\n\nFor $5, you're getting a really nice game with a good amount of difficulty. The length of the game might not be enough to justify the purchase.

And of course some of these items are hidden in hard-to-spot rooms and behind interesting bosses, creating a great sense of progression as you unlock more of them and open up your options in combat.\n\nThe difficulty is certainly there, specially if you are not playing on easy. Bosses will pack a punch, but they telegraph their moves with their smooth animations, which is where you see the Dark Souls inspiration.\n\nAnd to top it off, it has pretty graphics and cute characters. Even if it's kinda short (I could finish it in 1 hour on easy) it contains a new game+ mode, and the hard mode will most likely put up a nice challenge. I'm sure I'll come back to this game multiple times yet.\n\nOh, and I definitely recommend that you also check out Momodora 2, which is more of a \"metroidvania\", and is free.\n\n\nPS: only reason I compare this to Dark Souls is because the dev talks a lot about it on twitter, you guys can chill", "timestamp_created": 1404155554, "timestamp_updated": 1467069951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692816", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39501384": {"recommendationid": "39501384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074791292", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 197, "last_played": 1516542917}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "S\u00f3 magia Top Rogerinho", "timestamp_created": 1516510728, "timestamp_updated": 1516510728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39498552": {"recommendationid": "39498552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179288787", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 87, "last_played": 1516416318}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5168\u5b9f\u7e3e\u3092\u89e3\u9664\u3067\u304d\u305f\u306e\u3067\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3002\n\n\u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u304c\u826f\u304f\u52d5\u304f\u306e\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3057\u3066\u3044\u3066\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u3082\uff13\u6bb5\u968e\u304b\u3089\u9078\u3079\u3001\u4e00\u756a\u4f4e\u3044\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u3067\u306f\u30c7\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30c8\u3067\u4f53\u529b\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u56de\u5fa9\u304c\u3064\u304f\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30dc\u30b9\u6226\u3082\u30b4\u30ea\u62bc\u3057\u3067\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u5bc4\u308a\u9053\u3057\u3066\u3082\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u307e\u3067\uff11\u6642\u9593\u7a0b\u5ea6\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30b5\u30af\u30c3\u3068\u6c17\u5206\u8ee2\u63db\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3068\u304d\u306b\u3061\u3087\u3046\u3069\u826f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1516499246, "timestamp_updated": 1516499246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 633, "total_negative": 54, "total_reviews": 687}}

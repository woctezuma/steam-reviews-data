It's 5v5 objective based.\n\nPros:\n+Realistic weapons. Different weapons have to be reloaded differently.\n\n+Large variety of weapons from rifles, lmgs,  shotguns, and snipers\n\n+good community. I've played with several players many times. No toxicity usually\n\nCons:\n\n-Buggy. I've stood near a wall where half my body glitches through and I get killed. I've fallen through the map multiple times. Many times my soldier in game just stops holding onto his weapon with both hands messing up my accuracy.\n\n-Many weapons completely useless. Game exchanges realism for fun. Sniping is borderline impossible. \n\nI wouldn't recommend the game for the following reasons:\n\n1. The game is basically hide and seek. It's incredibly difficult to see players since they can glitch most of their body into scenery.  Many times defenders just go to poorly lit spots and sit there.  If you attack and die you will sit for 5 minutes watching your teammates crawl towards the enemy. If you are on defense be prepared to sit in 1 spot and stare at a wall until the enemies come to you.\n\n2. The weapons are completely unbalanced. You will see 90% of players using the standard assault rifles. Many weapons don't hit where the reticle shows on some sights. It takes 2 slow firing shotgun shots to kill someone while it takes 2 shots from an assault rifle that lays down 10 shots per second the same. \n\nUsing the sniper rifles is not viable in game. Snipers either come with no scope and are difficult to aim or come with a 4x or 12x scope. The maps are small so both of these are impossible and pointless to use. You will likely get flamed by your team for using a sniper.\n\n3. Many accessories are just as useless. You can use a flash light or laser sight and both of those will just get you killed in the game of hide and seek.  You can use forgrips and silencers but using them will make you unable to use body armor or AP ammo.\n\n4. Tracking is poor. Many times I barely move my arms to turn and my guy takes his hands off the rifle. Shooting 1 handed basically kills you vs anyone else. That fact it happens so much is ridiculous. \n\nThis game has a lot of potential for being awesome but it also has a lot of issues as well. The lack of viable weapons and items,  the bugs, and excessively slow hide and seek game play take this from a great game to a \"meh\" shooter. It will likely die once VR gets more competitive shooters. Or for more fun,  go play Rec Room paintball.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1519353651, "timestamp_updated": 1519353651, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508779", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40313453": {"recommendationid": "40313453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066044695", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520193179}, "language": "english", "review": "Met four random stranges, fought off the russians in a subarb creating a bound i'll never have again (until the next game), till we meet again, also buy this game... just sit down after awhile don't want to develop that thousand yard stare to quickly.", "timestamp_created": 1519340113, "timestamp_updated": 1519340113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40277437": {"recommendationid": "40277437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061508148", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519223359}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun game, though there's a learning curve.\n\nThe game has abit of an issue with team balance.

The mechanics feel outstanding and the weapons are very responsive. The in game voice chat works better and is more intuitive that any other voice chat I have found in a shooter. \n\nI have not even mentioned the immersion element due to the fact that this game is played in VR. The community is mosty kind and helpful. There are plenty of public lobbies that provide hours and hours of enjoyment. Also if you are looking for a more competative aspect there is a Large and growing competative eSports scene with regular season play as well as competative tournaments with live shoutcasting through the official onward Twitch channel.\n\nOut of the 380+ games I have in my steam library, this is by far my favorite game and will remains so for the forseable future.

[/h1]\nI was in a round where we were being annhilated. I see some cover up ahead and I decide to crawl my way to it, surrounded by enemies. I'm taking cover behind this sandbag and theres another dude here to. I tell him hello so he doesnt turn around a shoot me after he figures out I'm there. He turns around, waves, and proceeds to stand up so he can shoot the enemies. He has about six billion bullets fly at him so he quickly ducks to stay alive, and begins to heal himself. At this point he turns around and asks \"So, since we're not doing that again, have you seen Finding Dory?\" I respond \"Nah, Its a sequel, they're never as good as the origional.\" He says something along the lines of \"thats a shame\" and we begin having a conversation about how hollywood is going south in the middle of a battlefield, surrounded by russians who haven't figured out one grenade could kill us both and let them win yet. I then get tired of crouching and stick my M16 above my head and start blindfiring all over the place. My mag is empty so I begin reloading, and I pick up my empty mag and look at the other guy and say \"We gotta throw out mags because we're not going to have enough ammo\" so I throw my empty clip at them and he takes his fully loaded mag and throws it, then takes another full mag and throws that too. I am now down to two mags and he has one bullet in the chamber due to his misunderstanding of my words. He stands up and shoots a guy I got partially with a frag earlier and they're down leaving one russian left, which I did not know. He gets shot by this other dude and now its just me and my M16. I turn around to watch my side and I see this 6' tall russian dude come around the corner three feet away by me looking like the eiffel tower in comparison to my little crouching body. He shoots me immediately before I can put a mag in him and they win.

This is one of the best VR games out there, is a VR bestseller according to Steam, and is an excellent example of the full potential of VR. You want to reload your gun? Do it manually as you would in real life. Need to crouch behind a barrier? Get down on your knees. Are you sniping? Lie down on the real floor. This realism really makes this game and every VR developer should pay attention to it. The smooth locomotion via the touchpad is well designed and does not induce motion sickness for most people, so other VR games have copied this \"Onward-style\" movement control.\n\nThe gun mechanics seem very realistic and are unrivaled by any other game (including Pavlov) and the maps are very well designed. The gameplay is balanced via a point system on the loadout and the in-game mechanics, so the matches are very fun and highly dependent on your own skill. The tutorial is very helpful to newbies and the developers (isn't it just one guy?) seem to be moving this game in exactly the right direction. This game also stands out on the small things, such as the environmental noises and the appearance of some fog as you breath out in real life. The overall immersion is just outstanding.\n\nTo get good at this game, you need to listen carefully to your surroundings. Be stealthy, coordinate with your teammates via the radio, and learn the maps. You can improve your accuracy with a gun stock to hold your controls as if they were a real gun.

None of the other VR shooters can quite capture the nice balance of realism and tactics this game offers. With that being said, it has a lot of issues.\n\nFirst, it has some optimization problems. A lot of the things people complain about or want added to the game aren't being done because the game is just teetering on the edge of being unplayably optimized, and adding the new features they want will send it over. The game was made by an inexperienced developer, so I can only imagine the spaghetti code mess the game is, and it's gotta be impossible to get it into a decent state at this point without a huge overhaul of the code.\n\nThis is evident by the very rigid interactions and gameplay, as well as numerous inconsistent bugs and performance issues. You can only grab your gun one way, with your primary hand on the handle and you can grab the barrel with your offhand. You can't hold more than a single thing at a time. Want to check your one-handed tablet? You have to completely let go of your rifle with both hands, then grab it with your primary (and just your primary) hand. You can only grab a grenade with your primary hand, and pull the pin with your offhand. You can't throw with your offhand.\n\nYou can't share equipment between players; it's as if all your equipment doesn't exist to everyone else. Dead body ragdolls aren't synced between players so when you see a dead body as being right in front of you, maybe you're hiding behind it, your opponent sees it as being 5 feet to your left and they can see you clearly.\n\nBesides all of that, there are severe balance issues in the game as well. I've played in the competitive Onward league for 2 seasons now, so I feel qualified to talk about this. There are huge issues with night maps due to defending players (which are always in black) being absolutely invisible in dark areas. The night vision is nearly useless, but not useless enough that you can forego selecting it in your loadout. All it does is turn up the gamma and apply a green filter, which still does absolutely nothing when someone is in a dark corner or room staring you in the eyes.\n\nOne of the absolute worst balanced maps is called Subway, which has 2 major chokepoints (stairwells) that the attacking team has to somehow force through. The defending team almost always can get to the chokepoint first, and it's dreadfully easy to defend these chokepoints, but not impossible for the attacking team to make it through. Nevertheless, it's a huge balance issue in competitive play.\n\nDespite all the issues, it's an experience that other games can't offer yet, and one I enjoy a lot. If you're looking for a tactical shooter, Onward is the game to get. I'm sure the game will keep slowly getting improvements and features, but emphasis on \"slowly.\" \n\nIt's only a matter of time before another game is made that captures the same gunplay and tactic feel that Onward has, but by someone or a team that knows what they are doing. It will be a game that has a more flexible and stable codebase, and provide much better, feature-rich gameplay. If the Onward devs don't get their shit together, it won't be longer than a year or so before they lose their playerbase.

I've never been in combat but i have played a lot of paintball and my paintball experience comes back. I crouch, duck behind barriers, peek out on the side of walls and get shot a lot.\n\nAll in all, this is the most amazing thing I have experienced in VR.

Sure there's a few bugs to be tinkered out, but as it stands they could release this game 'as is' and I'd still say it's worth the price of admission. \nPRO'S:\n*Sound is accurate to real-life weapon counter-parts\n*Weapon selection and in-game controls are excellent and fleshed out\n*Great tutorial and single-player gameplay (though I'd like to see some AI team implementation at some point in the future)\n\nCON'S:\n*long wait times.......\n*whiny player's/people who won't stop screaming into the mic...\n\nOVERALL: For a incomplete game in early access, this beats most games in full release.

I am really, really impressed. Sure the visuals aren't exactly AAA grade but the guns look and feel amazing. The playerbase is really nice and helpful, everyone's up for a laugh. Just tell them it's your first time and they are very accomodating. I had very little lag issues even playing with Americans from Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThere is a bit of a learning curve on the controls, but the basic point and shoot is intuitive and very accurate and satisfying.\nI'm able to pull off single fire kill shots at pretty good distances using a holographic sight and god damn is it satisfying. This is the future of FPS.\n\nEXTENDED FOLLOW UP EDIT:\n\nI'm now nearly 15hrs into this game and I still stand by everything I've said. The controls have gotten even more intuitive as I played, I can reload without looking at my vest, or pull a grenade or pistol from my hip without looking at my vest. My legs and arms get physically strained from playing intense matches over a long period and it's awesome. It feels real.\n\nDucking for cover feels real, blind firing around corners or over cover feels real. Suppression WORKS because players are scared. When you get suppressed, you lose peripheral vision which is so cool. If you take damage, you start to bleed out and your vision goes black & white and/or blurry until you inject yourself with a stimulant to keep going. (This doesn't give you health back, only gets you back on your feet).\n\nThere are a few things I'd like to see changed for the future:\n- 4x & 12x Scopes. These are REALLY difficult to use, the sweet spot to see through them is seriously unforgiving and this is really difficult when you're using your hands with 2 VR controllers. I imagine a gunstock makes this easier but they can't be an expected requirement to play the game. I don't know how unforgiving scopes are in real life, but I doubt they are black until you perfectly position your eye ball? I have given up on using them.\n\n- Ammunition in clips representing how many rounds are ACTUALLY inside. Right now they are visually represented as full, or empty. I would like to be able to release my clip, check how many rounds are left then put it back in between fire fights.\n\n- It would be nice to be able to choose left eye vs right rendering for the sake of streaming. Watchers can't see my scope when I ADS on my right eye.\n\n- Binoculars! Due to the resolution limits of current VR headsets, seeing and identifying targets beyond medium range can be really difficult or nearly impossible at times. Having binoculars you can pull from your backpack would really help with this. It could even add to the meta of identifying targets over the radio.\n\n- Tactical Wrist Watch. The wrist watch compass numbers/bearings are great, but I think a more inuitive addition could be to have North,  South, NNW, SE, etc added as well for beginner players.\n\n- More maps would be great! But I'm sure they are coming.\n\nAll in all this game gets a solid 9/10 from me for pushing what an FPS should be. I haven't had this much fun with a shooting game since the original COD games.

The devs are extremely active and they listen to your ideas! There's a discord where you can talk freely with the Devs and give them ideas for the next update. For example, early on, the A-10's that fly over the menu had afterburners(I couldn't help but notice XD). I knew it was minor but I decided to bring it to the attention of the devs. After a quick chat with one of the devs he said he would put it into the game.

Reaching up to your shoulder to activate the radio to tell your teammates that you are still alive. There is something sublime about leaning your real body back behind a corner, reaching up to a virtual gun, pulling the magazine out, then reaching into your tactical vest for a fresh mag to slam home. \n\nFar more than the shooting, it is the supporting actions that prove that VR can be more than a gimmick. We need more games like Onward to prove that there is value in VR. If you spent the money for a headset, you owe it to yourself to play Onward.\n\nAnd if you  are skeptical of online play, the community is pretty great, welcoming and helpful.

That being said there are a lot of controls to get the hang of but most of them are easy to pick up on and then they actually feel really comfortable (like you are a real soldier). But the magic of this game is not in the first 10 hours... the magic happens when you begin to become a competent player. Checking corners with your teammates, knowing good spots, reloading under fire. These things give you a sense of incredible realism. There was one experience in particular that really stuck out to me, i found myself moving up a flank when suddenly i came under fire from an enemy player using an LMG. The guns are loud in this game (very realistic sounding) my vision became narrowed and i took cover behind a car ( Laying on the ground in my basement). Bullets rattled off the car over and over, i peaked up over the hood of the car and fired off a few rounds in the general direction of the fire. More rounds started to hit the car, Quickly I knew i had to get out of there but i would never make it across the street to cover. Suddenly i remembered i had a smoke grenade on my chest. I reached down pulled the pin and tossed the grenade over the car and in front of me. I then preceded to scramble across the street where i could rejoin my team on the other side of the map. Ok yes in any first person shooter that is such a lame story, but in VR when you have to think like that and everything feels and seems real, an experience like that can get your adrenal glands pumping. This is hands down the best VR title i have played up until this point. The replay value is fantastic, the dev team listens to the community, and the community is great to play with.

Und wenn: dann f\u00fcr Onward ! :-)\n\nOnward stand nach dem Kauf meiner Oculus Rift noch lange nicht auf meiner Wunschliste.\nDie Grafik sah in diversen Videos oder Screenshots nicht soo Einladend aus.\nDann schreckte mich ab, das man nach dem virtuellen Ableben bis zum Rundenende warten mu\u00df (das mochte ich noch nie). Und der immer wieder genannte Vergleich zu Arma hielt mich auch ab.\nWeil ich mit Arma bisher leider nicht warm geworden bin.\n\nIm Sommer habe ich dann doch zugeschlagen; und seit dem spiele ich Onward w\u00f6chentlich!\nUnd zwar in einer deutschen VR-Community. \n\n\nZu Onward:\nDie Grafik ist sogar besser als zuvor angenommen. In VR sieht die Grafik recht ordentlich aus.\nDie Waffen sehen sogar fantastisch aus. Sehen sehr real aus. Nur das leichte Gewicht der Touch-Controller sagt mir, das ich keine echte Waffe in der Hand halte :-) \n\nDas Waffenhandling, die Haptik, das Nachladen und das bedienen der Waffen sind sehr gut und sehr realistisch. Auch der Klang der Waffen ist sehr realistisch.\n\u00dcberhaupt setzt Onward auf Realismus. Onward braucht keinen Hardcore-Modus. Dieses Spiel ist Hardcore!\nWird man im Kopf getroffen, ist man sofort weg. Wird man am K\u00f6rper, Beinen, Armen nur angeschossen, wird einem schwarz vor Augen. Ist man heftig angeschossen worden, kann man sich nicht mehr bewegen. Dann mu\u00df ein Teamkollege herbei eilen und dich mit einer Spritze wieder auf die Beine stellen. Man kann sich auch selbst mit der Spritze versorgen.\nAber nicht wenn man ausgeknockt wurde.  Man kann dann nur noch nach seinen Teamkollegen rufen, u. hoffen das einer kommt. H\u00f6rt der Gegner deine Hilfe-Rufe, dann gibt er dir den Rest.\n\nUnd dieser Realismus; das ist auch eher der Vergleich zu Arma. Arma ist ja auch eine Simulation mit einem sehr hohem Grad an Realismus.\n\nVon den Maps her gibt es keinen Vergleich zu Arma. Zumindest von der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe. Und das ist auch gut so bei nur max. 10 Spieler je Server.\nEs gibt leider noch nicht sehr viele Maps. Aber unter den vorhandenen Maps, sind schon ein paar au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlich gute Maps dabei.  Es gibt auch Maps, die im dunkeln gespielt werden. Night Vision an, u. es werde gr\u00fcn und hell :-)\n\nDas Waffenarsenal in Onward ist recht ordentlich. In der Lobby des Servers kann man vor jeder Runde sein Setup ausw\u00e4hlen u. mehrere Setups bearbeiten. Und das bleibt dann auch so bestehen, bis man es wieder ver\u00e4ndert.\nUm die Balance zu gew\u00e4hren gibt es eine maximale Anzahl an Punkten, die nicht \u00fcberschritten werden darf.\nBeispiel: M\u00f6chte man einen Schalld\u00e4mpfer ausr\u00fcsten, fehlen am Ende dann Punkte f\u00fcr eine Handgranate. \n\nDas warten nach dem vorzeitigen Ableben bis zum Rundenende ist gar nicht soo schlimm. Wenn ich denn vorzeitig ausscheide, kann ich nicht nur den noch lebenden Teamkollegen zuschauen u. auf einer \u00fcbersichtlichen Map verfolgen, wo sie gerade unterwegs sind; sondern mich mit allen anderen virtuell gefallenen Mitspielern unterhalten.\nUnd da hatten wir schon eine Menge Spa\u00df :-)\n\nSobald die n\u00e4chste Runde startet, kann man sich auf der Map nur noch mit seinen Team-Mitgliedern unterhalten. Aber nur, wenn man noch dicht beisamen ist. Ansonsten kann man den Funk benutzen, um mit seinem Team zu kommunizieren. \nAber aufgepa\u00dft !  Ist der Feind in der N\u00e4he kann man sich durch Funkspr\u00fcche (Funkger\u00e4usche) oder Unterhaltungen verraten :-)   Das alleine macht Onward schon sehr interessant. Sowas gibt es nur in VR. (es wird kein Teamspeak genutzt. Voice nur InGame !)\n\n\nAlso, f\u00fcr mich ist Onward das VR-Spiel des Jahres. \n\n\nAusl\u00f6ser f\u00fcr den Kauf der Oculus Rift plus Touch-Controller war ein Youtube-Video \u00fcber \"Arizona Sunshine\" (VR-Spiel), das man in VR mit ausgestrecktem Arm und h\u00e4ndischer Ausrichtung per echtem Kimme & Korn schiessen und treffen kann.\nDas ist ein wahr gewordener M\u00e4nner-Traum :-)  \nUnd genau so funktioniert es auch in Onward.\nDas ist mit Shooter am Monitor nicht mehr vergleichbar. Das ist VR !\n\n\nPS:   F\u00fcr alle, die gerne Paintball spielen:\nKauft Euch eine Rift oder Vive und Onward !   Das ist der Ersatz oder das Trainingsprogramm f\u00fcr Paintball schlechthin.\nTauscht blaue Flecken am K\u00f6rper gegen Abdr\u00fccke einer VR-Brille im Gesicht  :-)", "timestamp_created": 1511537524, "timestamp_updated": 1511709890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619938", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37337408": {"recommendationid": "37337408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202985409", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515954565}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty cool", "timestamp_created": 1511531646, "timestamp_updated": 1511531646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37290052": {"recommendationid": "37290052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038682384", "num_games_owned": 600, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508137350}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing!

Its a mil-sim game with excellent realism (quick kill, good weapon behaviors, wallbanging), interactive weapons (many moving parts, weapon unique reloads), and a strong community (both in active players, and developer support). \n\nThe game is essentially 5v5 combat, with a variety of maps and two main modes for multiplayer (uplink - objective based, and escort -cover a VIP player), and its well populated even at non-peak hours for a VR game. There is a single player component which is just versus bots and a shooting range for practice which matches the amount of content most games of the same genre offer. Additionally it should be noted it is a full locomotion game, and many will often get sickness when first playing until they adapt, to do this it is recommended to  physically move your body (run in place) to reduce this effect until your body adapts. \n\nThe game is in early access, but don't let that fool you, there is more game here than in many games on the market at present, although again it is mostly a multiplayer experience with some single player components. The developer is actively updating the game with new weapons and maps as time passes, so it is well supported (although small team so major updates are infrequent).  \n\nOnward is for many VR early adopters the definitive title and justification of VR as a viable platform. Its one of the few games that you will see in the VR community at present where players exist with 100s of hours of gametime, and as such it is worth the price of admission.

I really love the controls and free movement. The gameplay is extremely well balanced in my opinion. The developer is consistently listening to the community and making improvements which is great. \n\nI have a few complaints. The level designs, while they do seem balanced and provide for good gameplay for the most part, often feel really sparse. They could use some more decoration. \n\nThe scale of the in game objects feels just slightly off sometimes. Some are better than others in this regard. The streets of Subway feel pretty good for example. \n\nYou're limited to 5 vs 5 and the maps are pretty small. A couple maps I would describe as medium sized perhaps. The maps aren't very numerous either and there is no Steam workshop to add more maps like in the game Pavlov. I would really like to see maybe a 12 vs 12 mode and some nice big maps. Ideally it would be the size and scope of Arma or Battlefield games, but obviously that's expecting too much. \n\nSome skill based match making would be nice too. I get paired with some super try-hards some times that are into the whole competitive meta game and it's really frustrating because I only have a few hours to play every week. I don't have the time to memorize every pixel of every shooting lane of the maps. Having some player statistics that you could look at for other players could help there.\n\nAll in all this game is a fantastic experience despite those minor complaints.

[/h1]\n\n[b] [u] If you've ever played airsoft, this isn't too far from it. But! No hop up issues or electric guns! Real ones! [/u] [/b]\n\nI usually like to go in depth, but this isn't some super complex game with back story and over 9000 things. It's a smaller, but robust game. I don't feel like I'm lacking in gun selctions, but I also don't feel like any one is differant from the others. Which is probably good because sometimes games are broken by gun balance. This isn't. This is .... mostly based on how much you can avoid derping; forgetting your team is black, not black & very dark green (Depending on lighting), forgetting to reload, getting lost, etc. Much also like airsoft, it's if you can see them. Sometimes it's hard. Sometims you walk in on two people playing hanky panky in spawn. Who knows?!\n\nIt's all very realistic. You have to pull out mags and pull charging handles on guns that have them, you can pull the pin on a grenade that may or may not kill you if you forget you have to click the button to let go and flail around like an idiot with a grande strapped to your hand. It's real easy to sight in, but hard to keep your hands steady. it's not so bad since usually 1-3 shots down people. I don't ever get the sense of \"I've emptied 9000 clips in you GO DOWN!\" It's kinda either they drop or you drop and that's the end of it till next round. \n\nAs far as the player base; ... small from what I see. You either get the imaptient dicks who expect you to be perfect, or the fun ones who joke around. I have a hard time seing the slight green of the uniform at distance so I've shot teamates. I'll apologise, but some people just want to vent all their problems on you. (You do have voice chat and a radio, so, try to use that or the map that shows wher your teamates are.) Beware of obsessive try hards. But otherwise most people are there for a good time.\n\nOverall, aside from glitchy loading screens and some lag, this is a flat out amazing game. It doesn't set out to do anything flamboyant, it just works. A little slow paced without a TDM, but still fun. Well worth 25$ It feels fair.

This is like if Arma, and Insurgency got together and made a VR game! If you know how to operate real firearms, and can play tactically, then this game is a must buy! \n\nTo start off, the community for this game is great! I see a lot of the same players in the lobbies, which means they are loving it as much as I am. Everyone is very helpful, and friendly to players new and old. You will play with some that want to plan their attack, and others that just want to rush the objective. Whichever way you and your team approach it, you are bound to have some fun! Although, I will say that just like every other game, you will see some rotten eggs. Luckily, those players can be kicked. So far though, the bad eggs are a minority, because the barrier to entry for VR is still too pricey for mainstream players (trolls, kids, etc..).\n\nAside from the community, the gameplay itself is really great! In fact, with the combination of the community, and gameplay, this game really shines among all other VR games I have played! I have never played a game besides Arma, where I have seen so much teamwork! This is like the definitive Military Simulator! I have a hard time going back to 2D games like Arma after playing this. I know that is a bold comparison, especially when Arma offers vehicles, and so much more, and is 2D. But being able to actually hold your guns virtually is amazing, and being able to operate with them as you would in real-life is also amazing! The realism is yet to be matched in any other military style game I have played besides Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, and Handgrenades. But that game is single-player only so it also cannot really be compared to Onward. Although, if you had to pick between Bullets and More, Pavlov, or Onward for a VR FPS which is online; I would pick Onward any day of the week! Pavlov is like Counter Strike VR. Not much realism in that one aside from the guns. Same goes for Bullets and More. \n\nNo 2D game gives you this much situational awarness and control! You can sit, lay-down, peak from walls, and any shooting stance comfortable for you will work! Currently you can play five versus five in a Search and Destroy style game type, or escort the VIP gametype. For the most part everyone I have played with enjoys the S&D style mode, called \"Uplink\". The VIP mode gets the least love, because whichever side is protecting the VIP is now missing a capable fighter, because the VIP has their loadout replaced with a pistol only. I agree with some of the other players that the game could use some other gametypes, but I still love this game regardless! \n\nHonestly, for what I paid for I feel that I have gotten my money's worth and then some! For $25, I now have about 25 hours in this game. In VR time, that is a lot of standing... and crouching, and dodging virtual bullets! I have played with people that have a thousand plus hours in this game! Crazy as that sounds, it is true! Like I said, I see a lot of \"regulars\" while playing this game. Everyone comes to recognize eachother's name after a while. You might join a lobby, and four of the people in it are people you have played with a day, week, or month ago! Although, there are also constantly new people joining the ranks everyday! So, if you are reading this, then why not you?!?! Seriously, if you have a VR headset, and you want a great shooter with a great community, and lot of replay value; then get this game!\n\nI literally cannot recommend this game enough! I highly recommend you get this game before the price increases! To me, this game is better than Arizona Sunshine, and most of the other largely popular VR games. This game really transforms the whole concept of first person shooter! You feel like you are literally in a room with the people you are playing with! When you first play this game you can get so immersed that the gun shots coming at you may scare the living heck out of you! \n\nIf you are still reading any of this review, then maybe I convinced you enough! Buy it! It will be totally worth it! \n\n\nSee you on the battlefield comrades!", "timestamp_created": 1509104936, "timestamp_updated": 1509104936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712083", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36035677": {"recommendationid": "36035677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086134427", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506104080}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8d85\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u67aa\u68b0\u6362\u5f39\u6a21\u62df\u5668\n", "timestamp_created": 1509090267, "timestamp_updated": 1509090267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36005969": {"recommendationid": "36005969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050810667", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1521280523}, "language": "english", "review": "First match: Getting used to controls.

VR has done something amazing and, instead of looking in from the outside, has placed us INSIDE THE GAME! Onward does an amazing job of making me feel immersed in a military combat situation. The ambient sounds and effects are subtle but effective and realistic.  The implementation of the inventory system is as real as it gets.  Your magazines, smoke grenades, flashbangs, side arm etc are placed specifically on your virtual body.  Look down and you see your equiptment right where you'd expect in real life. Reloading requires you to drop the magazine from your gun, reach over and grab a new magazine, insert it into your gun and operate the loading mechanism. Going from pressing a single button in traditional games to actually interacting with your inventory ads a level of immersion that just has to be experienced to understand. \n\nIf you want to imagine what it's like playing this game, just imagine what it's like in real life to engage in combat. The game modes are what you'd expect. There is an objective game mode which requires one team to arrive at an \"uplink\" destination and send a code.  Another game mode requires a single, randomly selected player, to arrive at an extraction point marked by smoke without being eliminated by the other team. The \"VIP\" in this escort game mode has only a pistol and the support of the remaining members of the team to get to the extraction point. \n\nThis game is a work in progress but make no mistake about it, this game is easily a stand-alone game in it's current form and will only get better as time goes on.  I love playing this game and can't wait to see what lies in store for us next.\n\nEDIT: I'm playing this game on the Rift with two cameras.  I have the game settings to allow for room scale.  This means that to turn around I need to turn my whole body around.  I also have my cable suspended above me, works great BTW. I was concerned with turning around so much that I would twist the cable up.  Luckily, I came across a program created by a user called TurnSignal.\nThis program displays an image on the ground below you that twists up as you turn so you can keep your cable from becoming twisted up.  I found it helpful and wanted to share.", "timestamp_created": 1506258357, "timestamp_updated": 1506264461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601676",

I think I've spent 2 of my 6 hours actually playing the game and not in some kind of loading session or watching other people play. Sucks because I had to refund Bullets and More because it didn't launch properly in order to get his game. Bullets and More has TDM so it would be more my style of play.

The movement is one of the better variations in VR currently and the gameplay is pretty good. \n\n\nThis game has a ton of room to grow and I think if they add a few more game modes and maps that it will be one of the most recommended games on Steam and for VR.

Or wounded warriors that want to relive those days in the desert. Even not being something I would play everyday, I can say that the developers actually had a vision of what they wanted to create and they are doing that well. I say give it a shot and see if it's what you like, if not, there is always that refund button.

I never bought this game previously as I had some concerns from things I had heard (horrible community, motion sickness) but I was intrigued at playing Call of Duty VR so I gave it a go. \n\nOnward's positives far outweigh the negatives that I experienced. It is what I had hoped it would be and while some of my concerns were justified, it did not make the grave mistake of frustrating or making the new player angry and I put in some time to learn this thing. I was not so kind to BAM. \n\nTo be brief, you need to learn this game before you play it. It's not like learning Elite Dangerous, but it is more of a learning curve than Robot Recall. It's war and it's unforgiving. That means following through with the tutorial, spending some time in the shooting ranges/solo campaigns, and reading some tips online. That helped a lot and is probably why I was not on the recieving end of any significant verbal abuse. I was awful for my first couple of days - you could find my corpse a minute into any game with a bullet in the head - and it wasn't until day 3 that I finally pulled through some very gratifying multiplayer games. There is a clear discrepency in skill levels between newbs and vets.\n\nI won't describe the war-play, that is evident from the trailers. You should know that you need to learn how to load the guns but that turned out to be very easy. What I will talk about are the concerns I had going in. First off, the community has a notorious reputation for being verbally abusive. And yes, I have heard some of that first hand now. The devs need a better way to police online speech and behavior beyond the existing measures. Onward is not the only game with this issue, nearly any VR multiplayer has it. Even though the racism level is high (the #1 issue I noticed), there are a lot of very good and helpful community members who took no part in that. It seems you might have to \"fish\" for the right room to join if you are uncomfortable. I am going to call this a growing pain of the VR community at large and not an indictment of this game. People will say anything if they feel there are no repercussions. \n\nSecond worry I had was with motion sickness. I am sensitive to it and this game does not use teleportation. But you know what? I did not get any. I played for hours last night and I felt fine. Maybe my VR legs are slowly kicking in but there has been no issue with locomotion at all. Maybe the in-game tension is enough of a distraction that the brain doesn't have time to press the barf button. \n\nOne thing to note to my Oculus using friends: There are some Steam-related things you should be aware of. First, you must launch this game through Steam even though it will appear in your Oculus library. If you don't, there is no multiplayer and I couldn't even get the shooting range to load. Second, launch the game from inside the Steam VR home room. I don't know why, but if I launch through my library, I have audio issues (All audio goes to my monitor regardless of my settings and my mic will not function). I have yet to experience that issue when launching from the Steam home room and that has been a fix for a couple of different games now. And one more note on the audio: Make sure you double check the Steam VR audio settings. Make sure sound is being sent to your Rift and the mic is set to Rift on launch and back to where you want it to be when you quit Steam VR. This has been reset randomly a few times now so save yourself the agony of having to reload and double check before you launch.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1505854237, "timestamp_updated": 1505854237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35065839": {"recommendationid": "35065839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014119536", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520520347}, "language": "english", "review": "great game hard to aim with the sniper rifle either build or buy a \"rifle\" stock that can hold the controllers in line makes it alot easier. game doesnt have any ballistics where you shoot is where it hits, need to line up the iron sights properly in order to get a hit.", "timestamp_created": 1505832558, "timestamp_updated": 1505832558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35050988": {"recommendationid": "35050988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051714579", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516568384}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Just sick.

It's just not for me.  However, the game is well done.  It's a military sim and it seems pretty accurate, including the fact that at times it can be difficult to tell friend from foe, especially at a distance.  I got shot at by my teammates quite a bit and even killed one by accident as this person was across the map and I couldn't tell what color they were.\n\nThe maps were honestly not the best.  The gameplay of one map in particular  consisted of running towards the inside of a building before you would be killed being out in the open.  And once inside, you were basically picking off enemies out in the open.  At least during my gameplay, the objectives were being ignored as usually one team killed another.

Onward is one of the few that stands out.\n\nOnward sets the bar for VR realistic shooters, as its mechanics force you into the difficult tasks of combat, without having overtly complicated mechanics. If you are new to VR, keep in mind this may be a little offputting initially due to moving with an analog stick or pad and motion sickness may set in. But its executed well enough to not be too overwhelming and with consistent sessions you can easily find yourself not even feeling off in the slightest.\n\nWhat makes this game fantastic is the literal responsibilty for everything you have to do. If you run out of bullets in the mag, you have to change mags yourself. You throw the grenades, you are the one holding your breath to take the critical shot on the target. Everything in this game comes down to you, and to see a game so involivng is fantastic, especially without over complicated in game menus and options to choose from. thats the power of VR. I still struggle to realise I have to pull the pin out of the grenade before I use it!\n\nWhat is not so great is probably the current lack of content and other similar things. Of course, it is still an early access game so its less the fact of criticism and more the issue of when will more content arrive, rather than what. Guns are good but need more variety of sound and polish. More maps, and maybe slightly more detail on said maps would go a long way. AI can either be too stupid or too accurate on the difficulties available and maybe need a bit of an overhaul from 2 states (alert and hunting) to a variety and more objective based singleplayer/coop would bring it out of the ground. Multiplayer is good but requires maybe more players, roles, support methods like mortars (vehicles maybe??) and so on. Glitches, bugs and other issues will surely be ironed out over time.\n\nMost of what is stated above is far from being added to the game, but with further development this could be the greatest VR realistic shooter on the market.\n\nArguably, early access games are a gamble. But considering the lack of substantial product available on the VR market this is definitely and excellent choice for those who are willing to push their VR capacity, or those who are interested in MilSims.

Something that I believe HAS to be implemented.\n\nPeople having some kind of stock to help stabilize their aim will absolutely tear you apart each and every time.\n\nIf you're not used to it, the movement might throw you off at first.

The idea is that you simply place your finger on the dominant hands controllers track pad to turn in said direction, I checked my controllers by pressing the home button on the controller to see my raw inputs and the controller works just fine when I inspect that but still turning left is an absolute nightmare! I have to resort to moving my real body counterclockwise or just pressing right untill ive turned enough to be satisfied.\n\nI for some reason couldnt play online! call me stupid but I think your supposed to choose a class, set it up and then press start mission/ok I do that and the game says game starting in 5... but then when it \"starts\" it just goes back to \"waiting for host\", this happened numerous times so I resorted to playing SOLO\n\nGameplay on the most part was like a really bad but good game, Like \"see how long you can survive against ninja aim dudes, the enemy is WAYYY more accurate than any VR hero will ever be so I resorted to just camping and blindfiring which I didnt really enjoy so I got bored.\n\n\nOverall, its an Okay game... but it needs some work and is not worth the asking price that it currently sits at.", "timestamp_created": 1504901049, "timestamp_updated": 1504901049, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34821488": {"recommendationid": "34821488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147510051", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 77, "last_played": 1520982264}, "language": "english", "review": "resolution to bad to see anything, buggy guns and irritating players", "timestamp_created": 1504898940, "timestamp_updated": 1504898940, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.411144", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34800999": {"recommendationid": "34800999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293258040", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505344799}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: I've managed to get the height/midget problem working. While the game is running as it's supposed to (seemingly), things just don't work. Sometimes, I can't run, I can't walk, I'm left to a crawl in the middle of combat.\n\nSometimes, my screen goes black for a moment when nothing is happening. \n\nI got sh** from other players because, when I unequipped my weapon to use my needle, the needle wouldn't equip  at all. There was NOTHING else in my hands. Yet, the needle just didn't feel like being grabbed, I guess.\n\nDespite the absolute best internet package money can by, an ethernet cord, and ping that would make Jesus jealous, the game lags exponentially in some places.\n\nThis could be the greatest game for VR - A Call of Duty but with actual skill requirements. But the game is so buggy, it's just not playable. And for those players that endure the bugs and play the game anyway, they are sure to give you heck for problems that aren't under your control if something bugs out on your end.\n\nEND EDIT...\n\nSee below for my prior review.\n\nBefore I start, I need to say I am an Oculus Rift user, and that might be where my problems lie.\n\nFirst off, the game plays and looks great. The fact that each weapon and tool must be used realistically is a game changer - It's not just \"point and click\" skill, it's memory, knowledge, judgement and accuracy. So, overall, the game should be great!\n\nShould be...\n\nThe problem is, it's glitchy as all hell. Half the time, I can't pick the weapon up that I'm trying to use. If I try to grip an assault rifle on my chest, it takes about 10 clicks on the handle to register. \n\nAlso, I can't even use the needle. The needle just doesn't work for some reason. No matter what I do, the needle is just decorative at this point.\n\nHalf the time when I go into a map, when I click fire, everything turns black and the game has to be rebooted. So, just firing a weapon can ruin an entire session.\n\nI can't run - I've never been able to get the run functionality to work. I'm stuck walking. Everywhere. All the time.\n\nThis may just be due to me using the Oculus Rift, but it shouldn't be labeled as \"supporting the Oculus Rift\" if it doesn't work correctly.\n\nThe game is far too glitchy at the moment for any Oculus user to enjoy. Please save your money until it is fixed.\n\nYou guys have an AWESOME game! Please test it on the Rift more and try to get it up and running for both devices, Vive and Rift, equally! I can't wait to play this game - It's got such promise!\n\nUntil then, I'll have to put my guns down and walk away.", "timestamp_created": 1504812402, "timestamp_updated": 1505101093, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509335", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34760462": {"recommendationid": "34760462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172839273", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519585671}, "language": "german", "review": "This game is one of the best for the htc vive, I couldn\u00b4t play it at first because of performance issues but now after some patches I can finally play it totally flawless with my xeon 5675,  it feels like when I played the first good military online shooter delta force 20 years ago it\u00b4s totally awesome you need to have this now!

Most people who have played the game for a long time are quick to help noobies. I think more people should use push to talk to be honest, as the vive does not have the best mic and it can pick up your breathing and it can get very loud. I do not judge, vr games are exhausting but I learned that people do not want to hear the efforts to live and I agree. There are a lot of actual veterans from all around the world playing too, and it is useful to watch their tactics (usually after I've died). In my opinion, its core playerbase right now is milsim enthusiasts and veterans which is expected from a milsim. I can totally see how one would spend hundreds of hours in this, it is totally addicting, as a game and as a tool. From a gamer's perspective, the people with actual war experience are very valuble to have on your team, so I treat them with respect because I want my team to win. But as an American I think soldiers kick ass, and I don't care how much money you spend trying to kill the bad guys. To the game. \n\nMultiplayer matches are 5v5 that last around 6-7 minutes but if you die early then you have to wait a bit. It's not terrible, take a seat and attention to what your team mates are doing. There are 6 maps, one or two have a night variant and there is a tanker level where you can recreate the ship level on CoD4. Watch those CORNERS. I have played them all, some more than others, but I still haven't memorized all of them yet as there are a lot of nooks and crannies where a bad guy can hide on every single level. Not every building has an interior, which is okay for now but hopefully they add more intereactivity with the environment as the game is developed. The graphics are decent and the levels are detailed enough to think that you are actually in that environment. Gameplay is solid, my aim can get a little shaky but it can be hard to aim like that in vr. I don't think there is a specific way to do it, unlike controlers in the past, the vive's controls are up to you. Sometimes I pull my controllers real close to my body so I can aim better and other times I extend further out.  Easily the best vr game I've played, others are good but none have come close to being this immersive and fun. \n\nSome feature that I think would be nice to have\nincreased server population\nmore heavy weapons (rpgs? at4's? That would be an interesting control scheme to see.)\ninformation about the guns, a description and their stats would be nice, I get guns but gameplay wise I did not know how to remove the magazine from an ak. The game teaches you to press down on your dominate hand track pad (htc vive) to eject a mag, cool works for tan team's guns, but once you start testing weapons out there are some things not covered such as having to manually pull some mags out on the black team's guns unlike the dropping action of STANAG mags. \nvaulting/mantling/jumping/crawling over or through walls and windows. \nRifle mounted grenade launchers\ndrone uav\nmore levels\n\npretty good for an early access game\nvery good for a vr game\nthe best milsim game out so far", "timestamp_created": 1504161609, "timestamp_updated": 1504161885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34626272": {"recommendationid": "34626272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182822487", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516766321}, "language": "english", "review": "The controls and feel for this game...

It isn\u2019t mean to be a Call of Duty clone but more based on strategy then a spray-and-pray shooter.\n\nWeapons are balanced with a fixed point system along with your kit load-out so no one player ever feels to OP. \nCommunications are open channel mics and radio coms located on your character making it very easy to spot, target, and eliminate threats. \n\nThe tunnel vision from being fired at to the heart beat pounding in your ears will have you on edge as every corner you turn; every room you enter, every step you take brings you one step closer to victory or defeat.\n\nHere\u2019s some game play of the recent map that Downpour Studios just unleashed for their Operative mode. \n\nNo commentary or silly clips just straight up game play of me vs 16 bots.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcoyHwCCiFA\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the cons because no game is without sin.\n\nAll the maps I\u2019ve come across have regions where you basically \u201cblackout\u201d and the screen goes dark.

At first i was very disoriented by the motion of this game but after about an hour im able to cope with the motion very well, im glad i gave this game a chance.

It being a \"hardcore\" VR multiplayer shooter I would recommend playing BAM first to really nail down going through (sometimes) complex reloads under fire and aiming accurately, without having to wait 5 or so between deaths.\n\nAs far as aiming goes, i would recommend 3D printing or building a \"noob toob\" out of PVC or just buying gun grips to steady your aim.

Another troll said the same thing and he said \"oh look my mommy bought me vr so I can go troll everyone because I have the best computer\" And the forum moderator out of nowhere said \"consider this a warning, that tone is not welcome here\" So I responded to the mod and told him that instead of telling the guy not to defend himself from trolls he should actually do his job and help the dude. So what happens then? The forum mod bans ME for a month for \"instigating a flame war\" I didn't even finish looking for help I just refunded it. Not worth the time when you get no support from the devs or anyone on their team.

This is the gaming we were waiting for a long time. \n\nSo why the negative review? Because it is very very poor optimized in terms of hardware resources. For me the game is barely playable at all and I never had any issue with 30+ other VR titles. I have tried to tweak the unity engine, Steam VR settings, Nvidia settings, supersampling and even with the lowest settings possible and after I tried every guide in the forums in the internet, I still have frame drops and the game stutters sometimes so much that Steam pauses the game every second where you can briefly see your Steam VR home area and returning you to your game that you cannot even move at all anymore. \nI do not want a refund, I do want to play this game. I really want to play this game, I love it, I need it.... but at the current state it is simply unplayable. \nIt is like you are a child and someone asks you if you want some ice cream, have you lick it only once so you know how it tastes and then takes it away from you on purpose to let it melt in the sun before your eyes.... Thats how it feels when you buy Onward. Not nice from you developer :-(\n\n*Further details see comments below*", "timestamp_created": 1494680161, "timestamp_updated": 1495151339, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487099", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31722424": {"recommendationid": "31722424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175479221", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516470563}, "language": "english", "review": "they ever fix the game for left handers? thats the reason i dont play", "timestamp_created": 1494676747, "timestamp_updated": 1494676747, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430795", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31713649": {"recommendationid": "31713649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000495350", "num_games_owned": 459, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504735141}, "language": "english", "review": "lag in main menu, even on lowest settings\n\nfreeze when loading into a game, lag in lobby.\n\nlag in game, to an unplayable degree.\n\nthe game worked OK When it first came out, now it works even less. before i was able to get into games, despite long loading and wait times, now i cant play at all...\n\nGTX 970 and i5 graphics card, in case you wanted to know", "timestamp_created": 1494639529, "timestamp_updated": 1494639529, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.401998", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31705705": {"recommendationid": "31705705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303908840", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494604887}, "language": "english", "review": "Really like this game, I didn't realise that there were no respawns, which was a little disappointing, but I understand that the game is trying to be completely realistic.

Aiming a 4x or 12x actually takes skill, and time. \n\n-You have limited ammo, so you actually have to manage your shots well\n\n-Every sound from gunshots, granades, wind, to people talking is very good quality.\n\n-When your being shot at, you are actually BEING SHOT AT. Your vision gets darker around the edges and you hear every bullet snap.

Its amazing.\n\n-This is a fact.\n\n-Best VR game out there. The gameplay basically feels like CS source had a bastard baby with ARMA 2. But that isnt even accurate because VR is involved. \n\n-Its better than both. Place yourself phycsically inside the ARMA 2 or cs battle with bullets raining down around your head while you try to stay calm and return fire or pop a smoke to book it. You can commit friendly fire by shooting your own team because you forgot your color or you panicked. There is no other indicator beside looking at your pad or the color of the guy. Or go completely Batman with a silencer and hiding in the shadows. You can actually follow near by player positions simply based on sound. By listening to him walk, talk, reload, or any other action that might cause a sound you can follow positions easily. Remeber local chat is always enabled so enemies can hear you and your family/friends/pet in the background too. \nThats just some of the the crazy situations that this game places you in. \n\n-FIrst games will be rough becuase you have to unlearn many old game mechanics. For instance there is not an auto aim feature that provides bullet drift towards a target. You have to literally line up your sights and fight recoil like a real gun. Spray and pray is just that. YOU spray and hope to god it hits something and in general you wont if you do that. Dont be the new guy that goes lmg, p90, or bolt action sniper without learning the nuances of reloading and charging them. They are more complex then the other guns and new players need to just learn the basics. \n\n- Protip - If you can reliably reload it, its a good gun. Seems simple but as said before new people forget you cant really pick up every gun and work them all the same. \n\n-After 150 hours I built my own stock that can release both hands to free float to throw nades or use the pistol and quickly return to locked position for rifle use. I recommend doing this after a few dozen hours in bc it is the next step in getting better at Onwards and basically makes long range a viable option. \n\n-Community is generally great. There are a few issues with the offical discord negating in game chat and players able to get to odd areas but in general those matches are 1/1000. If you need a help or a tip they will generally help but you have to try. If you arent talking and just standing at spawn trying to figure things out. Everyones gonna have a bad time and you will get kicked. Although if you are just standing at spawn and are asking for help and what not, thats not too bad. A few sessions in the fireing range learning to run and reload are crucial.

Without the usual push-to-talk option, players are encouraged more so than usual to talk to each other, be it in the lobby waiting for the game to start, while next to each other in-game, or over the radio in-game.  Rememeber though - If your team can hear you talking and the enemy is close enough to you, they can hear you talking too!\n\nOnce you've selected your loadout for the current map and team composition and the map loads, you have 16 seconds to discuss tactics with your team, or - as a lot of people seem to do - just fire at each other and throw grenades because you don't take damage during this time.  Once the 16 seconds is up, you have 6 minutes to either capture the objective (involving going to a small satellite dish and using your tablet to input a code, while avoiding getting your face shot off and teabagged while you're down), defend the objective (depending on which team you are on for that round, which is switched after each round), or just take out the opposing team before they have the chance to complete their objective or take you and your team out.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very immersive, with accurate feeling bullet drop and other gunnery mechanics.  When the time comes to reload, you have to eject your mag, reach to your spare mag (if you have one), grab it and put it into the gun, and then cock the gun before you can fire again - Or you can switch to your other gun or even a knife if you don't have time to reload or just want to feel like a badass rambo player.\n\nThis is by far the most fun game I've played in a VERY long time, and it's always been because of the players that you come across; sure you always get the team killers, and trolls, and those guys that go AFK as soon as a match starts, but the vast majority are willing to work together, and enjoy having a laugh.

I bought this game early December 2016 and couldn't get over some issues I was experiencing. I was getting kicked back to the main SteamVR load screen randomly, then back to the game again every 2 minutes or so, seemed like a resources / optimization issue. Holding the weapon seemed real cumbersome so I was shooting rifles one-handed (holy recoil). Also, simple tasks like using the radio, using the tablet, and reloading were very difficult to learn (no I didn't watch the tutorial, yes, I know that might have helped, lol). I also couldn't figure out how to get into the firing range, it's still not real clear but after Googling, I figured it out.\n\nUntil last night I didn't understand how the game had overwhelmingly positive feedback. Well, last night I fired it up an hour before I wanted to be in bed. I played for 4 hours. I couldn't put the game down! I was having a blast even though I had 0 kills for the first 2+ hours, lol. Well done, I love this game, definitely recommending it to my friends, especially the military types and Arma III fans.

I own a Vive and a Rift Touch setup, but this review is for the Vive as that's what I used to play this.\n\nThe same super annoying user experience bugs were still there (menus flaking out, ways to get into a state that deadlocks, etc). The game mechanics are awkward at best. Some of this may be solved with a gun shaped controller, but a lot of it is just silly lack of attention to game mechanics detail. Working the bolts on many guns will cause your controllers to clack together, for example, and sometimes it's almost impossible to draw the bolt back because your controller is in the way.\n\nGameplay is ultra slow paced. Of the four or five rounds I played today, the ONLY time I saw a member of the enemy team was after I was shot in the back, once.\n\nThe movement makes me sick. It's slow, and that helps, but I still feel slightly ill after a half hour in game. Is there a comfort mode? There should be if there isn't. (See Google Earth VR flight mode defaults for details of \"comfort mode\")\n\nLag seemed to be a constant issue. I have a a fiber connection and play a lot of Titanfall 2. Lag usually isn't an issue. But the live feeds from my team mates when I was dead were always super choppy. Many people I played with spoke with a heavy accent, making me think they weren't even in my country. Maybe better match making based on geographic location?\n\nI mean, I get it. Counterstrike clone for VR, right? Single dev? That's fine. As a fellow VR dev I can appreciate the massive amount of work that obviously went into Onward. And maybe I just don't like counterstrike anymore (haven't played since 1999-2000), I don't know.  I just think the focus should be less on ultra realism at the expense of user experience and more on fun gameplay. A spawn gameplay mode would be nice. Fix the annoying UI bugs. Stop making my controllers clack together.

I am Arma fan and wasn't impressed with Screenshot or Videos for this title.  This is one of those titles where the screenshot and videos do not capture the entire VR experience.  The first time you play this sim you are in shock when standing next to a full 6 foot tall human being in your squad.  Most VR multiplayer games model only hands, head, or chest.  This game models full bodys and gear and the animations are very natural.  Your teamates don't glitch or look awkward while moving or changing postions.  The models for both weapons and gear you carry are very good.  When looking down you see you chest plate carrier, grenade, syringes for first aid, and holstered sidearm.  You also have access to nightvision by using right hand and right trigger finger to activate, a map (if squad leader) from back pocket, a knife from left shoulder harness (pull out using trigger), and radio toggle on left shoulder (side buttons on right paddle).   This is using right hand dominant configuration (game allows you to choose your dominant hand).  At first it seems like alot but, after awhile you start picking up natural movements of releasing magazines and grabbing new ones.  It adds a whole new element of firefights when having to physically go through actions while suppressed or taking cover.  the game also has a practice mode and close quarter firerange you can walkthrough and shoot targets.

What do you buy? Sure you gotta pick up your Labs and Job Simulators to break in the hardware, then various games to test a bunch of different gun and swordplay mechanics, then visit Rec Room for a social multiplayer experience.\n\nBut none of these hold a candle to Onward and just how robust a game it really is. For a simple title with a few maps, one mode, some bugs, and developed by only one guy, it's remarkably polished and the attention to detail is exquisite. Even better, it's an absolutely compelling multiplayer VR game relying on simple, but immersive and effective mechanics.\n\nFor a point of comparison, think Arma meets Counter-Strike, and for those of you who tried out Hot Dogs, Horse Shoes, and Hand Grenades with your fancy HMD gizmo, you'll feel like you discovered H3's hidden multiplayer mode. The concept is that it's realistic 4v4 military-simulator first-person-shooty combat with large maps and one mode, \"War\", where attackers have to hack a satellite dish while the opposite team tries to defend it. While this all sounds relatively simple, it's the execution and immersion that makes this game a genuine cut above.\n\nWhen you need to reload, you have to manually eject the clip, grab a new one off your kevlar vest, put it into the gun and load the chamber. If a teammate gets incapacitated (as opposed to plain dead), you have to grab a revive syringe off your jacket, hold it over their body, hold the trigger button, then push in the trackpad button like you would with a real syringe. You can stand, crouch, and prone realistically and duck behind cover while your player model seems to accurately, and realistically track, every movement you make. Contacting your teammates is also given a dash of realism, as you can hear them when they're close, but when they're far away you have to bring your hand to your shoulder to use your radio, and of course, they can't respond when they're dead, potentilly even killed by your own hand! When you need to navigate a map or relay a location to your teammates, you have a tablet device you pull from a back pocket as well as a wristwatch as directional compasses to point out to your team where in relation enemies are to you. Even capturing the object is integrated into the gameplay, as you have to pull out your tablet device, read a code displayed in your tablet, and then go into a keypad to manually type it in in order to win the game. All those are just the mechanics built around a very well-polished and satisfying bit of simulated gunplay!\n\nThe best part? The game does all this without any extra button commands or a single piece of UI or HUD to operate your natural movements, instincts, and combat-related information. Couple this with some excellent sound design (and a really good subdued soundtrack on top of that), very detailed models and varied, detailed maps, it all comes together as a seamless experience. You'll wind up feeling like you're really there in the heat of battle, where one wrong move could get you killed. There are no Classes or Perks to be found here.\n\nThe maps available are also suprisingly solid. Most of the maps are assymmetric, and rely on using landmarks in order to navigate or call enemy positions. There's also a lot of interplay with verticality (though unfortunately the highest building you can climb is no more than three stories high) and long ranges that make for intense sniper shoot-outs. Close-quarters combat also can work well in Subway, which has a street level and a subway section transitioning from long-distance firefights to cramped quarters. There's even a solid mostly-symmetric map in the form of Suburbia which creates quick confrontations and intense indoor-to-outdoor combat.\n\nThat's not to say the game isn't perfect, however. As of the time of this writing, the game is short on maps sporting 3 unique maps, and 2 others with day/night variants. War is also the only mode available in the game, and there's no matchmaking nor leaderboard components to add to the competitive scene. There's also no way to customize load-outs outside of pre-matches for quick selections of favored gear. It'd be nice to tweak these while you're dead and waiting for the round to end, on top of maybe some more physics toys to mess around with or a simple shooting range to practice while you wait. There's also some getting used to required for the trackpad/thumbstick-based movement that can lead to motion sickness if you're easily prone to that. There's no blink mechanics here!\n\nBut what's interesting is that the mechanics are so tightly and well-constructed, it makes up drastically for these shortcomings and only shows potential for future modes to be built around such a solid framework. In fact, the strong community in the game came up with a few good ideas of their own such as hostage rescues, pistols or knives-only, no night-vision in night maps, and more. It's exciting to think what things might be like if these kinds modes were incorporated into the game with others to round out the very well-made War mode. Higher player counts could also make for interesting matches on the larger maps.\n\nOnward is a compelling and astounding accomplishment in the forray of VR shooters, and is a remarkable proof-of-concept in a multiplayer title for hardcore VR gamers. And it's done by a single man.\n\nVR needs more innovators like the mind behind Downpour Studios, because Onward, even in Early Access, is an incredible achievement of superb game design wrapped up in an affordable and enjoyable replayable multiplayer package at a well-placed price. This is a must-have for any Vive or Oculus Rift w/ Touch owners looking to take a fun, tense, immersive peek into the future of VR gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1487563084, "timestamp_updated": 1487563256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764118", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30024322": {"recommendationid": "30024322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095322832", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520129175}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely one of my favorite VR games, easily makes the whole headset worth it.

At its core it is a mid/late 2000's purely multiplayer tactical FPS. While I enjoy the genre, I am always a bit weary of the crowd it attracts, There was also the issue of movement. Everybody and their aunt is raving about Onward movement system being super awesome and honestly, I am also weary of hype. \n\nSo ... how did it fare against my relatively negative expectations? Pretty well. The movement system works okay for me, but I am not prone to VR sickness to start with. It is still a bit unwieldly, especially running seems to be of the hit and miss variety, but all in all it works. The gameplay and visuals are exactly what I expected : if it was a 2D game there wouldn't be much to talk about. As it is in VR though, the gameplay transcend its roots and become seriously engrossing. The visuals are not super detialled, but the framerate (on an i5-6600, GTX 1070) is perfectly stable, which is much more important in that case (especially in conjunction with the movement system).\n\nAnd now to the multiplayer aspect. There are no bots nor single player mode in Onward, so you really have to play and interact with other people. This results in two problems : first of all, you need to find a game to join, and secondly, you can only hope you won't be playing with griefers who only want to spoil the game for everybody. \nI didn't find a game to join. All were full which I found irritating and disappointing. In retrospect, this was ctuially a *good* thing. It means that there is a healthy (for a VR game) playerbase. Nevertheless I decided to start a server and check out the maps solo. Within 30 seconds of creating a  room I was joined by 5 other players (which became 7 on the second round). Some of the players were as new as me, but everybody was extremely friendly and helpful. It was MUCH better than I had expected, and it was, most importantly, *FUN*\n\ntl;dr : your standard tactical FPS but in VR, with an interesting (although still not perfect) movement system and a healthy and *friendly* playerbase.

Even if you're well versed in the realm of PC M+KB shooters, you really haven't come close to the kind of freedom Onward provides you with your actions. Now, thanks to the Vive (or Oculus Touch if you swing that way) you're awarded the ability to be in a virtual war like never before.\n\nNow you get to duck for cover while under fire. You fumble with this new gun you never picked before now, cursing the day you ever thought you liked the Aug. You say \"fuck it,\" standing up off of your living room floor while gripping your side arm. You move Onward blasting at the man dressed in black. He disappears behind a bush and you ready yourself to finish him... Victory appears in front of you. You won the round and saved the day. Not with mouse clicks and key presses, but by literally pointing that glock at that dude\u2019s face. Onward is littered with moments like this that would be just another \u201cmeh\u201d kill in Call of Duty or whatever into a heart pumping battle to the fucking death.\n\nIt\u2019s really great, guys.\n\nThe biggest downside is that there's some downtime between rounds, though that should motivate you to try hard to not get shot, stabbed or blown up. You also need your VR legs (while also not being susceptible to motion sickness) to handle the movement.  I barely count this as a negative because the game is early and thus constantly in flux but there is some annoying glitches and rough edges here and there. Certainly nothing game breaking though or anything that would stay my excitement for Onward. Some would also classify the steeper-than-average learning curve as a negative but personally I find that to make it all the more rewarding when you finally do start kicking ass regularly. \n\nOnward is arguably the best shooter in VR right now and anyone even vaguely interested in seeing how this genre has progressed -- as well as a glimpse into the future of what other VR FPS's can offer -- needs to give it a shot.

Conceptually I like this method better than teleporting, but in practice it's not usable for me yet.  I'd suggest adding options to adjust the speed and sensitivity of the dpad movement, including the potential for an extended acceleration curve (at room scale, quick movements can be done without the need for dad movement).  The sudden change in motion speed I think is the most disconcerting part at present.  \n\nAnother useful feature would be a reentering option for room scale.

The resolution of the Vive simply isn't high enough to accurately determine where players are, who's friendly and who isn't.\n\nIt's also very difficult to aim a weapon without using a special attachment for your Vive controllers that you either have to buy or make yourself. Without them, you just kinda hold both hands in the air awkwardly as you wobble them around trying to keep your aim still. Imagine you have a large cardboard tube. You know, like the ones that wrapping paper comes on. Imagine holding it by the end, a foot away, and trying to look through it. That's what aiming in this game feels like. They need to implement some kind of auto-level system, where if you raise your weapon to your face, it will automatically raise or lower it so you're looking through the sights. Even when you hold your weapon with two hands, you'll always be either aiming too high or too low. The reason behind this is because your non-dominant hand can influence your aim. While it's realistic, it's a hassle and makes my arms sore because I'm constantly holding them up. You cannot rest your arms. Ever.\n\nIt's also just not \"fun\" to play this game. Could just be opinion, but crouching in a corner for 5 minutes every round just isn't fun to me. This game would probably be better if I played it sitting down. Kind of wish I actually tried that before I refunded it, but oh well. It's also not fun to just get shot in the back of the head and have no idea what happened. Even in ARMA after you're killed you usually get a message telling you how you died.\n\nMy first dilemma shines true, though. The Vive simply isn't high enough resolution for this game. In Mil-Sims, you're constantly fighting enemies who are over 20m away at all times, and anyone past that distance is just a few pixels. Trying to determine whether or not they're friendly when they're just a few pixels is a big problem.\n\nForgot to mention, there's no tutorial. The provided one is an 8 minute YouTube video that's completely unedited and done in one take. The only way to learn how to play the game is to join a multiplayer match and literally ask other players to teach you. Now not only can you not play the game, neither can they because they have to teach you how the game works.\n\nEDIT: It has come to my attention that my problem with visiblity can be fixed with the SteamVR \"supersampling\" settings. Unfortunately I don't own the game so I can't test it, plus my other complaints are still valid (tutorial) so I'm not changing my review. Maybe someday I will give the game another chance.\n\nEDIT 2: Nope.

Locmotion is intuitive and not sickness-enducing, crouching or hiding for cover all works well, weapons etc work as you'd expect. Its a lot of fun and - once you get used to the level layouts - becomes very tactical very quickly.\n\nI hope the devs upgrade for more players as the maps would easily support 8 or 12 per side - and that would make for a more fun experience as the only downside is that you can walk around for a long time without seeing anyone and then the briefest of firefights and its over. In that regard its very much like counterstrike - so if you are expecting a shooting frenzy this is not it. That said, it can be very rewarding accordingly and even with 4 players on one side, commerardery (sp?) builds up quickly.\n\nThe only real criticism I have is not really the game's fault. Any players more than a virtual 150 yards away are represented by so few pixels on your headset that you cannot always tell which side they are on - there are simply not enough pixels to allow your eyes to differentiate between dark khaki and black colours of the opposing clothes. This will improve with hardware resolution over time, but in the meantime maybe a 'garish' mode could be introduced where players were more brightly coloured (red/blue) to help a little until then (I appreciate this would give a tactical advantage so perhaps would have to be applied to everyone as an option for that game session).\n\nOverall a great game design and experience - devs of other FPSs should take note.", "timestamp_created": 1486140156, "timestamp_updated": 1486140156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29671346": {"recommendationid": "29671346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020860932", "num_games_owned": 605, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503453238}, "language": "english", "review": "Game looks cool but I was never able to get it to start on my Occulus Cv1.

Don't get me wrong, this is Milsim paced, so if you stand up when you should be eating floor you're getting your head blown off, but your team won't be too mean about it and people will explain what you did wrong. Questions (especially how do I reload/run) are expected, as long as you ran through the firing range at least once. Anyway, I want to lean on that - great people to play the game with and games always running, so if you enjoy the game, you won't be put off by who you have to play it with.\n\nAs for the game, it's basically COD/Arma but MilSim paced/with one life. You fire pretty realistic looking/feeling weapons, including realistic reloading/grenade proceedures which keep the game from becoming a nade fest. Ammo is restricted, and most fights you won't use more than one magazine anyway because the sound design is wicked good in this game - shooting like a maniac, running and hopping around, talking... these things will get you killed. Some maps are wide open and your whole team may get sniped by one guy if you're not careful, others like subway are more chaotic. \n\nThe shooting on oculus is good and responsive - and the controls, while complicated, are great for the touch - I never thought the controlls killed me when I died and shots went where my iron sights told me they'd go. You do want to have a clear room area and not be embarassed to go prone or crouch though - cover matters. Shots around walls, over cover, hiding, etc are important and your spouse is going to laugh at you as you try to achieve them, be warned.\n\nMovement is touchpad based, and may make some people sick but it doesn't bother me.\n\nGraphics are good on my pretty good computer - I turned them to the lower setting but that's more for framerate than anything (i7, 970) - and the full graphics are pretty great for VR though will require a decent rig if you want to use them. \n\nRight now it's only 4 on 4 but they plan to expand that to (12 on 12?) squad on squad as the bugs get kicked out, of which there aren't that many. Content is a bit thin but it's early access so NBD.\n\nSo yeah, really fun game, great community, a lot of potential.", "timestamp_created": 1486074935, "timestamp_updated": 1486074935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631464", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29649837": {"recommendationid": "29649837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127803128", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 5558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "last_played": 1521201462}, "language": "english", "review": "Insurgency VR", "timestamp_created": 1486046014, "timestamp_updated": 1486046014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29644203": {"recommendationid": "29644203", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982755437", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502576677}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent.", "timestamp_created": 1486022678, "timestamp_updated": 1486022678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29642925": {"recommendationid": "29642925", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980864817", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518565808}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have a Vive/Rift, GET IT!

I couldnt go 30 minutes before I had to take a break because i felt like i was going to be sick. The unatural feeling of seeing the world move around you but not being able to feel the movement definetly messed with my system. After about 2 hours of total gametime i noticed the dissiness start to go away and after 6 hours i can say the movement doesnt affect me in a noticable way. \nmy advice is to play till you feel you need to stop, then come back a few hours later and keep doing this until you dont need to stop from dissiness or sickness.\n\nthe immersion is amazing. As a long time airsoft player i know the feeling of urgency in the middle of an intence game and no video game has been able to give me that feeling until now.\n\nthere are bugs but nothing truely gamebreaking such as occasionaly falling through the ground on a few maps and one player from the opposite team somehow spawning in our spawn area, but other than that it is pretty stable. no major crashes just the occasional glitch. very playable. still less glitchy than many AAA releases.\n\nAt the moment magnified scopes pretty much are terrible (worse than those $20 scopes from walmart) and barely useable but it is more of the nature of the vive where the controlers will allways have that jitteryness to them. \n\nOnly one gamemode and 7 maps at the moment but the maps are well layed out and pretty balanced.\n\nIf they did some more bug fixing, added more maps, weapons, and game modes i would deffinetly pay $60 if they go for a full release.\n\n\n9.5/10 for an early access game that costs $25\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1485329225, "timestamp_updated": 1485329225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29475404": {"recommendationid": "29475404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310443041", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519695779}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most fun games ive played in vr yet.

Controls feel natural, gunplay is satisfying, defeat feels fair, and victory tastes like ambrosia.\n\nThe locomotion in this game is a ground-breaker for the fledgling VR community and should be the standard that all VR games are to be compared to. Crouching, prone, standing, running are all intuitive and take almost no time to get used to. All controlled by the touchpad, you can walk, run, sprint, and even crawl. Because of the direction of your locomotion being decided by the direction of your non-dominant hand, you almost never get motion-sickness. \n\n*There is NONE of the teleporting that the other shovelware-tier VR games have*\n\n(And truly, if you do get motion sickness, sell your HMD and never touch VR again, because you and your teleporting cancer are going to kill VR gaming) \n\nTaking out items from the chest harness may be difficult at first, but the inclusion of a shooting range for training can help hone your reflexes. I've spent at least 4 hours in total in the shooting range practicing \"cutting the pie\", going around corners, sniping, point shooting, and of course, reloading. I've gotten to the point where I can reload an SMG or assault rifle on reflex in less than 2 seconds, something I can say that I am mildly proud of.\n\nThis game rewards not only physical prowess and fine dexterity through gunplay, but also teamwork and effective communication. Therefore, when two teams are equal in marksmanship, superior tactics will decide who comes out victorious.  Because of this, skill in this game is not a point and click adventure like most FPS games, but a test and display of superior body and mind. Every victory and every defeat in a multiplayer game only serves to make you better as a player. \n\nThe community is second to none so far, although with the Oculus Rift compatability released, there have been an influx of Christmas jerks who have been nothing but toxic. The \"twitch.tv\" crowd is starting to jump onto Onward as welll, unfortunately.\n\nTruly the first killer app for the HTC Vive.", "timestamp_created": 1484548075, "timestamp_updated": 1484548256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29282787": {"recommendationid": "29282787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018914049", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "last_played": 1520880621}, "language": "english", "review": "A must have for the Vive!", "timestamp_created": 1484512663, "timestamp_updated": 1484512663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29282599": {"recommendationid": "29282599", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970309124", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515849560}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best VR game and one of the best games ever made, there is absolutely no game out there that comes even close to what it's like to play a match of Onward.\n\nIf there was only one game for the Vive, and this was it it, it would still be worth the 800$", "timestamp_created": 1484512048, "timestamp_updated": 1484512048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29270760": {"recommendationid": "29270760", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965884250", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 275, "last_played": 1521503873}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor shooter hasta la fecha", "timestamp_created": 1484480822, "timestamp_updated": 1484480822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29265535": {"recommendationid": "29265535", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989005349", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517272152}, "language": "english", "review": "THE BEST VR games out there right now.

Fantastic game and one I'll come back to again and again, because this actually feels like a game. Not the same scripted event to replay, and not an overblown tech demo. I really regret not buying this sooner.\n\nLong version -  \n\n\nLet me just begin by congratulating the (SINGULAR) developer Dante, who I do not know personally, on creating an absolutely fantastic VR title, and in my opinion solving the locomotion problem for VR in general. Other games should be taking notes of the way touchpad movement is implemented in this game. Again, I totally regret not getting this game on release because its just so damn good and has all the replayability of a conventional couch first person shooter x10. The VR experience just adds something unquantifiable to the shooter genre, as with all VR games you just have to play it to believe it i'm afraid.\n\nTo me, the best feature of the game, and definately the most important thing in VR for the tech to have some staying power, is how player locomotion is handled, it's what will elevate the countless numbers of wave shooters, teleportation type games and chapter based stories to a level where a game is not only engaging in the virtual reality sense, but is also capable of letting the player explore a living breathing world by themselves in a more natural way, and better draw the player in to a deep, rich narrative, because the player got there by themselves, they weren't placed there to watch a scripted scene run its course. \n\nNow, just to be clear i'm not saying that this game has any of those things, i'm sorry if I've mislead but this is a tactical multiplayer shooter that has its sights firmly on the milsim enthusiasts rather than the call of duty, arcade shooter type players. However, I think every kind of fps lover will adore this game. There is no story to be found here, (expect the epic and equally hilarious moments you'll want to tell anyone that will listen) it's purely a multiplayer shooter. But the foundation this game is built on, the locomotion, is fundamental to this game for it to work, and revolutionary for VR games going forward. Before now, touchpad controlled locomotion felt like such an inelegant way to solve the problem i honestly didn't think it possible for me to fully enjoy a game with such controls. But holy crap, Dante has nailed it. Here's why -\n\nBefore the Vive released I was following it's development intently, and despite a major concern of motion sickness, (Which I'm not great with) I preordered anyway and hoped for the best. I'd never experienced any VR before, and was so happy to find it didn't have me immediately being thrown out of the experience by making me feel sick. Admittedly, after maybe 40 minutes to an hour I needed a break from it, and over time I feel I've built up a pretty strong stomach when it comes to VR. In the beginning, I felt some games were just too much to handle, such as Windlands, which I can now play with relative comfort. Feeling fairly confident I could now handle the touchpad controlled locomotion of onward, I purchased the game. When I tried the game for the first time, i had a friend round who had never experienced any VR before that day. Project Cars and Elite Dangerous both made him feel a little queasy, so after I'd played a few rounds of onward and passed the Vive to him I was expecting the movement to throw him straight away. He said it felt weird...once. After that, he never mentioned it again other than to say he'd quickly got used to it, and not once did it make him feel sick. I'm sure that any VR owners, whether they have an iron stomach or not will appreciate how huge that is for VR. Honestly, when i'd played a round in complete comfort it was like a eureka moment, like this was the gamechanger I'd been waiting for whilst getting a little bored of wave shooters and other simplistic and non innovative ways of designing VR games.\n\nFor me personally, the key is having the touchpad direction controlled separately to the looking direction. Games where that is not the case, and you move forward only with the pad but control direction by looking totally throw me, it feels like the floor is being pulled out from under you and you're being dragged along. Totally unnatural and completely removes you from the experience. Because you are able to glance over your shoulder whilst knowing in advance which direction your body will travel feels so much more natural. For me, an absolute game changer.\n\nOkay, wow. Locomotion aside, here's other great reasons to buy.\n\nIt is one of the most pleasant online experiences I've had on any game, across every platform I've ever played. Everyone is there to have a blast and its such great fun. I've also found that anyone who goes against the friendly atmosphere is ignored or voted to be kicked, usually with things like insulting other players. Things like teamkills are usually forgiven with laughter because the game is so much fun. It's like being in the same room as players as you see their character bent over in hysterics when something funny happens, and it just adds another level of immersion when you see something like that, hearing an actual persons laughter whilst seeing their actual bodily reaction in real time when they can be from another continent is so strange, like skyping someone inside a tron like world.\n\nHaving all your gear attached to your body, once you have understood what individual buttons on the controllers are for, leads to an extremely intuitive experience, weapons function as you would expect, as does all other equipment, meaning you are able to guess how you access and control tools and features, and because you must manually reload weapons yourself instead of hitting a reload button these are a very natural feeling process as well. It also adds an extra level of pressure and calculation to your game, the pressure of being caught short by an enemy whilst reloading as it is no longer a scripted and predictable event, and the calculation the player must make before reloading as to whether it is worth  being personally vulnerable and also being unable to help teammates versus having a few extra bullets in your magazine.\n\nNo HUD means a much more immersive and realistic experience.\n\nThe attention to detail is phenomenal, you may try to trip the developer up by testing certain gun's functions versus their real life counterparts, and it seems he has thought of everything. Things like being able to see a bullet in the chamber, being able to empty a pistol by cocking the slide enough times, one in the chamber when you've ejected a full/partially full mag, releasing a locked back slide before loading a magazine means there is nothing in the chamber, and being able to powerstroke pistols are but a few great details that I can think of that are so impressive and prevent you from being pulled out of the experience.\n\nA damn solid multiplayer experience. Even without the fact its VR i would play this conventionally on a monitor.\n\nFinally, a VR game i really want to come back to again and again, because this actually feels like a game, not the same scripted event to replay, and not an overblown tech demo.", "timestamp_created": 1484100666, "timestamp_updated": 1484100716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597315", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29174393": {"recommendationid": "29174393", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990296054", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505119603}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredibly active dev and honestly the best locomotion system in any VR game that I've played make this a groundbreaking, fun experience. \n\nPros:\n+Guns handle wonderfully, and there are lots to customize and experiment with.\n+Locomotion system is SUPER good.

Pulling pins on grenandes, using the radio and everything else you can do is very very accurate to what it would be really like. Trying to stay calm while under fire and reload the weapon correctly adds something truly unique. You dont just press a button you have to do a small series of complex weapon drills. It also goes in reverse, if your applying pressure to someone or a group of people and they are so stressed they dont reload correctly they could be pulling the trigger with no chambered rounds. \n\nI work in law enforcement so i handle, load and unload a gun everyday (one of the guns in this game) and i can tell you the feeling is about as close as you can get to the real deal. The eye for detail is amazing. I use a radio everyday for work so the coms element of the game is fantastic. I have muscle memory for reaching for my radio to talk to people so it feels so natural to me. \n\nThe immersiveness is something you just dont find anywhere else other than VR. When you spawn in with your team mates and your all patting eachother on the head, pointing pistols and knives at eachother or cupping your buddies manhood it can be an absolute laugh.\n\nA game i had last night with 3 other guys 4v4 on quarantine1 map. I got a high vantage point on a roof and started using the radio to coms the enemy location. Managed to coordinate a few guys and get a few killed before being pinned down by sniper fire. I was literally proning on the ground of my bedroom floor listening to rounds whizz over my head thinking how am i going to escape this? Rolled onto my back and pulled a smoke grenade off my vest, pulled the pin and dropped it. Gave me some cover and i started to return fire.

You reload and charge the bolt of the rifle yourself and can change the firing modes as well and it is all very nice. You must remove the pins off grenades and then throw them which is good fun, you can even cook grenades! As someone who has fired all kinds of weapons and gone through cadetship you can really appreciate a lot of the work that went into this. \n\nHowever this is where things start going wrong. As an early accesss game it does need a lot polishing. For a start when I had to cock my weapon after a reload I would often hit my controllers together which was rather annoying and would not always allow me to charge the weapon fully. This can be... very stressful when getting shot at. I also had a lot of trouble hearing sounds when in the game, sometimes I could not tell whether someone had just stepped next to me or behind me. And it wasn't just sounds I had problems with, visual aspects of the game were quite straining to my eyesight. I don't wear glasses and have good vision, but the resolution problems with early VR access does make it hard to tell at a distance whether that object is an enemy standing still or a letterbox. \n\nOther issues included teamkilling. It has happened to me multiple times where a teammate may accidentally shoot me in the round or on purpose at the start. I find it frustrating that they don't seem to get punished, you can initiate a votekick but it is useless if they are playing with their friends.\n\nThese are just things I have observed with only 1.3 hours of gameplay. It certainly is a short time but overall I did not enjoy it. I do feel that this game and the fps genre have a lot of potential in VR, but that potential is yet to be realised in this game. Right now I cannot recommend this game, especially when, at the time of writing this, it costs almost \u00a320.

I seen one guy lose his hand up his ass and had to play the whole round one handed, but again its early access so this is expected.\n\u2022 If youre easily frustrated, new players will almost always ruin your day. From mistaking you as an enemy to grenade malfunctions, its really easy to screw up on this game if youre not sure what youre doing\n\u2022 2 game mode and a few maps. This will probably change but as of now, the variety is not that large although the game is still very fun.\n\u2022 Although this may be due to the Vive's capibilities,  the resolution at far distances is fairly crappy. it isnt bad enough you cant see people, but its enough that you cannot tell if its a friendly, enemy or a tree branch.\n\nAll in all I believe it was completely worth it,  and im excited for what the game has in store in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1483672014, "timestamp_updated": 1494523027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29049140": {"recommendationid": "29049140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115169136", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482895924}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1483665567, "timestamp_updated": 1483665567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29048787": {"recommendationid": "29048787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041160309", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517296949}, "language": "english", "review": "Round 1 begins. \n\nYou look toward the enemy, grasping your MX18 with both hands.

Even in its pre prelease state it is immersive and a ton of fun. But you will not have the most fun unless you configure your rift to let you play in 360 degrees. \nAt first I thought that was going to mean buying a third sensor, which I might do still. But to be clear 2 sensors work great for me in a pretty small space. I have tried every possible configuration for the two sensors and this is what works best for me.\n\nStep one- Place one sensor in front of you and the othor behind you. Have about 6-8 ft between the sensors. (you can do this diagonally so you arent placing a sensor in front of your monitor.)\n\nStep two- Set the sensors higher than a desk. I have both of mine set up at about 5 1/2 ft above the floor.\n\nStep three- Run through the Steam vr Standing room setup. Make sure the floor spacing is accurate. I usually have to input an extra 12 inches even though my oculus is sitting on the ground. \n\nStep four- TEST IN THE GUN RANGE. Dont jump into a game right away. Go to a single player gun range and test things out. If things arent tracking correctly you can adjust your sensors pointing them higher or lower in real time. Make it so you can spin in a cirle while aiming down your sights with no issues. Try spin in the circle again crouched. If both dont work seamlessly. You probably need to point a sensor higher or lower.  Check to make sure that the floor is in the right area. If it is too high, the game will assume you are always crouching, and you wont be able to sprint in game. You will get MURDERED. \n\nStep five- If you adjusted the sensors or notice that the floor was incorrectly placed run through the Steam vr standing room set up one more time.'\n\nStep six- Test everything again in the gun range.

Yes, but it's ok. You sometimes have to rejoin or restart and read some Tipps on performance when you have a weaker PC (I'm playing with a GTX970 - and it runs fine - after I spent a few minutes searching for Tipps on performance). Has it a steep learning curve? No, not really. You have to rethink some of the stuff that you \"learned\" in conventional FPS games, but anybody who played Counterstrike should feel at home after 3-4 rounds. Will I throw up? Probably. I felt some slight motion sickness at the beginning. My Tipp: Start on the shooting range. Get used to movement and controlls. I did that for 10-30 Minutes and then had a pause. Now, I have no problems with motion sickness. Will I be TKed and screamed at by teenagers? No. Not one (intentional!) TK so far and very few annoying people. In fact the community is by far the nicest I met in a long time. If you have questions, ASK - nobody will mock you! They will help you! Incredible! I have a Rift, can I play with two sensors? Yes. I do that as well. And it's working really nicely with the 360 experimental Setup. I ordered a third sensor anyway, but it works fine with just two.\n \nSo: You really should get it!

You load in, check your map for the objective, ask everybody their names, then head out to acheive your objective. After the match everybody loads into the loby and of course, you must establish your dominance when you winThis game utilizes a realistic gameplay to really make the game fun, extremely rewarding, and intensively immersive. The community is the best part about the game due to the fact that everybody is always talking and messing around. The only upside to the pricey cost of Virtual Reality sets is that it keeps the community of players restricted to older people and excludes annoying kids you will find on Call of Duty. You should definetly play the tutorial because the game is very in depth and you won't be able to \"figure it out\" in your first game.  The proximity talking combined with the walkie talkies adds a great dynamic to the game and also allows you to talk to the enemy team if you're close enough.

The way the dev's make you release an empty magazine, pick one out of your ammo belt, insert said magazine (you can hit a button to slam the action closed; if there is no round in the chamber) or rack it. This depends greatly on the gun you are trying to surface but the attention to detail is second to none. The thing i like the most of this VR shooter is the radio to get the tactical advantage. Be careful though because not only can the enemies hear your (beeeep) radio but also your voice. Some people play with a \"VR Stock\"; I made my own out of a stock I had extra for my 10-22. It really does make shooting much easier, or aiming at least.

I would even attempt a \"solo\" shooting range, and would still get kicked back to the main menu. I spent a couple of days troubleshooting, assuming it may be my network connection, but the best I can tell, it is the game that is at fault. This particular issue doesn't seem to be that common though, I was only able to find one other person on the forums that had a similar issue.\nThus, even in an alpha state, the game is not even playable for me. Others have reported many other bugs, even though that's to be expected, don't buy if you're not willing to work around those.\nAside from that, I would also like to say that some of the controls need work. Overall, locomotion was fine and grabbing grenades...etc, but I for the life of me couldn't get the reloading to work even following the instructions on the forums and the tutorial video. Of course, I was unable to stay in a game for more than a few minutes, so I didn't have much time to get used to it ;-)\nOn the plus side of things, the community is overall very helpful and nice.

Le fait de recharger son arme manuellement apporte une complexit\u00e9 au gameplay bienvenue; \u00e7a \u00e9vite de se retrouver \u00e0 rusher en face de 4 ennemis sans se soucier du chargeur vide.\n-Les d\u00e9placements peuvent paraitre d\u00e9routant mais au final c'est la meilleure alternative pour apporter encore une fois du r\u00e9alisme.

Que dire si ce n'est qu'Onward est pour moi le meilleurs jeux VR que j'ai pu test\u00e9 dans sa cat\u00e9gorie (c'est \u00e0 dire FPS en PvP). C'est bien la premi\u00e8re fois que je ne regrette pas l'achat d'un jeu en early access. Onward est le genre de jeu dans lequel cela fait 4 parties que tu en es \u00e0 ta derni\u00e8re partie. Le jeu propose un gameplay dans lequel l'esprit d'\u00e9quipe et la communications sont primordiales. Dans ce jeu, n\u2019esp\u00e9rez pas courir \u00e0 d\u00e9couvert avec un fusils d\u2019assaut en mode full auto et rester en vie longtemps.\n\nLes + :\n - Une bonne dose d'adr\u00e9naline.\n - Un jeu assez exigeant (dans le bon sens du terme). Il m'a fallut plus de 2 heure pour faire mon premier kill.\n - Des armes tr\u00e8s r\u00e9aliste avec une bonne maniabilit\u00e9.\n - La sant\u00e9 ne se r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e8re pas d'elle m\u00eame. Un balle ou deux suffise \u00e0 mourir. (Il y a tout de m\u00eame la possibilit\u00e9 de se soigner ou de r\u00e9animer un co\u00e9quipier \u00e0 terre gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une seringue)\n - Le syst\u00e8me de communication est plut\u00f4t bien foutu, et m\u00eame assez intuitif: les personnes \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 nous entendent comme IRL, et une radio est \u00e0 disposition pour communiquer avec le reste de l'\u00e9quipe.\n - Le mode de d\u00e9placement est plut\u00f4t bon (Pas de t\u00e9l\u00e9portation). J'avais un peu peur du motion-sickness au d\u00e9but, mais il n'en est rien. Je joue g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement plusieurs heures sans aucun soucis.\n - Pas de HUD qui casserait l'immersion. Par exemple, il n'y a pas d'indication sur le nombre de balles restant dans le chargeur, ce qui oblige \u00e0 compter ses balles si on veux savoir \u00e0 quel moment recharger.\n - Les tirs de suppressions sont assez bien fichu. On sent une r\u00e9el pression lorsqu'on les subit.\n - Une bonne communaut\u00e9 dans l'ensemble, m\u00eame si de temps \u00e0 autre on tombe sur petit rigolo qui s'amuse \u00e0 descendre toute sa team en d\u00e9but de partie (\u00c7a reste heureusement marginal, et ce genre de personnes sont tr\u00e8s vite quick\u00e9). \n - De plus en plus de Fran\u00e7ais (on croise aussi pas mal d'anglais, am\u00e9ricain et allemand, ... donc la langue principalement parl\u00e9 est l'anglais).\n - Peu importe \u00e0 quelle heure de jour ou de la nuit vous souhaitez jouer, vous trouverez toujours un serveur disponible. En revanche, je pense qu'il y a encore trop peu de joueur puisqu'en moyenne il y a 6 - 8 serveur de 8 joueurs ouverts, soit moins de 64 joueurs sur l'ensemble du globe. Donc surtout n\u2019h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 venir enrichir cette communaut\u00e9.\n\nLes  - :\n\n - Trop peu de maps pour le moment, mais la cr\u00e9ation de map devrait \u00eatre ouverte \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 sous peu.\n - Un seul mode de jeu, mais d'autres sont pr\u00e9vu, donc \"wait and see...\"\n - Encore pas mal de petits bugs (\u00e9cran noir, tableau des scores qui p\u00e8te un plomb, joueurs bloqu\u00e9 au spawn, passer \u00e0 travers le sol et atterrir sous la map). Heureusement, on ne rencontre ces bugs que assez rarement. On les pardonnera d\u2019ailleurs pour le moment \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le jeu est encore early access.\n - Une prise en main un peu difficile au d\u00e9but (d'autant plus qu'il n'y a pas de vrai tuto \u00e0 ce jour), mais une fois l'\u00e9tape d'apprentissage pass\u00e9, c'est un vrai plaisir.\n - Quelques soucis d'optimisation. On peut constater quelques baisses de framerate dans certaines zones de certaines cartes. Le jeu tourne n\u00e9anmoins plut\u00f4t bien en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n - Le fait d'avoir en main des manettes, et non r\u00e9ellement une arme (donc pas de poids, pas de crosse...) fait un peu perdre en stabilit\u00e9 en donc en pr\u00e9cision. Il est tout de m\u00eame possible de se fabriquer un support pour les manettes avec des tubes en PVC et un peu d'imagination.\n - Encore quelques grillages \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve des balles.\n - Pas de possibilit\u00e9 de grimper au \u00e9chelles ou de franchir un obstacle pas plus haut qu'une table. Il semble toute fois que cette fonctionnalit\u00e9 soit pr\u00e9vu dans un future plus ou moins proche.\n - La r\u00e9solution du vive encore trop faible rend assez la distinction des joueurs au loin assez difficile. (m\u00eame si la je chipote un peu, ce n'est pas vraiment un probl\u00e8me inh\u00e9rent au jeu)\n\n\n En r\u00e9sum\u00e9 : Un excellent jeu tr\u00e8s immersif et assez exigent. Encore beaucoup de possibilit\u00e9 d'am\u00e9lioration en terme de fonctionnalit\u00e9 et de contenu et quelques bugs bloquant survienne de temps \u00e0 autre. Ce jeu \u00e0 un \u00e9norme potentiel.

Onward is quite tactical and very immersive, to the point that my nerves get the best of my during the tense \"eye of the storm moments\" right before a battle.\n\nWhat has me so thrilled about this game is the fact that they do not skimp out once on the opportunity to implement the immersive qualities VR has to offer. \n[*] Draw my rifle off my chest (were I chose to have it holstered in game options)\n[*] Fire wildly into the air at beginning of match (I shouldn't have to explain why)\n[*] Eject the magazine\n[*] Take new mag off my belt and load it into the gun\n[*] Rack the bullet (different based off of gun model)\n[*] Realize my team is no longer with me (See earlier bullets)\n[*] Team talks to me through talkies on their shoulder (I don't realize it's on my shoulder till later)\n[*] Enemy sneaks up on me and empties nothingness into my chest (My guess is that he followed steps 1 & 2 and didn't bother reloading)\n[*] I light the guy up (giggling like a little girl)\n[*] [b] AT THAT MOMENT I REALIZE WHERE THE TALKIE IS BECAUSE I CAN HEAR HIS TEAM FROM HIS SHOULDER [/b]\n[*] I then describe in full detail how their team mate was killed and how they are next\n[*] I'm sniped for screwing around with a dead guys walkie talkie (I deserved it)\n\n[spoiler] Made you look [/spoiler]\n\nThis game is everything I wanted it to be.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1480711401, "timestamp_updated": 1480711401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611730", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28145630": {"recommendationid": "28145630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028824290", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1521551316}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite possibly the best VR game to date.", "timestamp_created": 1480708031, "timestamp_updated": 1480708031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28132914": {"recommendationid": "28132914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033359745", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516199856}, "language": "english", "review": "I Dont Play this Too Much But It Definately Worth Having.

BUT! That's in one session. This game is fantastic. I've only stopped to wait for my animals to shut the f*** up so I don't annoy my mates in-game. So the informal, early review; \n\n     Onward is a first person shooter in VR form, akin to Counter Strike or ARMA, as silly as that sounds. It's a mil-sim (Military Simulator, not to insult anyone's intelligence) and it doesn't really fail at that, however, it plays out more like a simplified version of R6 Siege. You are pitted with seven other players in a map that the eight of you vote over. The teams, as expected, are divided into two, 4 on each squad. In itself, none of this sounds special. However, with this overused method applied to the Vive, this makes this game the most appreciated purchase I have made on the Vive, contending with maybe Audioshield. \n     You move about in your roomscale play area for the cover use and corridor maneuvering but the real movement takes place on the trackpad, being utilized as more of an analog stick. At first, I didn't like this method. It had been used in a horror game I tried a while back but it seemed cheap. Now, I'm thinking maybe it was the game and not the locomotion. In this game, this mode of walking seems intuitive and works out well enough, until we get our omnidirectional treadmills. (You'd better be working on it, HTC...or whoever else Valve commisions) This seems to simply be the best way to avoid that break in immersion as of right now, unless you're A Chair In A Room and you can get away with just being a set of finite areas.\n     TL;DR this game is worth your money. Yes the pricetag is highish for a Vive game right now but to be fair, most games are tech demos, essentially, for the Vive. This game isn't that. It is in early access but so much has been done to it now that it no longer feels like it. I can't spout the usual \"It has potential...but...\" This game is just already worth it. \n\n\n   Oh, and it has a playerbase unlike some games.

Or you can sit out and play a low risk play style, which means you're also just standing still doing nothing while waiting for someone to walk by you. \n\nSome of the game mechanics are sound, but the controlls need a lot of work. There are several things that don't work correctly for left handed players at the time of me writing this review. For example, I'm cross dominant, which means I prefer to shoot rifles with my left hand, and pistols with my right. The game doesn't let me do this.

Definitely a must-buy for each Vive owner. I even heard people saying they bought the Vive only for this game and did not regret yet at all. \n\nIt is still in early access, but not a typical VR tech demo.  It gets regular updates by the developer. Yes, this game has been developped by one guy.\n\n[h1]What I like[/h1]\n\n* Movement - best locomotion in VR - actually every other single VR game should take an example from this\n* Gun handling - feels realistic, but you can still handle it fast during hot gunfights, room for your skills to improve\n* Pace of development, the interaction with the community, regular performance updates, really listening to community\n* Creative and well thought map design\n* Hundreds of thrilling moments in amazing gun fights\n* Communication with your team mates during the matches\n* Even camping in a house and waiting for the enemy to approach the objective is still fun\n* There are coming community maps, which means there will be many many more maps\n* Game has every potential to be THE reference in VR gaming for this generation\n\n[h1]Where I see potential for further improvements[/h1]\n\n* Performance / Optimization - especially on Suburbia (new map on the 5th of November)\n* Making character more distinguable from each other; now only black and bright brown, maybe some red and blue elements on the uniform or helmets?\n* Something interesting to do in the lobby between the matches\n* Kick and mute function for host\n* More players, at the moment 4vs4\n* A free for all mode with respawns in order to practice\n* A PVE mode for coop on the maps\n* Binoculars\n* Better scopes\n* Improvement on the bullet penetration\n* Single player vs AI mode\n\n[h1] Overall, this game is a must have PC gaming experience. It might be the next step in gaming since Super Mario 64 or Wolfenstein 3D. It has a lot of replayability and will keep you sweating through some of the most intense gaming moments in your gamers life. Just one more mission is the motto. You will not regret the purchase. You will tell your friends how awesome it is.[/h1]\n\n[i] Twitch Channel : https://www.twitch.tv/mrorange55\nYoutube Channel : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1UE5TPoF0HX0HVpF_E4uPQ/videos?view_as=subscriber [/i]", "timestamp_created": 1478301411, "timestamp_updated": 1514725178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638249", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26415452": {"recommendationid": "26415452", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970413755", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509479230}, "language": "english", "review": "This needs refining, but what they've acheived is incredibly fun, and immersive for a proto-vive/fps game.

I actually hung up my vive for about a month, then discover this game was out and gave it a shot.

I slightly get motion sickness and this game will throw you off a little if you are facing right and move left. Easily avoidable.  Aiming,reloading and switching weapons has a learning curve but can be masterd in a few hours game play. \n\nAfter messing around in the shooting range you will want to get into the MP action. That first game will be pure adrenaline. you wont know what to do and people will be counting on your help. I wish i could feel that feeling every game!\n\n This game has some serious potential if the Dev continues to pursue bug fixes and more content. And yes I did say Dev as in singular. This whole game has been developed and produced by one young man as far as I have read. \n\nMy best advice is to buy the game(it's worth it big time if you like mil-sim games) watch the online tutorial a few times spend about an hour in the range getting familiar with every thing.

The emmersion is quite complete thanks to the way you are allowed to use the controllers for virtually everything your hands would do. aiming guns, throwing grenades and reloading have to happen exactly as you expect them in the real world to work.\n\nAs you may have read in other reviews, the movement is partially done by the left thumppad, in addition you have your normal room scale movement ofcourse. It was surprissing to me how quickly I got used to the thumbpac movement. At first I wobled around a bit but after one or two matches I didn't even notice anymore.\n\nMost fun about this game is the fact that it's a multiplayer ofcourse. The best complement I can give is that besides the VR this game just plays very well. Furthermore the Dev is very active. Can you even believe this is one person doing all the work!?\n\nAnyway this game is my favourite VR experience sofar.", "timestamp_created": 1477069066, "timestamp_updated": 1477069066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26146705": {"recommendationid": "26146705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026800915", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505675743}, "language": "english", "review": "This is going to be a long review.\n\nBugs:\nPeriodically when you die, the game will glitch and you will be stuck above your body. The only way out is the exit the game and re-enter. If a host creates a lobby and exits, there is no way to start the game as the host doesn't migrate to a new person. The game freezes when entering a game and shows that you are offline. Hitting \"reconnect\" does nothing and the game just hangs at the loading screen.\n\nSingle Player:\nThere is no \"single player\" option in the game but there is the shooting range. This mode is under the multiplayer option but plays as single player. This mode includes a rifle range in which you can demo all of the in-game weapons as well as a kill house where you can get in some target practice.\n\nWar:\nThis is the actual game mode. This is a 4v4 online shooter. If you are worried that there will not be anyone online, you will be surprised. There is usually an open game lobby to join. If not, create your own and people will join. In the lobby, you can chat with both teams but in the game, you can only chat with your team either through voice when close or radio over a distance. The descriptors for this game say \"realistic.\" Don't expect that to be the case. It usually consists of throwing as many flashes as possible and stabbing the other team. There are no tactics. Also, expect to have squeakers on one of the teams running their mouth. Most of the time, no one in the lobby speaks your language.\n\nWanted features:\nA dedicated single player mode. Language filter for the lobby since team games are hard when you don't speak the same language. Faster matchmaking. Ability to mute other players.\n\nOverall:\nNot a bad game. The controls take a bit to get used to. It can be frustrating at first but gets better as you practice and play. Overall, I would say it is a 3/5. With more polish and a single player campaign with even some workshop missions added in, this game could easily be the best combat VR game. The developers have worked hard on this game and the 3/5 I give it for an early access game is well deserved. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to see what a VR shooter should be.

But with the latest update, this has now mostly been resolved, the game's tracking is perfect 99.5% of the time.\n\nWhen you do get this game, be aware that it still is early access and theres still plenty to improve, however i feel like i can recommend this game now that the tracking issues have been dealt with, not in the least because the controls & immersion in this game are something else, that any gamer that likes shooters needs to experience.\n\nCurrentlly there are 4 maps, 2 desert themed, a container ship & a subway map (first 3 comming in day & night versions, subway sorta combines them) and the dev is adding more maps each few updates & will soon open up the game for community made maps.\n\nThe game has quite a nice selection of weaponry already, and is still beeing expanded upon aswell (the dev just added a shield for instance, wich is cool) im not gonna list all the weapons since i dont have a clue about most of them, but at the least i can mention theres obviously the usual rifles like ak47 & m4a1(or something close to it) and for pistols things like a 1911 and a glock, thats just the ones i know tho, theres a bunch more pistols, rifles, shotguns, snipers, idk what they're all called, i just go for the ones i see in movies/tv :P\n\nWhat really makes the game is the combination of joypad walking and roomscale movement, you walk up to a corner with joypad walking, lean around and aim your weapon 'for real', you wanna crouch? you crouch in real life, prone? same thing. (joypad walking will take you 15-90minutes of getting used too, depending on your current 'vr legs')\n\nAnd then ofcourse theres the vest, you 'wear' your inventory, your rifle, pistol, magazines, knife, radio, grenades, syringes & tablet are all grabbed from/stored on a spot on your 'body' and its just the best thing ever, really helps with the immersion.\n\nOveral, the game is very fun, immersive & interesting to play, and deserves tons of kudo's for doing a decent translation of shooters from monitor to VR, theres nothing like it available at the moment, if you like shooters and have a Vive (or later down the line, 'similar roomscale vr'), get this game.", "timestamp_created": 1476466809, "timestamp_updated": 1478029682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26029854": {"recommendationid": "26029854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065168161", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476459834}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10\nfine tunin of game mechanic  needed. \nGreat VR FPS experience!!!", "timestamp_created": 1476455660, "timestamp_updated": 1476455660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26029427": {"recommendationid": "26029427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114332019", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477330825}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u662f\u4e2a\u786c\u6838\u519b\u4e8b\u8ff7\u5fc5\u73a9\u7684VR\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u662f\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u597d\u8bc4", "timestamp_created": 1476453926, "timestamp_updated": 1476453926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26027074": {"recommendationid": "26027074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031827535", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514220386}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games for the Vive", "timestamp_created": 1476443015, "timestamp_updated": 1476443015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26023477": {"recommendationid": "26023477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089975397", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 2206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494135750}, "language": "english", "review": "stupid fun. best part, only like 2% of the community are assholes. everyone is generally pretty cool.", "timestamp_created": 1476419274, "timestamp_updated": 1476419274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26022649": {"recommendationid": "26022649", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983752725", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509745749}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty much the only competitive VR game out there, and its good!", "timestamp_created": 1476413311, "timestamp_updated": 1476413311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26015607": {"recommendationid": "26015607", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978284898", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511235566}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright. So. For the first few days I was kinda upset I bought this. Like, every time I moved I was at like 10fps, I couldn't figure out the damn controls, some of the people are assholes, etc. But now I have figured out all the fixes to improve my frame rate, and figured out the controls, and now its fun.\n\nFor anyone having framerate issues:\nFirst thing that helped was reducing the quality in unity. Sit at your computer, start steam vr, and then start Onward while holding ALT. This will bring up a settings window you cannot access from in-game. Reduce quality here (I did mine to fastest and it works swimmingly, haven't tried upping it again).\n\nSecond thing was minimizing the game window after the game starts (On the desktop). This one is a bit weird but it makes a weird kind of sense. Why make your gpu display on a headset AND a monitor huh? I don't really know why, but this helped my frame rate a bunch.\n\nThird thing was making sure NOT to have the \"Always Projecting\" or whatever setting on in vive settings. Make sure it is UNCHECKED. That's the one next to direct mode (Which I keep ON always).\n\nOkay, that's done. Now for playing the game properly:\nFirst, google the tutorial. It's short and teaches you some important things, like reloading and where your stuff on your vest is and how to use it.\nBut there's one important thing it didn't teach me. If you're like me, you'll see people darting off and you're like How the fuck do you run that fast? And nobody will tell you. WELL CHILDREN IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SIMPLE! (Caps lock is cruise control for cool). Just start moving with the left touch pad, and then click it in once or twice. After clicking it twice (each time you start moving from a standing position) you are at top speed. This makes the game far more fun, but also more nauseating.\n\nI hope I have helped at least one person.

Like Counter Strike, the game has multiple rounds, however you switch sides on the completion of each round and if you die, you don't respawn until the next round starts. Each round ends with either one team being completely killed off or one team completing the objective (typing a code into an IPad while you are on the objective).

(And I am on the west coast, USA.)\n\nFirst impressions: I screwed around in the shooting range enough to figure out how to aim, reload, and throw grenades, the shooting range didn't have much in it, which gave me a bad feeling about how the game itself was going to be, but since there wasn't a lot left to mess with I jumped into a game.\n\nMy experiences:\nImmediately, I realized that I didn't bring night vision because I didn't know it was a night map. I glanced over to my right to see my team mate prone-crawling on the ground with his arms above his head to shoot over cover. I lost my shit and then was instantly shot in the face.\n\nAfter that mistake, I spent the next several rounds just getting used to the slide movement controls (After popping some Dramamine to avoid motion sickness because I get it easily with slide movement.), but finally after a 3 or 4 matches with 0 kills and dying every round, I managed to get my first kill. Then two more. Then I was pretty hooked. \n\nI played for an hour and a half straight and only stopped because of bugs/crashes, but decided to write my review while everything is fresh in my mind. So here we go!\n\nMy review:\n\nThe gameplay is solid, there's an artificial suppression mechanic in place like many FPS which does help with immersion, the shooting is alright, though there's no real feedback in the controllers which detracts from the feel of it but there's not much that can be done about that.\n\nControls are... alright, they definitely need work at this stage of the development. For example, you reload by pressing down (As in the bottom section) on the gun-holding hand's track pad, then hold the trigger to grab the magazine with your other hand, grab a spare magazine off your belt and then drop it in and pull the charging handle then you're set. That's fine, because this is a \"mil-sim\", however the problem comes when you need to pull a charging handle and end up slamming your controllers together. Or worse, you try to reach for a spare magazine but because of the direction you're looking you can't actually grab anything off of your body. This is also a huge problem when trying to grab a grenade, or your medical syringe, or anything off of your body honestly.\n\nWeapons are decent as well, but could use some work. An example of this would be the 4x (ACOG) scope on some guns is tiny, just... it's incredibly small, the size of or smaller than the red dot sights. As well, it seems like sights are too close to your face unless you hold your arm far from your body, with sniper scopes I had to almost hold my arm out as far as I could reach for the scope to not clip through my face (That is with the one sniper I tried.).\n\nAll primary weapons have the same attachment and ammo choices, which means guns like the VAL which has an internal suppressor still has the suppressor option which does nothing, and has a foregrip attachment option that doesn't mount. The same issue is on a lot of weapons, and for example the shotgun, your ammo choices are FMJ, FMJ Tracer, and AP. Not shot or slug. These are menu options that I'm nitpicking but still.\n\nSummary?\n\nI enjoyed it a lot, it's a little hard to get into but a lot of fun once you do, I can't wait to see something like 8v8 matches in the future, and maybe addition weapons and attachments, as well as the improvement of the contols. Even through the bugs, there was no time where I was just frustrated or angry, I just wanted the game to restart faster so I could go back to playing.\n\nThis game is just what VR needs right now to save it from dying, it's an actual game, with actual gameplay, and I sincerely hope the devs don't give up or abandon this project.  If you're looking for a new VR game to play and you're on the fence about this due to the price tag, it's worth it as it stands.

Long story short, we laughed it up in the lobby and it's a game moment that will stay with me for the duration of my life :D LOLOLOLL!!!!!!\n\n3) Scary and intense, as a former infantrymen in the army, this game is out-standing and beyond immersive, like i mentioned prior, nearly impossible to explain if you haven't tried the VIVE yet.\n\n4) You move with the Dpad on the controller, its a little bit strange at first, but after oh i dunno a night of playing i had a pretty good hand of things.  This game rewards you for knowing how weapons work,  watching some of these guys on youtube i cringe, i'll be posting my own video soon and you'll see how to properly handle these weapons :D\n\n5)  If you have a VIVE and are even slightly interested in FPS games this is a must own.\n\n6)  Props to the Developer of this game, from what i've heard it's one guy!!! and he's 19!!! he improves the game every week or two, and i'm having a hard time understanding the whole situation... very impressed!

Despite the high praise from pretty much everyone in the VR community, I thought \u00a318.99 was a bit steep. But I decided to bite the bullet and give it a go. I like ARMA, Insurgency and of course; Hotdogs Horseshoes and Hand Grenades, so I was pretty sure I'd be in for an enjoyable experience.\n\nSo let's get to the nitty gritty shall we?\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe other reviews don't lie, this game plays like a dream. And I had no problems of motion sickness with the game's movement system (even at sprint speed). And it's thanks to this movement system that I can say this is more non-room scale friendly than Raw Data. The guns are almost on par with Hotdogs Horseshoes and Hand Grenades, although they're much more forgiving when it comes to inserting fresh magazines into the gun. Which certainly helps in the middle of a frantic firefight.\n\nThere are plenty of servers bustling with players. Something I didn't expect from a Vive game anytime soon, so you'll always be able to find a match. What helps more is that the community is one of the nicest communities in any multiplayer game that I've played, and are always sure to make noobs (such as myself) feel welcome. The netcode is also super solid, I never had problems finding/connecting to matches. And everything during a match felt responsive and lag-free.\n\n[b]Visuals[/b]\nMuch like Hotdogs Horseshoes and Hand Grenades, visuals are very much what one would expect of a Unity game, but it looks nice enough (especially the new Subway map). If I do have one minor niggle, is that the game is rather prone to performance drops on my GTX980, (but it's still playable, so it's not a big deal).\n\n[b]Sound[/b]\n\"What's this Sheppy? A new sound section?\" I don't normally comment on the sound design in VR games because they're all generally solid on that front. But this game requires a special mention, as the sound is absolutely stellar. And very, very loud (if you want it to be, there's \"Realistic\" and \"Normal\" sound mixes depending on how much you wanna blast your ears.) Being supressed by enemy gunfire in the heat of battle is both terrifying and exciting, and all these sounds come together to bring one of the most immersive experiences in VR to date.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nIf you like military sims, ruining underwear, spouting cheesy one-liners and moderate amounts of gun porn. Then this is the VR game for you. And in time, with the [i]very[/i] regular updates that the dev is providing.

I'm a huge VR fan in general and am hoping beyond hope that it'll survive as a platform (or \"peripheral\" for those of you that want to get super technical on word usage... trolls). So, I'm not going to diss on other games or vr in general to prove how good Onward is. Having said that, Onward is a very good game. It does what most good games do. It gives players toys (military toys in this case) and a multiplayer sandbox to use those toys in. What VR adds that no other game-to-date can is that elusive \"presence\". This game has presence in spades. OK, maybe not at first as the movement system is a little jarring and can cause motion sickness (you get used to it if you give it some time) . The learning curve is also a tad steep, but when you are the last person alive and the comms have gone dead, is when Onward really shines.\n\nYou'll remind yourself to stay in control to keep your heart from pounding out of your chest, to keep your hands steady and true, and your eyes wide open. You'll try and remind yourself it is only a game, but the perspiration will start to creep in as reality fades away, you'll hold your breath, your hands will tremble. You will feel alone and afraid. You'll wait, listen, look for any sign that'll give an advantage and a chance to snag the round. Time will slow and then, in a coming-to-an-epiphany-sorta-way, something will happen, something that I imagine can happen in the real world too. A confidence will start to fill in your veins as you'll imagine yourself as a victorious hero walking into a room, pistol in hand, and squeezing off four precise headshots to win in an epic, merciless fashion. You'll imagine placing each shot though your opponents skull like a skilled surgeon prescribing each bullet to its victim. \"One for you, you, you and one for you\", you'll say to yourself as blood flies and bodies fall.\n\nThe adrenaline that first caused fear turns to fight, and off you go as a one man team with a grand idea against an unknown number of enemies, weapon in hand and loaded for bear. You'll creep, crawl, run, stop, listen, look and repeat. You'll clear rooms. You'll peek around corners then pull your head back only to peek again. You'll push on, but most importantly, you will face your fate. You will face your enemy with a steady hand and determination as sharp as a razor's edge, and there he is! You see him, but did he see you? You hold your breath. You look again. Oh s*it! He saw you. A realization of now-or-never grips you.... fight or flight. You pay no attention to the fact there may be more than the one. You need this kill. Around the corner you go, out from cover, gun ready, gun aimed... BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG, you let the bullets fly. POP, POP, POP, POP, he fires back. Without thinking you head back to cover. The screen dims, you've been shot, but it's not fatal. You need healing. You reach for the syringe and stop... there's no time. A voice playing like a broken record way down under the intensity comes to your conscious state. \"Reload, Reload!!!\", it is saying. \"f*ck\", you respond and do as the voice commands. You reload like a well oiled machine, accurately, quickly, desperately. Then, while pulling back the bolt and barely giving it a chance to close, out of cover you fly again... BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG... The real world melts into a distant past and blurs into obscurity as all you have now is your instinct to survive and your weapon to survive behind. For victory or for defeat, for life or for death. You go... Onward.\n\nThat is what makes this game great. For that moment, it is REAL to you, you are there. Explaining that feeling is like trying to explain love. It can only be had by doing, by feeling. That is presence. That is the potential of VR.

What can be said that hasn't already been said? \"It's like call of duty...but real life\", \"It's the best military sim available to civilians\", \"Onward for life\" \nBut nothing says experince in Onward, like playing it with other people on the internet. \n\nMy first time playing Onward was short, I went to the shooting range first, by myself, and figured out most of the controls. Then I felt ready and joined a game. It was containment at night. I sifted through weapons and gadgets where I found myself a pair of nightvision googles. Sweet. I'm Sam Fisher, mother f*****. \nDied instantly. \n\nMy second attempt, I joined a lobby where eveyone was chatting, talking about system specs, etc. I was surprsied to get a \"Hi!\" from eveyone. So I used my outside voice in my apartment at 3:30am to say \"Hi\" back. \nNeighbors banged on my wall, that was the end of that. \n\nMy third attempt went fantastic, joined another lobby and got to meet quite few cool people. One guy was drunk, and the other two were trying to convice him that if he dies in VR, the headset will shock you, if he takes it off, you will be shocked too. Frankly, they helped me out quite a lot, I learned that if you tell someone that, in order to grab your knife, you press the grip buttons and the trigger under your throat. The result is that you slice open your own throat. Brutal.\n\nMy foruth attempt was a real treat. I made a lobby and played a few rounds of \"knife only\" and \"pistol only\" with 5 other guys. Then a guy named, black(something) joined and played a few rounds with us. We learned that his name is Dante and he is one of the devs of the game (I did not know he was THE dev). He began explaining some of the features he is working on in the game and was doing system performance testing. He really is a super nice dude. It's not everyday you get to shoot and kill the developer of their own game. 10/10 would play with you again, Dante!\n\nBy this time, I must have over 50 online games logged. Onward became the everynight, get the friends togeather and kill eachother. It became a routine of mid, right, left, corner hill, pitch tower, way the fuck over there, and i'm gonna hide. The nights became mundain, and that was when Onward, became our downfall. \n\nWe started with testers, and the people who did not speak our language. We harassed them, surrounding them with our weapons in thier face. Then we started to execute them. We even began tea-bagging the downed enemy. They say, Onward is so real, you can almost taste the balls. Our little click of friends had been getting stronger in skill. We started plans on killing off the enemy team and leaving one to fend for himself and we pin him down until he pulls the trigger on himself. Sometimes, a guy will get the nature of the situation and role-play a hostage. Not the brighest idea, becoming the play-thing of these sickos. We began with small tasks, like \"catch the grenade when I throw it to you\", or \"take out your knife and kill your teammate\" or \"commit seppuku\".\n\nVR is weird.\n\n8/10 - It's a great game\n(The game needs work, but all the bugs and glitches are worth those golden moments in Onward)", "timestamp_created": 1474449881, "timestamp_updated": 1474969056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25615789": {"recommendationid": "25615789", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974522156", "num_games_owned": 2914, "num_reviews": 458, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485412927}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm betting this game will have the most hours played of all the vive games by the end of the year.

VR gives you the unique oppertunity of turning up the volume on the immersion scale, often convincing players that they are destined for a career as a crack commando if only they didn't have to pick up the kids from school in real life.\n\nIt needs lots and lots of polishing on all fronts, from gameplay, map design to of course resolving bugs, but the good news is that it is getting it and Onward keeps improving. This developer is certainly no slacker and is worth watching as a future VR dev star.\n\nIn 6-10 months this will probably be a truly great game, right now it's an often fun early access title that really gets cooking when everything is working right and everyone is playing nice. Things can come apart at the seams when players do not behave like the designer intends and that needs to be looked at going forward because, hey people are human and don't always do what you think or want them too all the time. \n\nWorst of all things can get boring with all the constant waiting, and the underwhelming end game triggered by one team going to a point on the map and punching in a code ZZZzzzzz. That will turn off new players and could even kill the games potential if not addressed.\n\nOnward EA walks the tightrope of trying to balance realism with the fact it is a game and gets it right, for the most part.

I don't dislike it, although I did ask for a refund, it's just so early that there are far too many annoyances. The inventory system (switching weapons, gear etc) is really hit and miss. I have no idea how you could reach the grenade in the heat of battle since it's determined to hide behind your chest armour and primary weapon. Reloading is cool, but the position of all the levers you pull and hammers you cock are inside the right controller, meaning you will smash the controllers together constantly during a match. Running is difficult to achieve, seems you have to double tap the forward point of the track-pad AND lean forward? I don't know, couldn't quite figure it out.\n\nAs I said at the start, I don't dislike it, it does give that same feeling of being out on a paintball day trip or playing nerf with friends.

It has bugs. Don't be surprised, but don't let that stop you from playing the best VR FPS game there is.\n\nOnward is a first person shooting military simulator. I know Steam said exactly that above so I'll specify a bit. Onward has accurate firing. You must aim appropriately and match the sight on your target. Firing takes careful aim or you will miss. There is no quick scoping or killing someone accross the map unless you have a sniper rifle (Even though aiming with those is pretty difficult). There are no menus to choose your sidearm or attachments. There is no \"VR Teleporting\". There are no hit markers and there is no confirmation of kills. You have to confirm yourself.\n\n\nThe game has two lobbys: Shooting range and War.\n\nIn Shooting range you can practice your accuracy with the weapons within the game. 8 people can join you in the shooting range as well. There are targets at close, medium, and long ranges. There is also a simulation corner of the range that lets you practice close quarters firing. It helps to let you get used to the movement of checking corners. The only issue I have with the shooting range is that the shots you make on the targets are faint and they disappear before you can even get to the target, but that's just a tiny pet peeve. \n\nAfter you've practiced in the shooting range you can play the primary part of the game called War.\n\nIn War, you can choose between two teams Volk and MARSOC. Each team can have a max of 4 players, 8 players total. You choose from a list of classes which are Rifleman, Specialist, Automatic Rifleman and Marksman. Each class has weapons that coincide with that class. The Marksman has bolt action rifles with 12x range scopes for example. You can customize the weapon such as the sight, barrel, and ammo. Oh, also each team has selected chosen weapons that you won't find on the other team.\nYou can then choose your sidearm pistol, types of grenades, and additonal gear such as an extra morphine syringe (You use the syringe to give yourself more health or revive a teammate before they bleed out), night vision goggles, and body armor. My only complaint about the loadout screen is I wish there are explanations for each item for people who are not miltary savvy, but its a mil sim so to be expected.\n\nI believe there are 4 maps so far. 3 of these maps have a night version to play and the 4th is always at night.\n\nOnce in the game you are placed at opposite ends of the map, one team defending and another attacking. The attacking team have codes to enter into the objective to win. If a team is completely wiped out the opposing team wins.\n\nThe movement is a little clunky, but you quickly forget that once you get into the game. If you kneel in real life, you kneel in the game. If you go prone (Lie flat on your stomach) in real life you go prone in the game.\nYou control your movement with the touch pad on the Vive controller. Your default setting is to walk, but you can run by double clicking the touch pad on the controller. If you put your weapon away and you have free hands you move faster. \n\nEvery piece of gear you have is available on your VR body and you have to manually find it on your person and grab it to use it. To help with grabbing gear off your chest there is a slight vibration in the controller to tell you you're in the right spot to grab a piece of gear off your body. The knife is on your left shoulder, the radio is near your left ear, the map is near the right side of your back on the waist etc. \n\nFor communication you must be in proximity or using the radio system. Communication is essential in Onward. Friendly fire happens all the time and the only way to prevent that is communicating.\n\nOnward is the one VR game that I have been consistently coming back to play.

While I did enjoy the likes of Hover Junkers and even the silly Job Simulator, the only game that had kept my interest was Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades. Now that I've played Onward, I can finally say that VR has a game worthy of the asking price of the Vive itself. \n\nEverything in this game is intuitive, looks great, and sounds great. The only minor problem I've had with the controls is working things on the guns (accidentally hitting both controllers together repeatedly while trying to pull back the bolt, for example). Aside from that, the game plays exactly as expected. THANK GOD FOR TRACKPAD MOVEMENT! I was starting to get worried that devs were going to completely abandon that type of movement due to complaints of motion sickness. Spend a few minutes with it, and it feels natural. \n\nThe game does have a lack of maps, but the few maps that are there are mostly great. The only one I didn't particularly enjoy was the Tanker, due to it being so cramped, which made for easy early game grenade kills. After a few more are added, and the currently existing ones are polished, this won't be a con at all. Dynamic weather could be a game changer if it's added as well. \n\nThe game does have a stuttering problem every now and then. One screen will flicker and the game will run pretty slowly, but it only lasts for half a minute at most, then it's back to normal. This will probably be fixed in an update.\n\nOverall, Onward is a huge step forward for VR as a whole. Once PSVR hits the market, I'm sure development of longer games is going to skyrocket, but for now, Onward is king for me (though I haven't had the chance to play Raw Data yet). \n\nAlso, VR hugs.", "timestamp_created": 1473750765, "timestamp_updated": 1473751200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25489872": {"recommendationid": "25489872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130038383", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475997523}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm normally too lazy to give a review, but this dude really deserves it for this game.

The first realistic multiplayer military style shooter for VR is now here. I did not know untill tonight that it would be releasing today and I decided to stay up untill midnight to buy it, if the price is reasonable of course.\n\nAt first I thought the price was fair, but after the first hour into the game I am suprised this didnt cost over $30. This game has plenty of guns, attachments, gear, accesories, etc. that I did not expect for a brand new early access game. The gameplay is pretty stellar but I would change a few things.\n\nIt does not come without some problems though. The map/objective tablet is pretty difficult to get out because we cant see where we need our hand to be. Some of the buildings in the game are poorly designed and have pointless rooms, but it's not too bad. There are some holes in the floor of the map on the map with the crashed helicopter. The inventory system is kinda finicky. And the objective is extremely hard to play, easy to defend, and hard to find.\nBut what this game gets right, it gets right. The locomotion in my experience has had no effect whatsoever on me, but I have heard other experiences of motion sickness from other people, but for me it's cake. Being able to look around while running is incredibly natural and kind of feels like I'm riding a bike and the Vive wand is my handlebar. The radio works so well and it feels so cool to use. The models of the characters look and move quite naturally with the movement of the player, the arms seem mapped quite well. The sounds of the guns are amazing and on the realistic setting is quite scary the first time you hear gunfire whizzing by your head.\n\nThe social interaction is also definitely a lot of fun, but I can see plenty of room for people to grief and troll by killing teammates on purpose because as far as I know, there is no penalty for team killing. I am sure a system for that will come later but for now the people I played with were people who were also looking to play a fun game of war.\nThis is definitely one of my favorite VR purchases right up there with Raw Data and Audio Shield.

After slowly adjusting by playing just a few minutes of games like Hover Junkers per day over stretches of weeks, I adapted and this movement no longer bugs me. \n\nThe movement alone puts this head and shoulders above other MP games like Rec Room/Battle Dome to me and it's just the beginning. Add to that excellent graphics, great realistic guns including machine guns, assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles etc. Plus various attachments like red-dot scopes, 4x, 12x scopes, silencers, smoke grenades, stun grenades, HE greanades, body armor, tracer rounds, armor penetration rounds, night vision and so on. \n\nCurrently available are three maps that can be played during day or night time with more to come.

Onward is not only a realistic FPS, it's the most realistic FPS ever. No HUD. In fact, there is no info on your VR display except what you would see in reality... your hands, your gun and whatever else you are carrying, like the tablet with the GPS map. Sound is amazing and adds a lot, especially if you choose the deafening realistic option.\n\nWeapon handling looks real although sometimes you can fumble it up and hit both controllers over and over trying to pull a bolt back. Communications are important in-game and the proximity VoIP in conjunction with the fantastically thought out shoulder click radios cover all needs. Suppression is well balanced and the need to inject yourself or others when injured is very well done. \n\nI was really surprised with the movement feature. Besides teleporting I had only tried moving in another game (The Solus Project) and had trouble with balancing. In Onward it's perfect, no balance problems, no nausea (didn't have it on other games anyway), I suspect the movement acceleration is more progressive and that helps.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the game is still buggy, and performance is lacking (GTX970, low settings) for what are very basic graphics.

It really is incredible to group up with a few people in VR and work together to win the game.

Constant updating with new maps, improved sound, new weapons and items, has kepy me coming back. This game really shows you what VR can do. I heard Valve is even helping Dante with the development now, so it's only going to get better.\n\nThe good:\n-Seemingly good netcode, dedicated servers.\n-Looks great, sounds great, after patches, it runs great.\n-The maps that are there are good, and always being improved\n-Decent variety of items, nightvision, armor, flashbangs, frags, riot shield.\n-Very immersive, you'll feel like a soldier.\n-Deep mechanics for everything. and it's all so intuitive. Reloading, using your radio, turning on your night vision, it's all how you'd expect it to work. Some of it is a bit complicated so watch the tutorial before playing.\n\nThe bad:\n-Odd bugs with your characters placement when going up stairs, \"jumping\" over walls, black screens etc.\n-Only 1 game mode, I would like a more action oriented game mode like team deathmatch etc, with respawns. Drop in drop out maybe?\n-A few new maps have been added but there still aren't that many.\n-What weapon you use is mostly unimportant, they seem to all have similar fire rate and bullet damage. I would expect a P90 to shoot way faster and have low kickback, but not have as much stopping power, but it shoots just like any other gun in the game.\n-I feel like at this point, everyone uses body armor (cannot be penetrated by FMJ) and AP bullets (you get fewer bullets but they penetrate body armor) completely negating both.

It's the first of its kind on the first iteration of the hardware. The sound is suprisingly well done and very important in the game. Multiplayer has a lot more players atm than Hover Junkers for example. Waiting times are minimal (GMT +1, Sat evening experiencce). \n\nDespite the pre-VR movement controls and lack of teleport there is no motion sickness. Somehow the devs pulled it off. After a few minutes you adjust to movement via the trackpad of your off hand. There are still some glitches while moving over obstables and such but it works brilliantly for the most part. \n\nAll in all Onward is the best FPS shooter experience you can have in VR right now.

However, most people will be happy to pay $25 for what is essentially counterstrike VR. Got a little sick with the locomotion at first, but actually was able to adapt which is weird because usually I have to get out of VR for my nausea to go away. \n\nOther than sickness, the bugs are the real problem with the game. Sooooo many bugs still. For example, my first death was from a floating gun. The character model of my enemy was completely invisible, but I could see the gun floating in the air shooting me. Also, don't even try the 12x scope. There seems to be no way to unzoom it and the scope really doesn't work much.\n\nOne tip. Learn how to use your gear before you go out. It's not straight forward at all, but it is hyper-realistic. Gun reloading is exactly like you would do it in real life which is great. Definitely make sure you watch the youtube tutorial and practice user your gear and weapon in the shooting range.  \n\nThis review may seem negative, but its really not.

I've only clocked a couple of hours (and first 30 mins of that was on teh shooting range getting to grips with the controls and reloads etc) but once in the game - WOW!\n\nFirst - It's a good FPS. Good maps and good 4x4 style capture the objective games. \n\nSecond - The weapons are great - they feel chunky and they are realistic to hold and fire, and more importnatly, to reload and cock. Excellent detail, and when under fire a proper cause of (realistic) stress. \n\nThird - very important, but the community seems pretty cool. Peole are helping each other (i.e. me and another newby pinned down a building talking about how to capture the objective, how to use radio, how to suppress and run, etc) but also the better players seem happy to have you on the team, and will stop and give advice. \n\nForth - very funny. Many crazy scenarios. In my last game I had teamate take a bullet - I'm shouting 'he's dead' when he pipes up, theatrical weak voice 'I'm not dead, dude - just need a medic'. Another chap makes a hero run to syringe this teammate, only to get shot down by sniper fire. He literally played dead, waited for the shooter to get distracted, then leaped up and ran off laughing. It's more realistic than games where the kill stats gets splashed on the screen - if someone goes down at a distance, you don't know if they are dead, injured or playing dead. \n\nFifth - the movement works well. Much better than teleport. This is the first time I've thought that games like Doom and Fallout might actually work in VR without breaking the realism by blink hopping all over. And NO sickness at all....result!  \n\nSixth (and most importnatly) - it's total immersion. It's the most immersive PC experience I've had in 20 years of gaming.

I didn't feel immersed by the heat of war, it rather felt like walking in quite rigid and lifeless landscapes with very basic level design, and getting shot within minutes before shooting a single bullet. \nSound position is not good enough to really understand where fire comes from (even after several magasines have been unloaded) and I usually died without even understanding where it came from. Very frustrating.\nI personally find that the motion system, so praised by the reviews, is even less immersive than teleportation (because your character moves when your body stands still and it feels wrong and breaks the immersion).\nThe framerate is not bareable for a gtx 970 unlike mentioned in the game description. I had to overclock it quite a lot to maintain a barely bearable framerate. \nThere is no way to filter online games, and most of the time you join a playing game and wait in the lobby for 10 minutes.\n\n\nI asked for a refund, because I am afraid that in a few weeks/months the game will be unenjoyable if you're not an expert in these kind of games. \nMaybe I'll buy it again if more (and less hardcore/competitive) game modes are added, if something is done against all these waitings (in lobbies, for respawns, etc), and if the community does not become toxic like in most of these games (this seems to not be the case at the moment).\n\nBut for the moment, I must admit that I didn't have any kind of fun.\n\nBut if you like these kind of games and are good at it, I guess you'll probably find something you're looking for, because beside its cons, it has its undeniable qualities (no need to expose them here, just look at other reviews).", "timestamp_created": 1472938266, "timestamp_updated": 1472939304, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460319", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25333659": {"recommendationid": "25333659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059896039", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 6102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520232230}, "language": "english", "review": "What we all have been waiting for.

This is one of my favorite VR games and is definitely worth the $25.00 price tag. This entire game has been developed by one guy and I'm very excited to see what happens with this game as he updates the game and hopefully aquires a team of devs to fully flesh this game out because the potential for this game is huge. I am someone who loves playing tactical shooters like Arma in the virtual realm and paintball/airsoft in real life and this game feels like a combination of those activities. It's immersive as hell, the firefights get intense as you legitimatly feel like your in the middle of a battle. The multiplayer works for the most part, it's awesome having a team of 4 real people to play with the communication is great and radios are fun to use. \nAll that being said there are bugs/glitches and times where I've had to restart the game or steamVR but again it's in alpha and up to this point has been developed by one guy so what more can you expect? They don't break the game and will be fixed eventually. Anyone who is super prone to motion sickness should be wary as the movement system might trigger that. The first time I played I moved around and it messed with me a little but I got used to it pretty quickly and haven't had any problems since. The only other gripe I have is that there are no tutorials and I see a lot of players that have no idea what they are doing which can be frustrating but again that is something that will most likely be fixed in the near future and there's nothing you can't learn by just asking people in game. All in all I think everyone who owns a vive should give this game a shot, if you happen to be the 1% of people who don't enjoy this game you can get a refund so whats to lose?\n\nIn its current state I'd rate this game a 7/10 but can easily see this game becoming a 10/10 as development continues.", "timestamp_created": 1472906229, "timestamp_updated": 1472906229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25321932": {"recommendationid": "25321932", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981541396", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483038558}, "language": "french", "review": "Enfin un FPS complet en VR !

The voice comms are also excellent and your voices can be heard by your enemies as well, so you better watch out. \n\nIn the end smart team tactics rule the day over solo rushing. Syringes, grenades and pistols, knives are all actually useful items in this game.\n\nEven if you are not a gun enthuasist (I am not), this is the best bang for the buck easily for VR genre. Especially if you like more tactical online games & shooters with a more realistic touch. Then again, I got the same feeling playing it for few day that I got when playing CS in 1999 (before it came a phenomenon). I think it has captured a nice balance of realism and action oriented gameplay in its veins. Locomotion works surprisingly well with room scale movement. More the better, so with 6vs6 or more this would really be something (which is in the works as I've understood).\n\n10/10\n\nThis game will sell a buttload of Vives for sure.

Far too often I'd wait in lobby and launch into a match with a gun I've never used thinking I'd just \"figure it out\". I ended up switching to pistol instead.\n- If you have a friend to play with, join a shooting range lobby with them and mess around. This is a great way to learn the game and have a blast. You can even practice sniping at each other, knifing, or have a quick draw! If you have no friends, join a random range lobby and there is sure to be someone willing to show you the ropes \"in person\". The wait to get into a regular match is a bit draining, especially for your first day in as you will die quick and be forced to watch.

You'll walk away with watercooler moments every day you play. \n\nThis is an awesome step for VR. Highly addictive gameplay is an understatement. I can't wait to see where this winds up - I really hope it doesn't become some speed shooter. The competition and the incredible community just keep on giving. Everyone online so far with the exception of 2 players I've played with has been incredibly helpful and very enjoyable to play with. I hope this type of community continues and grows, because so far it's awesome to make friends in. If you buy this game do yourself a favor and STAY IN THE SERVERS. If you hop around when you die sure you'll get into the action again faster but you definitely won't build up any relationships and experience half the awesome things I have playing this game.  \n\nThe addition of player controlled analog motion (which honestly isn't THAT much different than Hover Junkers) is very well done and doesn't bother me motion sickness wise. You may get dizzy doing things a little crazy like clearing stairways or something, but it doesn't last. A game like this really couldn't be played with teleportation so I'm VERY thankful that this is done so well. \n\nThere is a wide variety of weapons and they all handle very well if a bit similar in feel. They're just slightly less fancy and more simplified than H3VR. Reloading is NOT the big deal that a lot of people complain about and there is a tutorial video that shows how to do everything on youtube. This isn't COD or any other game where you just press the button and the animation plays. Reloading isn't supposed to just happen without a little practice and fumbling at first in real life, so why should it be different in VR? Once you know what to do, it's all easily accomplished and feels awesome in the heat of being suppressed. \n\nAs for performance - yeah it's got bugs. No surprise. You WON't be getting away with supersampling unless you love reprojection, but I've been doing ok without it. If you are running stock settings, and have a decent gpu (970/980/ti) you should easily get very constant 90fps at default settings. At 1.5+ with a 980ti I was at nearly constant reprojection which I didn't enjoy so I'm just settling for stock. Grabbing items from your vest at first can be a little frustrating because it seems the vest clips through the environment which occludes you from grabbing equipment. This only is a problem for going prone or crouching your entire body over rather than just sitting down with a straight back. Straighten up and you can get everything pretty easy.

Each firearm was uniquely designed to mimic its real life mechanics. The way you actually have to aim the gun and hold it with two hands was done perfectly. If it wasn't for not feeling the recoil, I almost felt like I was at the range. \n\nThe chest rig was excellent idea, you are actually equiped with your equipment on you no scrolling through menus. \n\nThis game you can actually use real life tactics and must rely on team work.\n\nI look forward to seeing how this game developes in the future, but as of right now I am extremely impressed. I would like to thank the Creator of this game and my hat is off to you my friend. This game is by far the BEST one out and I will be playing many hours of it!\n\nAbsolutely AMAZING FPS that has every come out!!! For anyone who has ever wanted a video game to come alive this is it. COD and Battlefield on VR, but more realistic and accurate. They thought of everything when making this game and really make you feel like you are in combat. This game has very intense fire fights that will have you literally kneeling and laying on your floor. I will never forget trying to clear a small house and entering the doorway only to find an actual life size enemy trying to kill me (VERY INTENSE). \n\nWeapons: The weapons in this game are designed to spec and you have to operate them like you would in real life. (They are so realistic the only thing you are missing is the actual recoil in your hand). \n\nEquipment: To make the game  more realistic you actually wear a chest rig with all your ammo and equipment on your body, very cool!!! Your back up weapon is also attached to yor thigh or chest piece. \n\nTactics and Communications: The game can be very tactical if you have right group of people or it can be just fun free for all. The use of communications in the game was great idea. You can speak normally like you would in real life and people around you can hear, even the enemy, or you can use your radio attach to your shoulder, in the game, to communicate long distances.\n\nMaps: Maps are a nice size and have a lot of detail. You can enter buidlings and use objects as cover. There are also night maps, which you utilize Night Vision.\n\nThe limits are endless with this game and I look forward to how far this game will push the limit. Everything is realisitc and no one has an advantage over the other person like in COD or Battlefield. Probably one of the best games every created for FPS and it is designed very well.", "timestamp_created": 1472789880, "timestamp_updated": 1480320675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25297802": {"recommendationid": "25297802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083915002", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515643085}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Vr game out!

It is the one and only game that has kept me glued to my Vive. When I first got my Vive I was basically glued to it, but there hasn't been another game that has kept me playing one specific game exclusively like this one. Alot of people say when they got their Vives they were  never going back to normal monitor games. I, on the otherhand still loved to play ARMA3 and RainbowSix Siege. Although now since this game has come out I don't know if there is enough time in the day to play anything else lol. I would call it a Must Buy! for anyone who enjoys Milsim games and owns a vive.\n  \n                                          GENERAL\n\n   I find Onward compares pretty closely to a game like Insurgency, but with slightly slower pacing.Some people think the game is so slow its boring, but that is only the case if you don't know how to play or you are playing with other that don't get it too. The maps are decently big which provides space to make manouvers, but you are always attacling a specific point in the map. As long as the players in the game understand that, you get great action packed matches. There are a few bugs that have caused me to have to restart the game on occasion. This circumstance is very rare though, about 1 in 10 games at the most for me. It however has not taken away from my enjoyment of this title one bit. It is one of the most intense and exciting MilSim games I have ever had the chance to play. Teamwork is key, and Onward has provided some of the best teamplay I have seen in a game. When your moving around a corner either whispering or using hand signals as to not alert an enemy because you know he is very close it's just great. Other great moments come from spotting someone at a great distance and stepping back behind cover to radio and make sure it's not a friendly.\n   \n                                           MECHANICS\n  \n    I am also very impressed with the amount of guns, attachments, grenades and the other things available in the loadouts. The weapon mechanics are also great, akin to H3VR if you've played it. Using these realistic weapon mechanics in an intense firefight makes all the difference. The mechanics of the game make it a truly skill and teamwork based game that is exciting to play. It you don't master your weapon mechanics and radio usage you are going to have a hell of a time in this game.\n\n                                           COMMUNITY\n   \n  So far at this early stage of the game I have found nothing but awesome people to play with. Everyone is talking and communicating to get things done. Those that don't know what they are doing yet have all showed a willingness to learn and hear people out. Overally its the best experience I have had with people in the vive and I hope it keeps on heading in the same direction.", "timestamp_created": 1472692295, "timestamp_updated": 1472711690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25278117": {"recommendationid": "25278117", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970504859", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481067422}, "language": "swedish", "review": "One of the best MP games on the vive.

Gameplay is somewhere between Counter Strike and Armor - two teams of 1-~6 players fight, with one team attacking an objective, and the other defending it. Game lengths are usually around 5-10 mins, most of it spent carefully sneaking around, camping, and flanking the enemy. Running out in the open is a surefire way to lose your head, this ain't CoD! There are both large day maps and close quarters night maps, and they all play differently. It's purely PvP at the moment, there are no bot modes (but plenty of people online).\n\nAll communication is done through in game voice chat, which works fantastically (the enemy can hear you if you're talking to loudly, so be careful!). There are a variety of different role types and weapons to suit team comp and personal preference, the the role types are restricted (so you can't have an entire team of snipers :D ).\n\n\nIt also has great locomotion controls that are *slightly* more sickening than teleporting, but I had no problems with them even after a few hours of play. The grip and weapon controls are also very intuitive, although the game does thrust quite a few options upon you at first launch - a tutorial would be nice.

It can play on a 970 but if you dont know what the fuck you are doing or how to work your PC, you may have issues (it should work out of the box, but people are stupid and blame the application for their prior fuck ups). Out of the 7 hours of continued play, I've only crashed once but that was an issue on my part. I am running this on a gtx 1080 strix with a factory set OC, running the vive at 2x the resolution and a i7 6700k @ 4.5ghz with no lag or major frame dips.

Very easy to pick up and play and you wont find yourself lost unless you are retarded.

Audio is immersive, but not helpful, as positional audio does not seem to work for weapons(?).\n\nNext, let me talk specs and performance. My system specs are as follows:\n\nIntel Core i5 4690(non-k, no hyperthreading)\nSapphire Radeon RX 480 8GB Nitro+ OC\n8GB DDR3 SDRAM\nThe rest doesn't really matter, but quality SSD.\n\nNow, referencing the above specs, I found huge issues with framerate. The framerate would drop so low that I would get flickering, single eye vision glitches(NEVER seen before), and moderate tracking issues. However, it would clear when looking at less...cluttered or busy areas. That being said, I was not able to narrow down the cause specifically, but I suspect the smoke rendering in any given map does NOT play nice with AMD tech. Devs, please please please look into optimizing this for AMD users as well(if this is in fact related)!\n\nMore about mechanics. I was not thoroughly versed on controls, but even those I was not told about were easy to figure out(aside from reloading...the grab clip mechanic needs major tweaking to work well). There is no teleport locomotion, you are limited to strafe movement including walking, sprinting, crouching and prone movement. Remember, if you have room-scale space, USE IT to your advantage. Cover will save you. Aside from your primary weapon, your arsenal spawns on your models chest and sides. These are all interchangeable with your dominant hand, using the grip buttons. You may place your primary weapon about dead center on your chest, to begin accessing other items. Items may vary, as your loadout may be customized, but the same mechanic applies, grip button to grab the item, interact how you need to, and replace with grip buttons. Devs, a tip here, please give a faint highlight indicator for placement zone when within grip range, so we stop struggling switching items. I've fumbled to place my sidearm more than once just to die. Voice comms in game are managed through proximity chat(enemy team can hear!), and radio comm. Non-dominant hand to left shoulder and pull trigger. You will hear radio chirp to know you're talking. Other mechanics exist, like using a map, menu, and others however I have not learned these quite yet!\n\nLets talk about maps and variety! As for maps, there is a good selection, HOWEVER I would highly highly suggest that the devs include a good number of small maps, and perhaps a fast paced respawn TDM mode. In my opinion, this will help keep the community healthy by allowing active games more consistently and jump in as you want. If you play a night map, don't forget your nightvision if it's too dark! Weapon, mods, sidearms, and accessories for your character are plentiful, realistic, and totally enjoyable to customize. Good on you devs!\n\nThank you so much for reading my review, and I'll try to get more updated for review later.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1472659257, "timestamp_updated": 1472659257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25270865": {"recommendationid": "25270865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132101661", "num_games_owned": 742, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472905024}, "language": "english", "review": "PTSD Simulator 2016", "timestamp_created": 1472659210, "timestamp_updated": 1472659210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484456", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25270285": {"recommendationid": "25270285", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966401809", "num_games_owned": 1135, "num_reviews": 303, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517314619}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein sehr realistischer Taktik-Shooter f\u00fcr die HTC Vive!

I'd get a bit sick playing Vivecraft using a similar movement mechanic, but Onward does it perfectly.  Having analog control of player movement is great, being able to slowly sneak around a door way is amazing.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic.  There are different classses of guns that you would expect from this type of game.  However, unlike a regular FPS, there is something about this game that makes an assault rifle handle and shoot so differently from a SMG like a P90(which if you use a two hand grip like a pistol feels so very very right).  \nInventory management is very cool, but I can't find a way to put back a grenade if I accidently take it off my chest harness.  I think a lot of the game mechanics here are going to be copied by many other games.\n\n5 hours in, I can see myself coming back to this.  All it needs are more maps and more gameplay modes.  Currently, the objective based gameplay doesn't play out that way.  I never really seen anyone complete the objective probably because it's loads more fun to shoot people.  Definitely looking forward to seeing the development of this game, and I do hope that it grows.\n\nUpdate for late Oct:  The new updates in the last few weeks really change the game and increases the replay value of older maps.  Core game is the same, but adds random spawn points. Random spawn points for both teams is great and really slows the game down.  The new Subway map looks really good and the random spawn really makes better use of the entire area of the map.  If anything is a complaint, I think the larger maps should have a longer time limit as it can take a while to get to objectives when you're being careful.

You'll see a bug at the end of the video where I die but become a ghost instead of return to the lobby.\n\nPros\nAmazingly immersive\nIncredible sense of presence\nRealistic weapons\nBuilt for VR actions\nTakes real skill and cooperation to succeed\nLocomotion is the best I've seen to date. No teleportation, no motion sickness.\nCandidate for VR Esports if I've ever seen one\n\nCons\nEA title (they have a bad rep for a reason)\nSome don't like the UI, I didn't mind it too much. Does need more polish though\nThe main con is that games can drag on if opponents can't find each other. Needs a tighter time limit or something to combat lobby boredom while spectating nothing happening.\n\nThe video doesn't do the game justice.

Definitely feels more more real than teleporting.\n\nFull proximity voice comms, you can hear your team and the enemy. You can press a button on your shoulder to use your radio to talk over long distances. You have a PDA that you pull off your back that shows a map with the objective and a short range radar of sorts.\n\nI understand a few things now like why people use pistols in close quarters, unlike in a regular fps where you just use your rifle all the time. You have to hold the rifle with 2 hands to avoid insane recoil, and using 2 hands makes it very unwieldy to aim when going around corners so pistol is at a major advantage there.\n\nCommunication seems super strong, there is friendly fire which is a big danger. I can see how it happens all the time IRL. The night level especially where you have to use night vision goggles, I'm basically just assuming based on their position.\n\nSome of the guns I avoid because they are so complicated to reload, it's totally realistic so you have to remember to pull the slide on some of them. The big machine gun is really insane, you have to attach the drum, lift this top part, open the drum, pull out the chain of bullets, feed it into the gun, close the top part, pull the slide.\n\nStill a few bugs, I crashed out after 1.5 hours or so but usually I don't even make it more than 30 minutes before I'm too tired to bother playing something.

In this game you don't want to take of your VR Headset.\n\nAltough in this game you move without really moving you won't suffer any VR sickness. At least I had no feelings of VR sickness so far.\n\nThe steering is very intuitive but it needs some training. This game shows a way of moving around in VR like no other game so far. \n\nThe graphics are really nice and I think the best compromise of detail that can be delivered in VR without having performance issues with the currently available hardware.\n\nThe game is much fun so far and shooting is easier than I thought.", "timestamp_created": 1472579210, "timestamp_updated": 1472663294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25253612": {"recommendationid": "25253612", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978095237", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518847914}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes I am loving Onward! This game is one of the reasons why I wanted VR! It's a bit hard to see enemies at times, but that is more the limit of the screen on the Vive than the game. I love the complexity of the buttons to use for doing items (right controller to left shoulder to use radio, reloading weapons, etc). I was really interested in seeing how I would do with the locomotion in this game. I don't get motion sickness, but I was curious if I would be doing the leaning man the whole time. Once in a while I will lean in real life, but I haven't lose my balance at all. I am in love with this style of locomotion, screw teleporting - that is so early VR! Haha. I haven't run into any bugs either *yet*, so take that with a grain of salt since it is early access. My first experience in the game has been a great time.

The dev seemed to put a lot of time into game testing and feedback before putting it into early access, and it REALLY shows.\n\nAfter watching the recommended tutorial and practicing on the in-game shooting range, I tried out multiplayer. And it was awesome!\nWhen I got my Vive it was to play horror games and FPS shooters. And so far there had been no \"realistic\" shooter in the same style as ARMA for VR. Until now that is.\nIf you like slower paced ARMA styled military sim games, then you will instantly love this title.\n\nGRAPHICS AND SOUND\nFor a Vive game it is one of the better looking action type games when it comes to the low res Vive headset monitors. Compared to other Vive action games, everything seemed clear and more than I was hoping for diving into this game. Because of the environment and sound effects, you instantly get sucked into the game and forget that you are in VR. After the latest updates from the dev, the directional sounds has been greatly improved, and bugs are less occouring.\n\nCONTROLS\nFirst thing I want to address is the touchpad movement. I have tried many other titles with touchpad movement and instantly get motion sick. In this game I don't. I'm not sure how this was accomplished, but kudos to the dev. The fact that you need to physically crouch or lay down to do so in the game feels great and ads to the immersion. Swapping between equipment took a few minutes to get the hang of, but quickly became intuitive.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nI properly don't have the right to say that this game performed perfectly since I own a GTX 1080. But I experienced no low frame rates as of yet except for the darker maps when using night vision. But the dev already warned about this so if you have low system specs it might be a bad idea to play those maps.\n\nTO THE DEVELOPER\nThank you so much for making this game available to the VR community :) This is the only game as of yet that TRULY let people experience what VR has the potential for in games that aren't just \"tech demos\". The fact that it is a multiplayer game only makes it even more impressive.", "timestamp_created": 1472576245, "timestamp_updated": 1473699687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25252667": {"recommendationid": "25252667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136241178", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513712995}, "language": "german", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1472576079, "timestamp_updated": 1472576079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429523", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25252649": {"recommendationid": "25252649", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992342674", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472575663}, "language": "english", "review": "In case it wasnt obvius to you its multiplayer only so you need a good internet connection and you realy need to watch the tutorial videos as uoi are just thrown in to a multiplayer player game!

It's my new favorite game in VR. Sorry BF1 but I just wont have time for you now :-/\n\nSo far the game has been great! Glitches and bugs aside, I see lots of potential. Motion sickness has so far been a non-issue. Firefights can get quite intense. When you hear gunfire and your screen starts turning black because of the suppression, you immediately want to dive for cover. You may even accidentally  drop your magazine out of your gun and get gunned down by someone less clumsy :-/. So far the people I've been playing with are awesome, mature, and not childlike as you would expect to experience in COD or on Xbox.\n\nA few glitches I've noticed so far that would greatly increase the gameplay if fixed are the following.\n\nHolo sights- Sometimes they just dont line up correctly. It happens on random matches but the holo light will be too high and it wont line up with the sights on the front of the gun. (Pretty sure it only happens on Marsoc AR's)\n\nWalkie- A lot of times they just stop working during the match. You can sometimes hear one team member, but all the others sound like quiet static when they try talking.\n\nChoppiness- I have a GTX 1070, and I was playing with people who had 1080's and we all experienced choppiness when moving and looking around. This I understand will be optimized in future patches. Just something that can get annoying.\n\nAudio volume is off- It's very hard to tell where shots are coming from (both direction and distance).

This game is what the Vive had us imagining when we all first laid eyes on it. Gamers knew Virtual Reality was always going to come to this point and after the initial waves of content have died down, now it is here. Playing Onward feels like stepping into the future of games; a gameworld where real-life military tactics, aim and coordination matter. I have been testing this game for a little over a month now and there is a reason I have 121 hours on record: Its that good. \n\nNo other Vive game has held my interest for so long, or had me so dreading taking OFF the headset to 1. charge my controllers or 2. sleep/work. \n\nIt is to me the DOOM MP, or CounterStrike of VR. In the current game mode its one life and your gear, an objective to complete or defend and your team-mates. The bullets flying, grenades exploding and frantic radio chatter will all but convince you that you are in an actual war fighting for your survival. The movement system is a slap-in-the-face to nay-sayers who think artifical locomotion cannot work in VR titles. You simply have to try it to believe how well it DOES work. Gunplay is very faithful and realistic, not overblown in the effects nor the sound department. Positional-based sounds and voice seals the deal when I can literally hear my enemies on the upper floor of a building planning their next move, or I can hear the breath of a terrified conscript hiding behind a doorway (he's listening to your footsteps too...). \n\nYou BECOME the soldier. It is completely immersive and makes me throw my body onto the floor and against the walls trying to dodge bullets and hop behind cover in my room-scale. There have been times during my play where I truly felt I had a traumatic memory written from a situation I had just experienced in the game, because my subconscious was tricked into believing I would lose my life for real-- THAT WAS AWESOME! THAT is immersion!! At times you will feel ALL-powerful-- at times you will feel completely helpless-- but you will ALWAYS have fun. I've never felt my heart race faster while gaming, this is simply a new plateau of VR experience to live up to for future games.\n\nThe replayability, content and community for this game will keep it going strong for a long time, even if Dante chose to stop developing right now. But he's not, this is just the beginning for this game. I cannot wait to see what it grows into. For now, if you're on the fence-- treat yourself to one of the Vive's signature titles and get on the ride: it is already well worth the admission.", "timestamp_created": 1472560560, "timestamp_updated": 1472560560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25248224": {"recommendationid": "25248224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038622080", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500216325}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fuckcing good game !

If you're happy to play a game that is good, but just requires some extra lovin' that is likely coming then pick this up. 7/10\n\nGameplay: The ability to kill/be killed is definitely there, and you feel every bullet wizzing past your head. The guns feel good and require manual operation, such as reloading and using the cocking lever, but it isn't so precise that you feel like you're trying to do surgery with marshmellows on your fingers. The balance and leeway is really good. My only two real issues with combat are that if you want to use your map you need to put all your guns away (So you can't be holding a handgun in one hand and a map in the other), and [strike]that if you die at the start of a round you have to stand over your dead body until the round ends (Could be up to 15 minutes) without being able to watch the fight[/strike] I was just informed this was me being 'injured' and that I could have been revived from this position, fair enough! Bonus: There are a lot of options for preference, such as left or right handed, pistol position (Chest/Thigh), how items are gripped, and the like.\n\nVisuals: It isn't the prettiest game, but that doesn't affect it that much for me- If anything the distinction between the surroundings and the people is low enough that you can be sneaky, but not so low that you can't pick out targets on a bright day. The textures are not photorealistic, but they're adequate to me, however, the level design isn't perfect (Its fine. I wouldn't say its good or bad, but fine) and there is an issue with the terrain on one map, however, I've never had an issue with being stuck or unable to get where I want to go.\n\nControls: The controls are a little-bit fumbly and unsure at times, but when it works it works quite well; Its easy to switch weapons and use the items on your belt, however, I have had difficulty returning items to my belt (Like when I decide to try to throw a grenade, then remember what happened to my lightbulb last time and try to put it away), but actually using items is usually very good. Walking is fluid and uses a 'press a direction on the thumbpad to drift that way' movement system. It works well and you can move in any direction regardless of the direction you're facing, however, the distiction between running and walking is kind of gray and I had to learn how to move faster than a mildly panicked stroll in the middle of gunfights, but once you learn that holding your gun downwards makes you move faster (I understand the reasoning, but I think its a clunky and unintuitive implementation) it makes it a lot easier.\n\nMultiplayer/Latency: The multiplayer seems solid, I didn't have lag issues and voices were generally pretty clear. The only real issue I had was the in-game menu during the lobby, where the wrong number of players would be placed in the wrong teams (This occasionally transferred into game, to the surprise of our now five-man squad) but this is usually mitigated by people just saying when they're actually ready. \n\nOverall: A good game, and a very solid base. It feels like a game that has a lot of love put into it, but lacks the finishing touch. This is totally excusable, in my opinion, given that its early access, however, I'm still going to judge it as the product it is now, not excusing it for any issues.

They have done a lot of updates and expanded the solo missions to every map. I love the solo experience. I can now throw my plate carrier on and move through the solo missions, great training aid!\n\nI have been looking forward to Onward since I heard of its development and it is a major factor for me purchasing the HTC Vive. I spent four years in the United States Army Infantry and deployed to Mosul, Iraq and Baquba, Iraq. I was excited for Onward not only as a gamer who would enjoy it for the fun but also as a Combat Veteran who, like many, need that itch scratched as good as it can from time to time. Onward has scratched that itch and I am excited to see where the developer takes the game as it progresses.\n\nThis game can really be whatever you want it to be, depending on the type of players you get into a server. You can move slowly in a stack throughout the level and move as a team. Or, like I did in the ship map, you can use violence of action and storm straight through on your own eliminating enemy players as you go. It's up to you and what your team wants to tolerate.\n\nOne of my favorite moments was sneaking up to a stacked enemy-fireteam coming from behind a wall. I opened up my PKM and took a couple of them out, or did they go to the prone? It was hard to tell, just like a real-world scenario. Shots started to impact around me and I took cover behind an ambulance. I could hear the enemy yelling expletives at me from behind his wall. They kept shooting at me and I kept shooting at them, the rounds ricocheting off the cover. I've been out of the military for about 6 years, so when they executed a text-book flanking maneuver and hit me from the side I was really impressed!\n\nThe radio system is perfect and an accurate representation of real-world. You can speak normally to those around you without pushing any buttons but to communicated over a distance you need to reach up to your shoulder and push the radio button. You can also hear enemies talking if you are close which really gives the atmosphere an eerily awesome vibe.\n\nAs much as I love some of the other shooters for the Vive, Onward has perfected the rifle manipulations. Magazines are easy to change and the rifle is easy to charge and sling. I can almost smell the spent shell-casings lying in the sand and the aftermath of a grenade impact. \n\nCharacter models are great and show standing, sitting and IIRC in the prone. I love being able to drop into the prone when taking contact, conduct an ambush or shoot over barriers. The movement is fluid.\n\nPlayer hit-detection appears spot-on and there is great pleasure when mowing down an enemy fire-team with a PKM. The player's heal/revive system with the shot of adrenaline works well. \n\nI have never been prone to motion-sickness and I have hated the teleportation system in just about every other Vive game. Onward's movement system is awesome, easy to use and will likely change the face of Vive movement forever. I can understand that some may get motion sickness, but if Dante wants to address that I hope he can make teleportation-only servers or something so the rest of us can use the smooth-movement system he's implemented. \n\n\nOnward is fantastic but it does have some very minor flaws. I'm happy to see that out of about 200 reviews, only 10 are negative and largely due to players with a 980Ti having performance issues. While Dante said he is releasing a patch to fix this, I have had no issues with my 980Ti so I suspect these negative reviews are having graphical issues due to their collection of hardware and not just a single card. \n\nOne minor game inaccuracy that I ran into is using the M249 SAW. My controllers will hit each-other and I cannot pull the charging handle to the rear, easily to load the weapon. (Also, the M249 SAW fires from the open-bolt, Dante! :)  Although, having been an M240 gunner by trade this bothers me when I'm sure nobody else even notices, so it's no biggie. ;)   )\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game.

Talk about putting you in the battle, I just went through the kill house and it felt more like I was playing paintball than a video game.  The biggest thing I was worried about was motion sickness, but it never was a problem!  The touch pad for movement is an interesting way to do it and it didn't feel too awkward, but it was a little too sensitive as I moved a few times when I didn't want to... but hey it is early access and those little things don't even begin to take away from the experience I had. \n\nIn addition to an option to make the movement a pad press instead of touch, one other thing I'd like to try is an option to use the trigger in my off hand to hold the forward grip (when you release the trigger you release the grip) instead of a toggle. I had several times when the hand would come off the weapon unexpectedly.  Again, just some critiques of where to take the game but if you have ANY interest at all in a VR FPS, this is top notch... and I haven't even gotten into mult-player yet.  Way to go on this groundbreaking title!

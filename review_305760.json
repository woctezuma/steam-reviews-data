However, puzzles often call for you to set a delay in teleporting obstacles -- once an obstacle is placed, it cannot be removed.\n\nThe nice features of this game involve letting you \"rewind\" to the start of the puzzle if something's amiss, allowing you to make changes, and try again. And in the case playing your solution takes too long, you can temporarily fast-forward, for as long as you hold that button down.\n\nAnd in the case you solve all the puzzles, there's Workshop support where you can download others' puzzles -- or upload your own.\n\nOverall, well worth the price.

At first glance the levels look easy, but they are challenging! (I'm actually at a pint where I don't have any solutions.) The Story is also good, and the scenario described isn't so unrealistic. The Captain (which is a neat character [spoiler]that likes to play Minecraft[/spoiler]) says they haven't found any aliens ever, which is logical, since there are no signs of anything we could discover. [spoiler] That energy blast might be a negative energy blast, creating random wormholes which collapse after contact with positive energy (robots). Also, there's a nice excuse for the metal structures in the asteroid field, aliens![/spoiler] Just the density of the field is not scientifically accurate, but hey, it might be artificial, but I think Captain...\nummm... was it \"Barney\"? should have noticed that. But who knows! Maybe they were so far away that they couldn't detect it. I'm excited for the end of the story! (And for the solution of that level I'm stuck at.) Aaand the art is reaaaly nice! Just the rock rendering in the mod editor is... well... needs an update. Sadly there aren't that many workshop files yet, but you can check out my mod, \"No rock but steel\". Thumbs Up For The Game!\n\nEDIT: Nominated this game for the Steam Awards \"Game in Game\" Award. It deserves that! The fact of a [spoiler]scriptable arcade game system being available qualifies it.[/spoiler] Pls vote for this game!\n(btw, if you edit a review of a game you nominated you get something back, but that's not the only reason I do this=)\n\nEDIT II: There's just one unlogical thing. Why/How do the robots fall down in space? Is there an artificial gravitational field?

Maybe it's because of the very funny film \"The Naked Gun\", I watched recently. The eastern part of Germany, where I am from, has absolutely no baseball tradition. There is a game called \"Brennball\" (translated \"Burnball\"), which is similar and frequently played at schools. But in \"Brennball\" you have no pitcher and no batter.\n\nSo when you're interested in real American Baseball, Germany is probably the wrong place to be.\nI learned most of the rules by studying and watching simulated games. Nobody could explain them to me personally, because nobody in my environment knows the details. So I've been slowly developing my own humbly opinion about the game. During my studies, I was surprised to find out that the Japanese are a nation of zealous Baseball players - I hadn't expected this. At the moment I ask myself why there is this weird \"Out-when-they-directly-catch-the-ball\"-rule. Isn't this rule unnecessarily favouring the defence, thus slowing down the game? If the batter manages to hit the ball, shouldn't he have the chance to take some bases, no matter in which way the ball is caught? \n\nHowever, Baseball is fun as long as you understand the basic concept and rules. It's a unique mix of team and solo activities.\nUnfortunately it seems to be hard to find a good baseball video game! There are some \"OOTP\"-like games, but they only consists of numbers and stats. I want thrill and action! I want to be within the game, I don't want to be the manager only. The presentation and controls of \"RBI Baseball\" are crap, although it seems to be a realistic simulation.\nAnd then we have the bright star in the universe of Baseball games - \"MLB - The Show\"! This game must be really great, but I will probably never know, 'cause it's only available for PS4.\n\nThe PC-gamer better takes \"Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings\"! No licence, only cartoonish characters, but a lot of fun and excitement! The controls are good, and the players are full of visible emotions. They are happy, exhausted, angry or confident and they steam and sweat. This is how a good sports game must be! This is true immersion! You can even lean back and watch the computer playing against itself. By doing so, my little son learned the rules, too. And now he wants to play the game in reality! That's a great thing in general, and we've already ordered some equipment.

Given the lack of good indie baseball (and for that matter, american football) games, this is a charming and surprisingly addictive entry.  It brought me back to watching Sandlot or Major League, where the game isn't taken super seriously but the love for it is.  \n\nUnfortunately where it falls short is in customizeability.  While you can change the name, race, gender, and facial hair of any player you want, there's very little depth to the system.  You can't change their team, position, or skill levels.  You can't change uniforms designs or colors when you have a team.  You can't create new players, there are no free agents so whatever team you start with is what you have to live with.  This last point is especially frustrating because there are plenty of bench players who are more than good enough to be starters but are just not as good as their position players.  In a game with trading, they'd be great pieces to send off somewhere in order to grab a good power hitter or relief pitcher, in this one they just kind of sit there and take up space.  This should have been a major strength since they aren't beholden to creating teams, players, and schedules that exactly match MLB rosters, and it sounds like the sequel will have all these things so if it matters to you then hold off.  For me, it was dissapointing but I still enjoyed playing.\n\nThere is a leveling system that allows you to hire coaches who can make small adjustments to players skills (if the player has the right slot for that coach).  It's...ok, but doesn't feel like they should be called coaches (they only impact 3 players at most, for one thing).  I don't know what I'd like to see it replaced with, but hopefully the sequel fleshes out this system more.  As it is it just feels lacking.\n\nAll that said, I would still recommend this game solely on the strength of its character.  It's got tremendous heart and a surprising amount of depth.  Most of all it's just fun.\n\nEdit:  I know it sounds like I'm pretty down on this game, and I really didn't go into how fun it is.  It does a great job of capturing the essense of baseball, and if you play on a higher difficulty you really start feeling the importance of every pitch and at bat.  I just won a 1-0 game where my starter went 8 innings.  \n\nI feel like this game does a better job of 2k or the show of capturing the exquisite tension those games can bring, maybe because the characters are made up so you can project yourself more easily into them, but it's a wonderfully presented game.

The great part about this game is that you quickly pick up on certain skills, so you'll be raising the difficulty at a fast rate, balancing the game between challenging and fun!\n\nMy personal suggestions to improve gameplay for the SMB2:\n- The \"mojo\" mechanic for pitching.  It seems all to easy to lose mojo as a pitcher, and the only opportunity to gain it back is through striking out the opponent.  Maybe a one-two-three or scoreless inning should allow the pitcher to regain some of their mojo.\n- Speaking of mojo, I feel as if a beaned batter should not lose any.  If you're pitcher is batting, and he or she is beaned with the ball, I don't think it flows well with the game for him or her to lose a quarter of their mojo.\n-  Definitely add a batting practice mode!

The difficulty system (called \"Ego\") is well-balanced, always offering a harder game if you so choose.

But that's more of an impatience thing. \n- I wish there could be a 'Be a Pro' mode, but it doesn't really suit the nature of the game.\n\nHonestly, I can't wait for SMB 2 to release in September and the prospect of future Super Mega Sports Games (think Hockey, Basketball, Football, etc.) has me a super mega fan of this franchise.\n\nIt's important to note that these devs are based in Vancouver, Canada (woot!!!) and have a tiny team, but I hope they are able to expand with the release of SMB 2 and have the franchise take off. \n\nOverall, I fully recommend this game to players looking for both casual and challenging baseball simulation. Definitely worth the price, but you could wait for SMB 2 and the accompanying improvements.

I was looking for an authemtic true-to-life baseball game on Steam and it didn't seem to be available. But this game was garnering decent reviews and the sales price was fine, so I bought it. And I love the graphics even though they have nothing to do with a true-to-life sports game. They're all from the Sunday comics. And when they're in a tough situation, they sweat, they pound their bats they get looks on their faces. Love it. Hey, baseball is supposed to be fun, and this is a fun game. Teams are made up of guys AND gals. Its not multimillionaires in pinstripes. I think of this game in the same vein as watching a minor league baseball game, and that's not bad at all.\n\nI'm using a keyboard and there are a lot of complaints about that. Yeah, some of the instructions are poorly thought out and the keys don't respond very quickly. But that's what exhibition games are for, to learn the layout of controls. And if you google keyboard controls for Super Mega Baseball, you'll get a pdf page with all the keyboard controls. My biggest wish is that there was some way to save games in progress rather than go a full 9 innings.\n\nEDIT: I've now played 1 full \"season\" and the controls are simply awful. For example, with auto-fielding (the default), bases empty and my team pitching...a ground ball is hit to the shortstop, who picks it up and throws it...to 3rd base. And this goes on and on and no way around it. Shesh. For 4 bucks, whaddya expect? If you spend more...well, its your money.\n\n2nd Edit: I've discovered it also doesn't follow MLB rules. As the defense, I've had a man on 3rd with 2 out. A ground ball is hit to the second baseman, who tosses to first base for the 3rd out - but the runner from 3rd base scores - WRONG!

In my opinion the challenge should stem from (1) how well the computer team executes the basics (2) uses sound decisions, and (3) adjusts to your strategy against them.  I realize that this is not an easy task as this method would require extensive programming logic.  However in sports games where competition is the main focus, I believe that this subject is often not prioritized high enough during development.  As a faster alternative, they usually keep the CPU decision logic the same and just scale the player/CPU powers and abilities up or down depending on the situation and difficulty setting.  Any challenge outside of that would only come from playing your friends.  This game is a great example of this.\n\nAt the time of this review I have only played it for a few hours, but after playing several games while steadily increasing the difficulty (ego) each time, I did not see any changes to those 3 things I listed in the paragraph above.  The only differences I noticed was how incompetent it makes your fielders when it comes to catching routine hits (or incoming throws from teammates),  how it speeds up your aiming pointer while pitching, and how even #8 batters can hit 440+ foot home runs off the tip of the bat reaching two feet off the the outside of the plate... DESPITE the game stating I \"fooled\" them with my pitch selection.\n\nI like challenge, and I like learning from my mistakes and getting better.  But this game doesn't support that philosophy as when you get into the higher difficulties where it's not an easy win everytime, you usually lose due to the ability/power scaling, not from any controllable mistakes you made.\n\nMaybe I expect too much from a $20 game.  Although I think the developers were trying to bring back some of the vibe of the baseball games back in the 80's and 90's, they definitely nailed the \"cheese\" factor from that era.", "timestamp_created": 1498963542, "timestamp_updated": 1498963542, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488425", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33095425": {"recommendationid": "33095425", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990115002", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505822487}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredibly fun baseball :D\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1498933725, "timestamp_updated": 1498933725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33093519": {"recommendationid": "33093519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057193160", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519458213}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun but the control is confusing to me. better have a console for this game", "timestamp_created": 1498930922, "timestamp_updated": 1498930922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33086817": {"recommendationid": "33086817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254465429", "num_games_owned": 834, "num_reviews": 298, "playtime_forever": 6152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1057, "last_played": 1521617829}, "language": "french", "review": "je n'ai jamais eu un jeu de baseball  sur PC aussi bon que celui ci\n\nune pluie de home run\n\nles vols de bases et les strat\u00e9gie pour les bases sont parfaite et je n'ai jamais vu \u00e7a sur PC\ntechnique de lancer, fintes, bross\u00e9, plongent... sont exclent\nla prise en main est tr\u00e8s simple pour quelqu'un qui aime et connais le baseball et sinon c'est parfait pour apprendre \nun gameplay parfait\n\nles graphismes sont excelent les personnage sont fun le public est d\u00e9gent\u00e9 a l'image de ce jeu et les stade sont magnifique\nmodification des joueurs, nom,prenom, tronche, corps, coupes, teint, accessoirs... c'est complet\n\nla bande son est excelente, les voix des arbitres sont fun, le public gueule quand il faut, des petit rythme latino ou rock quand les joueurs vedettes vont taper et des annimation ultra fun, d\u00e9plac\u00e9, marante.... comme vous voullez mais d\u00e9gent\u00e9 comme l'ai ce jeu\nexcelent\n\n\u00e7a fait des ann\u00e9es que je n'ai pas pu jouer a un bon jeu de baseball, je suis ravi d'avoir trouv\u00e9 ce bijou\nvoila enfins un jeu de sport qui ne me fait pas regrett\u00e9 mes consoles et mes bon vieux madden NFL et major league baseball 2k\n\n\nsi vous aim\u00e9 ce genre de jeu ou si vous voulez d\u00e9couvrir je vous invite a venir jeter oeil dans mon groupe curateur steam senigaming sports\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/30955503-SeniGaming-Sports/", "timestamp_created": 1498920592, "timestamp_updated": 1514982993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33058590": {"recommendationid": "33058590", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981101700", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496970236}, "language": "english", "review": "gud", "timestamp_created": 1498862008, "timestamp_updated": 1498862008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33029664": {"recommendationid": "33029664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191125787", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509092290}, "language": "thai", "review": "wait for smb2", "timestamp_created": 1498813334, "timestamp_updated": 1498813334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33024730": {"recommendationid": "33024730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038518743", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 10715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516428948}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game, easy to pick up but hard to master.

But I do think even hardcore fans of the sport would probably enjoy it.\n\nI had this on my radar for what feels like years now, and I think it's probably even worth full price especially if you see yourself playing alot of local.", "timestamp_created": 1498395442, "timestamp_updated": 1498395442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32725371": {"recommendationid": "32725371", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993567513", "num_games_owned": 1386, "num_reviews": 182, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498272916}, "language": "english", "review": "A cartoony baseball game that keeps most things simple. There are only two modes: exhibition (single game) and season mode.\n\nExhibition mode seems more for trying out the game or one-shots with other people. Season mode is the main single player mode. It is not a management simulator; you don't trade players, manage player contracts/needs, injuries, etc.. Your unchanging roster includes 8 fielders, 4 subs on the bench, a rotation of 3 starting pitchers, 2 relief pitchers, and one closer. You just play a season of games, go to the playoffs, then delete the season and start again. Playoffs are two first-to-four sets (best of 7). First is the division championship between #1 and #2 in the division, and the second is where the winners play for the league championship.\n\nThe only other thing you do involves 'coaches.' Each individual player has a set of upgrade slots (7 max.). As you level up your profile (more games played = more levels), you unlock more of those slots and more 'coaches.' Coaches are just stat upgrades you put into those slots. You get access to more powerful stat boosts as you get a higher profile level.\n\nManually adjusting ego (difficulty) settings will get you the most out of the game.\n\nAt lowest ego (difficulty) settings, everything is simplified. For batting, your reticule is pretty much guided towards the ball destination, you just have to swing at the right time (and pick the ones over the strike zone). For pitching, aiming is easier and the opposing team bats worse. For fielding, I'm guessing your fielders automatically run towards the ball (unlike the slow walk they do on higher difficulties unless you manually control them). Maybe there are less errors. For baserunning, I assume that stealing is easier (I've never tried) and that they don't make obviously dumb errors (On higher difficulties, I noticed a drive to center field meant the runner on first doesn't run immediately and are thrown out at second if you don't force them to run).\n\nWhen adjusting ego (difficulty), you have to balance between enjoyment and competition/difficulty. Too low Batting Ego means you'll easily rack up the runs and too high means you'll end up scoreless. Pitching Ego is similar; too low means you'll have shutouts and too high means they'll keep the runs coming in. Baserunning and fielding just have to do with how much micromanagement you enjoy. If you want to be forced to control every player for baserunning/fielding plays, set a high ego. If you don't want to deal with the BS that can sometimes occur, set it low and let the AI handle it. When you boost your players' stats with coaches, you should be able to compete better on higher ego settings so you can increase the difficulty as you play.\n\nWorth a try for fans of baseball games (actually playing, not managing). As with most sports games, you have to be okay with random BS happening. A good pitch can randomly lead to a home run, you can make good enough contact hitting but it all be drives directly to outfielders, players might randomly drop the ball at crucial moments, etc.. However, you have the power to make the game as easy or frustrating as you want by changing ego/difficulty settings.\n\nThings I'd like changed:\n[list]\n[*] To be able to use WASD to throw to a base (and clicking to determine power) because it's so annoying when you throw it to the wrong base with the mouse. I had to train myself to make sure it went to the right base by moving the mouse in a clear direction for an extended moment before actually throwing. Luckily, the game situations usually allow the time to do that. However, it still occurred from time to time.\n[*] To have an indicator where fly balls would land. Left/right isn't a problem but it's hard for me to figure out how near/far it'll go. Ones that take a long time are easy enough to guess using trial and error (let go of the controls every few seconds and let autopilot tell you if you're near or still need to run), the shadow, and if you're close enough they'll start waving their arms. However, it's really frustrating when you don't get that time and the ball lands a bit too far from where I expected.\n[*] There should be multiple save slots for seasons (you can only have one season active at a time). This means when you finish a season, you're forced to delete it to play another. Even though the game doesn't allow you to do anything after one championship, it's still nice to see the stats for posterity's sake. Also, it means that if you have friends/family that also play the game only one person can play a season at a time.\n[/list]\n\nOther thoughts:\n[list]\n[*] I tried using an X360 controller but switched to keyboard/mouse. For whatever reason, it mapped my B as A, my X as B, my A as X, and my Y as Y. My RS didn't work but pressing it down paused the game. You can't remap controller controls in-game (although you can remap mouse/keyboard).\n[*] It's obviously made for controller but mouse/keys worked decently enough. I'm not 100% sure (because I didn't try with the controller) but it feels like matching the pitching/hitting reticule would be easier with a mouse. I was also fine with baserunning controls on keyboard. The rest of the controls, however, are probably better on a controller (especially controls to throw the ball to a base).\n[*] While arm is nice, having enough speed is so good on outfielders. Having a slow outfielder means a lot of frustration when what should be a double turns into a triple or inside-the-park home run. Arm feels better used on the cutoff players (SS/2B).\n[*] If you make a long throw to a base from the outfield, sometimes you can press the cutoff button (r-click) mid-flight and if the cutoff person is in the way they'll take the ball.\n[*] It can get really frustrating when the ball lands near 2-3 characters who are almost equally far away. You press a direction for someone to run towards the ball, but the game decides someone else is closer so it automatically switches you to that character. So your new character starts running away from the ball and the game switches to someone closer. The only way to avoid this situation is to set low fielding ego so the AI takes care of the work for you (the AI will run to pick up the ball instead of crawl).\n[*] I have no idea how pitching works. There was one time I 'fooled' a batter into getting a home run. I just try to randomize pitches/locations (to avoid 'anticipation') and mix in balls out of the strike zone. On higher pitching difficulties, I just throw mostly balls (non-strikes) because they seem to make contact. I rarely get strikeouts at high ego so I just hope they hit bad pitches for an easy out.\n[*] I'm not entirely sure how they rate Decent/Good/Great/Epic Contact when batting. I'm guessing it has to do with timing on your swing because I've gotten plenty of easy outs despite the rating. I've only gotten Epic once and it just drove into the high monster wall for a double. I assume that's how you get the 500ft+ HR achievement.\n[*] I ended my season at ego 60/99/99/99. I assume it gets easier as you level up and increase your players' stats but even at that difficulty it takes a couple of 9-inning wins to go up a level (~lvl 40ish). I assume the amount needed per level keeps going up and I can't imagine how many games would be needed to get to lvl 99.", "timestamp_created": 1498308427, "timestamp_updated": 1498308427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32644770": {"recommendationid": "32644770", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967929392", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510024876}, "language": "english", "review": "Best baseball game I've ever played!\n\nGood:\nThe graphics are silly but fun and pretty!\nThe Ego system is effective so you can find the perfect difficulty and improve as you go.\nThe Mojo stat is very clever and well executed.\nCharacter names (which are changeable) are funny.\nThe controls are great, even with keyboard+mouse.\nThe manager system is helpful and poses difficult decisions to affect players' stats.\n\nNot good:\nPlayer base stats cannot be changed.

Upon launching the game you may find yourself asking if it's even worth your time to play it. The initial graphics might take a moment for you to let down your guard. Perhaps there is hesitation to embrace a game that you saw in a bundle for a $1. I suggest that you soldier on. Let that game load, and take a tip from me before you begin. \n\nWhen that first pitch comes at you take a breath and relax. The batter will automatically adjust to the pitch. All you need to do is swing it at the right time. Worry about lining up that cursor later. Play the game for a moment. About 10 minutes in you'll be hooked and now you're a fan. Now you're asking yourself how in the hell it's even possible. \n\nWhy is this the best baseball game on the PC? Is it a conspiracy? Those are the types of questions you may begin asking yourself. The developers are also very active, friendly, and unlike almost every AAA game they actually address every question I've seen thrown at them. For example, you can't pick off a runner. Why? They didn't like their own ideas about implementing it at the time. I find that amusing and respect their attention to details. In the end picking off a runner doesn't matter because there is a lot of room for improvement and they are making a new version. Hopefully that means we'll see this game continue to grow and improve. If that's the case then it's a challenge and another developer will now have to step up and try to challenge the title. I give this game a 10/10 because nobody else is even trying, and plenty of time has passed.\n\nIf nobody else wants our money the PC master race must endorse the developers of Super Mega Baseball. Apparently they are Godlike and have done something that nobody else is even capable of considering. They made a baseball game on the PC that doesn't suck. I don't know why that is so hard to everyone else.\n\nIt's a solid game and evidentally this company, and nobody else, has the balls to challenge the video game baseball mafia and create it.

A must have for any baseball fan. It's a type of game that you just can't put down, you just come back for more, win or lose it doesn't matter cause you just can't feel bad when playing it. Don't let the funny graphics fool you this game has more simulation elements than any baseball i have ever played. Little algorithm called EGO makes it work. You can put it on 0 if you are just starting out or learning baseball basics and game will be fair and fun, or maybe you want tough challenge where you will need to put quite some time in unlocking some upgrades to make your team better. Then you can put EGO on 99 and piss some real blood :). \n\nThe game itself doesn't have a franchise mode but great thing is if you keep same team you played a season before, when selecting new season you keep all your upgrades for your players. That makes it super addicting to play, no matter if you win or lose you will get some points after each game you finish. You get points for even getting a hit that is recorded an out, strikeouts, home runs, wins and so much more. Every new level you randomly get a new upgrade to make your fielder or pitcher better. You can upgrade everything from their fielding ability to making him a greatest slugger that ever walked the earth :). Every few levels you will unlock a contract with which you can hire a new coach, getting better gear to even new stylist that will give you an edge. \n\nThe game can be deep as much as you like, you can play on some low EGO and just hit home runs for fun with no to very small challenge from AI, or plan upgrades for every single player on higher EGO. Fire that coach you are unhappy with and get new and better one, build your lineup like a real MLB manager, from your leadoff spot to clean up guy. You have all the freedom to make your perfect team, checking all the stats, learning how every single upgrade will make your players better, if you want you can get a lot of simulation elements. And by playing with same team from season to season you will never lose your managerial work. Personally that is the thing that keeps me coming for more :). Leveling up makes this game amazing. And that is great thing about it, you can play it like a straight arcade to a real baseball simulation. \nAppart from Ego a MOJO is also great addition, higher the mojo your player will be more hyped, a pitcher more precise, a hitter more likely to get that long shot to the moon. And by getting hits or forcing walks from AI pitcher his Mojo will come down and he will be more prone to make mistakes and throw that fat curveball in the middle of the plate. \n\nThe game mostly follows the rules of baseball, except every error is recorded like a single, but thats my only gripe. Also more ballparks would be nice :). \nIf you are a baseball fan you owe it to yourself to get this game, it's a blast. Type of game I see myself putting 500+ hours in and still can't get enough of it. You just can't put it down, after closing the game it's just pulls me in for that  one more game  to see what is the next unlock, next upgrade to make my team better. \nTwo thumbs up for developers, they made one AMAZING product and I can't wait for the sequel :).", "timestamp_created": 1494862732, "timestamp_updated": 1521232075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744277", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31760554": {"recommendationid": "31760554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103067695", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503168454}, "language": "english", "review": "Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings is a fun if somewhat frustrating game to play.  At this I've only played the game in Exhibition mode - I haven't played a full season yet at any difficulty level - I've come away with some impressions of the game.\n\nThe pros of this game as I see them include the ease of picking up and playing with the basic control scheme, the stadiums that have a nice sense of atmosphere and depth, and the sheer addictiveness of the game.  It's easy to play a three or four-game set against the same opponent, just as they do in the bigs.  It seems as long as I stick with contact hitting, basic throwing, and pitching without worrying quite so much about trying to get a fine aim on the ball, I have good results.\n\nThe cons of this game include some of those finer points, including fine-tuning pitches before letting fly, power hitting, lack of a practice mode to get accustomed to the gameplay mechanics, and the lack of errors in the statistics.  At least in the Exhibition mode, errors are made but not counted in the stats.  This may not be true in the Season mode, and if that's the case it's a very minor nit. But if errors are not counted in Season, it takes away something from the statistical tracking, especially as the game's stats tracking is fairly deep as it is, because the players do make errors.  And not having a dedicated practice mode makes things especially frustrating when trying to bat with power or get used to making diving and jumping catches.  \n\nI was fortunate enough to pick up this game as part of a Humble Bundle deal, at a cost considerably less than the asking price here.  For what I paid, it's definitely not a bad game and it has already brought me a lot of fun.  And I suspect some of the shortcomings of this game have been addressed in the updcoming Super Mega Baseball 2.

It is available for the Nvidia Shield TV and I've been waiting for it to go on sale to pick it up.  When I saw it was in the $1 tier in this week's Humble Bundle, I knew it was a no-brainer.  If I didn't like it, I only spent $1 on it. :D  So, I took the plunge.\n\nWELL WORTH $10, easily.  Honestly, I could probably even justify the $20 on this one.  It is very well done.  It makes me think of what a \"Hot Shots Baseball\" title would play like.  Don't let the cute little cartoon characters fool you, there is enough complex game under the hood here to make your baseball session a lot of fun.  The controls are very well done and the pace of the game is very quick.  (Arcade baseball at its best.)  My nephew and I played a few games against each other (he's much better than I am, that is for sure!  LOL) and we both enjoyed it alot.  I look forward to playing this title a lot more and recommed it to anyone that enjoys baseball games in general.  (I'm not even a fan of baseball video games.)\n\nI guess my only complaint would be that some of the tutorials can get a little annoying after seeing them once or twice.  There could possibly be a way to turn them off in the in-game options, but I haven't really gone that far to look yet.

This is the first baseball game in about a decade that I've enjoyed, and am planning to play through a whole medium game season, each game being 9 innings apiece.\nI'm not usually a cartoon-type sports gamer, but I must admit, that this is one of the better ones. I love the speed in which the game paces itself. I enjoy the way it takes over when there's a no-brainer fly ball, and I also enjoy the pitching controls.\n\nI like the characters, their personalities, and the animations. I like the way the controls work, each button being a different base. I like how they have the power metre go off to detemine how fast you'll get it to a base.\n\nThere's really not too much I don't like about this game.

Filling the void in the gaming world left by backyard baseball, Super Mega Baseball is a suberb game that has some of the most intense moments of any video game I have ever played. The difficulty system allows for players of different skill levels to faily compete, and makes the game much more enjoyable, learnable, and challenging.

That is, I think, a testament to the strength of this game and the way that Metalhead (devs) really made the game feel real. Another strength of this game is the ability for co-op and PVP. Playing with your friends (up to 4 players total) really feels clean and well put together. It is also very fun, especially in the era of diminishing couch co-op.

The pitching and hitting mechanics are as good as any baseball sim and it will scratch the itch of super casual and hardcore baseball gamers. It does lack a lot of the stat tracking and normal gameplay options you would find in normal baseball games (no pitch outs, no pick off\u200b moves, etc) but the things that are included are implemented, presented and executed at an above avg level.\n\nWhat really makes this game appeal to casual and hardcore and all in between is the way difficulty is handled. You choose from 0-99 with 99 obviously being the toughest. A few points tweaked either way can mean the difference between a fair challenge, a walk in the park, or a flat out RNG laced tirade mixed with occasional rage quits. Luckily the sweet spot can always be adjusted as your skill level goes up even between in season games. This in my mind is groundbreaking and it should be adopted in every sports game in my opinion and it's one of the main reasons there is so much replay value in this game.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this title and don't get caught up in the 'arcade' reviews of this. Yes the art is cartoonish and the animations are not the most realistic, but this game is a chameleon. It can be an arcade game for some and a sim experience for others, give or take a few things.\n\nPros\n- Pitching and hitting mechanics are top notch. Incredible\n- Very nice team upgrade system in season mode\n- Mojo system where players become hot or cold and perform poorly or above avg if the game pressure is high. Slumps and hot streaks happen based on this system.\n- Team appearances fully customizable\n- Most major stats tracked (not all)\n- Short Med Long Season\n- Difficulty setting should be blueprint for all games to follow\n\nCons\n- Lots of normal baseball plays ommited from the game like pitchouts and pick offs.\n- No online co op\n- Players not proportioned to the size of the field. \n- Sometimes runners hold up on balls that will clearly not be caught. This can cost you some runs before you get used to adjusting to this.\n\nIf you are a baseball fan and refuse to buy a PS4\u200b this is a must buy.

Steam is often to tied up to DotA 2 and CS:GO, but I urge everyone to just slow things down with a game of baseball or two with this game. If anyone grew up as a 90s kid will remember Backyard Baseball and this feels like a great upgrade from that. Nothing wacky here, but good ol' baseball. This game keeps my winter starvation away until the Spring Training season comes around. I definitely recommend buying an XBox 360 controller to play it. I did find using Keyboard+Mouse to be a little challenging at times where I had trouble throwing to the correct cut-off relay. Otherwise the mojo and pressure aspects make it fun and add slight wrinkles to player's effectiveness. This obvious becomes more recognizable at higher difficulties. Core UI and game interfaces is similar to MLB The Show. However you don't need to play a 162 game season. \n\nYou're able to make things super casual and make uber short seasons. I highly encourage people to play all the teams as they start off with their own flavor. If you're confident in certain elements, you can try particular teams that cater to that and helps you learn the mechanic. I chose the Blowfish because I wasn't spot on with hitting. They're contact specialists. There's a team for anyone and everyone. If you not confident in fielding, there's a defensive team that can aid you as you develop your memory for this game. \n\nThe only con I see for now is the depth of the team. There's about 5 bench position players (don't forget to upgrade them with your para-coaching staff). That's not bad. However at least for the Blowfish...there's only three relievers. AAAH!!! and the closer in my opinion isn't all that hot with this stuff. EEEKK!!! I guess my suggestion is make sure you take care of your pitchers and don't tire them out. Sure getting K's is nice, but an out is an out. I found CGs are gold in playing the season-long play mode.\n\nPlaying this game since Christmas up to now (March 2017), I think it's a must-buy or must-gift to baseball fans that want to not play the usual popular Steam titles.

If you want a super simulation baseball game, this is not for you.  I find those types extremely boring, especially when they try to be so realistic that it takes two hours just to play one game.  If you like your baseball games to be more arcade style, you will probably like this.  I was excited to play RBI Baseball '15 when it came out and find it pretty fun, but Super Mega Baseball is much more fun.\n\nThe good:  The art style for all the players is very cartoonish, but done well.  The game is fast paced, and you can get through an entire game in 30 minutes or less.  There is decent replayability in seasons as your team levels up and you can hire staff to make your team better, then play the next season at a higher difficulty for better rewards.  The game is satisfying to play, and the various players have lots of character.  Difficulty can be adjusted across a very wide range from extremely easy to very hard.\n\nThe bad:  There are no real baseball players or teams in the game.  This is no problem to me, but I know it will be for some people.  An issue I thought was going to be a major negative when I started playing is the automatic fielding your players do for you.  It looked like you could basically just let your team play defense for you, which would be bad.  However, if you let your fielders track the ball themselves, they will not move very quickly, so you will give up far more hits and runs than if you do most of the fielding yourself.  In the end I see it as a slight negative, but not enough to detract from my enjoyment of the game.  Finally, I have occasionally had an issue with the game crashing in the middle of playing (has happened in maybe 2% of my season games), which unfortunately results in a 1-0 loss for you and counts no stats from the game, even if you were winning 40-0 in the bottom of the ninth.

Batters and pitchers have specific offensive and defensive stats that can be boosted through modifiers placed in skill slots. I've played through five medium-length seasons and still haven't unlocked all the skill slots for my players. You can play against your old teams by starting a new team in a new season and adding the old teams in, which is a very cool bonus. \n\nMy game has occasionally crashed, which automatically hands you at 0-1 loss, which is frustrating. I've also experienced some inconsistencies with the available skill modifiers. For example, throughout my entire season with the Crocodons (a power pitching team), I had very very few useful pitching modifiers available to use. \n\nOther than these two issues, SMB is a huge blast that is definitely worth the price tag if you like baseball.

Not just about the quality of baseball games these days, but about the monopoly Sony continues to have over the MLB liscense. This is why for the last many years we have had poor quality games like this, RBI Baseball, and many others. \n\nIf you havent been playing baseball games for a long time, you might have no idea what I'm talking about, so I'll try to elaborate. \n\nIn the early to mid 2000's there were quite a few good choices to pick from when it came to baseball games. The 2k games,  The MVP Baseball series, and the MLB series were in their infant stages. Shortly after the 2005 season, the story goes that EA wanted the exclusive rights to produce Football games, more or less giving Madden the supreme domination over football games on the market. So in exchange for their monopoly over the NFL, they would stop making liscensed MLB games. They made a few NCAA Baseball games which were alright but stopped after 2007. \n\nBy this time, the 2k baseball games and MLB The Show games were competing for first place in the market. This was alright for a while, the 2k games were available to all platforms while the MLB The Show games were only available on Playstation systems. Both games had their own unique flair and continued to innovate pretty regularly year by year. \n\nAfter a while though, the 2k games started to take a back seat to the more popular MLB The Show series and by 2013, they stopped making baseball games due to low sales. \n\nSo you might see the problem here. The only competitor left was the MLB The Show series. This series is exclusive to Playstation systems, meaning anyone who didnt own a Playstation was excluded from being able to play any baseball games since 2013. Even worse, the MLB The Show games haven't been innovating in a long time. It's currently 2016 and since I happen to own a PS4, I've bought MLB The Show 2014, 15, and 16, and besides the obvious roster updates, there is hardly any innovation. This means that Sony has a monopoly over Baseball games that quite honestly havent made any decent improvements for years, leaving everyone else to either take it or leave it. \n\nThis is pretty lame to the community of people who grew up playing baseball games, and want for some competition to spice up the market. Competition produces better quality games with more innovation. Hell I'd love to see a baseball game with a career mode with as much effort as the NBA 2k games! Sadly we get crap like Super Mega Baseball.

There are excellent custom options, a unique perk system and unless you're getting slaughtered game-after-game, you can session game this over 2+ hours. It is simple to pick up but challenging to master. \n\nThere's a very generous difficulty gradient and I feel this prolongs the life of the game. The only drawback (albeit minor) is there isn't enough variety in the stadiums and when you have more than one fielder chasing a ball, the auto selection overrides itself and both end up running away- which is costly to your innings.\n\nSmall problems, I do stress.

I will recommend it,because if you love baseball,its a great game.\nIn itself it is an awesome baseball game. The physics off the bat and in the field of play are great. You can see the ball change directions on the lip of the grass or deflecting off the mound. The ball also plays very well off the fences. \nI do wish it was a little deeper. A 10 season Franchise mode with star points of course,more teams/divisions,aging players, pick offs,pitcher warm ups,deeper rosters,track errors, because they are a problem. I would also like to see it keep your W/L records for different egos, and be able to save multiple seasons.It could also use a stadium for each team(or at least for each team in a division) and the ability to pick your home stadium. I would be willing to pay for these additions. They would make a very good game better.\n\nIt does have problems in my opinion....\nI start at a certain ego to start the season (65),every time I win I add 2 ego,and everytime I lose I subtract 2 ego. I hold steady from 67 to 73 ego. I have never won a game at 73. I believe the game has issues at higher egos. At 73 ego I can generally predict how a game is going to go. I will score a few runs(2-4) early. I will hold them for till 7th or later. Then the AI will start hitting the ball in nearly perfect areas on the infield, where you have to dive,but wont catch it and the throw will not be in time, or my team will commit 2 to 3 errors in the inning. I wont have an error all game till the late inning with a lead. If I'm losing, errors are not an issue.Player errors grossly outweigh the AI errors. Also there are issues with fielder control. I was trying to field a ball with a left fielder ,charging the ball and suddenly I switch to the SS. The ball drops in front of the LF and the tying run scored. This is because its perfectly placed between the LF,3B and SS, and I have learned it is usually better to use the OF.\n\nThese issues are very frustrating. There is also times at high egos that if you throw a strike it gets hit hard. You can not throw a ball by the AI. This seems to be in big games vs. Division leader or a team ahead of you in the standings. Its generall early in the game...and doesnt last after a good lead.\n\nWhy you ask do I still recommend this game? Because even with these issues...this is a great game. The physics ( which are a big thing for me in a baseball game) are excellent. Its fun and challenging. If you enjoy a good baseball game its right here. Play/load times are fast. It could be a little deeper ,but its a good game.\n\n\nAlso I think the fooled/anticipated idea needs to go. Why would a guy anticipate a pitch out of the strike zone and swing at it. On the other hand a batter who is fooled will smack it to the fence.", "timestamp_created": 1474060214, "timestamp_updated": 1474345454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25523858": {"recommendationid": "25523858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120092544", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517354627}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a fun game.

Almost all aspects of the game are presented here in delightfully entertaining details, from a pitcher throwing so hard, he closes his eyes on release, to a glove-pump before throwing the batter out at first.\n\nYou have two modes, exhibition and season, each customizable; there are three season lengths, a dozen teams to choose from, and a fully remappable selection of detailed controls; yet, you can play the entire game with just the mouse.\nThe gameplay is smooth, the animations are believable and reflect excellent baseball motions and actions. \nThe pitches are easily selected either with middle mouse button or from a clickable grid, or keyboard. Batting is as simple as a click at the precise moment, or take a chance on a power swing, which has a limited-time hold-down effect to improve power, but you better make good contact!\nYou have a full pitching rotation. You have a bench of subs, and every player is rated in two positions.\nOnce you select your team, you can customize them in incredible detail, change the uniforms, but the most impressive addition is the staff; you can hire coaches, trainers, gear-suppliers, etc. Each one has multiple factors to consider, each is different, and all add skills to specific players, up to three per staff member. It will make all the difference in a penant run - you must use the staff to your best advantage.\n\nPersonally I made a bad choice when I installed, adjusting the base-selection sensitivity (set too low) and I couldn't throw properly from the field; even with this handicap, by batting the way real teams do - forcing the pitcher to throw strikes, going to the full count, etc., and by pitching with both variety of type and position, I was able to win championships. Then, thanks to the great tech support, a correction to my settings brought the full game back into my reach, and allowed me to increase a fully adjustable difficulty level (change it at any time) of my own liking. \nDouble plays, triple plays, throwing out steals, leaping catches, and diving saves are all part of a fantastic in-game experience.\n\nHands down, the BEST SPORTS GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.    THIS IS A MUST-HAVE!\n\nAddendum:\nThis game is really much, much deeper than a simple arcade sports game; I missed that aspect the first times around. The STAFF function turns this game into a deep, strategic, and flexible baseball management experience. Without going into details, there's a lot of fun to had and results to be enjoyed from carefully and lovingly assigning the right staff to the right players, and the displays make it easy. When you have great players sitting on the bench, and you start rotating and developing your players, it is more fun than ever. \nFinally, you can modify default teams into more interesting and different looking and differently named teams that you have personalized; then setting up a season, you can toggle on the newly modified team in place of its default.

Metalhead Studios understands that this is what a baseball game is at its core, and in polishing it, they\u2019ve made their game very compelling. Most baseball games feature realistic pitchers with 3-5 reliable pitches, just like in real life. Those games can be great, but adding more pitches and having them break like crazy really amps up the fun, even though it is unrealistic. But again, Super Mega Baseball throws caution to the wind when it comes to realism, all in pursuit of a fun game.  \n\nThe pitching in the game is perhaps one of the best, if not the best, pitching system in any baseball game I\u2019ve played. For one thing, each pitcher has an eight pitch arsenal, with breaking balls that curve so much they seem more suited to a game of wiffle ball. Each pitch can be thrown two ways - normal or power - which changes the dynamics of each pitch, causing some to break more, and others to increase velocity. This adds an incredible layer of depth to the pitcher/batter interactions. Those interactions - between the batter and pitcher - are the smallest constituents of \u2018game\u2019 that exist in a baseball game, and they really polished it to a mirror shine. They understand that this is what a baseball game is at its core, and in polishing it, they\u2019ve made their game very compelling. Most baseball games feature realistic pitchers with 3-5 reliable pitches, just like in real life. Those games can be great, but adding more pitches and having them break like crazy really amps up the fun, even though it is unrealistic. But again, Super Mega Baseball throws caution to the wind when it comes to realism, all in pursuit of a fun game.  \n\nBatting is a joy as well. The success of the batter depends on a few things - where the cursor is placed within the strike zone, their contact stat, and their power stat. For my first 150 hours or so, I relied on getting lucky with pitch location to hit home runs. I would place the cursor where I anticipated the pitch, and hoped it would appear there. As I reached EGO levels of 80+, I realized this was no longer going to cut it. I started a new technique - shifting the cursor in the zone towards where the pitch may land as it's flying through the air. This requires quick, snap-like movements with the analog stick, and so far I have been wildly successful. Most recently, I eclipsed the 90 EGO threshold season that I was having trouble with for awhile, and won the championship at that. Though it is somewhat derivative of \u2018zone\u2019 hitting from prior MLB licensed games, I haven\u2019t really seen a batting system reach these levels of skill depth. \n\nAll this being said, there are some things I would like to see added in Super Mega Baseball 2, slotted for release in Spring 2018. Firstly, some added depth in the gameplay. They already announced that defensive shifts would be added to the game. Pickoff attempts to curb base stealers would also be a great inclusion. But season mode needs the most work, I think. Selectively adding some tried and true features from other baseball games into SMB\u2019s season mode could be fantastic. The game begs for a seamless \u2018dynasty\u2019 style mode, for example. Negotiating with other managers about trading players could also add a great level of depth. Each season would naturally create its own storylines with players being traded and the league generally taking on a mind of its own. The league would be shaped differently each season. \n\nAlso, a fantasy draft mode would be absolutely incredible. Having a fantasy draft creates an entire league of new teams every time. That would be very compelling. Due to the fact that each team has a specialty (power, pitching, speed, etc.) they tend to feel a little too one-dimensional. Adding some power hitters to the Crocodons, for instance, would really balance out the roster. Of course, some would argue that each team having a specialty creates a kind of game balance in itself - each team has their own emergent style of game and strategy to uphold. The Overdogs won\u2019t be hitting lots of home runs, but they\u2019ll be stretching a lot of singles into doubles and doubles into triples, for instance, and so that \u2018small ball\u2019 style of play is their specialty, and this is all part of the strategy of choosing the Overdogs. Shaking up the players on the teams would make most of the teams in themselves balanced, but perhaps would take away from the balance of the \u2018league as a whole\u2019 as the teams become more homogeneous.", "timestamp_created": 1461816308, "timestamp_updated": 1510170377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.994124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22602204": {"recommendationid": "22602204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079423617", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461473465}, "language": "english", "review": "It doesn't even let me play the game even though i have the required specs to play....", "timestamp_created": 1461471610, "timestamp_updated": 1461471610, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.392771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22405906": {"recommendationid": "22405906", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976926021", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492553254}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an absolutely amazing game.

On a des sensations assez proches d'un MLB the show, en moins pouss\u00e9 \u00e9videmment, mais \u00e7a reste du \"vrai\" Base ball. Il n'y a pas de coup sp\u00e9ciaux qui rendrait le jeu un peu WTF et c'est tr\u00e8s bien. Les graphismes cartoon rendent bien je trouve, les bruitages, surtout celui de l'arbitre au marbre sont assez dr\u00f4le. Il y a quelques animations rigolotes mais qui tournent vite en rond. Globalement \u00e7a manque un poil de folie c'est dommage ils tiennent quelque chose de cool.\n\nLe gameplay en attaque est assez classique mais tr\u00e8s efficace, on vise avec le joystick et on appuie sur le bouton dans le bon rythme en pressant le bouton adapt\u00e9 au type de frappe que l'on veut faire. Pour le base running on appuie soit sur \"LB\" ou \"RB\" pour faire avancer tous les joueurs ou celui qu'on veut en le s\u00e9lectionnant avec le joystick. On peut \u00e9galement envoy\u00e9 un joueur directement vers une base en appuyant sur le bouton de fa\u00e7ade qui lui correspond (\"Y\" pour la 2eme, \"X\" pour la 3eme et \"A\" pour le marbre). Il y a \u00e9galement la possibilit\u00e9 de voler les bases.\n\nPour la d\u00e9fense, on choisit son type de lancer dans une liste avec le joystick droit (il y en a 9 en tout ils sont communs \u00e0 tous les joueurs, par contre chaque pitcher sera plus ou moins efficace en fonction de ses stats). Ensuite on appuie sur \"A\" pour entamer un lancer \"s\u00fbr\" tout en visant la zone voulue avec le joystick gauche. En lan\u00e7ant avec \"X\" on aura un lancer qui sera plus difficile \u00e0 mettre dans la zone mais qui sera plus efficace si r\u00e9ussi(t?). Par contre pas de possibilit\u00e9 de Pick off ou de lancer volontairement ext\u00e9rieur pour contrer un vol de base ni m\u00eame de but sur balle intentionnel, dommage.

It has a small but active steam community so visit the steam forums and add friends to your leader-board and get tips on how to improve. Would be nice if it had online multi-player (currently has local multi-player) and MLB licensed teams, but I imagine this is the next logical step for this game. Regardless, if / when online multi-player or MLB licensed teams come to this game, the current version should be an \"insta-buy\".\n\nSuper Mega Baseball hits the nostalgia spot too! If you remember having hours of fun playing baseball games for NES and SNES (Baseball, Base Wars, Tecmo Baseball, Ken Griffey Jr) then you need to buy this game now! If you never played a baseball game before but enjoy the sport, buy this game cause it will keep you coming back for more!\n\nIt's the type of game where I come home after work and look forward to having some free time just so that I can play.

I got it on sale and do not regret my purchase one bit. Yes, it's Baseball (my least favorite sport) represented in the form of a cartoon but it's game play does not lack whatsoever. \n\nFirst off, the game is local co-op. I just wanted to make sure everyone knows this because this is an awesome thing on steam. Second, the game play is also varied in it's works. At first, all the batting styles and pitching styles may seem relatively the same. Upon reading the instructions (as I usually do after an hour into the game) you can definitely mix up your style in order to meet the demands of the play. The batter can swing using \"A\" in which is a straight through swing. \"B\" will let you bunt while holding \"X\" will let you decide how much power to put into your swing. Alternatively, using the right thumb stick will let you sort of have a say in where the ball goes. This selection also uses a power setting in which starts at 0 and goes all the way up to 99 then back to 0. Timing is important in the game and plays a role from batting to pitching. \n\nWhen pitching (playing solo), the player will have to line up his pitch into a small box that is displayed. The game is even nice enough to show you where the ball is planning to go. These arrows may point in a different direction depending on what type of pitch you choose. I believe there are 8 different pitches to choose from including fast balls and forkballs. Playing local co-op though, there are no boxes displayed as to where you should line your shot up. This doesn't take away from the game as you can still get some fancy throws off. \n\nPlaying out field is relatively simple and you'll feel almost in complete control of your players. \"LB\" tells all players to run around the bases while \"RB\" tells everyone to run back to the previous. You can tell individual players to run to certain bases and even play some tricks running back and fourth. Pressing \"RB\" while playing outfield will make your player jump while pressing \"RT\" will make them dive. These are fantastic features but can sometimes be slightly misleading. Spacing sometimes plays an issue as I'm unsure whether to press one of those buttons or not in fear of completely missing the ball. You, as the player have to give some time to the actual players to pick up the ball. The ball is throwing accordingly to the button layout (Y - 2nd base, X - third base, A - home and B - 1st base) and holding down the throw button brings up a power meter of how hard to throw the ball. Releasing at the right time will give you desired power. The controls overall are pretty on point and you'll be blaming yourself more than it for mess-ups. Level of difficulty can be adjusted but be aware, anything over 20 is pretty tough (and 20 is medium)! The teams also have different characteristic settings as some are better at bat than pitching. All teams have ridiculously funny names.\n\n\nThe graphics are very enjoyable and the character designs are fantastic. Everything seems like it was taking slightly over the top but it's absolutely suiting. I wish they would add maybe one or two more arenas to play in. The ones that are given are none the less pretty.The local co-op scheme is absolutely phenomenal and well organized. Don't know whose pitching? Don't know whose batting? Don't know whose playing outfield? Don't know whose controlling what? Take a quick glance before the pitch is thrown and you'll see which player is assigned which task. Sounds are funny as the umpire will have you laughing when he sends you off the field (YOOOOOUUUURRRR OUTTAAAHEEERREEE isn't the start of it...  a deep low voice will be saying some random stuff that you'll have to listen to carefully to make out what the guys yelling in a mumbling fashion). From the bat making contact with the ball to the throws themselves, everything seems on point.\n\nOverall, a really fun baseball game that closely mimics a real one.

For about $20, you're probably not going to find a better one on PC. Compared to the awful (I thought) RBI Baseball 15, this game is a grand slam. The people that made this game knew what they were doing and obviously enjoy baseball. If you were into classic baseball games like Baseball Stars, then you'll probably like this one.\n\nTrue, there are no MLB rosters, but the players that are here are customizable to some extent. You can change their looks, numbers, and names. Their skill attributes can be improved over the course of a season through the acquisition of \"starpoints\" during games, hiring a coaching staff, and then assigning certain modifiers to players. Yes, it is as confusing as it sounds and not very intuitive at first, but I think I figured it out.  \n\nHere are some quick pros/cons:\nPROS:\n- Excellent/fun gameplay, smooth animation.\n- 6 beautiful baseball stadiums with their own configurations and characteristics.\n- Simple and intuitive hitting and pitching interface.\n- No bugs that I have noticed yet.\n- Attention to detail in the stadiums and player animations (some funny player reactions). \n- CPU teams seem to make the right plays in the right situations. \n- \"Ego\" adjustment so you can play at varying levels of difficulty.\n\nCONS (but not really... I mean, for this price these aren't that bad):\n- Not very deep stats, just the basics. In season modes, you can look at the stats for your own team or the top-10 league leaders in the basic categories. Unfortunately, you can't compare total team stats with other teams. Errors are not counted. So all runs are earned, no matter if runs score because of dropped balls. \n- No Home Run Derby! This is too bad, because it's really fun to hit homers in these stadiums. There are all kinds of features over the fence for the ball to hit and bounce around a bit. It just doesn't \"disappear\" into thin air like some games. Please add a HR Derby mode!\n- All pitchers can throw the same pitches, although with various degrees of velocity and movement.\n- Not really a CON because this is probably just me... Baserunning with keyboard/mouse setup is quite tough to get used to. I understand how it works now, but I still screw it up. I've lost count of how many times I've run myself out of an inning because I have runners going in all kinds of ridiculous directions. But I did figure out that yelling and screaming at the monitor does NOT help.\n\nThat's all I have for the moment.

I think these guys really care. Thanks.\n\nWhat I wish the game had:\n\nPersonally I'd like to be able to swing at any pitch even if the indicator doesn't turn red and even if I miss by a mile, as I just feel restricted, but I'm sure there's a reason for it; I just don't know it.\n\nAs others have pointed out, it would be nice for an update to this game or included in SMB 2 (if any), that the seasons continue on to be recorded (but not a big deal) and each team had their own stadium (big deal).\n\nThe crowd should mostly root for the home team and boo or be quiet for the visiting team. For the most part, they cheer indiscriminately, and that makes it feel less like a real baseball game.\n\nI'd like to be able to skip the home run sequences.\n\nPractice features such as hitting and base running would be very helpful.\n\nThis game is very fun and very replayable. The models are really basic, but it more than makes up for it everywhere else, especially gameplay and controls, and that's much much more important than the models.

F\u00fcr Baseball-Begeisterte, f\u00fcr Pro-Gamer im Baseballbereich und f\u00fcr die noobigsten Anf\u00e4nger (wie mich) ist dieses Spiel wunderbar. Es lassen sich kurze Matches ebenso arrangieren, wie das Spielen einer ganzen Saison! Man kann im KOOP-Modus oder im kompetitiven Modus spielen, was ich sehr sehr begr\u00fc\u00dfe!\nF\u00fcr einen ersten Blick aufs Feld:\nhttps://youtu.be/a-Pe_i8HLrM\nDie Regeln sind schnell gelernt, das Handling ist dagegen etwas gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig. Aber die Tutorials erkl\u00e4ren es sehr gut, so dass man schnell auf das Spielfeld gelassen wird. Ein Homerun ist dann kein Zauberst\u00fcck mehr, sondern reinste Technik. Einziges Manko ist die fehlende deutsche \u00dcbersetzung, wobei ich noch nicht im Workshop nachgesehen habe. Das Spiel ist rundherum gut durchdacht und in Sound, Musik & Grafik umgesetzt.

In fact, I believe I am the only person in the United States that follows baseball and no other sport. I am a student of the history of the game - especially the Dead Ball Era. As such, I have played every \"serious\" baseball sim with mainstays being OOTP and Baseball Mogul.\n\nI've been looking for a fun arcade type baseball game. In the glory days of the C64 and Amiga it was Hardball, MicroLeague Baseball and Earl Weaver baseball - the latter a decent strategy sim. My best friend and I used to stay up all night playing Hardball on the C64. I tried other arcade titles such as Star League Baseball, and The Show. None of these could touch the sheer fun of the first iteration of Hardball - until now.\n\nSuper Mega Baseball Extra Innings - known for the rest of this review as SMBEI - has completely captivated me. There are no trades, the longest season is only 40 games, there are limited substitutions, and the game looks like a nice little game forkids. But, don't be misled by these observations. SMBEI is a well done representation of baseball in an arcade format. Developer Metalhead have put a lot of love into this game and it shows. The game plays very well with KB and mouse even though the devs recommend a controller.\n\nThere is a visceral feeling to hitting the ball and pitching is a blast. The cartoon aesthetic may put some potential gamers off but, this is really quite a serious baseball game. The parks look fantastic, the fans are hilarious, and the cusomization is pretty good.\n\nDifficulty level is determined by a mechanism nown as \"ego.\" The higher the number, the more challenging the game is. And I would strongly suggest that after a few games to ratchet up the ego rating for a real challenge.\n\nAll of that said, there isn't complete joy in Mudville.You cannot create your own teams, bench and bullpen are very limited and while replayability is good, it could be better with more teams as well as an option to import stats from the free Sean Lahman Baseball Database.\n\nIt's the perfect baseball game to play when you aren' feeling up to the intricacies of games like Baseball Mogul and OOTP.

I was looking for a baseball game I can play season mode and I get this and more. I enjoy playing season modes in baseball not only to see if I can make it to the play offs and win but to see stats stack up during the season. How will each player has done for me through it all. This game not only gives me that but as you play consecutive seasons your over all stats are added together. I am right now in the middle of my second season in this game and I can see how many home runs I have hit, how many times I have struck out, how many pitches I have thrown how many double and triple plays I have made and on and on. I love this!\n\nThe difficulty setting is something I have not seen. I am use to difficulty settings of something along the lines of \"Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard\"  In this game your  difficulty is based on your EGO number. The higher the number the more difficult the game will become. It offers a grander scale to work with based on your desire so it is actually easier to find a good difficulty level for you than any other baseball game. (That I have played that is). Which brings me to my next thought, I was hesitant on buying this game, because I usually find in baseball games that you can create a team and just power slug fest your way through, having scores of 40-0 lol Its fun sure for awhile but then there is no difficulty and becomes boring after awhile. WIth the difficulty system you can avoid this problem. \n\nI have 2 things that I do not like about this game. The season is really short even on the longest length. 48 games. I can over look that though, it is just sad though. \n\nThe biggest issue I found in this game, and it may just be me, but the controls on the keyboard.

The only option available out there was OOTP, which isn't really my thing.\n\nA good experience I remember having was back in 2007-2008, when Ulltimate Baseball Online (aka Real Baseball Online) was around, which then became inaccessible. Different attempts to bring it back by other parties also didn't go well.\n\nThen I saw this game. I didn't expect much from it by simply looking at the pictures. Yet I gave it a try and playing the game is a whole different story. It's \"arcadey\" and all but has everything covered. \n\nI am not really that versed with rules of baseball, and can't really say what the game misses, therefore I think it's a nice game that anyone can pick up, even without having prior experience/knowledge about baseball as a sport.\n\nApart from being able to play a full baseball game, the game also offers ability for players to assign their team members with new skills and traits that can be applied in a game. Those skills are gained at the end of games based on performance which is calculated with points. \n\nPlayers also have the freedom to set the difficulty of games using \"ego\" which decides how much control a player needs to put on the team members. The higher the \"ego\" the more attention a player needs to put into controls and depend less on the AI aspect.\n\nIn addition to that, the customisation of team members in terms of looks is also possible. It has a wide variety of funny looking faces and hair styles that don't really reduce the game quality but instead add to it a fun and less serious atmosphere.

Not so much Tactical.-\n\nIn this game You mostly play Pitching, Batting and Fielding.\nYou can Customize the Players' Appearances and Names also , in Season Mode, Stats (via Staff Trainings, Gears, Styles)\nCannot create your own Team or Players though. only customize the existing players.\n\nSadly there is not much Depth about Tactics (No detailed fielding positions and other few things)\nBut It's a very fun PC Baseball game i've played in a while (i think there's still not Enough Baseball game on PC)\n\nI currently play on a Long Season. and it's really long (now at 22 of 48 games). I have grown to like my Customized Players with their individual play style.\n\nThe game run smoothly for me at 60fps (max) in fullscreen and windowed mode.\nControl with KB&Mouse and Controller is good. I did not get any problem so far.\n(Playing Local Multiplayer with 1 controller vs/with KB&Mouse need a bit of tweaking in the config file. As detailed in the Forum)\n\nps. As you may already know the Graphics and Art styles are Comical.

As many pointed out, the running system is a little unintuitive.\n\nBottom line: a fun engaging wieldly game that doesnt take it self too seriously but offers the player enough depth to play a casual arcade slugfest and/or manage, customize and play a team throughout a season.

At the end of the game I thought at least i would spend some time upgrading and whatever and maybe it would get more interesting with time but the upgrading options are so light that they could just be non existent.

There's much more depth here than you may expect. A ton of super-solid game mechanics with the right amount of control to satisfy those of us who want to jump in and play but also feel like we're mastering a game and crave the feeling of progression.\n\nSome of the solid game mechanics I enjoy:\n\nBATTING - has both tap button swing and power swing (hold the button to build up power and release at the right moment) all the while moving your mouse/controller to position the bat. Increasing the EGO (difficulty) will make positioning the bat more important!\n\nPITCHING - similar to batting, has a tap button pitch or power pitch by holding the button and aiming with the controller (or mouse).\n\nFIELDING - while simple, the options to jump, dive, and wall jump all exist. On higher EGO ratings, you will need to guide your fielders more towards the ball.\n\nBASE RUNNING - a nice feature here is you can tell all players to run at the same time OR you can control individual players (want 2nd base to run to third but 1st base to stay put? No problem).\n\nEGO (difficulty settings) - It has a difficulty system that allows you to fine tune the AI to provide you with the pefect non-frustrating balance of challenge (the values range from 0-99!), it's really quite incredible. This allows you to tweak the game's difficulty as you get better but keep it from being frustratingly difficult, unless you want it to be.\n\nTo put it simply, Super Mega Baseball is brilliant and an absolute joy to play.\n\nMy only con: multiplayer is local only.\n\nSuper Mega Baseball came out of left field for me and seriously hits it out of the park!\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nSome gameplay footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06YeN9BOu10", "timestamp_created": 1445516876, "timestamp_updated": 1447359504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668290", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18604968": {"recommendationid": "18604968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008611314", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477763539}, "language": "english", "review": "This game plays on Windows 10. I couldn't find any reviews or information as to whether SMB would play on this latest OS from MS (although by the time I write this they will probably have come out with another wallet sucking venture). As a result I was reluctant to purchase this game. However, I decided at the price, what the heck... I would give it a try.\n\nWhat a beautiful game. So happy that it runs smoothly with Windows 10. Don't let the arcade style cartoonish baseball players fool you. It is still baseball and so much fun in its simplicity. The EGO system is a stroke of genius. There is still enough tweaking that can be done to keep it interesting. Re-naming player names to Actors names was a hoot. It is a wee bit confusing at first, but within a few hours and some experimenting you will get the hang of it. If you want to micro-manage every little aspect, then don't waste your time. BUT if you just want to have a bit of fun playing an excellent baseball game... it is well worth the $20.\n\nThis game is visually stunning. The colours are vibrant and pop right out. The different ballparks are amazing. Please take note; the teams are not \"linked\" to any particular ballpark as there are more teams than ballparks. My understanding since joining the forum at www.supermegabaseball.com is that it takes time to create the ballparks and there will likely be more added in the future. The ones they have now are fantastic. The stands are full of cheering throngs of cartoon fans. The atmosphere is electric at times and you really get the feel of playing at a packed stadium. The cut scenes in between innings are outstanding. What a gem of a game. The streets outside the ballpark, full of traffic. Sparks flying off hydro poles. Subway cars, birds dive bombing the field, ferry boats... the detail put into this is absolutely amazing. I just cant say enough about the graphics. Outstanding!!!\n\nSince this is a console game ported over for computers it is a little tricky using a mouse and a keyboard. There is an option to re-map the interface controls to keys on your k/board, which I found useful. The fielding and throwing of the ball to different bases is very challenging. Using the mouse and finding the right \"sweet spot\" is difficult. Almost wants to make me go out and buy a controller, which this game supports. I would probably do just as bad though, since I have never owned a console platform and never used a game controller.\n\nThe devs and programmers are very quick to address any problems you might run into. They quickly answer your question and let you know how to solve a problem if one should arise and if it can be fixed. At least they get back to you and you are not ignored. \n\nBottom Line: Buy this game.

I really enjoy the batting and pitching mechanics, which are essential to a good baseball game, but everything needs some work. The fielding and baserunning are just ok. Both are too slow for my liking, even in season mode after you train and upgrade players. The difficulty curve is a little odd as well. The game has a Ego curve that goes from 1-100. I can absolutely crush CPU teams all the way up to EGO 60. Moving up to 65 to add more challenge just seems to make the game more unfair. CPU batters hit balls out of the zone off the tip of their bat a bajillion feet into the stands, CPU Pitchers get ridiculous strike calls.\n\nBatting is incredibly fun, except when it isn't. I think making contact with the ball and managing your power swings are done well, but I feel like you ending up hitting the ball directly to a fielding CPU player far too often. I once played a game where I went 8 innings just crushing the ball, and I bet the fielders in the had moved a combined 20 feet to gather them all up. \n\nI wish I could find a difficulty level that really hit the sweet spot.

This game might have some PS2 level graphics, but at least it means basically any computer made past 2004 will be able to run it. The stadiums and environments are pretty cool. They\u2019re nothing too spectacular, but at least there are some interesting things to look at in the background along with the crowd. Speaking of the crowds, visually they are very impressive. They all look like individuals and all have animations that go at different times, not just flat picture in the stands that bobs up and down. Unfortunately, the sound is off. They cheer just as loudly for both teams, and they usually end up rooting for the away team which doesn\u2019t make sense. Also, the sound design in general is just okay. Most of it is pretty decent, but some of it is just really annoying. (Que the Ump). Overall, presentation leaves a lot to be desired, but that\u2019s not the main draw to this game anyway.  \n\nContent\n\nSuper Mega Baseball: Extra Innings does have a lot to offer in the content category. There are a good amount of teams to choose from to start your season. I love the fact that you can change every single one of your players from their physical characteristics to their name. You can hire and fire staff to help level up you players as well. The further you progress the better staff you are able to hire. I also like that you have a full stable of pitchers including multiple starting and relief pitchers, as well as a closer. You also have to manage their stamina so you can\u2019t start the same pitcher multiple games in a row. It\u2019s a really nice feature, one I wouldn\u2019t assume a game like this would have, but it only adds to the simulation of the game. I wish there was some way to trade players. That is not too much of a big deal, but it would add to the simulation even more. There is also local CO-OP play, which is a must for me for any good sports game. Unfortunately, there is no online play for exhibitions or for season mode. I certainly wish there was as it would help with the replayabilty a lot. \n\nGameplay\n\nSuper Mega Baseball: Extra Innings really hit gameplay out of the park. The pitching is incredibly satisfying. Hitting can be pretty hit or miss. Sometimes it\u2019s really easy and you hit 5 home runs in a row, sometimes you pop every one up. It\u2019s still a really nice feeling system that I enjoy using. Fielding is okay, I don\u2019t like that you can\u2019t catch the ball on your own, the AI does it for you and diving could use a little work, but making nice diving catches and incredible throws feels really nice. I really like the scalable difficulty, the ego slider allows for basically 100 different difficulties as well as fine tuning the CPU\u2019s stats with the Ego Mode button. This makes it a really easy game to get in to, as well as a pretty difficult game to master. My biggest complaint about the gameplay isn\u2019t about gameplay at all. It\u2019s actually the distinct lack of gameplay. When you are simulating until you play your next game, you have to watch each game. They usually take about 8 or so seconds to simulate, but when you have 15 games  to simulate, you spend a lot of time just staring at the screen doing nothing.

Though if I had to choose between this and MLB The Show (not even sure if they still make that) I would pick MLB The Show.\n\nThe Pros:\n-Fun and simple to get a grasp of\n-The cartoon style is charming\n-It feels really satisfying to get hits/homeruns\n-Really cool difficulty management \n\nCons:\n-while it is simple some of the simplicity can take away from the game\n-The cartoony style is charming, but it can feel kinda annoying after a while atleast to me\n-Pobabaly the biggest gripe i have with the game is the fielding its automatic for the most part other than choosing where to throw or diving. (Idk if this changes on higher ego level)\n-Lack of team creating which is odd considering this game seems perfect for that kind of thing.\n-The creators seemed to try and market this game to people who dont like or know how to play baseball which is extremely odd for a sports game. I mean one of the trailers explained all of baseball rules which is just weird to me. That might be why the game can feel overly simple. (This honestly isnt a big deal more of just an obvservation not really so much a Con)\n-Also no multiplayer\n\nTo sum up the game is charming and fun to play if you like baseball and have been waiting for a PC baseball game. 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1441019098, "timestamp_updated": 1441019098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566462", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17808494": {"recommendationid": "17808494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082484693", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 2269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469949843}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and addictive, even if you, like me, don't have a clue about baseball.

Yes, there is no online multiplayer, local only, which may be a turnoff to some.  And, yes, the depth of season mode is limited; there is no trading players, no injuries, and a limited number of teams.\nBut if you're willing to sacrifice depth for fun gameplay, then I'd say go for it.

The physics feel super tight and even in higher difficulties you don't feel like you're getting cheesed when you ground out or pop the ball a mile high.  If you swing on that pitch down in the strike zone and haven't reacted quick enough you know damn well you're going to ground out.  Everything feels very organic and proper as far as how the ball reacts. There are two different types of swings (plus bunting) : power and contact. You are also able to check your swing with both styles. \nFor the most part the same can be said about the AI as far as their hitting goes; If you make your pitches and place them well you will get your outs and K's.  Again, feels very realistic despite it's cartoony graphics and light-hearted attitude.\n\nThe pitching, my favorite part.  You have a plethora of pitches (8) to choose from, which is way more than enough considering every pitcher has the same choices. The pitches available are:  4 seam fastball (so-called Meatball), Cut fastball, 2 seam fastball, Slider, Screwball, Curveball, Changeup and a Forkball which is like a split finger fastball or Sinker as far as the movement goes.  You perform the pitch by first aiming for the spot you wish the ball to begin it's trajectory and then following the break of the ball.  You attempt to come as close to the break point marker (which appears after you start your windup) with your aim marker.   The closer to that spot you get the higher quality a pitch you perform. As with batting you have two different pitching styles available to you. Normal pitching and Power pitching. It is a very well done and fun system which I find more interesting than the common methods found in other baseball games like power sliders and such.   \nAs much as I appreciate and love the pitching in this game, I also feel it is an area of the game that has a lot of potential to be made better.  Not so with how you perform your pitches but that each pitcher should have their own set of pitches. Along with that system it would more easily open the doors to having upgradeable pitches for each of the pitchers as well.\n\nIf you're familiar with baseball games and the game of baseball itself there is not much to go over with baserunning and fielding so I will not say much here.   \nThe fielding feels good but I can see people getting a little frustrated with how quickly (or slowly in this case) your fielders will move.  It feels very laborious at first but it is something you get used to and everyone's on the same playing field in that regard for the most part.  You can make awesome diving plays if you time it correctly as well as jump walls to reel in those homers you'd all but given up on.\nThe baserunning, less to say here than the fielding.  Pretty much your basic baseball game here except you cannot be picked off on base by the pitcher.  The game uses an adaptive method, if it notices you are stealing a lot of bases it will start to give your runners less and less of a lead off.  That is one point of the game where it is lacking and unfortunately simplistic.\n\nThe depth.\n\nYes, depth! In case you haven't been convinced so far that there is more to this game than meets the eye, hopefully this will make it a bit more evident.\n\nAs you play the game with your team in season mode you will be able to hire staff to help your team on their way.   Each member of staff you hire will have 3 modifiers to offer your players in four different categories.  Gear vendors, Trainers, Coaches and Stylists.  Your players will start out with a few slots open and available to have modifiers placed in and their stats will improve according to the type of modifier you set.  Each player can have up to a maximum of 7  slots for different types of modifiers that will be made available as you play through your seasons.  Any extra slots and bonus modifications you have done will persist from season to season with that team and you will eventually be able to make your players superstars, for lack of a better term.\nThere is a bit of strategy behind this feature and you will also see the opposing teams players' improving in the same way as well.  In some cases even quicker than your own players if you did not approach the proper staff or applied your modifiers poorly.  For this part of the game I would recommend looking at SMB websites forums for a more in-depth description of the system itself just for a better understanding.\n\nThere is also a decent amount of statistics in the game including (but not limited to ;) ) BABIP, AB/HR ratios, walk and XBH percentages, OPS/OBP/Slugging, Total Bases, etc.  And if by chance you don't know what any of these actually mean it is described in game.\n\nOne more thing that adds to the depth of this game is the highly adjustable and customizable difficulty system, called \"Ego\".\nYou can adjust the difficulty across the board, or you can go into what's called Ego mode and adjust the difficulty based on the positions you're playing.  For example, you could have batting and pitching at 50 Ego, but fielding and baserunning at 80 Ego so the game doesn't hold your hand as much for those bits.  It makes it very easy to find a difficulty which you feel comfortable playing at and that gives you a good run for your money sometimes.    The difficulty goes all the way from 1 Ego, through to 99 Ego.  Anything above 60-70 Ego (once you've gotten comfortable with how the pitches look and move) will give people who are familiar with baseball games a good challenge while at the same time feeling like it's a proper competition.\n\nAn unfortunate truth that has been a big disappointment to many about this game is that there is no online multiplayer, nor is there plans for there to be in this game.   With any luck this game will have a sequel, which, from what I hear and have understood, online multiplayer will be one of the priorities for that as it has (quite understandably) been one of the most requested things by the community.   \nIf by chance you happen to have friends within couch distance the game does have one of the most fun co-op playstyles I have seen for local multiplayer and a baseball game in general.\n\n\nIf you have stuck around to this sentence and read through the whole review I have written up, I commend you, and hope that this has given you a good idea to make a well informed decision.  This game and the team behind it truly deserve all the support they can get for this game.  It has amazing gameplay somewhat hidden behind it's cartoony facade.\n\nThanks for reading. :)", "timestamp_created": 1440652147, "timestamp_updated": 1440715962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26,

...finally!\n-----------------------\ntldr;  awesome fun game from the first minute of play... more depth and upgradeability after you get your initial fix.\n------------------------\n\nThis game really is awesome.  I've been waiting for years and years for a baseball game on the PC.  I'm not a console gamer so I've been saddened by the lack of anything worth playing in the PC world.  Well here is a truly great title that I was able to jump into and start playing immediately.  I could hardly believe pitching, hitting and fielding on my PC, and I was doing so successfully within the first 1 minute after installation.  You can jump right into this game with no studying ahead of time... the game teaches you as you actually play with pointers here and there in your 1st game.   The mechanics of pitching are fantastic and deep and the hitting is equally fun and challenging.  I have the difficulty setting set very low right now so fielding is pretty simple but I'm going to turn up the difficulty soon and gradually increase my challenge.\n\nAfter getting my fix on the first few games I started poking around I discovered some real depth with the ability to hire managers and use different manager bonuses to \"customize/improve\" specific skills on different players on my team.  Manager bonuses allow you to upgrade different player's stats such as power, fielding, mojo (mental strength and confidence), running speed, throwing power, etc etc..  Different managers have different bonuses that they can bring to your team if you hire them.  Each manager has a bonus that can be used on 3 different players and players have bonus upgrade slots... but not all players have all possible upgrade slots.  There is still more for me to explore here.  The point is there is depth to this game and it makes a difference to gameplay.\n\n----", "timestamp_created": 1440571923, "timestamp_updated": 1440572336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17716612": {"recommendationid": "17716612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082995144", "num_games_owned": 10810, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440638634}, "language": "english", "review": "So you want baseball.... you want a baseball game with all the thrills, all the spills, and the benches clear brawls.....\n\nWell... this game isn't that.. although it is still a pretty fun game to say the least.

It is an \"arcade\" type sports game, and not very strategy oriented (you can't shift fielders, for example).  The play is straightforward and physics-based.  It is also a ton of FUN!  The bobble-head characters are great to watch, even when you strike out.  There is a great attention to detail on this game, in a painstakingly cartoonish style.  The sense of humor and lightness continues right down to the stadium ads and billboards; I've fudged a few outfield plays laughing at them!

And, it supports mouse and keyboard or a controller equally well. While it doesn't have MLB teams, it is probably just as equal if not better than most baseball games that do.\n\nControlling individual base runners is a learning curve you will need to get over, it can be difficult at first. But, once you master it, you'll realize how well it works. The only draw back that I can see with the game is that you cannot pick-off runners as the pitcher. Also, you cannot individually steal bases without everyone who is on base being forced to steal.\n\nThese are minor things and don't interfere the gameplay, and I don't regret one cent of the purchase.\n\nThe only way this game can improve is if it had multiplayer and coop.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1440473994, "timestamp_updated": 1440473994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17702352": {"recommendationid": "17702352", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970724266", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1520804288}, "language": "english", "review": "Good art, good music, good style and presentation.

Fortunately, this is extremely well done.\n\nThis game does have something of an arcadey-feel, especially at the lower 'Ego' levels, which is the game's fairly unique difficulty mechanic.  From 1 to 100, the game's starting default is 15, good for most beginners.  The more Ego you're playing at, the more points you can potentially earn in game, which levels you, the player, up.  Leveling up opens up training and other ways to improve your players.  \n\nGameplay is rock solid.  In the field, jumping, diving, catching, and throwing are all inituitive, especially to those who have played other baseball games in the past.  Pitchng and hitting are simple, easy to learn, but more difficult to master.  \n\nThe visuals, especially on the players, are over the top, with exagerated features and even female players on every team.  Don't be fooled by the aforementioned visuals; the physics are very realistic and for the most part, balanced very well.  The only blip on the radar I've noticed is a bit too much of hard hit balls to the outfield ending in a runner on first being forced out at second.  There is no MLB or MLBPA license, but I don't think this game particularly suffers for it.   In season mode, you can also edit the appearance of your team, which is very cool.\n\nStat Tracking is also quite good.  You can find just about any stat you'd want during a season.\n\nAs for things I wish was in the game, can we have some online?  Please?  I'm not a big online gamer myself, but even if this were just the co-op modes, it'd be better than nothing.  \n\nThis is a very good first effort by developer Metalhead.

It's a nice departure from the exact science of an MVP/2K sim without the half-finished feel of RBI Baseball.  The gameplay feels like Backyard Baseball for an older audience and plays really well with a controller.  It has surprising depth, especially at the higher Ego levels, but was still simple enough for someone who has never played a baseball game before to pick up and play.\n\nI like the atmosphere of the game, keeping things fun without going over-the-top trying to be hilarious.  The ball physics are impressive -- it's not unusual to get 7-10 pitch at-bats by fouling pitches away, and I had one particularly memorable instance where a bunt started foul and rolled fair.  Pitching is immersive and rewarding, requiring you to really think or risk getting hit hard from being predictable, and requires a bit more skill than simply point-and-click without relying on ridiculous stick gestures.  The Ego system is a unique and, I think, well-executed approach to the difficulty system, letting you individually tweak different aspects of gameplay to make the game challenging without being unforgiving.\n\nThe game isn't without flaws, though, and arguably the biggest one is that fielding can feel a little sluggish.  The right stick is used for diving/jumping plays, and isn't as smooth or responsive as even MVP's controls were.  The players tend to automatically wander towards the ball, but there's not a ball indicator or catch circle to go off, so there are times where you feel like you're at the mercy of the RNG gods.  You also don't have a lot of control in customizing the game -- the team names, logos, and player attributes are all untouchable, but you are able to customize the players' appearance to give it at least some of your personal touch.  The inability to even change the players' handedness is a little disappointing.\n\nAll in all, this is an incredibly fun game right out of the box.  It handles well and strikes a nice balance between realism and arcade-like fun, and I think a few well-placed tweaks could really put it over the top.  9/10 and an absolute steal for $15-20.", "timestamp_created": 1440442145, "timestamp_updated": 1440442145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17697209": {"recommendationid": "17697209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146537985", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494252453}, "language": "english", "review": "Game Mechanics = Dank\n\nCharacter customization = Dank\n\nFun level = Dank\n\nOnline Multiplayer = Not Dank\n\n3/4 Danks", "timestamp_created": 1440439240, "timestamp_updated": 1440439240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17695930": {"recommendationid": "17695930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174684409", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518336366}, "language": "schinese", "review": "This game is really good,but sometimes it breaks down a lot,i think that is a bug needs to be fixed,somebody!!!", "timestamp_created": 1440433663, "timestamp_updated": 1440433663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17691907": {"recommendationid": "17691907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015094545", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458992400}, "language": "english", "review": "finally a decent arcade baseball game for lovers of the ballgame.\nSMB makes fun and is easy to learn, but difficult to master.\ncant wait for more content to come!\n", "timestamp_created": 1440415404, "timestamp_updated": 1440415404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17690909": {"recommendationid": "17690909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000592488", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515316239}, "language": "english", "review": "Super Mega Fun!!! 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1440409883, "timestamp_updated": 1440409883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17689400": {"recommendationid": "17689400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009618833", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 3157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500347370}, "language": "english", "review": "I have this game on Playstation 4 as well.

I took my beloved Moonstars on a long, 9-inning season. We dominated, it wasn't always easy but we got it done. Here's the deal: if the game crashes (which it does, most often RIGHT WHEN YOU WIN A FUCKING GAME) you take a loss. That's right, 11 innings of intense ball, we walked it off with a damn homer in the  bottom of the 12th and the game crashed. I reloaded, we had \"Lost 0 - 1\" against our division rival. I almost broke my keyboard.\n-Limited customization on a team level. In creating a new team, you're really cloning one of the twelve pre-existing ones with the option of customizing the characters themselves, but only by appearence. Hopefully someday we'll see the ability to create new teams and edit their icons, colors, player stats, etc.\n-Two game modes: Exhibition and Season. No batting, pitching or fielding practice.\n-ALL THE CONTROL MAPS ARE IN XBOX CONTROLLER TERMS.

I'm really not, I will give any game a Chance pretty much and have a long history of Gaming and Developing.\nThen why was this game the first Game on Steam I have requested a refund for?\n\nQuite frankly its the lack of scope.\n\nThere are two modes in the Game.\n\nExhibition and Season. There is no practice mode to speak of - instead the Game forces you to learn through a trial by fire. Innovative? Sure, legit replacement of a Practice mode where one could practice pitching balls, batting and so forth? No.\n\nSeason mode is literally an extended version of Exhibition - this mode could have easily been fleshed out (and I speak of this from a Programmer perspective) to be a Career mode with RPG Elements seeing as there is a half attempt to do that very thing by including Coaches to train up your team.\nCoaches that apparently work for free and Players that just show up to play for the hell of it.\n\nThat is it.\n\nThat is what you are paying for - Two Game modes. No Tournament play, No in-house Leagues to speak of, no Multiplayer 4 way split screem where you could control a player each as they each take their turn on the plate and then maintain control of them whilst they are on the bases to REALLY bring that team play co op element out. Nothing.\n\nI am more frustrated at the limited scope this game has. I have left it on my wishlist despite refunding it and will keep an eye on its development. It has potential but if like me you are used to sinking time into a Game and actually have friends who come round to play (as I do as well as play with my Girlfriend) this is just too lacking in gameplay variety to be worthwhile at the price it is.\n\nCartoon Graphics which dont capitalise on the medium by including any wacky modes and yet doesn't take itself seriously enough to include staples that make games like these a long term steam purchase. By sitting on the fence between these two ballparks this Game is unimpressive.\n\nAlso I WILL echo what others have said in other comments - to launch this on Steam and not include a multiplayer section despite having Leaderboard highscores feels like a Rush job to me. Including such a Feature and/or online monthly leagues would make this game top ranked in no time especially given how you can customise players - Id happily pay for DLC to customise them further.\n\nIf you are looking for a Casual no depth Baseball game to spend a few sessions a week on, sure, pick it up.\nI won't be until the Developer actually gives this game the potential it deserves.", "timestamp_created": 1440335307, "timestamp_updated": 1473380011, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518908", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17676625": {"recommendationid": "17676625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168119574", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449772696}, "language": "italian", "review": "shit!!!", "timestamp_created": 1440333634, "timestamp_updated": 1440333634, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.351238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17675533": {"recommendationid": "17675533", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969673552", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491348594}, "language": "english", "review": "Do not let the graphics fool you, this is a serious basball game.

Depending on what is going on during a particular innings, the tension, the emotion or even the expectation of scoring points might make the batsman tense and sweaty! But wait, the pitcher is as anxious and on top of that he is absolutely buggered with no MOJO left in him/her!\n\nExpect to see marvellous dives and acrobatic wall climbing catches executed by fun and cute characters. \n\nYou can elect to have an exhibition game for the fun of it or jump into a season, choosing how long a season will last - short, medium or long (consisting of 16, 32 and 48 games respectively with play offs). During the season mode, you will be able to hire staff to train your team and hopefully get more wins than losses, and other goodies such as upgrades.\n\nI like the player customization due to the fact it simple and straight forward. The perfect KISS principle and you will have fun with this option.\n\nIn terms of the controls, I would suggest you look at the tutorial. It is well designed and will help you to get the feel of the controls. It will take you some time to master them. After all, plenty of things to do on a Baseball pitch! Also, I would recommend you play with a gamepad. It makes the game more enjoyable.\n\nThe graphics are cute, fun and the game runs smoothly. \n\nPositives: \n~~~~~~~~  \n \n-\tGood, cute and fun graphics\n-\tNice Audio\n-\tSeason option\n-\tNice and easy player customization\n-\tAchievements\n-\tTrading cards\n\nNegatives: \n~~~~~~~~   \n\n-\tCan\u2019t see any so far\n\nSuper Mega Baseball: Extra Innings is a well-designed game.

This will let me delete MLB The Show from my PS4 to save some space.\n\nThis is the perfect balance of Arcade and realisism that has been missing since RBI Baseball (that's NES RBI Baseball, not the reboot).  The games are fast paced, but there's a surprising amount of depth.  The pitching control is fun, but moreso it's great that they've worked the AI so that your pitch selection is equally important.  Batting is entertaining, though some of the base stealing controls can be a bit much when you're first getting into the game.\n\nHonestly, an MLB-licesned version of this would be my dream baseball game -- but as is, it's still very much worth the money.\n\nEdit:  The one issue I've found with the game is \"in-betweener\" infield hits.  I've lost two late-game no-hitters to either soft chops that landed between the pitcher and catcher, or soft grounders that went to the bermuda triangle of field coverage that is the area between the 1st baseman, pitcher, and 2nd baseman.  In these situations, all fields will soft charge, stall, soft charge, etc -- no one quickly gets to the ball.  It's wose in the 1st base situation, because the pitcher will frequently start running towards the base to cover 1st (as they should), but then back off and work back towards the ball.

The game still has no online play. There are leaderboards, but it's just not as fun as playing with the person in real time. If this would be added, it would GREATLY help the game.

I've played the Xbox 360 trial of RBI baseball and thought it was terrible.\n\nAfter this came out on PS3 one of my friends snagged it and told me about it so I purchased it.  Don't let the cartoonish graphics fool you, this game is tons of fun.\n\nThey did a great job on the physics and took care to make sure base runners were the correct speed compare to throws and whatnot so double plays are realstically difficult and you're not going to throw out a batter at first base from right field. \n\nThe thing I like most about the game is the hitting.  If you play on the lower levels you can get away with just using a button to swing.  The harder you make the game the less help you get with batting.  \n\nThe increments of how much you get help with this go from 0 to 99 and it's called \"Ego\".  This makes it very easy to fine tune exactly how difficult you want the game to be.  The Ego setting also controls how good your fielder's jump is on a ball and how much you have to control them before they get to the spot where the ball is.  It also changes the difficulty of locating your pitches.  \n\nIn the PS3 version there was just an overall Ego meter.  In the Steam version they've changed it so you can either just change the overall ego or adjust specific Ego settings for Batting, Baserunning, Pitching and Fielding.  I haven't messed with the individual Ego settings as it hasn't been necessary for my enjoyment of the game.\n\nI have my Ego set at 50 and can still score between 5 - 10 runs a game just using the single controller button to hit.  I've tried the game on higher levels but haven't really attempted to go above 60.  Above that and it turns into the kinds of games I've avoided since then I'd have to move the cursor to get a bat on the ball and that's just not fun for me.\n\nMetalhead did a really good job on this port.

Don't be discouraged from buying it due to the cartoon art, as it has real baseball mechanics, the controls are easy to learn, and the gameplay is fun overall. I was quite surprised with the fact that you could even customize the players on your team. I was glad to be able to change my center fielder's name to Mike Trout and (try to) make him look like him. Of course, certain things can still be improved. On the first game I played, I somehow scored 10 runs and got a no hitter against the opposing team with no prior experience. I still have to experiment with whether raising the difficulty, called ego, will make a difference in making the game less easy. I won't hold this against the game, however, as in most baseball games you can score an impossible amount of points easily, but that doesn't make the game less fun.

The offensive side of things is pretty standard stuff, but it's the pitching that has a surprising amount of meat on its bones. Lots of pitch types, a twitch-based cursor-and-target system, needing to mix things up to keep the hitter guessing - it's a wonderful system once you get the hang of it. Fielding is somewhat CPU-assisted (less so at higher difficulty levels) although you can still take manual control of your fielders to chase down fly balls, leap for line drives and dive for ground balls. All of these mechanics are layed out via a helpful in-game tutorial system that works quite well.\n\nI really like how the \"Ego\" difficulty system is implemented. It allows you to ease yourself in and gradually increase or decrease the challenge until you find your sweet spot. And I'm very satisfied with the quality of the port - Runs smoothly on my 7870 and has settings for AA (up to 16x), AF and shadow quality as well as Windowed Fullscreen support.\n\nSMB is lacking when it comes to varying modes, unfortunately. Exhibition and Season mode is it. Something like a HR Derby or the option to jump right into a playoff tournament would've been nice. There are also only six ballparks, though all six are well designed and full of life. Baserunning controls feel a little awkward at first but I'm certain it's something that will only require a bit of practice. And while there is local co-op, the absence of online multiplayer is disappointing.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, SMB's finely-tuned gameplay and charming personality make it a joy to play.

Sure, we have OOTP Baseball, but it's not a baseball game. I love it as much as the next sabermetric fan, but I wanted a game to actually play baseball. And then we had RBI Baseball, which was a letdown. So naturally, I was excited when Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings was announced. And now that it's finally here, it feels like after years of being deprived of a good baseball game has finally come to an end.\n\nNow, I only really have three complaints about the game, but they're sort of not even complaints at all. More like a couple of things I want added to the game in future updates. \n\nLet's get those CONS out of the way first:\n\n- Lack of sabermetric stats\n\nBaseball fans LOVE stats. We love OPS, WHIP, AVG, and ERA, and I'm glad those ones are in the game, but over the years, baseball has evolved to embrace much more in depth stats. I want to know the WAR, BB/K, ISOP, BB/PA, RC27, and G/F of my players. \n\n- Lack of customizing options\n\nI want some of those Chris Archer stirrups. I want my player to look like that 20-something Jaden Smith-looking motherfucker. My nasty slider needs the player look to match.\n\n- Lack of online multiplayer\n\nI want to have my Harry Butts dominate another man's bat. I mean, he has a 1.45 ERA, 11.4 K/9, and .122 OPP AVG. Let me show him off.\n\nAnd now we get to the PROS list:\n\n-The game is beautiful\n\nThe player models are clean and fun. the graphics are vibrant. And the stadiums. Oh the stadiums are gorgeous. \n\n- The gameplay is fun\n\nIT'S BASEBALL. IT'S INSANELY FUN.\n\n- There are no special pitches or swings\n\nTake notes, Backyard Sports. Nobody likes to play against a pitcher who makes the ball corkscrew while it digs underground and pop up only to burst into flames and then into the batter's ass. Super Mega Baseball is cartoony, but it's never cartoony in an unfair way.\n\n- Ego difficulty slider\n\nI love this. You don't have an option of easy, medium, and hard difficulties to play on. You have an actual slider that sets the difficulty in small amounts.\n\n- The names of the players\n\nYou know the names you think of when you think of baseball? Babe Ruth, Clayton Kershaw, Sandy Koufax, Wade Boggs, Joe Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle, Rollie Fingers, Gaylord Perry etc. They're baseball names. Their parents looked at them and thought, \"Bob doesn't sound like a name for a future Hall of Fame catcher. Let's name him Buster.\" Well, in this game EVERY player has a baseball-sounding name. It's awesome. \n\n-It's a game\n\n-It's a baseball game\n\n-It's a baseball game on PC\n\n-It's a fantastic baseball game on PC\n\nWHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS REVIEW.

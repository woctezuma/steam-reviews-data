But, since the game is, in general, pretty fun and well put together (<= the positive), I decided to ignore my irritation with a few things:\n\n- My biggest systemic issue is that the game explains nothing.  From the menus to the goals to the mechanics, you pretty much have to figure it out yourself.  Theoretically, there are some explanations in the game's FAQ area.  But, since they're just vague graphics, they made no sense to me.  After playing a bit through the first level, I ended up watching a run-through simply because I wasn't sure I was doing things right.\n\n- My other complaints are much more specific and limited.  First, Level 6-3 has the \"Look Ma, No Hands\" Achievement (\"Complete level 6-3 with 3 Memory blocks without using the Rewind button\").  Since the game is all about sitting and looking at the screen as you try to figure things out, I assumed the Achievement meant you could get lost or something.  Nope.  In the only case of twitch-based jumping in the whole game, the Achievement boils down to 8 timed jumps on the last screen.  Irritating.\n\n- Next is the \"Sniper\" Achievement (\"Kill Big Mamarina with Psychobot\").  The wording of that Achievement is EXTREMELY specific.  But, the problem is that the last shot to kill the boss comes down to blind (literally) luck.  Again, irritating.\n\n- And, finally, the only way to complete the level just before the final boss is to be of an age to know about a certain game, know a certain secret code for that game, recognize 10 squares on the screen as representing something regarding that game, and put all of that together to mean something.  For the other 99.9% of the population, there's no other way to do it but to watch a run-through.  They're breaking the fourth wall.\n\nAgain, a mostly fun puzzle game with some irritations.  And, since it took me 25.9 hours to finish it with 100% Achievements, it's worth it even at the list price of about $10.  Though, of course, wait for a sale.  As I write this, it's currently on sale at certain sites for about $2.", "timestamp_created": 1513474311, "timestamp_updated": 1513474311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38156601": {"recommendationid": "38156601", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999858314", "num_games_owned": 1512, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512748380}, "language": "english", "review": "Tetrobot and Co. is a very challenging game but it also got a fair difficulty curve, The puzzles themselves are not that hard and not frustrating at all, they are well designed.\n\nEach level will introduce new mechanics and puzzles elements incrementally and will test you on what you have learned so far.\n\nI have really enjoyed this game and highly recommend to anyone who loves puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1512749358, "timestamp_updated": 1512749358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37815610": {"recommendationid": "37815610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070571332", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 232, "last_played": 1514030620}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0417\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c)", "timestamp_created": 1511811016, "timestamp_updated": 1511811016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37706125": {"recommendationid": "37706125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054830934", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1201, "last_played": 1514651320}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1]\u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043a \u0432 Steam[/h1]\n\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0451!\n[olist]\n[*]\u0423\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 [u]\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e[/u] \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c\n[*]\u041d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043a \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439\n[*]\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0448\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f\n[*]\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f Steam\n[*]\u0412\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f Steam\n[/olist]\n\u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043a.\n[spoiler]P.

Boy, was I wrong!\nIt's a smart, charming and addictive game of environmental block puzzles. It features a wide array of diverse mechanics with the levels never getting old or stale since almost all of them provide unique challenges. Nothing is explained explicitly, but the learning curve is very managable, even fun, since the game's infinite \"undo\" button encourages experimentation. You can always go back to before you screwed up or got stuck without losing progress. In terms of gameplay I've gotten frustrated only once for an optional achievement (a very hard sequence at the end of a level and each time you only get one shot before having to redo the whole level), which says a lot compared to most other puzzle games.\n\nSo the puzzling aspect is rock solid. The story felt a bit tacked-on, but is kind of charming. I'm a little less happy about some controls and UI stuff: There are weird hidden cooldowns after movement before you can issue block commands. If you click too quickly the game interprets the input as another movement command which can get a bit frustrating after a while. Admittedly it's a pretty minor gripe. More annoying is that the devs somehow thought it was a good idea to put the robot into a \"sleep\" mode after a few seconds without inputs, which plays an endless loop of a really awful \"snoring\" noise. But usually when I'm not issuing commands I want silence, because I'm deep in thoughts and racking my brain about a difficult puzzle. That noise really ground my gears several times! The menus were rather cumbersome, with seveal clicks and transitions just to get to the level where you last left the game. Not a big fan of the page-flipping design choice for the unlockables as well (especially since it always starts on the first page, not the last unlocked). The game also didn't feel well optimized for my hardware - I could barely browse after minimizing it, which usually isn't a problem with other games.\n\nSo while I do have a few minor gripes, over-all I'm still very happy with my purchase. There's a lot of fun content (~14 hours for all achievements) with many neat mechanics for a very fair price.

There are some extremely challenging puzzles in the game for even the hardcore fan. Your powers allow you to pick up (most) blocks of all different types. Wood blocks can be set on fire, ice blocks can be turned into clouds (which can then be pushed by fans), sand blocks can be turned to glass (which allows lasers to pass through them), sticky blocks, etc. The game is broken into different themes (fire, ice, water, etc), and each theme is broken down into 6 levels, and each level has 3 collectibles that can be found during the level or as side puzzles. If you collect all of these, you get a bonus level at the end, which leads to some bonus content online (game art, mostly). All of the things you learn throughout the game continuously build on themselves for some insane puzzles later on.\n\nPros:\n+Cute art\n+Great soundtrack!\n+Great difficulty curve in puzzles. You can almost always finish a level without finding all the collectibles, for a softcore mode. Ideas build on themselves and new ideas are introduced solo before combining with old tricks for new challenges. There are some REALLY challenging puzzles, but they're further into the game, where you'd expect them to be. A lot of times solutions for previous puzzles you couldn't finish will become trivial after you've learned a new trick later.\n+Wide variety of puzzles, since there are so many different mechanics to play around with. There's more maze-type puzzles, resource-management puzzles, and a lot of spatial reasoning ones that force you to work in a less-than-ideal area.\n+Length: I got 26 hours to 100% completion, but I REALLY, REALLY spent a lot of time on some because I was determined to figure them out with cheating, so definitely worth the money.\n\nCons:\n- I don't consider this a con, but it might be for some people: There are some VERY tough puzzles. I had to look up about 5 hints after spending perhaps an hour banging my head against the wall on my own. There was only one solution that was like, \"What the hell?\" because it involved extremely precise timing and it was hard to do that with a mouse and seemed more geared to a controller. The rest of the puzzles, however, were hard, but when I saw the solution, I said, \"Well, DUH!\" and felt like an idiot for not thinking of it.\n\nOverall: 9/10. Money well spent. The puzzles are so intricate and have so many parts to them that I can see myself replaying this in a year when I've forgotten the solutions.", "timestamp_created": 1498949856, "timestamp_updated": 1498949856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558671", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33092613": {"recommendationid": "33092613", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985118770", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496150682}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice puzzle.", "timestamp_created": 1498929566, "timestamp_updated": 1498929566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497950", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33047846": {"recommendationid": "33047846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005072613", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501950761}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440. \u041f\u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430. \u041b\u0435\u0433 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0438 \u0412\u042b\u041d\u0415\u0421\u0418 \u0421\u0415\u0411\u0415 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433 :)", "timestamp_created": 1498843677, "timestamp_updated": 1498843677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32974899": {"recommendationid": "32974899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056811737", "num_games_owned": 485, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438993245}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun but deceptively difficult puzzle game.

In my eyes, this is a rather cheap strategy for developers to raise the level of challenge for the players. Because it's more about fine motor skills and not so much the problem solving skills, and it usually adds a lot of frustration to the gaming experience. I understand how some might find these challenges appealing, but for those who simply want a challenge of the mind, these obstacles are unnecessary.\n\nThe most amazing thing with this game, is its ability to raise the level of challenge purely relying on problem solving skills. Out of over 50 levels in total, only in 2 ocassions do you have 2 small timing obstacles, while the rest of the puzzle relies 100% on using your brain. How the game requires you to think methodically, systematically figure out how to use all the gaming mechanics to solve the puzzles, is quite ingenious.\n\nHaving said that, the game isn't without minor flaws. My main complaint is the introduction of one or two gaming mechanics (a very small percentage of the total): these mechanics required to complete the puzzles are not clearly laid out to the players, and really demand lots of experimentation, and sometimes a bit of luck to stumble upon. This is not a serious issue, but might be frustrating when you are stuck at certain levels for a long time. \n\nOverall this is a fantastic game and I can wholeheartedly recommend it at full price to anyone who loves mental exercises. I also believe the game is a great educational tool, and can teach not only kids but adults how to think methodically, in order to greatly improve their problem solving skills. It's such a shame the game is so hidden on steam, despite its 97% positive review at the time of this writing. Currently it's impossible to find this game by filtering by reviews in the puzzle category, and this illustrates how lacking the Steam storefront algorithm is.

Otherwise, you can take a slightly more laidback approach to the puzzles, though you won't unlock all of the levels that way.  Akin to Yoshi's Island for the SNES, you have to get all 3 of the memory blocks in the same playthrough for it to count towards 100%'ing the game.  I was able to achieve that in a total span of less than 8 hours, which is surprisingly long considering that it's a puzzle game with less than 50 levels.  That's not a lot of content for this style of game, yet I feel like it was a smart choice, as it keeps the variety of game-play mechanics fresh, adding new block mechanics and layering elements you need to keep in mind in order to progress, instead of rehashing the same basic design numerous times with slight tweaks and alterations.  Not all of the mechanics of the blocks were explained or demonstrated that clearly, and the, \"Informative,\" pages over them weren't that useful, but trial and error will let the player hash the details out.  Plus the game has a fast, easy to use rewind feature, allowing you to undo any move rapidly.  The achievement for level 6-3 only demonstrates the remarkable utility of this feature, as otherwise the game would be utterly unpleasant to play, as it is very easy to make a slight mistake, which will mess up the puzzle completely.  \n\nWith the possibility for people to create levels and the broad variety of mechanics at their disposal, I could see people making hellish, treacherous designs, and were this a website-based game, I could see the developers releasing player-developed expansion packs, which could extend the game's life.  Since that isn't the case though, having finished the game with all achievements, I don't see myself coming back for more, as with all puzzle games, once you know the solution it loses its luster.  Additionally, the story was quite minimalistic.  Honestly, if it weren't for indicators showing me I had new storyline content to look at, I wouldn't have re-read earlier messages on what the story was even supposed to be and forgotten it completely.  \n\nOverall, the core gameplay and puzzle mechanics are solid, making for an overall fun and enjoyable experience, as well as a challenging one.  Smart decisions regarding game mechanics also keep the game from being overly frustrating (i.e. the rewind button), though the achievement for level 6-3 can bite me.  The story wasn't much, but it gives some motive behind your character's actions, and you feel some sense of progress that way.  For those trying to get all of the memory bars, I would give this bit of advice; remember to explore earlier rooms you've passed already and see if you can pick up blocks you placed earlier using more blocks you picked up from later rooms, as that was necessary to complete quite a few levels.

The aim of the game is that you control a tiny robot who can consume blocks and throw them out to trigger switchesmnake tetris pieces and so on. There are a ton of mechanics in the game and each block has different properties the jelly block sticking to walls,the wood block burning and some blocks also are converted with appropriate inputs like lasers an example being ice block converst to cloud. The puzzles becoming increasingly complicated over the levels and you need to collect golden blocks which are hidden in some hard to reach and interesting puzzles. The main problem with this game is that the screen scrolls over and in some puzzles you need to remember what happened in the previous rooms.This is done for the golden blocks in particular and can become tedious as you need to save up previous blocks and you come to know only after you have reached the spot.There is an infinite undo button which is good as well as demarkers which give you an hint of the puzzles areas and which are also cleverly used. I used the walkthrough for about 8-10 golden blocks due to the stage scrolling mechanic but these levels are far and few between and you need not collect all the golden blocks to proceed but there seem to be a set of stages if you collect all.There are some boss fights in between which are simply forming shapes with the blocks using the various block properties.The biggest gripe I had with this game is that there are just too many mechanics and too many block properties which show up suddenly in some puzzles and unless you have a good memory remebering those things and using them becomes difficult. They should have limited the number of blocks and properties. this is point and click game so no platforming at all. The puzzles also involve a bit of trial and error to understand and recollect the blocks properties and interaction with other blocks. This is a game for the patient gamer, when in full flow you will breeze through the level when not you would be road blocked. I played this game over a week as I got stumped after some time and had to rest before trying again.

It proves that sometimes making things more mobile-friendly and \"casual\" is the right way to go. \n\nThis game is hard, but rewards patience.

Qui siamo Maya, una ragazza impegnata a manovrare un microscopico robot all'interno dei circuiti dei vari Tetrobot resi all'azienda in quanto difettosi o danneggiati, per raccoglierne i blocchi di memoria e ripararli. \n\nAl contrario di BTM, per\u00f2, questo secondo capitolo non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 un.. puzzle-platform, bens\u00ec un punta e clicca. Si deve infatti cliccare per muovere il piccolo robot in un punto, cliccare per fargli prendere i blocchi, cliccare per farglieli sputare. I comandi sono tutti qui.\nOgnuno degli 8 mondi ha un suo tema, con i suoi esclusivi blocchi e le sue regole di relazione tra questi ultimi, che per\u00f2 non vengono spiegate da nessuna parte e bisogna intuire, cosa non sempre facile o ovvia.\nLa variet\u00e0 non manca, ma se tanto BTM mi aveva intrattenuto, tanto questo mi ha in buona parte annoiato.\n\nIl problema maggiore di questo gioco, secondo me, \u00e8 la sua natura fortemente simile ai titoli Two Tribes (penso a Toki Tori, ma anche altri) in cui non c'\u00e8 praticamente spazio per gli errori o la creativit\u00e0, che invece aveva caratterizzato il suo predecessore rendendolo cos\u00ec divertente da giocare.\nQui la soluzione di (quasi) ogni livello \u00e8 una e una sola, e pu\u00f2 essere raggiunta solo agendo in un determinato modo e usando i blocchi con la giusta e rigidissima sequenza, pena il non poter proseguire.\nMa se la fine dei 40+ livelli si raggiungerebbe anche abbastanza agevolmente, non si pu\u00f2 dire lo stesso dei tre blocchi di memoria dorati nascosti in ognuno di essi, fondamentali non solo per sbloccare roba bonus ma anche per avanzare nel gioco. Blocchi disposti in modo diabolico che richiedono sempre di pensare minimo 5 mosse in avanti per cercare di capire qual \u00e8 la soluzione.\nSempre che una soluzione ci sia.\n\nQuesto perch\u00e9, sebbene in caso di errore sia sempre possibile tornare indietro di un numero illimitato di mosse per riprovare in un altro modo, non sempre \u00e8 sufficiente: per risolvere alcuni enigmi apparentemente impossibili si dovr\u00e0 infatti tornare indietro di tot stanze gi\u00e0 belle che risolte (o anche andare avanti, i livelli sono molto ampi), al fine di riarrangiare in qualche modo astruso i blocchi gi\u00e0 utilizzati con quelli in nostro possesso al momento, per magari guadagnarne solamente UNO e poter finalmente risolvere quel dannato enigma, o tramite altre soluzioni altrettanto criptiche e poco intuitive.\nCi\u00f2 porta a un'eccessiva e costante incertezza riguardo il poter o meno completare una data stanza complessa con i blocchi a nostra disposizione, nonch\u00e9 ovviamente un sacco di frustrazione inutile che costringe a guardare una guida pi\u00f9 spesso del necessario, per non restare ore su un singolo enigma che magari si pu\u00f2 risolvere solo in un modo a cui nessuno sano di mente penserebbe. \n\nPi\u00f9 positivo invece lo stile grafico, che rimane in ogni caso molto simpatico, cos\u00ec come le musiche e le scenette/immagini d'intermezzo (soprattutto le pagine Face-blox dei vari blocchi). \nSe vi piacciono i puzzle inflessibili stile Toki Tori (che a me non fanno impazzire, come si sar\u00e0 capito) in cui eseguire 50 mosse nell'esatta sequenza per finire un livello, allora T&Co. con ogni probabilit\u00e0 vi piacer\u00e0. Altrimenti rimane un puzzle comunque carino ma che eccede decisamente troppo nella cripticit\u00e0, risultando spesso pi\u00f9 fastidioso di quanto avrebbe meritato di essere.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1459515373, "timestamp_updated": 1459515373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501235", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22175606": {"recommendationid": "22175606", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968095997", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 1854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459505369}, "language": "english", "review": "Jednoduch\u00e1 logick\u00e1 puzzlovina, na ktorej je jasne c\u00edti\u0165 port z touchsceenov.

Mit Hilfe des Psychobots (einem schwebenden Ball mit einem riesigen Auge) dringen wir in die kaputten Roboter ein und sorgen f\u00fcr Ordnung, indem wir Bl\u00f6cke einsaugen und an der richtigen Stelle wieder ausspucken. Mit Schaltern, Lasern, Strom, Klebstoff, Ventilatoren und zahlreichen anderen Hilfsmitteln, die man im kaputten Roboter vorfindet, kann der Psychobot jedes Problem l\u00f6sen, das sich ihm bietet. \n\n[h1]Umfang[/h1]\nUm ans Ende zu gelangen, m\u00fcssen wir acht Roboter reparieren, die jeweils aus 5+1 Abschnitten bestehen. Zusammen mit den drei Bonus-Level kommt Tetrobot & Co auf 51 Level, die jeweils aus mehreren zusammenh\u00e4ngenden R\u00e4tselr\u00e4umen bestehen. Genug R\u00e4tselstoff, um mehrere Knobelabende am Rechner zu verbringen. Wem das noch nicht reicht, der kann im Workshop weitere (aktuell 200) benutzergenerierte Level finden.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nDas Spielprinzip ist denkbar einfach und gerade deshalb besonders clever. Die franz\u00f6sische Independent-Schmiede \"Swing Swing Submarine\" hat ganze Arbeit geleistet. Tetrobot & Co ist ein wirklich originelles Spiel. \n\nEin Tutorial braucht Tetrobot & Co nicht. Herauszufinden wie sich die Bl\u00f6cke zueinander verhalten und wie sie auf ihre Umwelt reagieren, ist Teil des R\u00e4tsels. Den Schwierigkeitsgrad w\u00fcrde ich auf mittel einstufen.\n\nTetrobot & Co ist sehr benutzerfreundlich, denn man kann jeden Zug mit dem Psychobot wieder r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig machen und auch ein Level muss nicht vollst\u00e4ndig gel\u00f6st sein, damit man ihn beenden kann. Das Spiel ist recht gn\u00e4dig und verhindert so geschickt allzu harten Frust beim R\u00e4tseln. Ich kann euch aber versprechen, dass ihr nicht ruhen werdet, bis ihr jeden Level komplett gel\u00f6st habt, zumindest ging mir das so, obwohl einige dieser Level meinen Kopf ganz sch\u00f6n zum Qualmen gebracht haben. Das Schlimmste ist, dass man genau wei\u00df, dass die L\u00f6sung in der Regel besch\u00e4mend einfach ist.\n\n[h1]Artwork & Musik[/h1]\nDas Design kann sich sehen lassen. Die Level sind mit Liebe zum Detail gestaltet worden und auch die illustrierten Story-Sequenzen sind passabel gezeichnet. Das Spiel sieht nicht unbedingt aus wie ein Indie-Titel. \n\nDie Musik ist von Morusque, einem franz\u00f6sischen K\u00fcnstler, der das Spiel mit vielen verschiedenen elektronischen Klangwelten bereichert hat. Auch hier haben die Entwickler keine halben Sachen gemacht. Das ist vielleicht nicht jedermanns Geschmack, passt aber zum Thema. \n\n[h1]Kritik[/h1]\n- Tetrobot & Co generiert einen Teil seiner Schwierigkeit aus der Tatsache, dass man nicht genau wei\u00df, wie sich die Bl\u00f6cke verhalten. Das k\u00f6nnte man als Kritikpunkt sehen, weil die Schwierigkeit nicht ausschlie\u00dflich im Leveldesign liegt. Man kann es aber auch als kreative Herausforderung verstehen. \n\n- Ein weiterer Bestandteil, der die Schwierigkeit anhebt, ist die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe eines Levels. Je mehr R\u00e4ume in einem Level vorzufinden sind, desto mehr muss man sich merken. Das ist nicht die eleganteste M\u00f6glichkeit die Schwierigkeit anzuheben, aber durchaus ein legitimes Mittel.\n\n- Die Story ist etwas holprig und wirkt in den Zwischensequenzen stellenweise ein bi\u00dfchen aufgesetzt. \n\n- Auch das Extra \"faceblox\" kann mich nicht \u00fcberzeugen. Hier versuchen die Entwickler vergeblich lustig zu sein und ein paar Hinweise auf den Weg zu geben, wenn man auf neue Bl\u00f6cke st\u00f6\u00dft.\n\n- Die Controller-Steuerung ist ein wenig eigent\u00fcmlich. Ich ziehe ganz klar die Maussteuerung vor.\n\n- Man sieht dem Spiel an, dass die Entwickler ein Produkt im Auge hatten, das man problemlos auch auf einem Handy oder einem Tablet spielen kann.\n\n[h1]Specs & Extras[/h1]\nVer\u00f6ffentlichung: Oktober 2013 (PC) / Oktober 2014 (Wii U) / April 2015 (iOS/Android)\nBetriebssysteme: Windows / Mac / Linux / Wii U / iOS / Android\n\n\u25fe Original Soundtrack \n\u25fe Errungenschaften\n\u25fe Sammelkarten\n\u25fe Steam Cloud \n\u25fe Workshop Support\n\u25fe Level Editor\n\u25fe Gamepad tauglich (Xbox 360)\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nBravo! Dieses Spiel ist, wie ich finde, rundum gelungen. Es ist wirklich originell, schaut nett aus und ist solide programmiert. Der Preis stimmt auch, was will man mehr? F\u00fcr Puzzle-Anf\u00e4nger ist Tetrobot & Co stellenweise vielleicht ein bi\u00dfchen anspruchsvoll. Da das Spiel aber schon ein wenig \u00e4lter ist, gibt es mittlerweile viele ausf\u00fchrliche Guides und Walkthroughs. Durchspielen sollte also auch f\u00fcr Puzzle-Anf\u00e4nger kein Problem sein. Jedem eingefleischten Puzzle-Fan kann ich Tetrobot & Co bedenkenlos ans Herz legen.", "timestamp_created": 1453354375, "timestamp_updated": 1459914986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435248", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20398608": {"recommendationid": "20398608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156357076", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450853559}, "language": "english", "review": "Fulfilled that insane desire to unlock everything and solve every puzzle 100%.

The story levels don't have much replayability, beyond completion and achievements, but you can easily spend 10+ hours in this game just completing the main story.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it, especially if it goes on sale.

Where the original had slippery, floaty platform controls, this game has precise click-based grid movements. While many puzzles in the first game depended on you not only solving the problem at hand but also pulling off difficult platforming maneuvers, this game has gone the pure-puzzle route. Heck, even the story (which doesn't matter much in either game) is better in this one, for what it's worth. Basically, every complaint I ever had about the original Blocks that Matter has been fixed in this sequel.\n\nI also have to make special mention of the soundtrack: while I really enjoyed the original game's chippy blippy soundrtrack, this game takes it in a completely different ambient direction, and actually really, really pleasant to listen to. For several days after finishing the game I had the soundtrack on during work.\n\nAs a final note, I played this game on a Surface Pro 2 (aka a touchscreen computer) and it played very well!

Customers send you their broken Tetrobots and you deploy your Psychobot in order to repair the robot from the inside out. You do this by absorbing and spitting out blocks of matter.\nEach Tetrobot has to be repaired in phases (levels). Each level consists of multiple rooms with generally one puzzle. There is a rewind button in case you get stuck. Each level additionally contains three memory blocks. Gathering those unlocks extra levels.\n\n[b]Why I recommend the game[/b]\nTetrobot and Co. is a very difficult puzzle experience. Do not be fooled by the endearing artstyle; this game is hard, especially for the completionists amongst us. One of the things I found very difficult was understanding which blocks to use and which ones to save for another puzzle. However, with difficulty comes satisfaction when you finally are able to solve that one last puzzle that stands between Psychobot and the last Memory block.\n\nFurthermore, the controls are simple. You only need the mouse to play. The soundtrack is nice and there are quite a few songs so I had something to listen to whilst planning my next move. These two elements allow me to focus more on the puzzles themselves as that is what this game is about.\n\nTwo (perceived) flaws I need to mention. First, there were multiple occasions where my blocks flew straight through solid walls, forcing me to restart the level. So there are some bugs.\nSecond, the story falls short of being interesting. You come across pictures and letters sent by the owners of broken Tetrobots - and your replies - but it never kept my interest.\n\nTo summarize: if you like a rather difficult puzzle game with a nice soundtrack and you care less about story to drive the game, Tetrobot and Co. is something you ought to consider.", "timestamp_created": 1442228841, "timestamp_updated": 1442239827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18020670": {"recommendationid": "18020670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009706328", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453564195}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend this for deep thinkers and puzzle aficionados.\n\nTetrobot is an outstanding brain bender.

The design is simple but clever, the different blocks and environments each look distinctive yet work incredibly well within the overall visual theme of the game. The sounds are an absolute joy, I just love the little clinks and chunks the different blocks make when they connect. They are also functional, in that they let let you know what's happening: lasers go [i]vreee[/i], fire goes [i]woosh[/i], and the Bot makes the cutest little chirping noises when you do something wrong.\n\nAll in all this is a must-buy for puzzle fans.\n\nPS: I'd recommend playing the game on a touch device.

The devilry comes in the form of a progression in puzzle complexity that is both smooth, gradual and fierce. A lot of the fierceness lies in wait for the completionists among us - the real tricksy puzzles only rear their gnarly heads when you're trying to collect all 3 of the \"bonus\" items in each level. While these items are used to unlock further sets of levels, you can get by without collecting them all. At least to begin with. \n\nThe puzzles themselves mirror the simple/complex nature of the game design. At first, it feels like the only thing you can do will be the solution, but before long, you're looking at a myriad of possibilities, most of which are wrong, many of which will prevent you from being able to collect all three of the bonus items, and one of which is correct. \n\nGood news though, the game has a neat \"rewind\" feature, allowing you step back move-by-move, which removes any penalty for experimentation. It's a very smart inclusion, as without it, the game would be a frustrating maelstrom of restarts, but with, allows freeform exploration and an infinite amount of spaghetti for you to throw at the wall. \n\nHighly recommended for those that like a game to challenge their brains more than their fingers.", "timestamp_created": 1428710190, "timestamp_updated": 1428710285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502982", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15297043": {"recommendationid": "15297043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054176522", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478721727}, "language": "french", "review": "Un excellent puzzle game !

It's still about manipulating blocks, but that's where the similarities end.\n\nHere, you fly around and stick blocks of the same type together to solve puzzles most of the time, and it's not really possible to get yourself killed. There is a rewind button if you get yourself stuck, which is good because that *will* happen.\nYou'll go through multi-screen levels, making your way to the exit and collecting 3 memory blocks. The memory blocks aren't really optional, you need enough of them to unlock new levels. But you do get to skip a bunch if you don't see the solution to get them immediately.\n\nAt first, each screen will be it's own puzzle, but soon enough you'll be backtracking between screens to solve things.\nAnd at first, things start of simple - 2 types of block (glass and sand), no special interactions or physics extept that they only stick to their own type. This also gets more tricky fast, as you'll learn that fire burns wood and turns sand into glass, metal is can be electrified (to trigger electiricity based switches) and gets pulled in by magnets, slimes can be used to make blocks sticky so they don't fall when they hit a wall etc. \nThere's even a few boss levels, which really aren't too different from regular levels except for the fact that you'll be shooting things into a huge slime in some way.\n\nThe game really shines in it's level layout.  Some really tricky puzzles are included, but mostly the maps are designed in a way to trick you into overthinking. And every new mechanic, instead of having a dedicated tutorial, has a screen or two worked into the level that shows you how it works. Late game example of that is the room where ice and cloud blocks are introduced. A simple switch drops down 2 blocks of ice - one passes a laser and gets turned into a cloud. The cloud blocks the exit, and you can't suck it up. But you can launch the ice cube at it, and that will disperse it. And presto, by finding your way out of the room, you just learned a few important bits.\n\nThe music & art style also work well - music sets a sense of mystery, and the art is nice and cartoony. It combines well to give a clear presentation.\n\nOnly downside is that sometimes the engine glitches, especially when rewinding - so that blocks don't end up where they should. Rewinding further usually helps in that case though.\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of quirky puzzle games, this certainly deserves a look.\n", "timestamp_created": 1427060825, "timestamp_updated": 1427060825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15012141": {"recommendationid": "15012141", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971383754", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433002422}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr nice um Die grauen zellen mal wieder zu aktiviren", "timestamp_created": 1427060058, "timestamp_updated": 1427060058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15000119": {"recommendationid": "15000119", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999006735", "num_games_owned": 1028, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427003760}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Nothing special but gets the time going [/h1]\n\nFor a casual puzzle game this servers it purpose well.\n\nGood:\n[list]\n    [*]Interesting Puzzles\n    [*]Can Get challenging\n    [*]Easy to play\n    [*]Really nice visuals\n[/list]\n\nBad:\n[list]\n    [*]Feels like a touchscreen cellphone game\n    [*]Repeative\n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1427004018, "timestamp_updated": 1427004018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14975284": {"recommendationid": "14975284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052249141", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426913351}, "language": "english", "review": "hard game.", "timestamp_created": 1426873786, "timestamp_updated": 1426873786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461538", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14975101": {"recommendationid": "14975101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003702727", "num_games_owned": 1127, "num_reviews": 239, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488513498}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego de tipo puzzle con una interfaz muy sencilla.

For those whom played blocks that matter and didn't like the platforming aspect, don't worry, this doesn't have any platforming to speak of. The only related things in the game are the characters and the use of blocks.\n\nThe game actually controls through point and click mechanics, moving your character from place to place through just clicking there. The games main focus is using a combination of different blocks which interact with eachother in different ways, in orde to solve a puzzle. Placing blocks involves you shooting them out instead of using the tetronimo mechanic from the last one. Each block has specific functions hinted to ingame once you find them. The game constantly throws new block types at you, as well as special new funtions, mixing things up. They continued to throw new mechanics all the way to the end of the game, and all of them felt well implemented. \n\n You're main objectives in a level consist of two things; getting to the end, and collecting the memory blocks. You can beat a level without getting all chips, but in order to progress to certain stages, you'll need to obtain the memory blocks. You'll also need to 100% a section to unlock the bonus stage for keys to the small boss puzzle stages (using the term \"boss\" lightly, as it is really a series of puzzles).\n\nThe game features no way to die, and if you do mess up a puzzle, there is always an undo button to push things back to where you need them in an instant. The game never felt tedious or boring; always throwing new ideas and puzzles types your way. The puzzles, while challenging, never felt too easy, or too hard. The game also never feels the need to hold your hand at any given point.\n\nThe only flaw that I can think of is that there is a bonus challenge later in the game which requires knowledge of the konami code, but it's not required, and is overall a terribly minor flaw on an otherwise great puzzle game.\n\nTo me it was worth every single cent.

The timing detracts from the game in my opinion, up until then if you understood how to solve something you could solve it in one or two tries.  Once the timing got involved however the 'undo' button was used a lot.  It's very frustrating understanding how to solve a puzzle and having trouble executing that solution.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind which may have an effect of your enjoyment of this game is that if you intend on getting all of the brick pieces (which are the bonus objectives) you may end up undoing a lot of your work in any given level.  The reason behind why you would undo your previous solution is that it may not have been ideal, meaning that you could have saved a block or two which would allow you to get a brick piece.  I'm not sure how I personally feel about it since this is something that has provided me with enjoyment and frustration at different times.  One of my level designer friends really liked this aspect of the game though.\n\nThat being said, I think that the basic mechanics of how the blocks work in relation to each other is very intriguing and leads to a lot of interesting puzzles.  The art is sleek, the music is charming; it feels cohesive.  [b][u] I recommend [i]Tetrobot and Co.[/i] to anyone who loves puzzle games [/u][/b].

Celui ci \u00e9tait un jeu de plate-forme r\u00e9flexion d'une tr\u00e8s bonne qualit\u00e9e. Ainsi Tetrobot & Co continue dans cette lanc\u00e9e en sacrifiant le c\u00f4t\u00e9 plate-forme pour tout miser sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 r\u00e9flexion, un pari r\u00e9ussi.\n\nTetrobot & Co c'est 8 mondes de 6 niveaux, ainsi que quelques niveaux bonus, \u00e7a peut parra\u00eetre un peu court mais on peut rester longtemps sur certains puzzle, la dur\u00e9e de vie approche ainsi facilement 10 heures pour terminer le jeu, et plus pour le 100% (c'est le temps que j'ai mis, bien s\u00fbr comme c'est un jeu de r\u00e9flexion il est fort possible que vous prenniez moins de temps que moi pour terminer le jeu, la dur\u00e9e de vie du jeu d\u00e9pend de votre facilit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre les puzzle), compte tenu du petit prix (10\u20ac, moins en promo) c'est tout \u00e0 fait honorable.\n\nTetrobot & Co se veut original dans chaque monde, en effet le gameplay se renouvelle tout au long du jeu sans que l'on perde ses r\u00e9p\u00e8res et reste excellent de bout en bout avec une tonne de bonnes id\u00e9es ! De plus les musiques correspondent bien aux mondes auxquelles elles sont associ\u00e9s et sont tr\u00e8s relaxantes, ce qui aide pour un puzzle-game.\n\nTetrobot est tr\u00e8s joli, il est tr\u00e8s similaire \u00e0 ce que l'on a pu voir sur Block That Matter, ainsi si vous avez aim\u00e9 les graphismes de Block That Matter vous aimerez ceux de Tetrobot et vis versa. Bien s\u00fbr d'une beaut\u00e9 technique Tetrobot ne brille pas, mais on s'en fiche puisque ce n'est pas ce que l'on recherche en jouant \u00e0 un jeu de ce type. De plus par sa faiblesse technique Tetrobot tourne sur n'imorte quelle b\u00e9cane, donc aucune excuse si vous voulez vous le procurer ! (c'est ce qui m'a permis d'y jouer par ailleurs).\n\nLe gameplay est tr\u00e8s simple, le curseur de la souris et les deux touches de ladite souris... et c'est tout ! Et pourtant cela suffit pour faire un gameplay tr\u00e8s efficace comme nous le prouve ce jeu !

However, Swing Swing Submarine made two design choices that I feel makes this game inferior to its predecessor.\n\nThe first is that while [i]BTM[/i] is a puzzle-platformer, Psychobot (the protagonist of this title) flies, removing the platforming element entirely. While this makes sense from a business standpoint (I imagine they have tablet devices in mind for this game eventually, if it doesn't already exist), it does remove a significant layer of gameplay that made the first game so enjoyable.\n\nSecondly, each stage is broken into Zelda-style rooms, with pipes that connect rooms together. While it certainly makes the content look cleaner, there are several instances of puzzles being broken up between rooms in such a way as to render the gameplay unintuitive (as an example, in the early water stages, there are several puzzles that require you to know the spacial locations of other objects in adjacent rooms prior to firing yourself from a cannon). Given how these puzzles tend to interact, either larger rooms when appropriate--or at least the ability to view other rooms from a mini-map or the like--would have been welcome, and made these puzzles more intuitive.\n\nUltimately, while I do feel this is a solid game at a fair price point, the fact that this game is simply more shallow and less skill-based than [i]Blocks That Matter[/i] is rather disappointing.

A lot to be more specific.\n\nSo far I really like the puzzles, the style and the fact that you just want to get EVERY single golden block (pieces of some sort of a memory bar) keeps you entertained for quite some time.\n\nThe artstyle is pretty neat/cute but once again, don't let it fool you, it can be rock hard ;) Also there seems to be somewhat of a story but quite frankly I didn't/couldn't care about it (yet). \n\nI am only in world 3 now but there also seems to be enough content as well as some new gameplay mechanics now and then.\n\nTo keep a long story short, if you like puzzlegames you'll sure like this one too, if you hate pure puzzlegames, this game probly will not change your mind. o/", "timestamp_created": 1396707351, "timestamp_updated": 1396707351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9706487": {"recommendationid": "9706487", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997756161", "num_games_owned": 604, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508427910}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best puzzle games on the market.

It's a puzzle game and has very simple controls (just click the left mouse button) but some of the levels really make you think. You control a little robot, you move by left clicking on a square. Using this robot you travel through various rooms in a given level searching for the end portal. As you explore the level you may find different blocks (wood, sand, stone, sticky jelly) which each have different properties and can react differently in various situations. For example, if you let a laser or fire get near a wood block it will burn and be destroyed, but a sand block turns to glass. In most levels you need to try and conserve as many blocks as you can.\n\nOf course getting to the end portal on each level usually isn't very difficult. However there are three gold coloured blocks on each level, and obtaining all three of those and then getting to the end portal can lead you into some fiendishly brain-teasing logistical puzzles to think your way through. If you sit and think long and hard enough, nothing is beyond your grasp to figure out. If you get frustrated enough (or completely stuck) there is a brilliant guide with a video for how to complete every level, but it's very satisfying to solve everything for yourself (and if you look at a video you'll feel like hitting your head against the wall thinking \"it was so obvious, why didn't I see that\").\n\nGive your brain some gentle exercise with this charming, fun, and non-violent game.", "timestamp_created": 1393971400, "timestamp_updated": 1393971400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9330415": {"recommendationid": "9330415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082337182", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411076469}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game", "timestamp_created": 1393855996, "timestamp_updated": 1393855996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9309625": {"recommendationid": "9309625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003118652", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1394083081}, "language": "english", "review": "A great puzzle game!

While at this point the Tetrobot is the most popular and best robot around, it is not immune to problems. The Psychobot\u2019s job is to go into Tetrobot and fix whatever problems my lay inside.\n\nSo what exactly do you do in this game? Well, you move blocks. Blocks that matter, to be specific. The game follows an extremely similar style of logic and mechanics that Blocks that Matter does, since they both play out in the same universe. The goal is to maneuver throughout the Tetrobot, finding as many pieces of memory that you can along with getting to the end. Unlike the puzzle platformer style of game play the previous game had, this plays more like it is on a  grid. The Psychobot flies through Tetrobots to wherever it needs to be.\n\nFixing a Tetrobot isn\u2019t easy, though. It is actually quite the puzzle, as they get a lot of blocks clogged up into their system. You have to manipulate these blocks so that you can continue on through certain passage ways and areas. Blocks connect to blocks of the same matter. So stone will connect to stone, wood will connect to wood, and so on.  Knowing how to correctly stack blocks will be very helpful for maneuvering through these levels.\n\nIt is never hard to relax and play this game. Everything about the game is very soothing. If you would like you can slowly make your way through each puzzle, taking your time and taking in everything the game has to offer. Just as Blocks that Matter was, this game is very charming. I always manage to have a smile on my face when playing through it, either it be the satisfaction of solving the puzzles or even just picking up on some of the funny references they have to different games, books, movies, and music!\n\nThe pacing in the game is pretty nice as well. In total there are 8 sections in the game, each containing 5 normal levels and one key level. Each section slowly adds new mechanics, making game play more complicated yet all the more fun. You never feel overloaded on all of the things you have to learn or solve, but it never drags on either. The Tetrobots act as the sections, each having their own issues. Either they be flooded with water or even frozen! Each Tetrobot\u2019s problem will advance and change the game play, which makes for an excellent thrill when going into a new section.\n\nBesides the overall satisfaction of being able to solve some of these complicated puzzles, the game really helps you feel rewarded for your efforts to progress through the game. There are a lot of cool and interesting unlockables from not only completing the puzzles but collecting the 3 memory blocks there are in each level. Either it is more pieces to the story, a few extra levels, or a collection of all of the soothing songs available. You really have this drive to continue playing through the game.\n\nTetrobot & Co. was a unique game to play through. Its charming style kept me relaxed as I challenged my mind with each level. Swing Swing Submarine really has a way with puzzle games. If you really enjoy puzzle games then I highly suggest you give this one a try.\n\nIf you want some video footage going a tad more in depth on how it plays, then make sure you check out my video on it!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzGwF68Jbk8&feature=youtu.be\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1385418078, "timestamp_updated": 1385418078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741581", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7632344": {"recommendationid": "7632344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011946728", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1384048276}, "language": "french", "review": "Excellent puzzle-game.\nDifficult\u00e9 au rendez-vous sans jamais \u00eatre injuste.\nTr\u00e8s bonne surprise.", "timestamp_created": 1384190916, "timestamp_updated": 1384190916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7452440": {"recommendationid": "7452440", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966527290", "num_games_owned": 2689, "num_reviews": 386, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427148775}, "language": "french", "review": "Difficile mais tellement plaisant visuellement et musicalement qu'on en redemande.

It has a simple concept and uses it in a variety of ways to create some challenging puzzles. One of the big let-downs of the game is probably the amount of bugs that are still present in the game though. Only three of them were heavily annoying though. Here are the bugs I can remember if it helps the developers. If they want videos or photos of any of the bugs then just let me know.\n\nReproducable Bugs:\nYou can pick up a block behind a block you've just thrown, and the thrown block will stop when you hits the block you just picked up. (Extremely exploitable!)\n\nIf you throw a block, move Psychobot a block, and then undo, the block will stop on a block a little bit before you pressed undo, as though it had hit something. (Also exploitable!)\n\nIf quick enough, you can throw a block against a wall and then quickly duck under it. Needs to be near frame-perfect though. (Exploitable.)\n\nClouds moving from fans will sometimes split from other connected clouds once you use undo. This can also cause the clouds to merge into one block if they're stacked in one direction.\n\nThrowing a block while Psychobot is holding a pipe from a magnet will cause the pipe to phase though Psychobot. I think this only happens in one level, but is still worthwhile to note.\n\nLevers don't go back to the middle state after a undo, allowing you to pass through any lever without triggering it.\n\nIf you undo while blocks are getting deleted from your inventory then the blocks will not come back from that undo. If you undo again then they'll come back.\n\nUnreproducable Bugs:\nWhen pressing Undo it undid a whole bunch of my progress in a level, not just one step. This happened four times. On the first boss stage it undid an entire puzzle. On one normal level it undid the solution for an annoying memory block. The third time was another normal level, and it undid the solutions of 2 memory blocks I had gotten when I was about the get the third. The fourth time it undid all my progress on the last level of Spacebot right at the end. In all cases I just had to quit the game and come back the next day... If it helps any, I had spent a lot of time in those levels before this bug popped up, and it might have been caused by changing rooms a lot. An additional side-effect is that electricity animations freeze where they were before the undo, until another object get electrified.\n\nPsychobot has gotten stuck in blocks before. \n\nDestroying a cloud that a slime was standing on caused the slime to float without moving.\n\nSometimes when I've Alt+Tabbed out then the game won't Alt+Tab back in correctly. I can still hear and control the game with the mouse but I can't see the game at all, just the windows behind it. A little bit of window bar can be seen at the top of the screen though, to see the name of the game. Swapping the game between desktops in the Task View didn't fix anything, so I had to shut the game down and repeat the level.\n\nSometimes fans and magnets can spawn without collisions. Means that some puzzles can be impossible unless you restart the level.\n\nIf I remember or encounter anything more then I'll update this post.", "timestamp_created": 1515213276, "timestamp_updated": 1515240912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38991174": {"recommendationid": "38991174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012135881", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "last_played": 1515861537}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved blocks that matter and i gotta say this little game is adorable", "timestamp_created": 1514933240, "timestamp_updated": 1514933240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

Dialogue and story are great, exploration is fun.  The Real Time with Slow Time combat is well done and enjoyable, I like it more than Real Time with Pause.  I'm playing on Normal and I've had to replay several battles, but only once, to win.  So, some challenge is there, it's just about right for me.  The graphics are nicely done and I enjoy the art style.  I had one crash, since addressed by the devs, but, other than that the game runs smoothly and is very responsive to input.  Each party member has it's own personality, reflected in dialogue, which adds to the atmosphere.  The leveling system doesn't depend on XP to advance your characters, so there's no farming to gain XP.  Rather, you have to explore and find gold and blueprints to level, a nice change IMO. In short, there's alot going on under the hood that seperates this from your usual dungeon crawler.

Story is intriguing, but other parts of the game need work or even some alteration.  First each battle plays out almost the same and becomes boring fairly quickly.  This is the same for the loot for the most part.  Although, the character skills are interesting enough and do add some flavor to the battles\n\nI think the game needs more tactics to up the challenge level.  Instead, of having the enemies always come out of little portals where the archer and the mage can pick them off quickly, maybe have them closer to switch the batlle up a little bit, or give some enemies the ability to dodge attacks or even reflect them.  Have some enemies teleport in and out of attack range.  The battles just need to be made not so damn predictable.  I think the best way to make loot better is to make it more randomized and more unique  so it changes the way battles play out\n\nI am giving the developer a positive review because this game is so promising and I think the dev needs some positive reinforcement to make it better.  I deleted it from my hard drive but may re-install if I later see an update that makes the battles more interesting.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1506285705, "timestamp_updated": 1506285705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35044652": {"recommendationid": "35044652", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983083878", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505738499}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall this is a pretty decent game. The story is massive (the dev clearly cares about this), and there is great attention to the details of the backstory, dialogue between characters, and lore that can be found around the game. \n\n\u2028\u2028For me the battling is the best part. While it is not without its problems (sometimes tricky to pick the correct enemy - units pass through each other), in EA status it is clearly already in good form. It is tense and have genuinely felt my heart race to survive the onslaught.  Took me a few battles to get used to the mechanics\u2026you really do have to make use of slow time, and be tactical, which is satisfying. I understand there are more battle modes to come, so looking forward to that.\n\nGraphics look great, particularly when you have loads of enemies in battle, and I only ran into a frame drop once while running through the first proper level of the tower. (I am running it on Ultra settings though at 3440x1440 on a fairly decent card so not a surprise). I love the use of light and shadows in exploring, and understand this is to improve further. Use of particles is great. Visually it pops very well. \n\nAudio is decent. Sound design is clear enough and helpful in battle, though some things are missing (here\u2019s a noisy waterfall, there\u2019s a silent one) - and I turned all the levels up in the settings. Music is good  to keep you playing, though I wish there was more orchestra, and sometimes it needs to have more punch. Particularly going in or out of battles, so you actually feel impending danger or success! \n\nI think there is a lot of detail to the leveling up of heroes, inventory, skills etc which I was left to discover for myself. The city \u2018menu\u2019 idea is good and clearly shows the dev cares about connecting it all together with the backstory - will be interesting to see where the story goes. It\u2019s promising a lot.\n\nFrom what I understand from the dev, this is going to be a huge game in terms of content, and it is already well on its way.  In over 4 hours playing I only got to end of the tower\u2019s first floor, so still got 3 more to go just in this current EA build! The dev is clearly committed to the game based on the responses here, so looking forward to seeing how much more it grows.", "timestamp_created": 1505739102, "timestamp_updated": 1505739102,

It looks like devs are really trying hard to fix everything what players report and also theirs response time to bug reports or questions is pretty fast. So if every early access game would be like that, the world would be much more nicer place. :-)\n\nWhat I really like:\n- graphics, videos, etc. looks really awesome\n- time slowing in the battles (to me it feels more engaging than classic pause system)\n\nNeutral feelings:\n- At the beginning I was really excited how the battles looks like (you have battleground and you have to killing enemies whose are comming from multiple doors and wanna kill you), however after some time (I'm in half of second level) I feel like it's so repetitive and I would really like to see more battle modes as well (I know there are boss fights, but I mean something really different)\n- I would prefer wider choice of skills (every level a new skill is opened and then you can choice one from two specializations for that skill).. so at least two skills per level would be nice, to let player select in which way should character goes\n- Difficulity definitely needs little more balancing ..

I'm really enjoying it, certainly more than Torment 2, even more than  Pillars of Eternity actually.  Come to think of it, I don't believe I have had this much fun playing an isometric RPG since the original Neverwinter Nights and that is high praise coming from me.\n\nThe combat system is fun, similar to RTwP you see in Pillars of Eternity, but instead of pausing the action completely, it slows down to a crawl when you activate the tactics mode.  I'd say the combat requires good tactics and reactions even on normal difficulty.  I've wiped a couple times on bosses, but  overall I'd say Normal is challenging, but not too difficult. There is a good variety of enemy types with varied abilities and your party members each have multiple skills that they can modify with different properties.   So far (about 1/2 through the first act) I found the story engaging and interesting, and I'm enjoying it more than PoE.  The story is mainly told through conversations between your party members and various books and notes scatered around the levels, but there are occasional cut-scenes during important moments.  As for the visuals, the level design is really great for an Infinity engine game IMO, vibrants colors, water effects, lighting effects and overall good variety in tilesets.  The characters models leave a bit to be desired though, they are somewhat blocky and have no visual customization besides weapons (update: while individual pieces of armor do not show, there will be 5 skins per character based on the quality/tier of armor they are wearing).  \n\nI would highly recommend this game if you are into old-school RPGs like Baldur's Gate, IWD, Arcanum and Neverwinter Nights.  I am certainly enjoying it far more than other recent efforts to bring this genre back such as PoE, Torment 2, and Divinity:OS.

So I thought perhaps there should be a negative review that almost sounds like a positive review. \n\nI see a lot of promise in this game.  And after my first negative review I spoke directly with the developer so they could further understand my issues.  The one huge problem I have with it so far is that your people do not take up physical space on the battle field, allowing enemies to run right through your people.  They give you interesting battle fields to fight on but then when you close in on a choke point the baddies just waltz through to your people in the back.  Taunt lets you grab their aggro for a minute but what\u2019s the point of maps \"tactical\" positioning possible if you\u2019re just going to have to use an ability to do the same thing anyway.  This is something I've been told they want to change but there are currently technical hurdles.  I understand this and hope they are able to overcome them but the not taking up space on the battlefield might be a deal breaker for me if it never makes it in.  \n\nSome of the 2d art is really great, but some of them are not to the same standard it seems. so I give that a mix bag. The 3d art is not going to win an award but it is 100% good enough to portray and interesting and nice looking world. \n\nThe story is interesting but pretty linear early on, and overall there are not going to be many options but what few choices you do have with the story is aimed at having larger more meaningful choices which I think is a good thing so I hope to see the story develop too. \n\nWith what problems there are here, and the price tag it's hard not to recommend this game but at it's current build I'd say wait.  However all that being said, I'm not going to return it even though it's elibible because I wanna see if it will get better, and if you're the kind of person that is interested in the development process of a game and supporting the game makers then this really might be the gem for you.", "timestamp_created": 1504333584, "timestamp_updated": 1511023898, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633618", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34618161": {"recommendationid": "34618161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078211419", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504697823}, "language": "english", "review": "Just putting in a review of my experience so far.

I find in most RPGs you can spend a lot of time and energy looting hundreds of pieces of gear and you'll still end up about being at the average of where the game wants you to be, so why waste the time?  Why not just give the player 1 outfit and quit the pretense of loot?

I'm not involved in the secret war going on since the dawn of time between turn-based/rt with pause, a combat system should be what fits the game.  I find that the higher difficulties have been difficult (because I don't care to deal with the stats of armor-choosing often) and the easy settings seem a bit bland.  I haven't found the strategy beyond managing the basics of mana and cooldowns and moving units around to spread the damage out.  Perhaps it takes longer to find the strategy.  I would say thus far it's not that exciting as a Starcraft or not as fun or tactical as Grandia II, but there seems to be potential here.\n\nThe environment is nice.

Descubran a la joya oculta del 2017 mientras todav\u00eda est\u00e1 en early access.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITqNMtJBD1g\nAn\u00e1lisis completo publicado [url=https://www.simpatiaporlacritica.com/single-post/2017/08/11/Tower-of-Time]aqu\u00ed[/url]\n\nHay una serie de juegos que r\u00e1pidamente se nos viene a la cabeza cuando hablamos de RPG. Por supuesto que tenemos a los de acci\u00f3n (ARPG) cuyas mec\u00e1nicas responden a un combate inmediato, intuitivo, que lo emparentan brevemente con otros g\u00e9neros como el arcade y el hack & slash. Y la otra gran familia de RPG es la cl\u00e1sica, con combates en grupo por turnos. Hay un universo entero de puntos en com\u00fan entre todos los juegos que se consideran de rol, aunque hasta ahora nadie hab\u00eda intentado modificar el sistema de combate.\n \nTower of Time m\u00e1s que una torre es un puente que viene a unir los dos mundos. Con la arrogancia del indie no s\u00f3lo plantea un sistema de combate absolutamente novedoso, sino que reescribe muchas reglas de oro que hasta hoy se consideraban sagradas dentro del RPG. Empecemos por lo que ya ven\u00edamos hablando: combates. En ToT controlamos un grupo de 3 h\u00e9roes a elegir entre 7 (siete!) clases distintas con \u00e1rboles de habilidades \u00fanicos. Si bien la presentaci\u00f3n de las peleas son las cl\u00e1sicas de los RPG por turnos, una vez que comienza el combate todo cambia. Podemos controlar a cada uno de nuestros h\u00e9roes tanto es sus movimientos como en sus ataques, adem\u00e1s de elegir qu\u00e9 skills usar y en qu\u00e9 momento. Aqu\u00ed es donde m\u00e1s se acerca al ARPG, aunque mantiene una idea mucho m\u00e1s t\u00e1ctica, ya que hay que diagramar los movimientos de tres personajes a la vez. Para resumirlo, es una mec\u00e1nica RTS dentro de un juego de rol.\n\nEl sistema de leveleo tambi\u00e9n es ins\u00f3lito, y no sigue el mandato divino del rol, es decir, aumentar de nivel eliminando enemigos y ganando experiencia. Una vez que nuestros h\u00e9roes avancen de nivel por primera vez (esto s\u00ed es a la vieja usanza) tendremos que conseguir planos para mejorar un edificio de entrenamiento, donde los personajes entrenar\u00e1n para subir de nivel. Dichos planos son \u00fanicos por clase, as\u00ed que adivinaron: los level-up ser\u00edan como el resto de los \u00edtems, sujetos a un sistema de loot cl\u00e1sico. Para compensar esta dificultad, de cierta forma, el sistema de crafteo con cristales es muy sencillo y poderoso, permiti\u00e9ndonos forjar items legendarios muy r\u00e1pidamente en el juego. Hay que decir tambi\u00e9n que en las primeras dos horas de gameplay no fue tan necesario subir de nivel.\n \nEl nivel de inmersi\u00f3n de la historia y los personajes es s\u00f3lo comparable al universo Witcher. Hay una complejidad narrativa que es la delicia de los m\u00e1s fan\u00e1ticos de este tipo de tramas, y les proporcionar\u00e1 unas cuantas horas de diversi\u00f3n. De hecho, hablando de tiempo, actualmente la campa\u00f1a dura m\u00e1s de 40 horas, a\u00fan en early access.\nLa dificultad del juego es adaptable a las habilidades del jugador y se agradece, ya que de otra forma ser\u00eda un monstruo incontrolable. La versi\u00f3n f\u00e1cil es realmente f\u00e1cil. Ideal para los que no tienen mucha experiencia y quieren disfrutar de la historia. La dificultad normal es desafiante. Esto quiere decir que habr\u00e1 peleas ganadas y perdidas, pero con varias alternativas para superarlas. Ya en este nivel de dificultad los novatos se sentir\u00e1n ahogados. Finalmente, para superar el modo dif\u00edcil, en palabras de los desarrolladores, para ganar ciertas batallas la \u00fanica forma es tener un set-up espec\u00edfico de items y skills en los personajes elegidos. No hay mucho para agregar.\n \nEl costado art\u00edstico del juego est\u00e1 a la altura de todo lo dem\u00e1s, y tanto el motor gr\u00e1fico como la banda sonora original son placeres divinos. Faltar\u00eda quiz\u00e1s algunas animaciones del entorno (cofres, piedras de loot, etc) pero confiamos que estas caracter\u00edsticas se ir\u00e1n sumando al juego. De hecho, los \u00fanicos parches que se implementaron hasta ahora son mayoritariamente en el sistema de combate. \n \nNo hay punto flojos en Tower of Time, salvo quiz\u00e1s ser un juego orientado a jugadores hardcore, lo cual no es algo necesariamente malo. El g\u00e9nero de RPG suele tener muchos t\u00edtulos pero pocos que realmente dejen una marca en sus jugadores. ToT llega para patear el tablero y consagrarse como uno de los mejores.

I highly recommend this game.\n\nThe most compelling aspect of the game for me is the cutscene artwork.  The still images are breathtaking.  They somehow manage to simultaneously show you how beautiful and developed Altara once was and the dire situation of the world today. The images manage to evoke strong emotions \u2013 a feat that few games have accomplished.\n\nEach level is beautifully designed.  Heavy particle areas, such as waterfalls or long-distance renders, will tax your GPU.  It is easy to be immersed in each level and forget that everything you see is within a magic tower.\n\nThe story line is top notch and genuinely creative.  You, of course, are the main character, however, as the main character, you sit on your throne and do nothing.  Everything is accomplished by your heroes.  I won\u2019t spoil the novelty of how this is done (from the context of the story).  The story quickly brings together the five races (humans, dwarves, elves, ice giants, and shadows) to give you plenty of options for creating your ideal party.\n\nEach hero has a unique set of skills to give you an edge in combat.  You can easily customize the skills before each battle for a nominal fee.\n\nThe approach to combat is certainly unique.  The \"slow time\" gives you minute control over every detail.  In the early stages, I found this wasn't needed.  As the enemies became stronger with more abilities and combat lasted longer, events happen so quickly that my heroes would die before I realized what was happening.  Trying to micro-manage each hero without the slow-time would be near impossible due to the fast-paced nature of combat.\n\nI would argue that gold is the most precious resource as it is the only resource that cannot be farmed.  You have the option of working through the main story or completing challenges.  Each challenge can be repeated, but you only get the gold and crystal reward once.  The item, however, can be farmed and deconstructed for crystals.  Need to make some new rare armor, but short on crystals?  No problem.  Do a couple challenges and you\u2019re set.  The economy in general will need improvement.\n\nBeing an early access game, it has its own set of growing pains.  Improvements that are surely on the developer\u2019s to-do list: no mini-map, can\u2019t remap key assignments, moving around the city can be a little awkward, can\u2019t make notes on the main map (can\u2019t make notes of any kind, for that matter\u2026not that the game is complex enough to require notes, but would be nice to know where certain things are that you think might be important), and can\u2019t adjust the camera \u2013 to name a few.\n\nEven with the growing pains, I\u2019m truly excited for the release of the full game and see the storyline thru to its end.  If you are looking for a story to lose yourself in, this is a game you don\u2019t want to miss!\n", "timestamp_created": 1502332470, "timestamp_updated": 1502332470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687062", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34106163": {"recommendationid": "34106163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069771409", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511271144}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't like turn based RPGs anymore.

Je trouve n\u00e9anmoins le jeu prometteur (assez pour \u00e9crire une critique). \n\nIl a le bon feeling des RPGs \u00e0 l'ancienne, et un syst\u00e8me de combat original dans le style: on affronte des vagues d'ennemis, un peu comme dans un tower defense. Les personnages  sont bien diff\u00e9rents les uns des autres et ont des r\u00f4les tactiques pr\u00e9cis. Je trouve les combats un peu faciles pour l'instant mais je n'en suis qu'au d\u00e9but du jeu.\n\nQuestion immersion, le jeu a su trouver le bon compromis: initialement fan de jdr tels que Baldur's Gate ou Planescape Torment, je n'ai maintenant plus la patience de lire de gros pav\u00e9s de textes pour rentrer dans un univers. Ici pas de gros pav\u00e9s \u00e0 lire mais des interventions r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et courtes des membres de notre \u00e9quipe qui commentent les d\u00e9couvertes de l'univers, ou des descriptions courtes associ\u00e9es \u00e0 certains objets du d\u00e9cor. C'est assez sympa.\n\nJ'\u00e9sp\u00e8re que le jeu saura \u00eatre aussi int\u00e9ressant sur la dur\u00e9e et qu'il saura \u00e9voluer au cours de l'early access.", "timestamp_created": 1501185434, "timestamp_updated": 1501185434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33810012": {"recommendationid": "33810012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203108243", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509557701}, "language": "polish", "review": "Wci\u0105gaj\u0105ca fabu\u0142a, ciekawy pomys\u0142 na walk\u0119, czas potrzebny na przej\u015bcie gry nie jest przesadzony, wi\u0119c\ngracze z mniejsz\u0105 ilo\u015bci\u0105 czasu na zabawe b\u0119d\u0105 z pewno\u015bci\u0105 zadowoleni.

Amazing graphics, cool story, a very atmospheric soundtrack. AND underneath all this eye candy is a very cool and unique battle system. This has all the polish of a AAA game and is something you need to keep an eye on! My one and only gripe is the loading screen. I hope the developers can reduce the loading times between scenes and battles.\n\nGame Details:\nTower of Time is new take on classic RPG - trying to bring something fresh to this genre. It has a rich story and a novel real-time combat - a blend of RPG and RTS - on higher difficulties meant to be challenging. Maintain a complete control over the battlefield or be crushed.

Many of the puzzles in the game involved noticing tiny details and clicking on them. For example there is a statue hidden in vines that I did not see even when I walk past that location 5 or 6 times. There are also hidden rooms that are behind thick vegetations and journal updates that are hidden in libraries.  The landscapes are also very beautiful, including ice-covered caves, mechanical gadgets and a mix of technology and magic. \n\nThe game mechanics might be a bit difficult for those people that are used to turn-based RPG games. In fact, the games happen in real time, but you are given the opportunity to slow down time. However, even so, the fighting will keep you busy and you need to micro-manage them if you are playing on hard or epic levels. There is also the option of playing the game in easy or \"story\" levels as well. The player is given the choice of playing the game at any levels that he is most comfortable with.\n\nThe game world is extremely huge and consists of dungeons of many levels. Each level is made up of multiple sectors and the map is interspersed with teleportals to enable easy travel. Currently the game is in Early Access and more than half the contents are still under development. However, the contents that are currently release has given me many days of pleasure and enjoyment.\n\nThis game is like an exquisite gem and I would highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1500850390, "timestamp_updated": 1500850390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681179", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33742759": {"recommendationid": "33742759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017883718", "num_games_owned": 1584, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502026126}, "language": "polish", "review": "Ta gra niszczy mi system.

It really feels like your decisions matters at every moment.\nWhat's more music is just great, super climatic, even gave me goosebumps couple of times.\nOn the other hand graphics are a little poor in here and there, but cmone, it's early access.\nLongs story short I higly recommend Tower of Time for every RPG fan out there.

Even though it's early access, there's still plenty to do and there will be more story added. The combat was a little difficult at first, but after a while I needed to raise the difficulty. Combat is a separate entity to exploration, you know when you're getting into a battle The skill system has a Dragon Age style of levelling up, an ability then a choice of A or B to add to that ability. The devs also answer questions on the forum section of Steam, which is nice to see. I even saw them offering to edit someone's save if they encountered an unsurpassable bug.\n\nPros:\n\n-Loot based system has that familiar rpg feel to it.\n-Teleporting is instant.\n-Enemy analysis before battle, shows resistances/weaknesses.\n-Beastiary shows every enemy you've faced, so you can learn how to take them down for next time.\n-If you fail a battle, you can retry or load last save.\n-Crafting system is simple and effortless.\n-Soundtrack is enjoyable.\n\nCons:\n\n-No controls option. Although they are simple, but it would be nice to have an option to check them.\n-Low amount of save slots - 5 and an autosave (I prefer to have as many as I require but not a dealbreaker).\n-Sometimes you may need to click more than once for an ability to activate, minor bug but it will be fixed.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

Each floor of the tower has a theme to it, and that, mixed with the music makes the game feel very atmospheric. The story is one of the strongest aspects of this game and you will get most of it through the main play but will find little extra tidbits of story hidden throughout each floor of the tower. There are more than just story hidden around the tower though, there are also hidden treasure stashes and some secrets to uncover. \n\nCombat in this game is much more than just using the best spells and blowing your oppenents away. There are tactics that should be considered on each group of enemies and different enemies have different weaknesses. It will take more than just the best gear to overcome each encounter. You have to plan out how to get the most out of each spell/skill you have at your disposal. I feel this kind of combat is rare in most RPGs and I like how challenging some of the fights can be. But even if you fail the game lets you restart that fight again without having to go back to the last time you saved. \n\nThere is also a crafting system in the game that is simple but effective for gearing out your champions. You will get gear drops from treasure chests and encounters. You will also get crafting crystals which can be used to craft more gear. Old gear you no longer want can be disassebled to gain more crafting crystals to make more gear. \n\nOverall this game is really good and I am looking forward to seeing it through to completion.\n\nIf you would like to see gameplay of this game I have a full playthrough playlist on YouTube that you can check out here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEBxDBAj5nU&list=PLS31VRbZGLdbjmpuUL8Ff-fsEVXnWoKdV", "timestamp_created": 1500129478, "timestamp_updated": 1500129782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655276", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33558334": {"recommendationid": "33558334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008423537", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509472943}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, quite nide!

Big thumbs up to the developers for not being afraid to try something complety new. My only comment is that some of the things could be explained better, like how exactly armor works. Also, ability to view details of the enemies to check their stats while in combat - not only before the fight -  would be nice.\n\n\n- add\n\nAwesome!!! I just found my first enchant.

The environments are hand-crafted, beautifully detailed -- the quality and care of the designers shows from the very first second of gameplay!\n\nThe tutorials on how to play -- explaining skills, the points system, equipment, combat, etc. -- are very easily understandable and make it easy to pick up the game without struggling in ignorance or needing to consult a wiki.  \n\nControls are quite natural and fluid with Diablo-style movement.  I really like that you can view the entire battlefield in combat, without the camera being locked on your character.  This enables you to position your characters optimally, planning for enemy movements and attacks.\n\nPoints put into character skills, (special attacks), can be respecced at any time, which is nice if you come across a particularly difficult group of enemies and need to change your strategy on the fly.\n\nThe dialogue, story, and found bits of text are EXTRAORDINARILY well-written -- easy to read, yet interesting and entertaining.  Some games have repetitive dialogue or become boring within the first 5 minutes... not so with Tower of Time -- it reads like a lovingly-crafted novel -- a work of literature unto itself.\n\nI am still at the beginning of my journey with the game, but it has already impressed me to no end!

I recently bumped into an indie title called Tower of Time, developed and published by a small developer in Poland called Event Horizon, and had quite a bit of fun with it.\n\nEvent Horizon launched Tower of Time as an Early Access title on July 13. The game is a single-player, isometric top-down dungeon crawler with RTS elements that takes place inside a huge, multi-level tower that was unearthed during an earthquake in a dying world. \n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\n\nYour character was drawn to the tower as a child, and you briefly entered the structure and talked to a presence that said you\u2019d return someday to claim the power waiting there for you. Many years later, you indeed re-enter the tower in search of resources to help the citizens of your city, where continuous failed crops and the scarcity of clean water have threatened your people\u2019s future.\n\nYou initially return with two trusted friends and warriors, a prototypical male fighter and a female archer. They encourage you to let them go ahead and scout the tower and make it safe for you, which works out as you have a date with a large crystal throne you first glimpsed as a child. From that point on, you direct your companions\u2019 actions via the power of the throne, and as the game progresses you are introduced to new characters to add to your party of up to four.\n\n[H1]GAMEPLAY[/H1]\n\nYour team will explore the tower, fight monsters, and gain valuable insight as to what your world was like before its decline, as well as what caused it to begin dying in the first place. Most battles you can choose to initiate or postpone, as you can see many of the monsters in the tower milling about and waiting to kill you. Some battles, though, are unavoidable: sometimes your party is ambushed, and other times you have to engage an enemy force to progress further into the tower and solve its mysteries.\n\nOnce you enter combat, the game switches perspectives to give you a broader view of the battlefield, and you are allowed to position your adventurers wherever you like prior to starting the fight. This is advantageous for getting your ranged fighters and casters where they can be most effective, although you\u2019ll need to move all your characters around quite a bit during some fights. Once you start each battle, enemies will spawn from multiple locations on the map and attack, and you\u2019ll control your team members\u2019 movement and abilities in real-time while managing their health, mana, and ability cooldowns. The game\u2019s combat isn\u2019t unlike the Tactical View in EA and Bioware\u2019s Dragon Age games, and although you can\u2019t freeze the fight completely, there is a Slow Time button that you can use as much as you like when things get hairy. And things will get hairy; the first few fights might suggest otherwise, but once you have a full party and have to manage ranged DPS, melee, and healing/buffs in real time, you\u2019ll be glad you can slow things down occasionally.\n\n[H1]CONCLUSION[/H1]\n\nThere are plenty of time-worn fantasy tropes on display in Tower of Time, and I ran across a minor glitch or two, as well, but given its Early Access status and its very budget-friendly price of $15(also, 15% off until January 15), I think there\u2019s more than enough fun in this game to outweigh such concerns.\n\n[quote] This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/gaming_until_end]Gaming Until End[/url], through the generous contribution of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/HellCowON]HellCow.[/url] [/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1515837103, "timestamp_updated": 1515837744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39265975": {"recommendationid": "39265975", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993666152", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 232, "last_played": 1515883532}, "language": "english", "review": "For once an early access game that is playable not full of bugs and something that i want to return to.. nice !!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1515705981, "timestamp_updated": 1515705981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39186201": {"recommendationid": "39186201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112314609", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 763, "last_played": 1515967750}, "language": "english", "review": "Im realy suprised how good is this game.

Like drawing fire walls or cracking the earth or various other things.  It should be done more )\nEasy of Understanding - It's interface is easy to understand and get you right into the game.\nChallenges - Having the ability to get extra coins / gems if you can not progress is a good idea I had to use this a few times to get to next map.\n\nMIXED ATTITUDE\nLoot - doesn't feel special \n\nCONS\nFighting Maps - somewhat boring after continues sessions envirorment / fight repeative.\nVoice overs - None as of yet but it's early access yet few are avilable.\nChoice of Char -  I wish you could have some kind of choice or customization of your first character with it's voice or powers or any choice is gone.  \nUnlocking Char -  Since you can not choose your own character makes you somewhat annoyed you can not get more characters to choose.  \nStory Line - Somewhat confusing your going into a tower for a person yet was a boy yet  he's not a king yet somehow met this king,  made this guy a lord yet somehow, it's end of days or something ... LOL  I just started to go WTF is this story about... I don't like RPG that have endless texts and I enjoyed the smoke scenes but somewhat extra non-sense Fantasy story line.

Also i wish i could scroll in not just in combat but when exploring the levels in the game. I also do think that the game could benifit from allowing the use of a control, as there is not that many controls for the game and thus they could do a port to the consoles.\n\noverall Tower of time is a fantastic game that is due for release in april and all i can say its a must buy, i think it will become a cult classic, but because of the load screens in to combat and also in combat i could see the coding for my attacks in combat i can only give this game a 9.1/10", "timestamp_created": 1516539702, "timestamp_updated": 1516539702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39519612": {"recommendationid": "39519612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004834751", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "last_played": 1516564403}, "language": "german", "review": "Bin ehrlich gesagt total \u00fcberrascht gewesen von dem Spiel, aaaaaber: es ist fesselnd!\n\nCrafting?

It has the general structure of Diablo -- click-to-move, scads of loot, ability to go back to town and dump your junk when necessary, etc. -- but with more of a story, and with the \"arena\"-style battle setup, complete with a \"bullet time\" slow-things-down function, that's more like Baldur's Gate.  It's not difficult to pick up the basics of the game, and the tactical battle structure makes for some interesting character construction decisions.\n\nSpeaking of character construction... you do not customzie your own character in this game.  There are six (and possibly seven) pre-determined and pre-named characters that constitute your \"champions\".  (The conceit of the game is that you, the player, are seated in a magical throne and observe/control your champions through a mysterious psychic link.  Trust me, it makes more sense in context...)  However, you have a great deal of flexibility in how you build and grow those characters, and the game is very generous when it comes to giving you options to change on the fly.  (Atttribute points can be reset for a relatively trivial fee, and skills/skill modifications can be completely reset and redone at any time.)  There is no experience point system; instead, you purchase new levels for your champions with gold (that's scattered all over the ground in the game levels -- apparently mages are pretty sloppy.)  Progression is gated by the requirement that you upgrade class buildings -- each upgrade adds a fixed number of additional levels that you can buy for characters that use that class building -- using scrolls that are only found in the dungeons themselves.  This gives you peaks and valleys as you go along -- just after you get the upgrades and start levelling, things are significantly easier than when you've progressed further, hit your level cap, and need to find those new scrolls to stay competitive with the beasties you face.  You can always dial back the difficulty at any time if it's all too much for you, but even \"easy\" mode isn't exactly a walkover -- you still need to strategize a bit or you'll get your party wiped before you know it.\n\nWhat sets [b]Tower of Time[/b] apart, though, is how thoroughly polished and feature-complete it is for an Early Access game.  I've played full release titles that weren't as solid as this game.  You are not buying in to a paid beta test here -- this is a virtually complete game (now that the Book Two patch has added a huge amount of additional content) that only needs a few rough edges polished off here and there.  (The UI could use a bit more polish, and the game isn't always completely clear on what weapon/armor stats do what to a given character.  Mostly clear, but not completely.  It's a nitpick at best, though.)  The artwork is absolutely gorgeous as well; easily competitive with the eye candy you get from a  a AAA title like Diablo 3. The game appears to be very stable as well -- I've only had one crash, and it did not compromise my save or gameplay in any way.   (It was actually at the point where the pseudo-tutorial transitions into actual gameplay; I tried again and it worked fine the second time, and I haven't had a glitch since.)  I do have a relatively high-end laptop, though, and cannot speak to how the game will perform on borderline systems (or in versions of Windows prior to Win10).  \n\nIn summary -- this game is not your typical Early Access game.  It's actually worth the money they're charging for it. In fact, it's got the content and quality of a major US$50 release already.

I can understand that the inhabitants would correct the tables and chairs etc but those tables and chairs would still be on a ceiling.  The idea of the building being upside-down was just not realised.  Aside from the static layout the dynamic items don't always fit the enviroment.

Advertised with hundreds of skills and possibilities, but the actuality is that they are very linear as skill trees are associated with certain characters. For example, you start the game with a tank and an archer, and a little down the way you get the spell caster healer. Each of those characters has a preset appearance and has unlocks for class specific abilities as you progress through the game...\nMoreoever, I don't find the association with \"classic\" RPGs. The dialogue is lackluster, and the only \"option\" I've had in a dialogue tree is if I want to choose a sword or armor as a reward.. This is not a role playing game...\nI would compare this mostly with Diablo, with some elements of Darkest dungeon.

You can search more and bring him better Item 2 - you get a reward. Or - you can decide for an extreme option that has negative permanent consequences to one of your champions and offer Something 3 - and you get unique reward. I think that next to the novel combat it will be second most unique feature in ToT.\n\nAlso - we are working on Party Alignment - depending on the choice you make, imposing your will on the party OR letting your party decide - your champions will react differently - and as the time progresses they will fracture into groups, some being more and more loyal to you, some despising you.

Tower of Time is a really good experience so far given that it hasn't been officially released. I'll go through the different aspects of the game.\n\n* For gameplay footage, I'll leave a link at the bottom of this post. *\n\n[b][u]RPG Check: Characters and Loot[/u][/b]\nIt has the requirements for an RPG experience. While you don't get to create a character from scratch, you have pre-defined characters that you add to your party along the way. From what I'm seeing, you don't get the usual gain in power via experience but it's done through spending in-game currency to \"train\" your characters.  Your party/characters have an interesting range of unique abilities that can be expanded upon or upgraded via the usual ability point system.\n\nThe loot and equip experience is pretty standard and you also can tell an item's power through the green - blue - purple color system. Ofcourse, comparing the actual stats of each item will benefit you more.\n\n[b][u]Story Check: How is it done?[/u][/b]\nThe story is quite good. From what I can tell, It's not groundbreaking but I've only put in so many hours into it. It's done through non-animated cut-scenes and text. Oh, this may not be for everyone but expect to do a lot of reading in-game. The cut-scenes are voiced over very well (more on that below) but other lore related items are done through reading conversations, books and the like.\n\n[b][u]Audio & Graphics[/u][/b]\nFor a game that hasn't been released and is quite cheap, the audio is done very well. It doesn't have a lot of voice-over work as mentioned but where it applies, it's done really well. The narrator or the main character, gets you into the story without over-doing it or appear lacking in effort in terms of delivery. The background music fits each scenario.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good. The environment is textured enough that it looks better than its price. It also doesn't get too monotonous as the pacing allows for general change in scenery even though it's dungeon themed all throughout. The character models could use some work though and it would have been better if equipping items showed through during general gameplay.\n\nOh, more graphical settings would be appreciated. For those gaming on an ultrawide panel, it's supported with the exception of cutscenes. \n\n[b][u]General Gameplay[/u][/b]\nIt has a very Diablo-like feel when you run-around - also a little bit of Divinity. The activities are a bit standard: you loot, search,  scrounge, fight (more on that below), and figure out how to get around a problem. I wish the developer would add a \"ping\" option to reveal some items without showing important treasures or key quest items.\n\nThe game has this concept where you are going deeper into a tower but it still requires you to revisit the surface via a menu option. As mentioned above, you have to train your characters so re-surfacing gives you that option along with being able to upgrade skills and forge items. Moving around the tower are done through running or using the teleporters scattered in the different levels. Your party is always visible even outside of combat.\n\n[b][u]Combat[/u][/b]\nAside from the overall experience, the combat in Tower of Time is perhaps the other most fun thing about it. It's either started via an ambush or deciding to meet enemies head-on. \n\nThe combat is done arena-style where it doesn't use the last tile-set you see. You are ported to a different area where you have to complete objectives and they can vary. From what I've seen, (1) there is the general fight until the enemy is dead, (2) node defense scenarios and (3) aggression scenarios where you have to destroy enemy nodes/portals.\n\n[strike]There is no pause button in combat[/strike] (** Apparently there is one in the General menu option **). Instead, you have a slow-time option that allows you a think things through while combat unfolds at a slower rate. It will be easy on your first few attempts but it gets much harder as you progress. Waves continually increase, mobs gain more abilities and get \"beefier\" as you move down the levels. You can \"run away\" if you don't see your strategy working out (I don't see a penalty system for this) or you can always adjust the difficulty setting. Lastly, the zoom out option works very well - it lets you see the whole arena like a board.\n\n[b][u]Summary[/u][/b]\nSo that's what I've seen so far for Tower of Time. I have no regrets in the purchase I made. It's a great RPG/RTS game for its price!\n\nSample gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FvZEvENPBU", "timestamp_created": 1521378143, "timestamp_updated": 1521390268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525059", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40874388": {"recommendationid": "40874388", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978170885", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 498, "last_played": 1521391424}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok...so im waiting on Pillars of eternity 2 to come out...I was like- if i try this game it is going to be childish and boring and the same ol thing.

O t\u00edtulo conta com cinco n\u00edveis de dificuldade, atendendo desde jogadores que apenas querem seguir a hist\u00f3ria, at\u00e9 os que preferem ser desafiados nos combates que, diga-se de passagem, podem ser bem dif\u00edceis devido ao imenso n\u00famero de inimigos.\n\nO mundo est\u00e1 em decad\u00eancia, a comida cada vez mais escassa preocupa a humanidade sobre o futuro fadado ao fim. Num passado distante, um evento resultou no decl\u00ednio do planeta, por\u00e9m esse evento, assim como v\u00e1rias coisas sobre o passado, se perdeu na hist\u00f3ria e se tornou uma inc\u00f3gnita. Eis que uma torre emerge \u00e0 superf\u00edcie, com v\u00e1rios elementos m\u00e1gicos do passado, passado esse o qual a humanidade teme, por isso evita contato.\n\nSeu personagem, durante a inf\u00e2ncia, entra nessa torre e encontra um trono com poderes misteriosos, mas ainda n\u00e3o preparado, \u00e9 instru\u00eddo a sair da torre e voltar algum dia. Esse epis\u00f3dio \u00e9 jog\u00e1vel, voc\u00ea controla seu personagem ainda crian\u00e7a, enquanto explora a parte inicial da torre. \u00c9 importante isso para criar um v\u00ednculo com o protagonista, achei muito legal, por mais que n\u00e3o haja a\u00e7\u00e3o, h\u00e1 grande diferen\u00e7a entre apenas ler sobre um fato do passado e voc\u00ea jog\u00e1-lo.\n\nJ\u00e1 adulto e com um bom cargo, voc\u00ea volta \u00e0 torre com alguns subordinados, infelizmente n\u00e3o posso falar muito, mas [b]seu personagem n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 visto frequentemente[/b], isso \u00e9 algo muito legal na trama do jogo, em contrapartida voc\u00ea pode jogar com o grupo dele, inicialmente composto por Kane, o honrado escudeiro, e Maeve, a ambiciosa arqueira.\n\nA personalidade dos personagens \u00e9 maravilhosa, os di\u00e1logos s\u00e3o muito bem feitos e, embora n\u00e3o seja poss\u00edvel conversar entre eles a qualquer momento como em Dragon Age ou outros t\u00edtulos, frequentemente um di\u00e1logo \u00e9 iniciado com opini\u00f5es e pontos de vista de cada um. [b]\u00c9 importante conhecer o car\u00e1ter de cada personagem, pois isso influencia no alinhamento[/b]. As escolhas feitas pelo seu personagem afetam o alinhamento de cada componente do grupo, se negativo ele traz penalidades \u00e0s batalhas, se positivo traz boas recompensas. Por exemplo, se Kane tiver um alinhamento positivo, ele d\u00e1 mais armadura para o grupo, se estiver negativo o grupo perde armadura. \u00c9 interessante e necess\u00e1rio equilibrar bem esses alinhamentos de cada um, pois o impacto em batalha pode ser grande.\n\nO t\u00edtulo conta com um sistema de craft de equipamentos bastante facilitado, craft esse feito na cidade, local onde voc\u00ea pode teleportar seu grupo a qualquer momento para trein\u00e1-los, melhorar/gerenciar itens ou acessar os desafios. \u00c0 medida que voc\u00ea explora a torre e enfrenta inimigos, desafios s\u00e3o liberados para que voc\u00ea possa faz\u00ea-los e ganhar recompensas (ouro, gemas para craft, itens). Esses desafios n\u00e3o tem nenhum impacto na hist\u00f3ria, \u00e9 apenas uma forma de voc\u00ea se divertir ou testar builds, j\u00e1 que cada personagem pode dispor de apenas quatro habilidades, ent\u00e3o \u00e9 uma boa forma de ver na pr\u00e1tica se h\u00e1 uma boa intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre as habilidades e personagens escolhidos. Algo interessante \u00e9 que [b]os pontos da \u00e1rvore de talentos podem ser remanejados a qualquer momento sem nenhum custo[/b].\n\nVamos falar um pouco do sistema de batalha do jogo, ele n\u00e3o \u00e9 em turnos e sim em tempo real, sendo poss\u00edvel voc\u00ea ativar o [b]modo t\u00e1tico a qualquer momento e o quanto desejar[/b]. Desse modo vemos com calma quem do grupo \u00e9 o alvo de cada um dos inimigos e tamb\u00e9m auxilia a desviar de habilidades que os oponentes lan\u00e7am, se tornando um combate bastante din\u00e2mico que requer aten\u00e7\u00e3o total. Esse modo pode ser pausado (ao pressionar espa\u00e7o, o tempo \u00e9 parado), ou por padr\u00e3o, apenas o tempo correr de forma muito lenta. O jogo possui[b] mapas de batalha separados do mapa de explora\u00e7\u00e3o[/b], dessa forma foi poss\u00edvel criar locais com variedade de elementos que auxiliam a adaptar diferentes estrat\u00e9gias. Por outro lado, em alguns n\u00edveis esses mapas de combate podem se tornar chatos e cansativos, j\u00e1 que um mesmo \u00e9 usado em diversas batalhas. Atualmente o jogo conta com 55 campos de batalha.\n\nA [b]arte do jogo[/b] \u00e9 linda e a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o bastante bem feita, eu particularmente amei as imagens que aparecem como cutscenes.

I am rather Hard to PLEASE when it comes to games(RPGs) like this, but when it grabs you for over 90 minutes and that was just to see what it had going on, you know that if you sit down to this GAME(Tower of Time) you will not leave the table for hours.\n\nHowever I did find that this game could have added one thing to make for a more enjoyable setting! I think that if they added more narration to the game, it would truly pull you in! I found that the stop and go of reading to get through was rather cumber-sum.

You don\u2019t outright pause the game and it isn\u2019t turn-based, instead you hit a key and time slows to a crawl, allowing you to switch between characters and direct them where to go/how to attack and while you\u2019re doing that, your enemies are slowly coming at you, so if you take too long deciding you\u2019ll waste that advantage.\n\n \nAfter the first couple hours of the game I\u2019ve only glimpsed at the character skill trees for the first 3 characters but thus far it seems each character will have a chance to progress 8 different skills with optional paths in each and be able to activate 4 of those at any given time during combat and some of those skills are what you might expect out of a game like this but others are really neat in how they are activated/display on the screen like the temporary earth-wall you can throw up to block off enemies and their ranged attacks.\n\nThoughts on Gameplay\nI found it a little redundant and kind of strange the way they have you visit the same level in the Tower at the beginning of the game, first as a boy, then again right after a cut scene only this time as an adult.  Now when you return \u201cyears later\u201d the character you\u2019re playing as has little to no memory of having been there.  I would think this might work better if they left out the part of you playing as a boy entirely they could still use the cutscene and flash images of the tower to accomplish the same thing but give you a better feel of how the character would be seeing the Tower all those years later and it would be a little less awkward for the player experience.\n \nI didn\u2019t particularly care for how the game takes you from the main adventuring floor to a \u201ctactical map\u201d during combat and then throws waves of enemies at you. I would have prefered your typical approach in RPGs like this where you fight what you see on screen and where you see them, rather than it loading me into a different area and then at times being surrounded by enemies coming at me from all sides. This felt kind of like a call-back to older RPGs that did something very similar to this though.\n\nOne other gripe I had about the game is that you can\u2019t rotate or move the camera outside of combat, (and inside combat you can move but still not rotate the camera).  The game map doesn\u2019t quite match up with the angle of the layout on the screen and while this is a very small thing it at times made it slightly confusing when trying to navigate an area.  Even if the camera is going to be locked in at a certain angle, I still appreciate being able to zoom in/out, move, and rotate that camera around any time I\u2019m exploring around a game like this.\n \nFrom what I\u2019ve seen thus far and read online it appears there is plenty of lore to discover in-game about the world and the story you\u2019re playing through.  The game itself has an interesting vibe to it as you are learning about the apocalyptic situation you are currently in while also getting to learn about what the world was, once, long ago before magic came into the world and how magic has affected it since. While I\u2019m still early into the story of the game it certainly appears as if the problems that might end this world are tied in some way to the appearance of magic and it\u2019s possible abuse. It will be interesting to see how the story develops in such a way that magic can be used to save the world or if it would need to be abandoned entirely else risk the end of this civilization.\n \n\nConclusion/Rating\nBammsters rating system breaks down into five categories and rate the game on a 1 \u2013 10 scale with 5 serving as \u201caverage\u201d and then average those scores to a final overall rating.\n \nDesign:  8\nThe environments, the creatures and the overall feel of the game look really good and the background sounds, effects and music sound are a wonderful combination. It could use with some additional camera controls but otherwise functions well.\n \nChallenge:  8\nThe battles are fun and engaging and with the ability to adjust the difficulty you should be able to find middle ground to get a challenging and enjoyable experience. I did struggle early on with a few of the encounters but things got better once I found additional characters to add to my party.\n \nFun:  8\nI found the game to be quite a bit of fun. While I didn\u2019t particularly care for how entering combat the game switches to a smaller combat zone/tactical map that sends the enemies at you in waves, I still enjoyed playing. The way in which some of the skills/spells work is also neat and at times very interesting.\n\nReplay/Longevity:  7\nAs with many games like this the fun for fans is often in playing through and trying out different character builds/skills and scouring areas to look for missed secrets and lore which as I mentioned before it looks like there will be plenty of.\n\nPrice:  8\nTower of Time is still, at the moment, in early access and bugs and changes should be expected though thus far what I\u2019ve seen is a pretty polished project. They list 25+ hours of gameplay currently and for $15 I\u2019d say it is well worth that amount even just for a single play-through.\n\nOverall Score: 7.8 out of 10.\nOverall this has been a fun game to look at and I\u2019m looking forward to delving into it more and if this is the type of game you\u2019re interested in, if you enjoy RPGs I definitely encourage you to go and check it out.  \n\nFor this and other reviews visit us:\nOn the web:  [url=https://www.bammsters.com]Bammsters.com[/url]\nOn YouTube:    [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/BAMMHAVOC/videos]Bammsters[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1517681645, "timestamp_updated": 1517681645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578436", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39799381": {"recommendationid": "39799381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098673283", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517590711}, "language": "turkish", "review": "\u0130nceleme videosu i\u00e7in : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgFdXE1OhHM", "timestamp_created": 1517604061, "timestamp_updated": 1517604061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39701518": {"recommendationid": "39701518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068851657", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518204122}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend the game reservedly, and hope they will improve it further.\n\nA nice try. A bit different from other similar games, which pretty much says it all. In short: strategy normal, battles close to what other games have. Looks pretty, offers practically nothing new otherwise. Not a bad game, though. Crashed only once (so far) and then there was an autosave from immediately before the crash.\n\nThe slowed-time idea in battles is not bad, but nothing revolutionary: a turn-based battle works just as well. Otherwise the battles are regular fantasy RPG battles for the most part. You can back off and not battle at all that time, you can mostly choose your heroes for the battle on the fly. Those are good ideas. Far less stressful than those games where more enemies just get spammed at you and you click, click, click.\n\nAs to the other ideas in the game: the environments look nice. Races? Giants, dwarves, elves, humans, orcs, beastmen, ents... haven't seen any hobbits or dragons yet, thanks for that. Puzzles solved to get to the next level. I guess all this is necessary for a fantasy game but, with the same ingredients, I would say many predecessors have been more interesting somehow. Trading has been eliminated, which is not only a plus. I like to trade when I play a fantasy game. Don't ask me why. The game contains loads of completely unnecessary dialogue for filler. A sceptic member in a party that traverses a fantasy world with magical spells and all that? Okay.\n\nMovement outside battles is jerky. Makes me nauseous if I play a lot. Doesn't affect everyone, though. I hope they'll fix that. No way to adjust camera outside battles - very annoying. I hope they'll fix that too. Uses a lot of computer resources, apparently for the effects, which doesn't seem all that necessary. Looks nice but does nothing for the overall experience.\n\nScale 1-10, somewhere between 5 and 8.

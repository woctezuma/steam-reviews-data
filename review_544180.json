The atmosphere of the game made me feel as if I were in space, floating around in an infinite galaxy on some sort of mission. Which to me felt PRETTY AWESOME! The game has an absolutely BEAUTIFUL soundtrack that cycles throughout the game, again adding to that floating around space vibe.\n\nI think one of the things that surprised me about Orbox C, is the smart level designs throughout the game. I never would have thought that I would be writing down ways to pass the level on a piece of paper, which in my opinion makes this game a REALLY good puzzle game. \n\nWhen I played the game, I ran through no bugs, no glitches, it was a really good calm, smooth, and mysterious experience for me!\n\nOverall.

Who doesn't love a bit of space? I know I do. Regardless, there are a total of 7 packs of 30 levels each, each with varying levels of difficulty based on the name of the pack, it should be obvious on what is what. The hard difficulty pack definitely took me the longest to complete.\n\nNow this game was given to me for free by the developer, and I have made the entire game into an LP on my channel, a link at the bottom of the review is available.\n\nWithin the LP I addressed some replayability concerns, that this game definitely doesnt offer, such as a star system - there is no way to really indicate how well you completed a level compared to everyone else, or what the min-max values would be. The lack of a star system defeats knowing there is a better solution available and the strive to get to it, and without it, you honestly dont know, and not many people wish to spend a few hours a level to see if they could potentially beat their previous score on it.\n\nWith that said, there are other options for replayability that I addressed in my LP such as a storyboard that changes between playthroughs similar to NIER or other games of the sort. This may be unheard of in puzzle games but it is a possibility to add repeat playthroughs each time, perhaps expanding the ability to add additional blocks types, etc.\n\nThere are no unlockables in this game outside of unlocking the next pack once the previous has been finished, no custom backgrounds, no alternate backgrounds, blocks, etc, forcing only one look for this game. It would have been interesting to see some of the other levels in alternate styles.\n\nSettings are a bit lacking, I get a full screen/windowed, SFX and BGM on/off buttons. That is it. No options to set resolution (needed for recording to YouTube), nothing for skins, etc as I mentioned before, no in-depth video settings, or any of that sort. The settings are very straight forward and minimal.\n\nNow, do I recommend this game? I do, for the price point it is offered at is perfectly fine for the amount of levels (>200) it offers and is a good time killer, however for those who want to replayability in this game, it may not be quite at that level for you unless you enjoy min-maxing on your own without knowing if there is a better solution available. Though keep in mind the lack of settings can drastically hinder ones desire to play this game if you're looking for customization via options.\n\nFor video playthrough along with commentary see: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCNAkq5hBleiDV68c2ef8yuvx46O_W9yE", "timestamp_created": 1498481254, "timestamp_updated": 1498481254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32549658": {"recommendationid": "32549658", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991806340", "num_games_owned": 538, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497806975}, "language": "italian", "review": "Ho trovato questo gioco, fatto molto bene.

I\u2019d been working at the time and was due for a break. I hit the game\u2019s Steam store page and immediately knew that I\u2019d enjoy playing the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SycMDceA_co\n\n[h1]What is Orbox C?[/h1]\n\nYou see, Orbox C is a puzzle game. Further, it looks like the type of game that has some action gameplay components to it. It requires critical thinking and quick thought. As one may suspect, this is entirely up my alley. I\u2019ve played very similar games before \u2013 it\u2019s not a new concept per se \u2013 but it\u2019s a very interesting take on the genre.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Mechanics Introduced Quickly[/h1]\n\nOne of the things that I love about this game is that gameplay mechanics are introduced at a relatively rapid pace. You\u2019ll get a few levels of the same mechanic and then a new mechanic is introduced. This mechanic is generally not just a small change but something that adds significant depth. This prevents the game becoming tedious and increases the challenge.\n\n[h1]Challenging Gameplay[/h1]\n\nSpeaking of increasing the challenge, the game isn\u2019t as easy as it appears. Most levels had me repeating them to find the solution. However, at no time did I ever feel that any of my failures were unfair. The game kicked my ass until I logically moved through each level. \n\n[h1]Pretty Simplistic[/h1]\n\nWhat makes the game magical, however, is that it is simplistic in its nature. But it gets it so right. It doesn\u2019t strive to be more than what it is. Consequently, it delivers an all-around puzzle experience. \n\n[h1]Downsides?[/h1]\n\nI\u2019m used to writing these protracted reviews lately. My reviews generally are around the 1200+ word mark. Consequently, I carefully consider what I believe my readers will read and what they won\u2019t read. There\u2019s not much here to honestly criticize. My biggest criticism of the game is an external issue that I want to address on my business blog. I urge anyone who cares about marketing to read the blog. Hopefully, you\u2019ll learn something.\n\nHaving said that, the game is lacking in overall polish and pizzazz for it to appeal to the mass audience. But it\u2019s a $2.99 indie game made by two guys for crying out loud. It\u2019s supposed to be a little rough around the edges. The point is it does exactly what it is intended to do. It has more than sufficient amount of content to satisfy fans and that\u2019s what it\u2019s done.\nIf the developers can clean up the game\u2019s marketing image they\u2019ll be doing extremely well for themselves. I hope that people keep an eye out for it during the upcoming Steam sale or indie bundles if they\u2019re not willing to hand over the equivalent of a cup of coffee.\n\n[h1]The Gamephasis Verdict[/h1]\n\nCoffee or the game? The game\u2019s going to last you longer than a cuppa. However, if you\u2019re addicted that probably won\u2019t matter. If you\u2019re a serious puzzle gamer then get your hands on this hidden gem and have some fun.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n[url=http://www.gamephasis.com/]Gamephasis[/url] has reviews, previews, streams, giveaways and so much more.

Spiele. Das Spielprinzip ist, seinen Hauptblock in eine bestimmte Richtung zu lenken und dadurch den Ausgang zu erreichen. Gestoppt wird dieser nur wann er bei einem andren Block oder \u00e4hnlichem ansteht. Danach kann man eine neue Richtung w\u00e4hlen. Die Levels fangen sehr leicht an und erkl\u00e4ren Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt immer wieder neu dazu kommende Bl\u00f6cke in jeweils einem neuen Level. So gibt es zum Beispiel Levels, wo man entweder alle blauen Kugeln ber\u00fchrt haben muss, eine Kugel an allen 4 Seiten aktiviert haben muss oder s\u00e4mtliche Dynamitbl\u00f6cke am Feld zum Explodieren gebracht hat.\n\nDer Schwierigkeitsanstieg der Levels ist angenehm und kann je nach Schwierigkeitsgrad auch sehr fordernd werden. Aktuell gibt es 7 verschiedene Gamemodis und ein 8 soll laut Ingame Info wohl noch kommen, nachdem eine bestimmte Anzahl von Keys verkauft wurden. Eine Art Dankesch\u00f6n Content, wann das Spiel genug Interessenten gefunden hat - zumindest verstehe ich das so. Insgesamt gilt es also zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt 210  levels zu bestehen. Wann ich dieses Game jetzt mit Zup! vergleiche, dass ich ebenfalls gespielt habe und auch ganz ok fand, muss ich sagen, dass Orbox schon etwas mehr Herausforderung bietet und nicht nur ein Spiel ist, mit dem man in 15 Minuten Hunderte Erfolge freischaltet. \n\nInsgesamt kann ich sagen, dass ich das Spiel f\u00fcr Zwischendurch ganz lustig finde und den Preis von 2,99\u20ac auch f\u00fcr angemessen halte. Das Spielgef\u00fchl und die Handhabung ist sehr gut und auch die Soundkulisse passt sehr gut ins Spiel und gef\u00e4llt mir. Es gibt 31 Steam Erfolge f\u00fcr die man jedoch schon etwas Zeit, Geduld und R\u00e4umliches Denken mitbringen sollte um auch wirklich auf seine 100% zu kommen. \n\n[b]PROs[/b]\n[list]\n[*]sch\u00f6nes Leveldesign obwohl schlicht gehalten\n[*]stimmige Sounkulisse\n[*]Steam Erfolge\n[*]fairer Preis\n[*]Sammelkarten\n[*]keine Bugs\n[*]gute Erkl\u00e4rung\n[/list]\n\n[b]CONTRAs[/b]\n[list]\n[*]keine Ingame Optionen f\u00fcr Lautst\u00e4rke\n[/list]\n\nWer gerne Puzzlespiele spielt kann hier fast nichts falsch machen.

The particle effects are decent, the textures are fine, just overall what you would expect. The music is pretty good, but it is a little too loud. I could just turn down the volume of my computer, but that would be annoying if you were talking on discord or trying to record your own voice, etc. You can only turn the music off or on. I feel like it would be way better suited with a slider. The buttons on this game are huge, leading me to believe that this is most certainly just a mobile phone port, which is fine, at least it runs well and looks nice. Truly any computer made past 1998 should be able to run this game pretty well.\u00a0\n\nGameplay\n\nFor a puzzle game to work, it needs to meet two criteria for me. 1. The mechanics of the game are unique/ maps are well designed and 2. It should be easy enough to get into, but hard to beat. I think this game nails that personally. While the mechanics are nothing too special, the stages are very well done. Basically all you do is move a cube left, right, up, and down. The cube doesn't stop until it hits another surface, basically meaning you can shoot your cube into space and you'll have to start over. \u00a0There are a good amount of different objectives to complete to finish a level. Sometimes you just need to get to the end, sometimes you have to destroy blocks, collect orbs, or touch every side of a block. Some levels are a combination of 2 or 3 of those objectives. There's a good amount of variation, and the levels can be very challenging at times.\u00a0\n\nContent\n\nFirst things first, this game is only 3 bucks. Even keeping that in mind there is plenty of content in this game. There are 210 levels to complete across the various difficulties. Each level takes about a minute to complete, give or take depending on how good you are at completing the puzzles. Basically you get at least a few hours or gameplay from this game, about what you would expect. My goal for any game is to get an hour of gameplay of every dollar I spend. This is a game where you should be able to do that easily. Again, this is a puzzle game, so there really isn't anything other than puzzles included in this game.\n\nOverall\n\nThis is a very solid game in every category. Doesn't do any one thing great, but it does everything very well. Plus, it's very cheap and will run on anything. If you are into puzzle games, or just want to kill some time, this isn't a bad buy at all.", "timestamp_created": 1496164725, "timestamp_updated": 1496164725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32065665": {"recommendationid": "32065665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237834472", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496937405}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042f \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u043d\u043e.... \u042d\u0422\u041e \u0416 \u041a\u0420\u0423\u0422\u0410\u042f \u0418\u0413\u0420\u0410!!!!

As you might have puzzled out from the names this is actually the third addition to the orbox catalog. The previous two titles are free browser flash games that can be found on a plethora of different websites. It appears the developers wanted to go down a different path this time and create a more substantial marketable game. Which brings us to today.\n\nSo being that this is the first game in their series they\u2019re asking money for \u2013 what is it you get exactly. Well \u2013  for starters you get 210 levels of varying difficulty packaged into a surprisingly good puzzle game.I should mention that I had never played nor heard of an orbox game before being approached for this review. So I had no idea what to expect.\n\nI do try to keep a neutral attitude going into every game I review as I want to give a fair chance. That said, I was a little hesitant as I thought this was just going to be another generic puzzle game. It is \u2013 and - it isn\u2019t. Let me explain\n\n I didn\u2019t find anything that I felt I hadn\u2019t seen before, however, it takes solid timeless mechanics that are continuously \nsuccessful and implements them together. There\u2019s nothing wrong with taking old ideas and recycling them. As long as it\u2019s done well. Games have been doing this for billions of years why change now?\n\nAlright, let me explain the basics to you. It\u2019s quite simple- you\u2019re a box and you can only move up, down, left, or right. You slide along a fixed path until you hit a block or encounter the endless pits of spcae. And that\u2019s really all there is to it. Beyond that there\u2019s five objectives that you may encounter within each level. Each one differs slightly and gives a good change of pace so that you\u2019re not mindlessly repeating the same thing like a zombie.\n\nGetting more specific - the five objectives you\u2019ll face are the default get to the exit, destroy the bombs, collect the blue orbs, activating the sensors, and breaking ice blocks. Mind you, not all levels rely solely on just one of these. I\u2019ve had several times that require multiple hurdles before I could complete the overall challenge.\n\nMoving into the music \u2013 we\u2019re greeted with a cool spacey set of tracks. It doesn\u2019t feel out of place or get too repetitive \u2013 which if you\u2019ve watched any of my other reviews you\u2019d know is one of my biggest gripes. \n\n\nDifficulty is always key to a successfully puzzle game. And this game nails it right on the head. The challenge ranges drastically from quick and easy to mind-numbingly hard. I got halfway through normal for this review and really started to feel the heat ramping up. There was more than one puzzle that had me swearing and throwing empty bottles around my room. \n\nThere\u2019s several game modes or \u201cpacks\u201d as this game likes to call them. They do group the game difficulties in with them, however, looking beyond the standard game - there\u2019s a speed challenge if you\u2019re feeling up to setting some records.\n\nI care little for achievements and cards, but, I know there\u2019s those out there who live for this kind of stuff. There\u2019s currently 31 achievements that can be gained\u2026 They\u2019re not particularly hard to get though seeing as I\u2019m sitting at 55% with just a little over 2 hours of gameplay.\n\nMy final thoughts on this game are more positive than I would have thought. Honestly, I\u2019m not that fond of puzzle games to begin with, but, I found that I didn\u2019t have to push myself to complete this review. I\u2019ll likely put a couple more hours into it which is impressive considering I don\u2019t normally enjoy these types of games. It is a super casual game \u2013 I don\u2019t even think that need be said, but, you\u2019re getting about 5 or 6 hours of content for almost nothing. \n\nThis game is currently up on steam for $3. I will say that there is a flash version out there \u2013 though \u2013 it only offers a fraction of the levels that you\u2019re getting here. The developer has also setup a demo with a generous 30 levels for you to try out. So if you\u2019re a puzzle fanatic then I\u2019d recommend you at least check that out.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1491874363, "timestamp_updated": 1491874363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31026153": {"recommendationid": "31026153", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982999259", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490597650}, "language": "english", "review": "Orbox C is a scifi themed indie puzzle game with good music and engaging, variable puzzle mechanics which keep the gameplay fresh through a large catalog of levels.\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WksvdmjEjfI&ab_channel=UnlimitedAmmo]Orbox C Impressions[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1491683991, "timestamp_updated": 1491683991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31023757": {"recommendationid": "31023757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137240226", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 191, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491662500}, "language": "english", "review": "+ Amazing music\n+ Colorful graphics\n+ Ramps up the puzzle difficulty slowly over time\n+ Puzzle requirements change throughout the game\n+ Gives your brain a workout\n\nMake up your own mind with the gameplay: [url]https://youtu.be/UptvN1ufqQg[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1491676709, "timestamp_updated": 1491676709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31017198": {"recommendationid": "31017198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058481260", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491595394}, "language": "english", "review": "I was asked to review/play this game, in return for a free copy.

If you\u2019d rather just read my thoughts, those will be typed up beneath the video. If you do choose to watch my video, please be warned that there are vulgarities in the video. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOiLrNyuLsE\n\n\nIt\u2019s very rare that I find a puzzle game that makes me break down my moves step by step in order to find the solution. Usually I can simply click buttons until I pass the level. This puzzle game is not so\u2026 simple. This puzzle game requires thought, planning, and understanding of the mechanics in order to beat a level. I found myself struggling with the levels around level thirty. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, it was a good level of frustration. There was always that feeling of reward at the end of the level. That all too familiar feeling of \u201cHow did I miss that? That was so obvious\u201d If you\u2019ve played puzzle games before, you know that feeling.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a puzzle game that you can kind of do halfheartedly and blow through with relative ease, I\u2019d say this game is not for you. There is thought required to be good at this game. And that is a good thing, a very, very good thing when it comes to a puzzle game. I will not lie, I am not good at this game. I am happy to admit that I struggle to beat some of the levels in this game. But these are amazing qualities for a puzzle game to have. \n\nI definitely recommend this game to anybody looking for a good mental challenge. \n\nI spoke with one of the developers during the period of time of me recording this video, he is a very generous guy who showed that he really cares about his game. And really, there\u2019s nothing more you can ask for from a developer than for them to care more about the game than the money. This developer proved that to me and because of that, I will be a repeat customer of the games these developers produce. \n", "timestamp_created": 1485998980, "timestamp_updated": 1485998980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501540", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29462358": {"recommendationid": "29462358", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992515845", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483004652}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0439. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0435 15 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e,\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c-) \u0418 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e. \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u0418\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1485265302, "timestamp_updated": 1485265302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29453995": {"recommendationid": "29453995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052225865", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509404734}, "language": "english", "review": "Orbox C is a good game for you if you enjoy problem solving puzzle games with a good sound track.

Took a look at the description on Steam, and given it\u2019s only $2.99, decided to give this a try, as I\u2019m into puzzle games.  No regrets on this decision, as this is a very nice puzzle game with many interesting elements in it.\n\n\n\nGraphics:  When you open the game, it starts in full screen, but you can modify it to a smaller screen size, which I usually do.  Nice Sci-fi space graphics that change from level to level, so you\u2019re not looking at the exact same background each time.  Sprites are simple and easily labeled so that you know what you\u2019re looking at.\n\n\nSound:  Space-like music atmosphere is nice to listen to, but you can mute the music and sound effects at any time if you want to.  However, it may not hurt to have a few more soundtracks to choose from to listen to as you play to increase variety.\n\n\nControls:  Not too many options to have to worry about, as the controls are pretty self-explanatory.  In reality, all you\u2019re using is the directions on the keyboard (WASD or up/left/down/right) and R to restart if you get stuck and can\u2019t go out of bounds.  Controls are responsive with no lag, and if you push 5 directions ahead of time as you\u2019re going through a long part, the Orbox will move in those directions with no loss or delay.  Orbox moves quickly, which is nice for the longer stages, as they flow better with no real delays.\n\n\nGameplay:  I'll break this down into pieces.\n= It\u2019s easy to get the hang of this game, but you\u2019ll quickly see how the later puzzles make you think a bit.  Luckily, there are no enemies, and you can scout the board out before moving to see what you\u2019re dealing with.  There are no lives, or game over, or anything like that to pressure the player, so feel free to try various things out.  If you go out of bounds, you\u2019ll just go back to the start point (you\u2019ll want to go out of bounds a lot anyway to get a few of the achievements).\n= There are no time limits on the levels, so feel free to take as much time as needed to think through possible routes.  You\u2019ll need to look ahead a bit in later levels to see any tricks that may be present.\n= You can play a level as many times as you want, mainly to go for your best score, time, and moves (though the moves record is a bit glitched, as it doesn\u2019t keep your best move score, but rather your score on the last time you beat the level).\n= I like how in Easy, the levels start very simple with just getting to the goal.  A few levels in, new elements get introduced, one at a time.  This allows the player to learn how to best deal with these types of elements.  And as the levels progress, the player sees how these elements get combined together in having multiple tasks to do in a level.  The player will deal with anything from collecting stars to dealing with gates, grow blocks, sensors, ice, and bombs.  Nice job with the symmetry designs in most levels, giving a little more substance than just the basics to many of the levels.\n= There are a whopping 210 levels, split into seven packs of 30 levels.  You start with the Easy pack and unlock more packs as you complete the packs you\u2019re working on, which include Average, Normal, Hard, Easy 2, Speed, and Bonus.  There\u2019s a spot for an eighth pack depending on feedback.  Difficulty progresses steadily on Easy -> Average -> Normal -> Hard.  I would guess Easy 2, Speed, and Bonus are somewhere in between in difficulty.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re into puzzles, I would give this game a try.  $2.99 is a good price for the amount of content you get.

To move towards the exit you basically have to stop your block on other blocks in order to get to the exit without floating off into space. As you progress through the levels you will be greeted with different mechanics to keep the game interesting. For example on level 4 'angles' are introduced for the first time which are basically corner pieces which whizz you around the map in a 90 degree angle in a particular direction. The levels are very quick and usually only take a few minutes so the game makes you feel like you are progressing at a particularly fast rate which can make the player feel quite accomplished. There are 8 packs each consisting of 30 levels each so there are a ton of levels to sink your teeth into for a low affordable price.

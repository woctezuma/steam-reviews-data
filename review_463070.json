And they're mostly really good.\n- Dynamic difficulty system that works surprisingly well.\n- Good stage training modes and boss rush modes for practicing.\n\nAnd it's not just all stats either, it's got the good game design to go along with it: \nSome ships function very differently from others and will force you to heavily adapt how you play the game. Bosses are menacing and will not shy away from getting right up in your face, forcing you to leave the comfort zone at the bottom of the screen. Bosses sometimes come in groups and often times have strategic dismemberment. \nThe dynamic difficulty system affects game speed, enemy attack difficulty, and your own attack power, and will adapt to provide an easier experience if you're struggling, and a tougher experience if you manage to keep up.\nThe music isn't mind-blowing but it complements the action nicely and some tracks will stick with you.\n\nAll in all, pretty great.

I suppose this has happened frequently lately mainly due to the types of games I've been playing.  As you may have already guessed, this is the case with Mecha Ritz: Steel Rondo.  If it weren't for Hanaji Games bringing Yuki Shouhei's (or HEY for short) game to Steam it's likely I never would have played it, which would have been unfortunate as it's one cool shooting game.\n\nMecha Ritz: Steel Rondo is a Japanese indie shmup that was formed around the goal of creating an STG that could be accessible to players of all levels.  Normally this is achieved by having several difficulty settings, but this game takes quite a different approach.  There is a rank that is adjusted up and down depending on how well you're playing.  I was skeptical at first, but it's handled in an ingenious manner.\n\nOne might wager that playing well is defined as avoiding enemy fire, but it's not that simple.  The system takes several variables of play style into account such as using bombs appropriately, avoiding bullets, the speed enemies are killed, and also the distance enemies are killed from.  Rank is adjusted in real time so the challenge will rise and fall depending on your performance.  When starting the game rank is set to zero by default, but it can be increased in order to have a higher difficulty right out of the gate.  The fact that the game is generous with extra lives, shields, and bombs combines well with the ranking system.  I quickly found myself playing aggressively to boost rank as much as I could handle knowing that there were ample resources available.\n\nPlaying aggressively will lead to trying to kill bosses as quickly as possible, and killing bosses quickly will lead to different endings.  I've seen three endings and quite a few branching paths for alternate stages.  After playing a small amount of time extra Mecha (ships) will be unlocked.  The Mechas all have a unique primary fire, secondary fire, bombs, and other assorted attributes such as movement speed.  Two Mechas even have an awesome graze mechanic that encourages and rewards riskier play.  Mecha Ritz has a large amount of content, but the game doesn't do the best job at letting you know about it.\n\nThere is a text file in the game's directory that should absolutely be read before playing.  I found myself frustrated by the lack of ability to return to the title screen while playing, but it turns out it's possible and explained in the file.  It might have been more logical to simply have a pause menu with a quit option rather than holding three buttons though. There is no notification at all when you unlock a new ship, and I can imagine someone not even knowing that ships beyond the first six exist as they technically don't have icons of their own.  The menu initially felt a little strange to maneuver, but works fine once you get the hang of it.  Other than that, there isn't much else to say that I viewed as potentially negative.\n\nMecha Ritz: Steel Rondo is a great shooting game that is easily enjoyable by players at any skill level.  Among the things I've already mentioned it also features a decent story, quirky cafe based sense of humor, FM synth soundtrack, and the ability to watch replays of your runs.  It would have been really nice to have Steam achievements and leaderboards, but it doesn't actually detract from the game itself. HEY has truly created an excellent shoot 'em up, and it's probably one of the first games that would come to mind when suggesting a game for someone that wanted an introduction to the genre.  I absolutely recommend Mecha Ritz: Steel Rondo.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review?

And a lot of enemies have various coffee themed names that are all pretty clever) and to top it all off, there's a story in between all the bullets that actually doesn't seem too half bad.\n\nA young girl genius named Veloce discovered \"Mecha\" and has exterminated all of humanity, creating a world of steel machines for her to dominate over. Years pass and one machine, curiously human in its actions, has gained sentience. The collective souls of humanity has somehow converged into the machine, and boy are they ANGRY. You carry out their will and seek to mete out retribution against the tyrannical Volece and give peace to the tortured human souls.\n\nAnd crazy as it sounds, it ends up being a captivating story. You want to find out what's going on, why things had to be that way, and it just works. \n\nSome other very nice touches were the option to change the enemies bullet and explosion colors. You have to unlock them, but having this option is really appreciated, as if you don't feel the bullets are visible, you can change them to a color that is, and there seems to be enough to satisfy anyone. This to me is a really neat feature as a common complaint in these shmup games is that bullets can be hard to see, so it was smart of them to make it an option to change the colors. \n\n\nI highly recommend this game and also recommend you pick up the soundtrack.

This game makes it easy for me to enjoy the bullet hell experience while still feeling like I'm actually good at the game.\n\nOh, yeah: the FM synth music is amazing.\n\nThe only real problem I had with the game is that there's no explanation whatsoever as to how things work. How do you gain Rank? What is Heat? Why do bosses shoot a million bullets that then disappear? A game manual or tutorial would fix this right up.\n\nEventually I'll get the hang of the scoring/ranking system and I won't be as terrible.

As a result of this system, clearing the game is pretty easy. I'm a mediocre shmup player and was able to clear it on my first attempt with several lives left over. However clearing the game is not really the point. The real meat of this game revolves around the scoring system. The scoring system in the game mostly revolves around trying to push the rank as high as possible as well as speedkilling and point-blanking enemies. It's simple, but due to the games excellent use of the ranking system it always creates an exciting scoring experience for all skill levels. Player's will find themselves at a rank high above where they're comfortable and frantically dodging in order to try and keep it for going down. It's an adrenaline rush that needs to be experienced to be understood. \n\nTo top it all off the game has excellent visual presentation, fantastic music, TATE support, and a very customizable practice mode that allows you to switch ship types on the fly. My only real complaint is the lack of leaderboards given the game's focus on scoring. Some achievements would have also been nice but certainly aren't a deal breaker. \n\nRegardless, I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in the genre. There's enough here to engage and challenge both newcomers and veterans to the genre making the game very open to all. If you are unsure, there is also a freeware version available online with less features and no translation but still a similar and exciting experience.", "timestamp_created": 1465581553, "timestamp_updated": 1465581687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571772", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23483694": {"recommendationid": "23483694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016859256", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497373097}, "language": "english", "review": "Mecha Ritz is an innovative shmup with a uniquely manic pace thanks to its adaptive difficulty system and creative patterns.\n\nMR's big gimmick is that it adjusts the game's difficulty on the fly, according to players performance's, and awards higher scores to higher difficulty runs. This isn't a new concept, having been done many times before in a variety of ways, but Mecha Ritz executes it with a very special flavor. When you play well, the game's difficulty ramps like an out of control roller coaster, providing instant feedback and a dazzling light show of chaos. \"But wait!\" you might be shouting while raising your finger inquisitively, \"doesn't that mean the game must be really really hard? I don't like the sound of being punished for doing well\". Well, actually, the games difficulty drops just as fast and as hard as it rises (once again, going back to the roller coaster analogy). This is both a blessing and a curse, because the game does lack the tension of constantly fighting for your existence that is so vital to the genre, but scoring and seeing how far you can push the chaos takes that drive's place, and allows the game to become even more manic (and at times, completely insane) while feeling rewarding and fair.\n\nBeyond the adaptive difficulty, for me, the game's true strength is more fundamental. Even if the difficulty were set in place, Mecha Ritz is a masterpiece of adrenaline fueled pacing and cleverly designed stages and bosses. Stages are filled with unique setpieces and mini-bosses who rapidly jump in and out of the spotlight like over-excited circus performers relishing their time on stage. Bullet patterns and hazards do a brilliant job of forcing you to keep moving at high speed, as opposed to the slow microscopic dodges in most bullet hell games, and make dodging feel thrilling, free, and fun, without sacrificing any of the engagingly mind-bending chaos of traditional bullet hell shooters.\n\nMecha Ritz is a game that proves just how vital this oldest and purest of game genres still is, and the unending possibility for creativity that lies within it. With its over the top manic gameplay and quirky audiovisual presentation, Mecha Ritz has easily become one of my top 3 shmups ever made. Highly recommended.\n\n\nPS: If you're on the fence, try the original freeware version. It lacks much of the polish and content of this version, and annoyingly forces you to unlock any level of difficulty beyond easy, but it's fundamental charm is much the same.", "timestamp_created":

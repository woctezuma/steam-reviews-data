The standard price for this is absurdly high, especially given that this came out some time ago, now.\n\nBut for $25.00 during a sale, sure. It has its flaws, and among them is that some pretty important battles (Bagration) are somehow in the DLC rather than the base game, and some battles (Citadel, AKA Kursk) don't even appear to be available at all. Also, it's sometimes needlessly complex (once I group together units, do I really need to Shift-Right Click to attack with the group? Just a right click should do if I bothered to group them, after all) while in other areas somehow still watered-down (partisans are a whack-a-mole annoyance rather than a crucial issue, much of the time).\n\nAll that said, have you ever played Unity of Command and wanted a bigger scenario with more complexity? Well, this is basically just that: the biggest UoC scenario is about the scale in space of the medium-sized ones in WitE, and about half the scale in turns.\n\nIf you don't know what Unity of Command is, here's another take:\n\nEver played Civilization games and wanted to do nothing but fight battles with the end-game units? This is basically that, sans helicopters and giant death robots. You'll spend countless turns shuffling across hexes, defending hexes, stacking units (up to three in a tile) according to what you plan on happening, and, of course, fighting for cities (as well as victory points). There's a lot more military complexity, too, and none of that stupidly-simple diplomacy that Civilization fans have come to know and occasionally tolerate.\n\nAnd beyond all that: if you are a war-gamer, this is one of the most detailed titles in PC war-gaming that you'll find.\n\n\nBut it has its flaws. \n\nI already mentioned the pricing, but the price might feel a little less astronomical if certain other flaws didn't also exist. \n\nFor one, the music: you get maybe a grand total of 7 minutes of actual music, divided into 2 tracks. And one of the two tracks, while an excellent attempt at a very martial-sounding march, is itself already repetative. While I don't want to compare HoI4 to this, as the two games are actually quite different in many ways, I have to say that HoI4 itself annoyed me musically, as it had maybe 20 minutes of music at launch and you heard the same stuff over and over again over a 5-10 hour campaign. But WitE is far worse... in just the first hour of actual play, I already found myself thinking about putting on my own music. \n\nAnother pretty major non-gameplay-related flaw is the lack of useful tool-tips. You get tool-tips, yes, but most are not very useful and are often limited to a single-sentence that doesn't connect the question at hand to the other gameplay elements. This is an issue in other games, sure, but in a game with such a massive amount of text, how is it that tool-tips are so small? This game doesn't hold hands, but maybe some better tool-tips, at least, would be a good idea... especially given that the manual also doesn't always provide a straight-forward answer (or always explain what an acronym means, or what a couple of gameplay mechanics actually do).\n\nYet another lack-of-polish issue is that the DLC campaign scenarios are intermingled with the base-game scenarios in the menu. This sounds nit-picky, but when you just want to try the base-game prior to deciding on DLC, it only serves to obscure what you really can play. Worse, the tutorial scenario, because it begins with a 'V' for its name (named after the area it occurs in), is buried in the list... fortunately, V is close enough to T (for Tutorial, you know) that I still found it while looking for a tutorial scenario... but really? You know, seperate folders for game content have been around since Doom had the different WAD files for maps. Doom, guys. Doom. A game that was little more than blasting demons had the foresight to use different folders for maps. And here we are twenty years later with a major war-game that lumps every map into the same folder.\n\nAnd still another non-gameplay-issue: resolution and full-screen. Resolution can be screwy, and I toyed around with mine a little bit (though fortunately I didn't run into any black-screen issues or more major stuff like some on the Steam forums may have). And true full-screen doesn't exist... a major war-game without even the option to go full-screen. Again, Doom, guys. Doom.\n\n\nSo why still recommend it?\n\nWell, if you don't mind getting through a couple of beginner's traps, don't mind a sort of high learning curve, and don't mind putting on some Moody Blues, then you can jump into a far better depiction of the Eastern Front than you saw in CoH2, HoI4, or in almost any other strategy game. \n\nThis is as close as you can get to seeing what really was going on in the Eastern Front. If you allow the Soviets to pull back in those early-war scenarios, you may not get another chance to encircle them. The Panzers often must move forward, keeping the Soviets routing, not allowing them to entrench at the rivers, all while realizing that fuel may become an issue and that once the mud appears, that's it. Unlike most games that depict the winter weather being the downfall of the offensive in 1941, this one accurately shows that the *mud* actually was the beginning of the end, as the Panzers couldn't get ahead fast enough at that point to keep the Soviets retreating.\n\nReally, it's those things that make this game what it is. It's the over-all attention to the military realities, acknowledging that ammunition and fuel are two totally seperate things (unlike HoI4 or UoC), acknowledging that you can't simply empty France and Germany to deploy every last unit against the Soviets (an issue many, many WWII games have run into, where you can win on the Eastern Front by taking everyone who should have had to stay in France and using them in the East, all because the human player knows that the scripted invasion of France won't hit until 1944). Not that the Western Front exists in WitE, but enough scenarios force one or both players to leave garrisons in certain cities in the Eastern Theater in order to not lose victory points.\n\n\nTL;DR - \n\nVery good gameplay, very thread-bare presentation (music is ultra-repetative, some UI elements are poor). \n\nFor $25 (and $10 on I-tunes for some better music), it's worth it. Maybe for $40 if you are really into hex-based wargaming. \n\nBut for $80, I'd say wait for a sale. \n\nDefinitely a game I recommend, but, well, not for $80.00. Hopefully they chop the standard price in half (at least) before long, but that hardly seems likely from what I've seen... and to anyone still trying to defend the current price: the game is way too old now to justify the price. Super Mario Bro's for the NES in the 1980's might be an all-time classic... but they don't still charge the $30 original price (or whatever it was, adjusting for inflation, etc.). In all likelihood, if the price was set to $25.00 (which it is during winter sales), it would probably make *more* money that way, selling two dozen more copies a year, than it does currently probably selling a couple copies a year at $80.00.", "timestamp_created": 1514656201, "timestamp_updated": 1514656345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630413", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38824098": {"recommendationid": "38824098", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997288328", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1515596851}, "language": "english", "review": "gr8 gaem m8", "timestamp_created": 1514564036, "timestamp_updated": 1514564036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.352244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38720883": {"recommendationid": "38720883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390038731", "num_games_owned": 899, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 11785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3802, "last_played": 1516205712}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Scenario List: \nBattle for Kharkov 1942 (12 May - 22 June 1942 - 6 turns) \nOperation Sturgeon Catch 1942 (2 June - 3 August 1942 - 9 turns) \nCase Blue Phase I (28 June - 18 July 1942 - 3 turns) \nOperation Uranus 1942 (19 November - 30 December 1942 - 6 turns) \nOperation Kutuzov-Rumyantsev (5 July - 29 August 1943 - 8 turns) \nCherkassy Pocket 1944 (24 January - 5 March 1944 - 6 turns) \nRed Army Resurgent (19 November 1942 - 17 March 1943 - 17 turns) \nDecision in the Ukraine (24 September 1943 - 4 May 1944 - 32 turns) \nRetreat from Leningrad (22 June 1944 - 3 January 1945 - 28 turns) \nDrama on the Danube (20 August 1944 - 5 May 1945 - 37 turns)", "timestamp_created": 1514342091, "timestamp_updated": 1514342091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38635041": {"recommendationid": "38635041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051363573", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 8056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 235, "last_played": 1516257024}, "language": "english", "review": "A hundred hours in, and I still have no idea what I'm doing. \n\nGreat fun.", "timestamp_created": 1514146447, "timestamp_updated": 1514146447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38601913": {"recommendationid": "38601913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037487626", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514577872}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game to kill time with even though i dont understand anything im doing", "timestamp_created": 1514077695, "timestamp_updated": 1514077968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38547602": {"recommendationid": "38547602", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961168458", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514469947}, "language": "english", "review": "Kind of like accounting software.

It is not. It is just deep. True, learning the game is a pain. Period. But it does not take that much time to get into it, 3-4 hours and you should be good with most mechanics. \n\nSo, is it fun? Yes. It is a challenge and the way the mechanics work, the results of actions make sense. E.g. what you expect to happen in certain situations, like storming a city or attacking across a river or encircling an enemy unit, will give you the results you expect. It is a good \"military\" simulator rather than a tic-tac-toe puzzle system a la panzer general. \n\nHOWEVER:\nThe larger the game gets (the bigger the scenario and the further in you get), the longer the time the computer takes to calculate its turn. This is because the AI calculates what it wants to do. In the small scenarios, this is basically irrelevant. But I have been playing the big campaign on the soviet side and am now on turn 58.\n\nIt takes the computer 45 minutes to calculate its turn!!!! I'm sorry, but what?! \n\nI would really have liked to finish the campaign (standing at mid-1942 at this point) but I am not going to wait for 45 mins for one turn (= 1 in-game week) to pass. This is even more frustrating as, as a Soviet, I'm not doing much in my own turn at this time in the war. So I'm busy for 3-5 minutes and then wait for almost an hour.\n\nIf you really want to play the Great Patriotic War, I would suggest War In The East 1. It's an old DOS game that will give you eye cancer and has very odd controls but once you get used to it, it will at least let you finish the game.\n\nEdit: To address arguments that my computer is just too old: I have an i7-5500 CPU with 2,4 GHz and 12GB RAM.

And since it is an old game it will probably stay that way.\n\nThis is a very serious WW2 simulator, and in the hex based/counter genre the most encompassing game I have played. All units and leaders are historically accurate (as far as I can tell, and I know a thing or two about WW2), and units come with very detailed information and historical photographs. \n\nIt is not a dynamic, or graphically appealing game, all fighting is autoresolved, so it is mostly a game of strategic planning, concentrating your troops and building up fronts. \n\nThe AI is pretty decent, for example: It detects attempts to encircle and tries to avoid that. But since the German units start off way better (really rather overpowered, as their historical edge lay at least half in communication, coordination, speed and organisation, things that cannot easily be programmed, so to simulate the advantage of the Germans, their troops are very strong compared to Soviet troops), and since the unit values favors defense greatly for both sides, the Soviet Ai hardly ever attacks and is overall rather passive. Basically the AI only attacks where it has calculated that the odds favor them, and if you keep your units stacked and tidy, that is almost never (except the first winter (special rules)). \n\nNothing really different from most hex/counter based games, just very broad in scope and very detalied in information. It could have been a very enjoyable game.\n\nBut.\n\nThe AI takes ages to calculate and complete it's turn. In the first few years this is bearable. But I arrived at turn 160 in late '44, and it takes the AI 15-30 minutes complete one turn, often with the only real action being bombing runs (of which there are no less than 100+, each with an autoresolve report, but that is only a fraction of the time). That truelly kills all immersion and gameplay, and really makes this a waiting game, a complete grind. Finishing off 20 partisan units every turn by moving a unit next to it does also not contribute to a vivid experience. (my PC was high end for the time the game came out: quad core i7 3,4, graphic card doesn't matter in this game, but was also high end)\n\nI cannot imagine how you dare to sell a game for this amount of money, that is so severely testing your patience. All my 180+ hours played are from 3/4 of ONE playthrough by one side (admittedly I took much time learning and exploring the game, checking leaders, moving attachments around etc.). \n\nSo, if you wonder if you should buy this, buy it only if you have a LOT (and I mean a LOT) of patience and are a die hard WW2 strategic fan, and then only if it is on sale. \n\nRather sad, because if you are into realistic strategic WW2 games, this is a great game at it's core.", "timestamp_created": 1484953445, "timestamp_updated": 1484953445, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 167, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851307", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29372411": {"recommendationid": "29372411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024249153", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502380074}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer knochenharte Strategiespiele mag, wird an diesem Spiel nicht vorbeikommen.

GG's WitE is the quintessential best, end all, beat all, WW2, Eastern Front, computerized operational level simulator ever on the planet.  That's right, I said it.  You can take that Hearts of Iron 4, pants-tightening chub and go sell it and that game to the tourists, skeezix, cuz this right here is what it's all about.  This is the cat's ass of Eastern Front, grognard wargamming.  Not sayin' HOI4 doesn't have it's place, but if you're the kinda dude (let's face it, absolutely zero women probably give a rat's hind end about the East Front and if there's one out there, well that's just one more female I've infuriated in my existence) that read \"When Titans Clash\" or \"Enemy at the Gates\" back in the day and it wasn't a college assignment , then this, my friend is for YOU. \n\nYeah, it's a hefty $80 pricetag, but if someone sold you a $20, Christmas Sale Lincoln Navigator, I doubt that SOB would make it off the lot, and there'd probably be a dead hooker buried in the back that you'd have to explain to the cops as well.  WitE will indeed make it off the lot, purring like a V-8 hemi Charger, with zero dead hookers in the trunk.  \n\nWhy is it so great you ask?  Well, I'll lay it on you like Dolemite.  This monster encompasses the entire WW2 adventure from Germany's Barbarossa \"What's the worst that could happen?\" heyday to angry, vodka soaked Russkies rolling all up into Adolf's backyard like drunken soccer hooligans to camp out for the next 40 some-odd years at ye olde Reichstag. Unless of course, you're savvy enough to alter history with your mad, wargaming skills and turn Moscow into a Teutonic holiday retreat.  Good luck with all that, because it ain't gonna be easy, Herr Schlecte-Ahnung. \n\nAs the Soviets, you're going to get your cossack handed to you in '41.  But like the real deal, your job is to minimize losses, sacrifice units, dodge Commrade Stalin's temper tantrums, make the Krauts pay for every inch of ground, and stop their encirclement shenanigans long enough until mud and winter roll into town.  Those ladies never disappoint.  You'll suffer too, make no mistake, but not as much as Winter-Fritz in '41 who failed to show up in cold weather gear enough to survive a Wisconsin Indian Summer.\n\nI'm mainly talking about the Grand Campaign here, which is the real reason anybody walks the path to WitE.  Sure, you can play some limited scenarios if you want to.  Be sure and help yourself to some Shirley Temple's over there in the pink cooler while your at it, Sally.  Come join the Mensch when you feel up to it, but don't hurt yourself.   \n\nThis game is unparalleled in it's handling of minute details that you may or may not ever bother to look at.  But you will.  Eventually, we all look.  And half your game memories will consist of, \"Yeah, the city was taken...but good Lord we lost a lotta guys doing it.\"  And, like the real war, you'll wind up writing off numbers of dead due to the sheer complexity of the titanic struggle.  \n\nEverything, and I mean EVERYTHING is factored into this Goliath.  Weather, leaders (which you can change in and out with realistic limitations, or y'know, just have shot), supply, unit cohesion, the f'ing railroads and grade change once you get into real Russia, seaports (as Krauts I still can't take stinking Sevastopol due to their sea supply), air cover, air missions, updated gear and how long it takes to actually become available, scorched earth policies, pulling armor and transport out of units just to save on gas, fortifications, Western Front influences (this was a big one for me and is mirrored appropriately), partisans being a pain disrupting supply, SS units, Guards units, Police units (you can steamroll the town but unless military cops are there to hold it, it'll turn into Detroit sans Robocop).  Sickness and normal attrition play a role as well.  Hell, there's probably a graph chart depicting Pvt. Wiener Humpelstein's syphillis advancement and it's effect on his komrades but I just haven't found it yet.\n\nThere you go folks, there's my review.  Is it difficult to learn?

I bought it because Hearts of Iron 4 just didn't deliver in terms of realism or complexity, and so far I've been pleased with the purchase.  You can play the game fairly quickly after mastering basic concepts, but there is waaaay more to the game than just pushing units about.  Once you get into the longer scenarios you will start to find out that you really do need to know what's the difference between the equipment your regular and your SS motorized divisions have, you will need to consider how to airdrop fuel, where to cross that river, how you are going to break through and encircle, and, oh my God, winter is coming!\n\nThe game covers all the main scenarios of the invasion, as well as grand campaigns.  Combat, supply, leadership and infrastructure are all dealt with in clear but detailed and complex ways, and if you play through the scenarios in increasing complexity, you can slowly learn the mechanics of the game.  As I said, it allows you to get into the game, but after 15 hours I feel like I know know how much I don't know and which directions to learn.  This is a game you could sink hundreds of hours into.  The AI is competent and has caught me out, but with a human player the tension would be mental.  As for the price, I bought it on sale, as it does seem expensive, but the level of detail and historical faithfulness do make this worth the price.\n\nAnd now to finish with the obligatory \"would... again\" list-\n- Week 1. Push through northern USSR with the Finns coming in from the North.  Ahh the sun is shining, the panzers are rolling, and Soviet divisions are crumbling, life is good.\n- Week 3. We get to Novgorod, and I now have to split my armies, the pesky Soviets seem to be holding the line a little better.\n- Week 10.  The bitter seige of Leningrad continues... How many more men must be put through this mincer before the city falls?  Curse Stalin and his orders.  The Ju88s fly overhead on their way to bomb the port, but it makes no difference... I just want to go home.\n- Week 12. Partisans have torn up the lines behind us, and they say we cannot get any fuel by air this week.  Still more good German men are being thrown at the Leningraders.  Why won't they surrender?  God help us, it's August, and we're running out of sunshine.\n- Week 14.  We've taken the mainland suburbs of Leningrad at horrendous cost.  Still, throw enough howitzer shells at anyone and they soon melt into the past, no matter how fearsome their leader.  I've heard in the swamps to the south, our tanks have stalled against another Soviet line... the devil take this war...\n- Week 16.  We've barely moved in 2 weeks, the encirclement south has come undone through massive Soviet reinforcement... The colonel says one more push, and Leningrad should fall...\n.....\n.......\n.......\n8/10 Would like to make a funny comment, but really, this war was beyond terrible.", "timestamp_created": 1468246519, "timestamp_updated": 1468246657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751093", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24126256": {"recommendationid": "24126256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096749783", "num_games_owned": 712, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513221547}, "language": "english", "review": "Just look at me, refunded once for its complexity but buy it again, now I have WITE, WITW and WITP!!!!!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467780622, "timestamp_updated": 1467780622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24090834": {"recommendationid": "24090834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119721645", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1705, "last_played": 1516395587}, "language": "english", "review": "The best WWII game I've played.", "timestamp_created": 1467661260, "timestamp_updated": 1467661260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462427", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23679324": {"recommendationid": "23679324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031832483", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 16627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1515543973}, "language": "english", "review": "Bloody expensive.

I will shift over and play a campaign as Germans next.... it will be glorious !  This game is for anyone who loves strategy WW II gaming. The details are amazing, from unit content to production there is a wealth of information you can use to develop your plans. Leaders are an enhancing element I really enjoy - get the right one in charge of an Army and you can command an area of the battle. I also like how guards divisions are created after a big battle. I look forward to many, many more hours on The Eastern Front \n- I do wish the production system was deeper and I could choose what to build and how to design the divisions (The Germans really need a production system) I'd like to be able to add more AT guns to infantry divisions at the expense of a couple panzer divisions for example.

I will say it is essential if you are a competitor.  But it makes reading the manual very hard like reading a school book.  I will suggest just make the manaul without the formual but only the logic of different topics, and add the formulas and functions in the appendix section.

Not to mention the unending amount of bookkeeping involved. If you want to simulate manpower, replacement rates, supply etc., and you DO if you want any sort of realism in a wargame, you're going to have bookkeeping. Computers do all of that PLUS you don't have to have a spare garage to keep those giant maps and thousands of counters lying around for months while you play it. IF you can find somebody to play it WITH.\n\nNow, back to this game. Old grognards like myself will remember cardboard titles like Drang Nach Osten/Unentschieden (Fire in the East/Scorched Earth) and Gary Grigsby's War in the East IS those games, only even better as you now have a computer capable of simulating everything down to the amount of ammo available for Mauser 98k rifles available to every single unit in the game. All behind the scenes so you don't have to bother if you don't want to. But you can, and if you ever want to know how many PzIVs you made this months, you can get that info too. Or not. You don't have to.\n\nIf you just want to push counters and conquer hexes, you can do that too, leaving almost everything else to the AI, which is very good at what it does. And that's the true beauty of this title, in my opinion. If you're just starting out and are a bit intimidated by the sheer size of this monster, and you have every reason to be, then don't worry. Just play. Select unit, move, attack, move some more, and let the computer handle the rest. Very intuitive and easy to get into.\n\nIf you want more, and eventually you will, then there's the extensive manual (almost 400 pages) that covers everything you might want to know. And so gradually you learn more and more about how your supplies work, how air power works, how to keep your units in supply, how to keep the enemy OUT of supply etc., all without having to learn it before moving a single counter. Too many games demand that you memorize the manual before you can even be moderately successful at playing the game, much less have any actual fun doing so. WitE is not one of those games, which is really impressive considering the amount of information and detail involved.\n\nHistorical? If you want something closer to history than this game, you'll probably have to invent a time machine and start learning how to speak German. The early lightning advances, watching your precious Panzers becoming shadows of their former selves as they race out of range of their own supplies as their supporting infantry struggles to keep up, watching everything come to a standstill as General Mud bogs down everything, grand encirclements, spending weeks reducing pockets of enemy troops cut off knowing that your infantry really needs to get the job done and get to the front before the Russians can start counterattacking your vulnerable flanks, you name it. WitE has it.\n\nThe price tag? Yes, it is expensive, but you'll be playing this game for years and years if wargaming is your thing, so you'll get your money back.

A ci\u00f2 si deve aggiungere un sistema molto dettagliato per quanto riguarda la gestione dei generali e comandati.\n\nPreciso che War in the East ha 5 anni e per i wargame non deve essere considerato vecchio, anzi, solo con la recentissima patch si pu\u00f2 considerare maturo. Infatti da anni escono patch e beta patch con cadenza bimestrale che hanno aggiunto molte modifiche al nucleo centrale del gioco. \nBilanciare un gioco del genere, mantenendo un'assoluta fedelt\u00e0 storica non \u00e8 un compito facile.\nIl gioco \u00e8 costoso ma deve essere considerato una sorta di investimento, si acquista oltre al gioco un supporto costante e duraturo.\n\nL'IA \u00e8 buona, tuttavia si destreggia meglio coi sovietici in quanto l'esercito tedesco si basa su un movimento pi\u00f9 ragionato.\nViceversa per il giocatore neofita \u00e8 pi\u00f9 facile utilizzare i tedeschi in quanto i rifornimenti e le dismissioni delle unit\u00e0 seguono quanto storicamente avvenuto, invece per i russi il giocatore deve creare le unit\u00e0 e gestire le varie fabbriche e manodopera e cercare di salvaguardarle il pi\u00f9 possibile.\n\nPossibilit\u00e0 di giocarlo con un avversario umano col sistema play by mail.\n\nInoltre esistono vari mod, in particolare consiglio la mappa creata da jison (trovate tutto sul forum ufficiale).\n\nPer completezza va detto che \u00e8 da poco uscito War in the West che ripercorre la guerra in Europa dal 43 (invasione della Sicilia) al 45. In linea teorica riprende la base di War in the East e la migliora, tuttavia \u00e8 un gioco ancora immaturo, ha un andamento del gioco pi\u00f9 a senso unico e a tutt\u2019oggi lo trovo incompleto per varie ragioni che esulano da questa recensione...\n\nVa detto infine che se giocato su un portatile full hd da 15 pollici le scritte risultano troppo piccole e si \u00e8 costretti a diminuire la risoluzione. Per lo stesso motivo non \u00e8 adatto per i monitor 4k. Insomma il gioco viaggia bene in full hd con uno schermo di almeno 17 pollici.\n\nIn definitiva, se ci si vuole avvicinare ai wargame veri questo \u00e8 il gioco che consiglio.\n", "timestamp_created": 1437307944, "timestamp_updated": 1437307944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17093818": {"recommendationid": "17093818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032191113", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504733324}, "language": "english", "review": "Gary Grigsby's War in the East simulates warfare on the Easter Front in the Second World War. It is a game you will either spend tens (ok, hundreds) of hours with... or you will just not get over the first hurdle of user interface & the manual. If you get over the interface and the hefty manual (highly recommended for new players, 100's of pages of important stuff), you need to gain understanding a rather delicate web of interdependencies, between morale, supply, air raids, HQ, generals, encirclements and evacuation. Than, AI will be piece of cake - but it will take tens and tens of hours to get to stage when you need to start playing Soviet Union on Hard to get some challenge.\n\nHowever, the game begins when you start playing against humans. And you will find out that you have much to learn and that you do not know how to play. You will find that there are tricks, fine tricks and almost exploits. In any case, the game against expert player is quite different than even against very tough AI. Things are unfair, no matter which side you play... but also fun. You will understand that the system of interdependencies is much deeper and that micromanagement is much more important. I guarantee that during games against humans you will reach total despair, no matter which side you play. \n\nHint: choose Soviets for your first game against human - they can fight even after you made quite some mistakes. Germans, Germans require a player class or two better than the opponent to succeed. But expertly played Axis is a very challenging opponent, even for an expert Soviet. At least until you stabilize in '42-'43.\n\nTo sum up, the game if you choose to get deep into it, will take hundreds of hours of play.  Worth it? Worth it if moving symbols over hexes is your thing. However, be careful if your family situation is strained and you should not get into a very complex game which will take hundreds of hours of your life. And if you do not like complex games, that is not the game for you. \n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Complexity\n[*] Details\n[*] Most complete warfare simulation of the Eastern Front\n[*] Really well thought out - though one can appreciate the finer design only after hundreds of hours played\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Complexity - not a game for everyone\n[*] Predicting the results of battles can be frustrating and require a lot of skill (one needs to take into account all the variables, that is morale, supply, type of units fighting, arms in the units etc - the numbers on the counters are only rough guidelines). That is doubly frustrating against expert human players as they can improve supply, morale etc. by skilled play leading to more difficult prediction of the results - as you do not know everything due to fog of war.\n[*] Some balancing issues when facing expert humans\n[*] Simulation of warfare only; no option to simulate production, interfere with the units armaments, etc\n[*] Your social life will be in danger if you like complex wargames\n[/list]\n\nCheck the AAR's here: [url=www.matrixgames.com/forums/tt.asp?forumid=910] AAR Forum [/url] \n[url=www.matrixgames.com/forums/tm.asp?m=3457737] My opponent AAR (two year old) - myself playing Germans\t[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1437150009, "timestamp_updated": 1437150035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517491", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17081118": {"recommendationid": "17081118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043495973", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505401044}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with lots of detail.

At times it can be difficult to know if you're making the right choice. The interface can, at times, be overwhelming. All of the sudden a unit is highlighted in red. Why? It's not always evident immediately what is happening, or if it's significant. (Red highlight means it's out of supply range)\\\n\nI'd recomend starting with the 3 turn Scenario Road to Minsk. It's a quick fix, shows you the basics, but also is complex enough to offer a lot of replayability. With some of the longer scenarios it's easy to get lost and just see a wave of units. With the Minsk scenario you have a difficult objective. Not because the battles are hard, but because you must grab massive quantities of territory on top of conquering the enemy. For an added challenge, try the Soviet side. The game tacticvs change completely.\n\nWhich brings me to the full campaign. The monster that is Barbarossa. For myself it's too big. It's a massive theatre of war that quite frankly is daunting. Check out Grey Hunters Let's Play for a truly epic story. \n\nI'd love to see more scenarious I can tackle in an evening. I'd love to see tooltips to tell me exactly why that unit is highlighted yellow. Or why that attack failed. \n\nThrough all of the detail and interface is an entertaining game.

Well, I played that incredibly short demo that came with other Humongous games, but that was it until I decided to purchase the full game on sale and give it a try. I had a good time playing it (though I wish I could have experienced it as a kid.)\n\nFreddi Fish 1 was Humongous' first game to use hand-drawn animation instead of pixel art, so that's something I admire it for, but that and its age (pre-Windows 95) mean that it isn't as refined or advanced as its sequels, though I like the retro charm it has. The animation and art are generally pretty good. The weak point is probably Freddi and Luther, who look very different here than in later games. They're drawn differently on most screens, usually looking okay, but sometimes very awkward or even terrible (Luther, especially, can look atrocious on some screens.) \n\nOne thing about this game is that it has a sort of sober atmosphere. The music, which is excellent by the way, has some very somber tracks and the graphics tend to be rather dark and muted. The game's premise is also serious: you're on a mission to prevent mass starvation. Of course, there's plenty of bright, cheery characters and fun, colorful animations, so it's not a dark or depression game, but it's definitely the most somber Freddi Fish game. The game also has villains (two bumbling Mafia sharks and the Squidfather) and I hate these characters. A Godfather parody could work in Spy Fox, but it's totally out of place in this series.

They have a tendency to get dull, and while Freddi and Luther are both decently developed, the side characters are not that interesting. This is, of course, coming from a grown-up's perspective; children will no doubt be able to enjoy them more.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent and entertaining game that might not immediately catch your attention, due to the old graphics and sound as well as the unassuming presentation, but when it does you could easily be stuck for hours, just clicking at everything on the screen until another unexpected animation flies across the screen.

I mean, what the hell? Let's just play all the Humongous games!\n\nFreddi Fish has you playing as the titular character, who is a young aspiring fish detective out to help people with their various problems. In this first entry, all the fish in the ocean are literally DYING. I'd say those are some pretty low stakes to set for your first game. \n\nYour grandma had all the fish's supply of kelp (a bit foolish, if you ask me), and it was unfortunately stolen by sharks who would leave clues behind in bottles out in the open for anyone to find. So, the game has you both trying to help fix whatever random problems a fish might have gotten into (trapped in a cage, living in a bright shell, or... using a mandolin as a crutch), as well as tracking down the bottles throughout the ocean floor. It's a nice combination between following clues and solving simple puzzles, that gives the game better flow than something like Putt Putt.\n\nWhat I don't like, however, is the process you have to go through in order to get said bottles. This is still one of the older Humongous games where you can't skip the transition animation between screens, and the puzzles are so simple that the game gets really... really... really dull after a while. It's not unbearable, but it doesn't help the game for being fun, or at least memorable.\n\nThe game also seems to have a bit of a lazy HUD, where Freddi and Luther will actually swim in front of their inventory list on certain screens, as if it's a part of the background. And the aesthetic has me... mixed, at best. I love the backgrounds. The hand-painted screens look wonderful, but all the cartoony, bright fish that swim in it don't fit. Like, at all.\n\nIt's a similar complaint I had with 2015's refuse-worthy children's film \"The Good Dinosaur\". They both have wonderful backgrounds, but the characters that inhabit them are a big contrast from it. I think the backgrounds in this game would be better for a point-and-click horror game for a diver slowly losing oxygen than needs to find his lost submarine. A lot of the backgrounds are dark, intimidating, or ominous in some ways that gave me more of an isolated and suffocating feeling than the feeling of playing a simple kids adventure.\n\nOf course, the voice acting is pretty \"meh\". Freddi and Luther are fine, but with the rest of the characters, it's pretty hit-and-miss. Some memorably terrible voices would be Fiddler Crab, the dumb shark, and the hermit crab. They just sound too overly-cartoonish or just flat-out bad to listen to.\n\nAnd the game's story is pretty weak. You get some kelp to save all the fish in the sea, but the fact that no one cares about the potential starvation, or that the only political impact is just the king being mildly concerned about their ENTIRE FOOD SUPPLY GONE MISSING, seems a little odd to me. I mean, if America lost all of it's supply on food, would the President start a press conference, and open with, \"Well, citizens of America, it seems we have lost all of our food supplies. Don't worry about it, though! There's these two kids that told me they'd find it. So... just go about your own business.\"\n\nAnd some of the fish are inanely stupid, getting stuck in incredibly simple problems. Seriously, Fiddler Crab. How the f*** did you get stuck in that f***ing cage. It's not a crab trap. That is a simple locking cage. Did you accidentally lock yourself in there? In your own cage? And Luther is such a hindrance as a sidekick, it really feels like Freddi is the one going around and fixing everyone's incredibly simple problems, instead of them just going out and actually finding the solutions themselves, if they could just move their g****** legs.\n\nYes, this is a children's game. I know people like to the throw out the \"But it's for kids!\" argument whenever you call something from children's entertainment sh***y, but I pull no punches and I use no excuses for my criticism. If I didn't like something in a game, I didn't f***ing like it. It doesn't matter if it's \"just a kid's game\" or \"just an action game\", and I need to get over myself. It's that mentality that lets horrible entertaiment like Transformers run rampant in the film industry.\n\nSlight rant aside, Freddi Fish is an honestly bad game. It's story was certainly lacking, especially with the tacked-on moral at the end, it's artstyle clashes, and it's puzzles are far too simple (even for its intended audience).

The game features a goldfish named Freddi, and a green guppy, Luther, as they embark on a quest to find her grandmother's treasure chest. This game's art style is very colorful and wacky, while the backdrops illuminate under the shimmering ocean surface. The music definitely gives me that summer vibe as Freddi visits various locations such as a beach, a junkyard, and even a king's castle. There are loads of things to click on in the back ground and foreground. Since this is a game for very small audiences I can imagine that this serves as a simulator for waving one's keys. Aside from that the character's dialogue is very tounge and cheek. I forgot how amusing those mafia sharks were in the cutscenes. The game even has section dedicated to teaching mathematics, which is probably the reason I'm so good with math now! All in all, Freddi Fish is a cute, fun exploration game, but would not recommend to an audience who never grew up with any of these games.

While there, she learns that her grandma's kelp seeds have been stolen! Freddi sets out with her best friend Luther to find the culprits and restore the seeds to their rightful owner.\n\n[b] The Gameplay [/b]\n\nFFaTCotMKS is a point and click game designed for younger children. The resulting gameplay is simplistic but intuitive. Puzzles tend to fall into the [i] use this to do this [/i] category, which is fine. I completed the game in about 40 minutes, but I expect it to take a bit longer if you choose to explore the areas more thoroughly. I liked it, though it may not be enjoyable for everyone. It is very easy, after all.\n\n[b] The Characters [/b]\n\nFreddi is a very brave and conscientious role model for children. She pays proper respect to her elders and does her best to set things right. I found it very difficult to be interested in Luther, however. He barely helps beyond asking meaningless questions and is seemingly only after the kelp seeds for his own benefit (despite being reprimanded by Freddi several times). However, his antics make him an interesting foil to Freddi and her grounded disposition. Still, he felt unnecessary and I personally didn't like having him around.\n\nThe side characters give the game an atmospheric quality that I enjoyed as a child and continue to enjoy as an adult. Their colorful personalities are memorable beyond the confines of their limited time on screen. Interactions with them are simple and genuine, and an enjoyable aspect of the experience. I chuckled a few times at the villains' dialogue, especially.\n\n[b] The Setting [/b]\n\nFFaTCotMKS takes place underwater. It appears to be the ocean, but it could be a sea or some other large body of water, as it is never explicitly stated.\n\nI liked the variety inherent in the different environments. The world is well populated and immersive, and there are a TON of things to click on in every screen of the game. Colorful little creatures bounce around, a starfish teaches you basic math, pearls shine and an opera fish performs a solo. It's worth exploring every inch just to see what crazy thing will happen next! These fun little events are synonymous with Humongous Entertainment's early point and click offerings, and they help bring the world to life.\n\n[b] The Graphics [/b]\n\nThe game has a very charming, almost handdrawn look to it (forgive me if the art actually IS handdrawn, I'm not very proficient at spotting the difference). The graphics are endearing and vibrant while simultaneously giving off the look of a cartoon. It's fun to look at and even runs in widescreen!\n\nCharacter designs themselves aren't incredibly impressive, but their personalities more than make up for any obvious deficiencies.\n\n[b] The Sound [/b]\n\nThe music is serviceable and ambient, but not very memorable. The sound effects, on the other hand, are abuzz with life. You'll recognize many reused sound effects if you've played any other Humongous Entertainment games, and I guarantee they'll put a smile on your face.\n\n[h1] The Verdict [/h1]\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds. It's chock-full of educational and humorous content for younger minds. It looks and feels like an interactive animated television show, it has a strong identity and an altruistic endgame, but, most of all, it does exactly what it sets out to do: provide a meaningful experience. I think it's definitely worth a buy, though I'd recommend purchasing a reduced price. 7 dollars might be too much to some people for the amount of content you're provided.\n\nI give Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds [u]9.5 out of 10[/u] purple sea urchins.", "timestamp_created": 1454827688, "timestamp_updated": 1454869616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.955446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20879248": {"recommendationid": "20879248", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975080813", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464352139}, "language": "english", "review": "Exactly how I remember it.

While the game can be completed in only an hour, It's one of the most nostalgic hours of my life. But, a review isn't based on nostalgia alone. Let us talk about the actual game. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nStory wise, Grandma Grouper has lost her Kelp Seeds, which she shares to feed all undersea life. You are Freddi, and with the help of your best friend, Luther, you are tasked with finding the lost 'treasure'. But watch out! The Squid Father and his shark goons are also after the seeds! Talking to, helping, and interacting with the undersea life is the only way to reach your goal, but you better hurry! \n\nWhile a simple kids story, this game does it exceptionally well. I never once felt interaction was forced. Everyone seemed to know Freddi in some way or another, but that doesn't de-value the interaction. While I did beat the game, I didn't obtain enough sea-urchins to enter the undersea volcano, which will send me back one day to find out its mysteries. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game plays as you would expect a point-and-click game to play. While you move around the world, you are set to be in one area, while finding things around the world to interact with. It plays fantastically, but at times, the object you are looking for may be too well hidden, and blends into the background a little too easily. \n\n[h1]Voice Acting[/h1] \nThis is possibly the [b]major fault[/b] with the game. While some people are voiced decently (The Eel, Stingray, Pirate), others seem like a very odd choice. For example, giving the Crab a French accent is a little weird, and at times, Freddi would sound disinterested in what is happening. While this isn't such a huge deal, it still takes it out of the experience. \n[i]I PERSONALLY[/i] give it a pass, solely on the reason this is a childrens game built in 1994. And not just a childrens game, a [b]young[/b] childrens game. I just let it pass, but it is a negative point. \n\n[h1]OVERALL SCORE[/h1]\nFreddi fish is an awesome game, more so for children and the nostalgic. With a good story, math and mini-games, it's awesome to help a developing mind along. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th][b]STORY[/b][/th]\n        [th]7/10[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td][b]GAMEPLAY[/b][/td]\n        [td]8/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td][b]VOICE ACTORS[/b][/td]\n        [td]4/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td][h1]OVERALL[/h1][/td]\n        [td]7/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nYes, it has it's problems, as all games do, but it handles them well, and keeps the whole experience enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1439927323, "timestamp_updated": 1439951911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17246208": {"recommendationid": "17246208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075332849", "num_games_owned": 769, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437973703}, "language": "english", "review": "Freddi Fishes 10/10 right in the childhood\n100% no kill run.", "timestamp_created": 1437973939, "timestamp_updated": 1437977837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.747272", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17240498": {"recommendationid": "17240498", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998933737", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437940159}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this with my son today, a fun classic that was perfect as his first adventure game.

I decided to venture into the depths of the ocean once again to revisit a happy part of my childhood, and dare I say it was quite awesome.\n\nBeing a mystery adventure game there are of course puzzles that are quite simple and not exactly challanging. It took me one hour to complete this game and that's because I took my sweet time to interact with everything and have a nostalgia overload. The puzzles mainly consist of you talking to different sea creatures and desiphering their clues. The dialoges are charming and well written, and it never feels like a chore to talk to anyone. There are also some special features in this game that is quite classic with older adventure games. For one thing you can interact with everything. If there is a rock  somewhere on the level you can click it and a small crab orchester begins to play, or a shark dances for you, or a hula dancer takes the rock and does indescribable things to it. \n\n\nI recommend this game for those of you that played this as a child and want to have a rush of nostalgia visit for approximately an hour. It's one of the games that still live up to its name despite you being 20 years older and isn't just tedious with bad humour and lousy gameplay.

Tycker att det \u00e4r ett roligt spel f\u00f6r barn,  med p\u00e5hittiga karakt\u00e4rer och uppdrag. Huvudkarakt\u00e4ren \u00e4r en tjej, vilket \u00e4r en nice omv\u00e4xling, \u00e4ven om det inte l\u00e4ggs s\u00e5 stor vikt vid det (vilket \u00e4r bra!). R\u00f6stsk\u00e5despelet \u00e4r bra och milj\u00f6erna \u00e4r fint gjorda. Mitt favoritst\u00e4lle som liten var teatern d\u00e4r de hade lagt mycket energi p\u00e5 att ha flera olika sm\u00e5 upptr\u00e4danden :) Det som jag tycker \u00e4r negativt \u00e4r kanske matematikl\u00e4raren. Det k\u00e4ndes bara random och att det inte \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndigt att l\u00e4ra barnen \u00e4mneskunskaper i varje spel de spelar bara f\u00f6r att.

I beat the game in 48 mins because i had a mouse problem and i just had to switch it to window mode (alt+enter). It was nice to finally go back a play one of the games I played from my childhood.

The dialogue is unparalleled by it's sheer insightfulness, and it really encourages critical thinking about the bigger picture in this heinous and deplorable crime: Who really took the kelp seeds? What was their motive? And why kelp?\n\nAs you delve deeper into the dark underworld that Freddi Fish inhabits, you discover that all is not what it seems. If you truly want to solve this despairing crime, you slowly come to realise that you will have to deal with some colourful characters to get to the answers you need. Freddi is forced to strike a deal with a brothel owner, where in exchange for information about the suspect he so desperately requires, he must quietly drop another investigation examining the extent of underground (or should I say underwater) prostitution rings.\n\nThis new 'pearl' of information leads Freddi on a spiral of depravity involving local mafia hitmen, a retired cop who's out for revenge, and a vast network of organised fish trafficking. You follow Freddi through all these events, and you are with him even when his partner is executed right before his eyes. From there you watch him slowly derail, turning to alcohol and heroin abuse to keep him sustained. You know he doesn't sleep anymore. His bloodshot eyes stare blankly each night. You are not privy to his thoughts, which is a fortunate thing indeed. You would not want to see his thoughts. It is evident that he is merely a husk of the fish he used to be. But through all this, a faint lingering motivation remains. He still feels duty-bound to complete his investigation. To find out why the kelp seeds are missing. It is the one thing he has left to drive him.\n\nSo, out of the darkness of the soul, a monster emerges. A fish who has no boundaries. A fish who no longer cares about the law. A fish that only cares about the truth. And he's not afraid of breaking a few fins to get it.\n\nNa\u00efve to the despicable nature of the underworld no longer, Freddi tirelessly pieces together clues to this abhorrent crime. Other fish soon grow to fear the monster he had become, and he gained a reputation for having an incredibly short temper during 'private conversations'. Many would walk away from these 'conversations' with fewer limbs than they begun with. \n\nBut something was nagging at Freddi Fish. Although he did not hesitate to relieve victims of their body parts, he still felt a pang of guilt every time that he did. His fins would shake as he sat in dimly lit bars and drank himself to death. The other fish saw it too. They saw what he refused to acknowledge. They saw a broken fish, living on booze and hookers. Eventually, Freddi saw it too. He saw what his life had become. Utterly meaningless. Insignificant. What happened to the na\u00efve, happy Freddi? What happened to the Freddi who formed a career fighting crime, fighting delinquients just like the one he had become? What happened? Tears began to flow down his scales, as he realised what he had become.\n\nThe old Freddi was gone. \nAnd, one massive heroin overdose later, the new Freddi was gone too.\n\n\"And if thou gaze long into the abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.\"", "timestamp_created": 1519390390, "timestamp_updated": 1519522914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40168707": {"recommendationid": "40168707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367738248", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518898451}, "language": "french", "review": "C'est un jeu que j'ai ador\u00e9 dans mon enfance et qui a tr\u00e8s bien vieilli.\n\nSeulement, c'est version ne contient pas de menu, pas de sauvegarde, le pointeur est tr\u00e8s sensible et va tr\u00e8s mal.

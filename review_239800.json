There's only 7 main bosses and they're all very quick. In around 2 hours I completed the game twice (once on normal and another on very hard).\n\nI really like the movement in this game. You can \"dash\" in any direction 3 times. You can also slow down time with an energy bar that refills over time. This creates multiple intense moments in the game which is awesome. Slowing down time and then dashing in order to escape multiple bullets in a tight area feels awesome. \n\nThe bosses are all unique and well done as well. I particularly like the last stage, where it's a mega man style boss rush at the end. However, you face TWO of the same bosses at the same type (e.g. instead of 1 blob, you face 2). When I initially saw this I thought it was insane because the other bosses were no pushovers. However, to my surprise I only had a mildly difficult time with facing 2 at the same time. This goes to show that I really mastered the mechanics/bosses of the game, which created a nice sense of achievement. It also helped that these duplicates had less health than the originals :P.\n\nThe story is just a funny little thing thrown in. You're a girl who wants to be a the #1 hero, so she decided to KILL all the other heroes\u2026.. Then someone ELSE takes the credit, the girl beats him up, and the whole world thanks her because they HATE the guy cause they think he killed the heroes\u2026\u2026 lol what the hell xD. Like I said, it's funny. Nothing deep, but funny.\n\nUnfortunately, this game didn't AMAZE me. I found this really strange considering that I love Cuphead. After thinking on it for a while, I realized it was due to 2 things.\n\n\t1. The game is really short, so you don\u2019t have the time to really MASTER the mechanics. You have time to get good at them but that's about it. When it takes only 1 hour to beat the entire game, that's understandable. This significantly diminishes the feeling of achievement you get from beating the game/bosses.\n\t2. This game is Cuphead Expert levels of speed, sometimes more, but the game doesn't require you to be all that good. That's because the game gives you plenty of health to make multiple mistakes. This caused me to quickly give up on trying to master certain sections because the speed of the game was just so damn high. The game did nothing to slowly grow me into the fast pace, so I often found myself \"cheating\". E.g. Sometimes I just dashed through an obstacle even if it cost me some health or to give up trying to dodge a boss's attack just so I keep shooting the boss and get more damage in. In Cuphead, I would freaking restart the level if I took 1 hit. That's because Cuphead did an excellent job of telegraphing all the moves and making everything feel \"difficult but fair\". This game just didn't hit the same sweet spot.\n\nRegardless, this was a fun game. I genuinely enjoyed beating all of the stages.", "timestamp_created": 1515908603, "timestamp_updated": 1515908603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39116764": {"recommendationid": "39116764", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984478327", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392292783}, "language": "english", "review": "Sick game.

The story is cute and all but doesn't really work with anything in the game besides 2 bosses and honestly it does detract from the game. If I think what my character is doing is stupid than I'm going to think the game is stupid. The visuals are fine but nothing has much depth to it. You can tell what's what but it's not pretty to look at it. The sound and music is great though with different audio cues for every action it seemed and plenty of tracks so the music doesn't get dull. The main story can be done in an hour but with different difficulties, challenges, and play styles this really adds to the replayability. The only problem with the gameplay is that there doesn't seem any use for some of the weapons over others and some unlockable weapons make previous weapons completely useless. I get you have to beat the game to use them but you can then use those weapons to help you beat the game on a higher difficulty so it just seems a little broken.

I'll start with the cons. My major \"complaint\" is how hard it was for me to get used to the mechanics, three dash-jumps from start + slowmo was a lot to get used to, and if you're like me and decide to start the game on hard you're probably not gonna have a great time on the first level... And that first level is 1/7 of the game, which takes me to the next point: the game is really short, like, 40 minutes short, it ends when you're finally getting the hang of the controls.  \nNow, the reason I find hard to review this is cause those cons are also pros. The game is short, but no two parts are the same and every section in every level is filled up with new content and mechanics. The controls feel weird at first but HOLY SHIT it's awesome to use the slow-mo to dodge two bullets, change weapon in mid air to hit that third one with the katana, make a few wall jumps get height and dash above those enemies, change to rocket launcher again without even touching the ground once and... You get it, it's fun. \nTo me, what makes the game is its replayability, and I'm sad cause I know not many people are into that. Each level has 4 difficulties with actual variations in them (different boss patterns, enemy placement, etc), and if you think finishing a level is fun, try finishing a level on v. hard without dying. It feels so rewarding when you know the layout and just how to use your abilities properly.  \nThis review is already a mess and I haven't mentioned most of the stuff, so: graphics look cool, music is fine, story is almost non existent (still charming and the two dialogues are... good, I guess?) and everything feels made up with so much love. When you die, for example, Wryn says different stuff in different stages, that alone shows you how much attention they put into this little game.  \nCurrently I have just a few hours, but I *WILL* finish everything on v. hard.\nTL;DR: the game gets its awesomeness from replaying and learning the stages, so if that's not your thing, it's probably just gonna have twenty minutes of gameplay.",

It is intended to be beatable in a single sitting (though it is not required) It is probably about as long as the games it is intended to resemble. \nI have yet to play the coop mode, but i do like that it is available.\nOne reviewer complained about the twin-stick controls on the platformer being bad.  I did find it a bit easier to use WSAD and the mouse, despite twin-stick shooting in a platformer being a factor originally drawing me to the game.  Either way it is fun and well done.\nGraphics are retro in a good way.  The pixelation is definitely done to cater to the style, not to cater to laziness; the art is well detailed. For me the biggest downfall would be the title is a bit similar to another indie platformer. The plot is a bit contrived, but amusing and sufficient.  Maybe you require more \"reason\" to go around committing wonton acts of violence, but I feel this game is more about gameplay rather than the game's story, and it got gameplay right. It certainly was more fun that you just had reading my review.\nIf you are considering the cost, I prefer quality over quantity.  It isn't very expensive, and is certainly long enough. But if you must be cheap--i totally get it. i also want to buy more games that i wont play--click that wishlist button and wait for the next steam sale, but once you get it you'll be sorry you waited so long.

It's a fast-paced 2D platformer/shooter with a large focus on boss battles.\n\nThe controls are precise, fluid and simple with the choice between keyboard controls and gamepad controllers (the XBOX 360 controller apparantly has official support, but I only used keyboard controls myself).\n\nThe difficulty is challenging but fair, although I've only played on the normal difficulty so far so I can't comment on the higher levels. I died a few times, but it wasn't frustrating because checkpoints are very frequent and I could get back to the game pretty quickly. Everytime I redid a section or boss I did better as I got better and learnt their moves. Every victory felt earned rather than just handed to me.\n\nThe story is barely there, you play as Wryn (I think that's how to spell it) who is disgusted by the heros of old, who have grown complacent and corrupt over time. She decides she will kill them and show everyone what a real hero is meant to be. It's a bare-bones plot, but it provides some context for the game I guess. It doesn't intrude on the gameplay and you can skip it without missing much.\n\nThe games art is something I can easily see people dismissing it over. Wryn herself looks like something from a young teenager's deviantart. It's simple and stylised and maybe not in a good way. Personally I don't mind it and the game is so quick-paced that I'm never focusing too much on any thing except bosses which tend to be the nicest looking things in the game.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, the game is very short. How short? I beat the story in an hour on the normal difficulty. While it might be short, the game uses this well as it's packed full of action and is never slow or boring. It's a quick, fun experience you can keep coming back to or replay over and over trying to get a better time or score.\n\nI would very much reccommend this game, if you're still on the fence wait for it to go on sale.

Espero que este an\u00e1lisis te ayude en si vas a comprarte el juego o no (compralo) y que abajo del todo dejo un resumen que sirve como conclusion del an\u00e1lisis completo (en serio COMPRALO YA!!!)\n\n\nBleed! Que significa.... umm... \u00bfsangr\u00f3? \u00bfsangrado? DA IGUAL! (result\u00f3 que significa sangrar, gracias traductor de google :D)\nLo que s\u00ed importa es que este es un juego (vaya, no me digas) de acci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida y divertida con un estilo muy a lo arcade y con un poco de plataformeo.\n\nVoy a mencionar las cosas que me parecen m\u00e1s importantes de este juego, que son:\n\nCONTROLES - BOSSES - NIVELES - REJUGABILIDAD\n\nCONTROLES: Bleed como supone ser un juego de acci\u00f3n R\u00c1PIDA tiene unos controles excelentes. \nTienes un salto comun (como en cualquier juego de plataformas) y cuando estas en el aire puedes hacer 3 dashes con los que puedes maniobrar perfectamente a donde quieres ir y que combina perfectamente con la habilidad para RALENTIZAR EL TIEMPO, la cual es increiblemente util y divertido usarla con los BOSSES (pero de eso toca hablar despues). Est\u00e1 buenisimo el esquivar en el aire todas las balas cual ninja en c\u00e1mara lenta. \n\nBOSSES: Increible!! Aunque el juego mas o menos dura entre 1 hora y hora y media, hay MUCHOS bosses, buenisimos y variados, desde pelear en un edificio contra un helicoptero hasta pelear contra un robot mantis gigante en un tren en movimiento. Y no solo eso, tambien le dan muy buen uso a la habilidad para RALENTIZAR EL P*TO TIEMPO hay ataques que solo los puedes... este... LITERALMENTE VER solo con esa habilidad y otro boss que es super r\u00e1pido si usas la habilidad para RALENTIZAR EL PINCHE TIEMPO lo puedes ver y el boss aparece ah\u00ed mirandote y tu intentando esquivar las balas mientras le disparas y... A QUE EST\u00c1 BUENO EL JUEGO???\n\nNIVELES: Muy buenos! Aunque no sean la gran cosa, cada nivel te bombardea con nuevas mecanicas para que NO dejes de jugar hasta terminar el juego. (como esta parte del an\u00e1lisis qued\u00f3 muy corta voy a alargarla un poco m\u00e1s poniendo este par\u00e9ntesis de relleno :D)\n\nREJUGABILIDAD: Este juego al ser muy corto se basa en... pues la palabra lo dice todo, jugarlo una y otra vez.\nHay 4 dificultades (Facil-Normal-Dificil-Muy Dificil) y dependiendo de cual elijas abran M\u00c1S o MENOS enemigos y ser\u00e1n M\u00c1S o MENOS agresivos. En vez de como en otros juegos, que los enemigos simplemente hagan m\u00e1s da\u00f1o y ya. Y los jefes en dificil son BUE-NI-SI-MOS!!\n\nAunque si, el juego tiene algunos errores como por ejemplo el tener que comprar mejoras y armas, lo cual te obliga a empezar en dificultades menores y farmear un poco si necesitas un arma especifica (como la katana ninja!!!) para matar a un boss en dificultad dificil o muy dificil aunque seas un PROASO COMO YO!! \n\nRESUMEN: Si est\u00e1s buscando un juego de acci\u00f3n pura y dura, que ponga a prueba tu habilidad y reflejos, al cual jugar una y otra y OTRA y OTRA VEZ!!! sin importarte el que terminarlo la primera vez solo dure poco m\u00e1s de 1 hora RECOMENDADISIMO!!! \n\nPD: Tambien hay un Bleed 2 juegalo tambien :D\nAH! y por cierto dame pulgar arriba que cuesta menos tiempo que pasarte este juego :D", "timestamp_created": 1486480149, "timestamp_updated": 1500260845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29759616": {"recommendationid": "29759616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043429943", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486817145}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

However, the game needs somewhat precise aiming, more than the right stick on a 360 pad can really offer.\n\nSo then there's kb/m controls which are similar to Hotline: Miami in that your character shoots at your cursor, regardless of screen position.

You can play the insanely difficult 1 life for the enitre game mode if you want, but I think you have to beat the game first.  You almost certainly want to use a game controller to play this.  I'd guess it's frustrating without one.\n\nThe downside, it's got no voice acting if you really care, but the main thing is that it's short.  Really short.  Really, really short.  I beat the game and played a few challenges in 2 hours.  For the full price, it's really only worth it if you're the type who likes to play a good mechanic repeatedly on a few bosses and characters to become perfect.

It could make Bleed even more popular, but I don't think it's some kind of unknown indie game.

I've had the demo for several years, and I absolutely loved it, but I was completely unaware that the full game was available(in all honesty that may just be because the demo only offered so much, and I eventually forgot about it).\n\nPROS\n-The controls are solid, though you may have better luck with a gamepad than a keyboard. Wryn's moveset, as basic as it is, offers a lot of maneuverability once you practice enough. The gun(s) are delightfully diverse between each, and since you can carry two at once, you won't need to switch very often. If you do need to switch, however, the devs threw in a 'Change Weapon' option in the pause menu.\n-The soundtrack, while not the best I've ever heard, is still absolutely wonderful, and I can't help but get pumped up whenever I hear it.\n-The enemy designs are just delightful, and fit each stage well.\n-The level design is equally as good, requiring skill, but still being forgiving enough to let you fix your mistakes.\n-The bosses are ridiculously fun, diverse in design, and challenge the player every single second of the fight.\n\nCONS\n-The art. While I'm a sucker for old-school pixel games, this one looks like it was made with MS Paint. I personally don't mind it too much, but it definitely slips into uncanny at points.\n\nBEFORE YOU BUY\n-It's difficult, to the point where even Normal is enough to kill you in a matter of minutes. This game requires practice, practice, practice. Expect to die a lot.\n-This may just be me being awful at the game, but stages do not give you many points unless you explicitly choose to play them on Hard or Very Hard. In most cases this wouldn't be a problem, and it would make sense, but considering the previous point...yeah, it gets kind of brutal and grindy, especially if you want to max out your upgrades/purchase all of the weapons. (Spoiler warning: You want to max out your upgrades for the later stages, because they are BRUTAL)\n-This game is SHORT. I beat it on Normal in about 3 hours.

There is a lot of variety in the ways you utilize the mechanics, the encounters are well planned and each level gives a distinct experience, with a smooth increase in difficulty.\n\nThe bosses are the greatest part for me, though. Each one is different and interesting, and finding the weapons that would work best and how to react to the patterns was a great experience.

Though it's nice that you can go back to previous stages in a higher difficulty (hard, very hard, and these will make you suffer) to farm a bit for some upgrades.\n\nAlso, on higher difficulties, some parts are almost bullet hell like, when they're throwing a crazy amount of bullets at you, and the only way you can possibly dodge is by slowing down time, but still, the curtains are very dense (for those who understand danmaku terms).\n\nEven though I still haven't finished it, I definitely recommend it. I love the challenge, it's the kind of game that gets you actually talking to yourself as you play, and spontaneously swearing when you die.

Bleed is a fine game the graphics are fun the soundtrack is perfect for the game and the soundeffects are brutal.(in the good way) But if you couldn't tell by the trailer the real shine is the bossses. Bleed has 10 bosses each one different from the last and ALL the bosses in this ggame are uniqe not just from eachother but from any bosses  i've ever seen. It has the basic types of bosses like the snake kind and the robot and giant glob one but they are different from thw ones in other games. The story has potential but such a big story does not blend well with sauch a small game. Overall i give bleed a 76/100. BIAS REVIEW: This game is sooooo fun i loved it the graphics the music the bosses everything the story was meh but the gameplay makes up for it my favorite boss was bunny rockett I love this game it took me sooooooo long to beat it on very hard mode but it was NOT worth it all the unlockable characters suck but I guess thats ok I still give this game a 76/100.", "timestamp_created": 1458160858,

Thank you for this game. It brought old school and modern gaming together in a perect mix. All I had to was look at the title screen and I was in love with the main character, which I can only describe as a female version of Barry Steakfries (Jetpack Joyride), Wyrn. Buy the Game.

The gameplay was frustrating at first, especially with the combination of the right trigger to jump and the right stick to shoot, but after a little while the controls began to feel just right. Having the left trigger's bullet time compliment the right trigger's multi-jump was definitely a good move on the part of the developer.\n\nIn addition, there's reason to play the smallish number of levels over and over again when you earn points that can be spent on health and bullet time upgrades as well as new weapons. And the greater the difficulty setting, the greater the points you earn. So there's every reason to want to complete each stage on V. Hard.

It is literally 6 levels [spoiler]technically 7 but the last level is just a combination of the first 6[/spoiler] and they are all very short. They can probably be completed in about 10 minutes on your first try, on easy mode, if you aren't used to this sort of game. But once you have finished them, there are a bunch of upgrades to unlock. However, you can only unlock them by replaying the levels over and over. The different difficulties don't  change the way the enemies behave so not even that will increase the replayability. So that is the biggest issue with the game, and it can put a lot of people off if a game is too short.\n\nThe second issue I have with the game is that the controls are weird. On controller, it's very difficult to aim since it's a twin stick shooter platformer but on keyboard it is more difficult to actually aim in all directions at once, and you will need to aim in all directions at once with the amount of enemies that spawn. The triple jump mechanic is interesting and if you pull off cool dodges with it then it feels satisfying but it does have its downsides that make it a little unresponsive sometimes.\n\nThe story is pretty lame so don't come to this game for a story and the artstyle is typical pixel art and doesn't detract from the game for me but it doesn't do anything special. The same goes for the music in the game.\n\nThose were my main issues with the game. If you can get past those then you should try this game. It is really fun and intense.

And is it good? Well, yeah! Just read this review to find out exactly why!\n\nThis game is good, there's no denying it. And I'm not just gonna sit here and say \"yeah the game's good, get it\". Because that would be scummy of me. I'm going to start with the basics of the game and then move on to talk about the art and controls. Each will have quite a bit to talk about, so be prepared for that.\n\nSo, as for the basics of this game, Bleed is a fast-paced, frantic platformer. As you run around the levels you will encounter many beasts and ghouls, all of which unique to the level. When I say unique, I mean that each enemy is never really shown again in the same level. To put it simply, the sprites are never lazily thrown around as if the game doesn't matter, it's obvious that the devs of this game have put a lot of thought and effort into the actual design of the levels and the enemies, which pays off in the end.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it's, as I've said before, fast-paced and frantic. This is further enforced by the side-scrolling element which is tossed in. You advance in each level by either scaling upwards or downwards and running from place to place. As to be expected in a side-scroller, I suppose. Whilst also talking about gameplay, I think I should talk about the biggest mechanic in the game. Time slowing. How it works is, you hold down your RMB (Right Mouse Button) and it slows down time. This is extremely helpful and in most situations extremely vital to your safety and ability to live.\n\nOne thing that I ADORE in this game is the amount of weapons. From a Shotgun to even a Katana, each weapon is unique and will help you in it's own way. Some enemies are best tailored to certain weapons and some can be destroyed with all types. This shows a sign of a good game when the player has multiple choices as to what they want to use to defeat certain enemies, meanwhile challenging themself to try it with harder or lesser used weapons.\n\nFeeling like the game could just a little bit of \"OOMPH\"? How about you ramp up the difficulty with the different difficulty options! Each option is still hard in it's own right, so you don't have to worry about picking a difficulty and thinking that you're forced to play it for the rest of the game, whilst steamrolling the game.\n\nIf anything, I could say that this game is honestly one of the hardest games I've ever played. And I would be telling the truth 100%. This game is tough as nails, but I still find myself yearning to play it just knowing that I could beat the game in a harder difficulty, or even just play with a whole different weapon choice. Even once you've beaten the main game, Arcade Mode will have you coming back for more. Arcade Mode is honestly harder than Campaign mode for one simple reason; You have to beat the game with one life. Yeah, I know, hell. It's amazing fun all the same, and if you make a mistake you can remember it for the next time you play!\n\nEnough about my undying, adoring love of the gameplay itself and onto my undying love of the art of this game. Yeah, okay the game is pixelated and that's totally fine! There's nothing wrong with pixel art when done RIGHT. And boy oh boy did this game do it right. \n\nFirstly, you should note how gorgeous the sceneary is in this game. The backdrops are so well done and show an obvious amount of time and detail which has been poured into it. Each character and enemy alike are so well done that you can find yourself staring at how brilliant the sprites actually are.\n\nWeapon art is done incredibly well, each weapon differing from the other and allowing you to actually see how different the weapons are from one another.\n\nAlright, onto the final stretch, trust me.\n\nThe music in this game is brillant. It's amazingly upbeat and cheerful and can make you just want to buy the OST for friends upon friends.\n\nNow, for the bit I've been waiting to talk about for quite a while. The places where this game kinda falls short.\n\nOkay, look. This game isn't perfect but that doesn't take away from how good the game actually is, so take these little nitpicks with a grain of salt.\n\nThe controls:\n - There's a damn good reason I didn't put the controls in something that I enjoy. It's because I don't really like the controls with this game when using keyboard. Controller, as recommended by many, many other reviewers, is totally agreed with by me. I mean, don't get me wrong, the game is 100% playable with mouse and keyboard, but it's just a bit rough. For me, at least.\nAchievements:\n - Some achievements feel super, super, hard to get. I'm all for a tough achievement but I don't like games that have achievements which make me curse the game itself.\n\nApart from that, everything else in this game is pretty great!\n\n\n\n\n[b]Enjoy the review?

She sets out to beat all the previous heroes of the old times. Her super powers? Bullet time and excessive amounts of fire power.\n\nRetro in looks, the game is set in the vague year 21XX and the graphics are reminiscent of 16-bit era. It works in [i]Bleed[/i]'s favour as the silly and colourful enemies and bosses have a refreshingly distinctive look to them. The soundtrack is plainly awesome. I love how the tracks have been carefully chosen to fit all scenarios; especially the last level's soundtrack was simply intense.\n\nWith colourful artwork come the silly looking enemies. Cats and flying ooze blops litter the levels. The bosses include worms, a slug and a dragon among other silly things. While the common enemies are simple and predictable, all bosses have at least three special attack patterns that get faster and more intensive the higher the difficulty setting becomes.\n\n[h1]Legacy of Max Payne and Matrix[/h1]\n\nThe fast-paced gameplay of gunslinging and attacks coming from all directions at once is alleviated by Wryn's super power: she can slow down time at will (or at the click of a button). Bullet time renders many impossible looking situations manageable, even easy, but the twist is that the bullet time energy is limited and replenishes only when not used. Wryn can do three consequential dives in the air (like double jumps but better), a feat that becomes really useful when dodging attacks while using bullet time.\n\nThere are nine different weapons to try, two to start with and the rest to unlock through experience (gained by winning levels or challenges) and beating levels. You start with dual pistols and rocket launcher, and since there are no reloads it's rather common to just run through a level with the fire button down all the way.\n\nOne can buy e.g. a flamethrower, a sniper laser rifle and a sword that can be used to ricochet bullets back at enemies. All weapons are unique and useful in their own way but some require more practice than others. You can only equip two weapons at a time, which is a bummer since often you'd like to use 3 different ones in a given boss fight. Though weapons can be changed by going to escape menu, it's still a break in the flow that is bad in a fast-paced game like this.\n\nI played [i]Bleed[/i] without problems using keyboard and mouse but controller is recommended (I have one but I still preferred K+M). Controller enables more accurate dodges and movement while mouse allows more accurate targeting so both are totally viable settings. At least one controller is required to play local co-op, which I sadly didn't get to try out.\n\n[h1]Challenging but not Nintendo-hard[/h1]\n\nMastering bullet time, dodging and useful weapon combinations are the key to winning the boss battles and especially when playing through the Arcade Mode where you also have to manage the combometer (for highscores and for certain weapons), done by hitting enemies and not getting hit yourself.\n\n[i]Bleed[/i] has seven levels that can in principle be beaten in an hour or so but the four difficulty levels add a lot to replayability unless you just started out to torture yourself through it with the Very Hard mode.\n\nWhile in Story Mode there are check points and you can play any section as often as you wish, the Arcade Mode makes you play through the game without a single death. As your health bar does not get replenished between levels this puts [i]Bleed[/i] into the category for extremely difficult games to complete 100%. Nevertheless it is almost completely fair, so you know every mistake is your own.\n\nI needed tens of tries to survive through Hard and Very Hard difficulties in Arcade Mode but it felt very satisfactory once I did it. As such take my 21 hours to 100% completion with a grain of salt - it could take you a bit less time if you were good or very much more to 100% [i]Bleed[/i] depending on your skills. You might even find it to be nearly impossible.

While a limited 'bullet time' power has been explored time and time again by games of many different genres, I don't honestly think I've ever seen it implemented as cleanly and effectively as in Bleed. The game allows you up to three mid-air dashes, which can be performed in any direction and steered to a very precised degree. Normally the high speed and intensity of the game's action makes it difficult to properly utilise this mechanic to avoid the almost bullet-hell like hazards of each level, but that's where the bullet time comes in. Each level is, in addition to being very creative, extremely well suited to testing your ability to find the perfect moment to slow down time and use your air dashes to carefully weave in and out of obstacles, all while trying to deal maximum damage to the enemies in your way with a variety of weapons.\nIn addition to the well crafted levels, each boss is highly unique and a tonne of fun to fight. You're unlikely to beat any of them on your first try, but none of them ever feel unfair or cheap. \n\nMy only complaints about the game are in the nitpicky details. I'm personally not a fan of spritework with coloured outlines, as I think it gives too much of a pillow-shade look to the characters. I can't say anything from the soundtrack sticks out as particularly memorable either. Generally speaking the weapon balance was a little off, with some of the unlockable weapons being downright useless, and most were just generally worse or less universally appropriate than the  default loadout, so you'll unfortunately probably go through most of the game without bothering to switch out. \n\nOverall though I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone who into difficult games that require quick thinking and precise movements and aiming. I've already enjoyed Bleed more than enough for my money's worth after two full playthroughs (first on hard and then on very hard), and I absolutely plan to go back and try and get an S-rank on each boss!", "timestamp_created": 1449518972, "timestamp_updated": 1449518972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19543442": {"recommendationid": "19543442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074618214", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420998864}, "language": "french", "review": "Jeu sympas, bon d\u00e9fouloir.", "timestamp_created": 1449475929, "timestamp_updated": 1449475929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19505013": {"recommendationid": "19505013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027343237", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449323690}, "language": "english", "review": "Played with a controller.\n\nWeird controls, probably allows for some cool gameplay after you get used to it but the story mode is too short to really get the hang of it.

Now to the nitty-gritty stuff:\n\nPROS\n\n- Great game mechanic\n- Controls are on point\n- Unique and new play style make it all the more fun\n- Awesome 8-bit (I think) graphics\n- Pretty good story\n- Terrific jumping and gunning system\n- Fast-moving, fluid movement that feels good\n- Overall good layout in general\n- Soundtrack is amazing\n\nCONS\n\n- Definitely too short\n- Does not have enough replayability (the sense of replayability comes from beating each level on one of four difficulties)\n- Weapon mechanics are WAY unbalanced (the Dual Pistols are, in most situations, the best)\n- Should have had more 'meat' to its bones (as I said, more levels, as well as possibly a more extensive shop and upgrades system)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAn overall great game. It nails the 8-bit (I think) graphic style and layout. The control style is one of the best and most obscure I have seen. The other character variations and modes are not overly appealing to come back to. Main things to work on is game content, as I completed the initial game in just under three hours.\n\nDefinitely a great buy!", "timestamp_created": 1448793423, "timestamp_updated": 1448793865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19348947": {"recommendationid": "19348947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097305053", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484923997}, "language": "spanish", "review": "O.o que juego mas hermoso, al principio cuesta acostumbrarce a la jugabilidad pero a la larga te acostumbras y queda todo   \nmuy bonito en pantalla. lo recomiendo, ademas si que es dificil", "timestamp_created": 1448753595, "timestamp_updated": 1448753595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19344619": {"recommendationid": "19344619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170886969", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448732462}, "language": "english", "review": "I was able to finish the game in little over an hour, and it didn't put up much of a fight.

(Even on easy)\n\n\n[h1]So Bleed[/h1]\nMy first heard about this game through YouTube. The Let's Player bumbled through the game, complementing it overall, and I thought \"Hey, this is a pretty cool looking game! I'll put it in my wish list and maybe pick it up later.\"\n\nSo it sat in my wish list for awhile, and then I got a coupon [spoiler]something like 75%[/spoiler] for it and bought it, to which it sat around in my library for awhile.\n\nAnd then it happened:\n\"You know, I'm really bored with all the games I've currently been playing. There must be some random thing I have installed that I could fool with.\"\n\"Oh hey Bleed! I remember seeing a video on that back in, what? 1987? Let's try it out!\"\n\n\nSo my first [i]real[/i] experience with the game was with the options menu. I always go into the options menu when I first play a game, not to go optimize the settings for ideal play or anything crazy like that, [spoiler]this is an 8-bit game, doubt I could really do any optimization[/spoiler] but to turn the game onto Windowed mode, because I bleedy [spoiler]eyyyy[/spoiler] despise Full Screen.\n\nSo you can imagine my surprise when I saw not only no Full Screen, and a fairly lack-luster settings menu to boot. Heck, the cursor color option was a slider! [u]A slider![/u]\n\"Ohhhhhh noooohhhh... This is going to be one of those 'Looked cool and had to be instantly returned' games.\"\n\n\nSo I play the first level and get presented with a red-headed [spoiler]more like Pink-headed but heck[/spoiler] lass toting two Pistols in hand. Game tells me to WASD, so I WASD.\nPush W, don't jump. \"Oh good. It's one of [i]those[/i] games.\"\n\nSo yep. W movement key, but it don't do jack. Gotta push Space to jump.\nAlright cool. First thing I do, being a gamer, I start mashing the hell out of Space to see if I can double-jump.\n\"Alright so when you're in the air you can burst forward. That's kinda cool, I guess.\"\nAnd then the games tells me to Double Jump.\nAnd here's where Bleed starts to get interesting:\n\n\nThe main character [b]Wryn[/b] has Multiple Jumps. About 4, one regular jump and three \"Double Jumps\".\nBut not just any \"Mash Space to continue Air Time\" jump. She has a [u]dash jump[/u].\n\nWhat do I mean? Well, remember when I thought she could move forward super quick by mashing Space?\nWell, she can dash in any direction. Up, down, left, right, diagonal, you name it. This turns what would've just been another run-and-gun platformer into a very engaging fast-paced game.\n\n\nThis was then accented by the introduction of her \"Energy\" bar. What does it do? Slow down time.\n\nYep. Bullet Time.\nNow you have pin-precise movement options and time slow.\n\n\"Oh. It's going to be one of [i]those[/i] games.\"\nYep. Bullet Hells. [spoiler]Meh at least it aint Japanese Bullet Hell.[/spoiler]\n\n\nPlaying on easy, the first mission was a breeze. I died once trying to figure out the double jump mechanics [spoiler]to be met with Wryn's cutsie \"Hey no fair! This is the first level, it's supposed to be easy!\" death message, reminiscent of the likes of AVGN Adventures[/spoiler] but went through most of the game with my M1 button taped down as Wryn literally ran-and-ganned [spoiler]that sounded a lot better in my head[/spoiler] through \"Guppy\", \"The 6th best hero of all time\". [spoiler]That guy's the 6th best hero? Christ I'd hate to see the 7th... or is that [i]me[/i]?[/spoiler]\n\nI popped into the shop and saw a huge variety of weapons. \"Shotgun\", \"Flame Thrower\", \"Beam Rifle\", \"Katana\"... \n\nbut my eyes were on one single name.\n\"OH MY GOD THERE'S A REVOLVER IN THIS GAME.\"\n\nBlasted through the second level, experiencing a decent number of deaths and coming to appreciate the time slow mechanic by dodging bullets fired by the Worm Boss(es).\n\nBish bash bosh: Revolver!\nAnd it was crap. At least for a noob like me (at time of playing)\n\n\nThe third level was where the game hit me in the face. I ran through kissing my new Six-Barrel Shooter [spoiler]not that it matters with infinite ammo[/spoiler] as it shot out nice big bullets at my opponents. Felt about the same as the Pistols, but the ricochet effect was nice.\n\nAnd then we got platforming around Lasers. Alright.\nAnd then we got tiny robots that spawn if you hit a Laser. Okay.\nAnd then we got the fact that the Revolver has piss poor damage (before ricochet) and lower attack speed than the pistol.\n\nDie, die, die again. Always because one of the \"50+\" bots snuck up on me to get that last hit off.\nBut I never felt [i]cheated[/i]. Every time I died, there was a voice in the back of my head saying \"You can do it! Just try a little harder and you're sure to make it!\" [spoiler]That voice [i]may[/i] have been Wyrn, who was saying around the same thing, as well as asking if I could get my Big Brother to help with the level. (Thanks love)[/spoiler]\n\nAnd that's when it hit me.\n\n\nThis is [b]not[/b] the kind of game where you can you whatever weapon to like.\nThis is [b]not[/b] the kind of game which you can blaze through in an afternoon.\nThis is [b]not[/b] the kind of game which treats you like your dumb.\n\n\nThis game is [b]hard[/b].\nIt'll bite you if you pet it the wrong way.\nIt's not like Super Meat Boy, which holds onto your hand with its jaws until you shake it off and get good. It's absolutely no Dark Souls, ripping you to shreads in the span of seconds and demanding you treat it like your king.\nBut it's no Kirby or Mario. You [i]can[/i] and [i]will[/i] die. [i][u]A lot[/u][/i].\n\n\nBut even with that in mind, it was never unfair.\nTo keep going with the analogy, it isn't AVGN Adventures, which attacks you even if you treat it like royalty.\n\nEven hit you take is fair, and purely caused by your own inability to play games good. Every hazard thrown your way [i]can[/i] be avoided, if hard to do. It was [u]designed[/u] that way.\n\nIt wasn't designed like AVGN Adventures [spoiler]and the games of old that it mimicks. (Just harping on AVGN Adventures since it was designed as \"How to make a Platformer that pisses you off\")[/spoiler] The hazards weren't designed [i]to[/i] hit you. They were designed to be [i]avoided[/i] by you. (Huge difference)\n\n\nNothing feels cheap. Every task set in-front of you, no matter how hard, [u]can[/u] be conquered.\nAnd that's the beauty of Bleed.\n\nYou know that you can beat what it puts in front of you, and that's why it's so hard to put down. Every level is another challenge that awaits you. Not mocking you, since it knows you can beat it, but just waiting, like the [strike]Boss[/strike] Hero waiting atop his Tower.\n\n\nAnd that's really it!\n[h1]The TL;DR of it is[/h1]\nthat Bleed is a very well designed platformer. While somewhat hard to get used to, and an absolute kick in the teeth most of the time, everything that happens in the game feels like a fair challenge you can overcome.\nYou [u]want[/u] to get through each level. You [u]know[/u] you can.\n\nAnd the game knows it too.\n\nIt knows it and it won't go easy on you.\n\nYou gotta work hard to become the best Video Game hero of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1445638946, "timestamp_updated": 1445638946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18635004": {"recommendationid": "18635004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115467043", "num_games_owned": 539, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487456329}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredible Twin Stick Platformer Shooter that has you jumping and dashing through the air in slow motion, dodging bullets matrix style.

We follow Wryn, a young pink haired girl who wants to become the greatest hero ever. Doing so, she must first eliminate the top list of the greatest heros of all time, which include a fat purple blob, a robot ball, worms and so on. That is basically the story in this case, nothing more, nothing less. I was kinda let down finding this out, but considering the games overall lenght, it was kinda predictable in the end. Must mean, the game focuses more in terms of gameplay. Well, sorta.\n\nBasically, you use the mouse to aim your guns, the WASD keys to move and space to jump, standard stuff. However, you also have a \"bullettime\" button on Shift, a very useful tool in this game. The game slows down, also zooms in on the character a bit but still letting you see alot whats going on around you, which is very usefull since the game tends to throw dozens of projectiles at once at you. Wryn also is capable of a \"triple dash\", which you can perform after jumping and is used for dodging. Combined with her wall jumps (wich work very well in my opinion) this can lead to some pretty tricky maneuvers and helps keeping the game fast paced (even with bullet time, which can be drained very easily). \n\nAs for the guns, i found most of them not that usefull to downright completely useless, and usually stuck with the standard dual machine guns and the flame thrower. Because of that, anything that wasn't these two weapons, felt really unsatisfying and unhandy to use.\n\nDifficulty wise this game is ok. Normal is what you expect. In Story mode if you die in a stage, you usually just respawn earlier in the stage, with some Point loss i believe. Wryn isn't really robust but she still can take a few hits, so it's fair in my book if you take the overall gameplay in retrospectiv.\n\nThe graphics were my biggest dislike about the game. I just can't stand these sprites. Wryn and her rival look atrocious, enemies and bosses look basic as hell and the overall looks of the levels don't impress me either. As for the level design itself, it's average. They are all fairly short, most of the time containing a mini boss, an element new to the prior stages and (of course) a different theme. For what they are doing they are alright, allthough they had no real depth to it, which i missed highly here.\n\nIt is difficult to say how i really felt the entirety of this game. Some part of me enjoyed it, some other part thought it was pretty dull and the most mediocre thing in a long while, lack of story didn't help either.\n\nI guess for that price it is an ok game. Next to the Story mode there is also an Arcade mode, some things to unlock and a boss battle mode, so there should be more time after. If you are fan of Jumpers with shooting elements give it a go. or stick to better alternatives. Like Metal Slug.

Doesn't really make sense, but i'm not here to question. I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\n[h1]Gameplay\t[/h1]\n\nYou are Wyrn a girl who dreams to become the greatest hero of all time. To become the greatest hero of all time you must kill the current best heroes to claim your title. The controls were a bit odd and it took me a bit to get used to them.  The feature of being able to slow down time is amazingly fun and you have a decent arsenal to pick between. There are 13 bosses to fight through. The game plays fluently and the triple dash is really helpful when you are in a pinch (along with slowing down time). The game can be completed in a quick amount of time, however it's a very enjoyable and challenging experience. There are a total of 4 levels of difficulty to enjoy (Easy, Normal, Hard, and Very Hard) along with 2 other gamemodes to fight through.  \n\n[h1]Graphics/sound\t[/h1]\n\nThe Graphics are pixelated and really match with the charm of the game. The music is upbeat and allows you to immerse yourself into killing whatever you happen to be fighting at that moment. The whole game gave me a kinda old-school vibe; in a good way. \n\n[h1]Pros/Cons\t[/h1]\n\n[b]Pros\t[/b]\n\n+ 3 different ways to play and 4 levels of difficulty\n+ Multiple characters to choose from (unlocks characters if you beat story on higher difficulties) \n+ Interesting combat mechanic\n+ Slowing down time \n+ Boss fights are different in nature and strategy\n+ Good ending\n+ Fast-Paced and Challenging\n\n[b]Cons\t[/b]\n\n- Short game overall \n- Controls are a bit odd and take getting used to\n- Local Co-op only (It would be amazing with online co-op but still amazing to play alone!)\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts\t[/h1]\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed playing through bleed. I honestly felt like a badass when I would slow down time dodge multiple bullets, reflect the rest with my katana, then shoot the hell out of the boss ending him. I might have gotten a bit addicted; only a bit! I enjoyed this game and while it was short, it was sweet. I once tried challenge mode only to realize I'm getting butt kicked by 3 bosses at once. Overall a very fun game which I can recommend to almost anyone who likes platformers or becoming Neo from The Matrix.\n\n[h1]TL;DR\t[/h1]\n\nBleed is a highly enjoyable fast-paced, pixeled, challenging platformer where you fight your way though all the old heroes to become the greatest hero of all time. You have 4 difficulties to choose from and 13 bosses to defeat. The combat is fun because of the ability to slow down time and the ability to triple dash. The arsenal has an decent amount of weapons to choose from and the increase in challenge when you go on higher difficulties is noticeable. The controls take a bit to get used to and overall the game is short, but highly enjoyable to play through. \n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1440729797, "timestamp_updated": 1440731046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768257", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17729546": {"recommendationid": "17729546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038148225", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480442158}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is easy when you go one player, it does gets harder with higher difficulties but as the respawn point is very forgiving you beat it easly.

I haven't finished it 100%, there's still a number of unlocks, difficulties, and achieves for me to go for, but after finishing the game on normal, I have to say that it's some of the most fun I've had in quite a while.\n\nSo what it is? It's a classic-style action-platformer that plays like a mix of Megaman, Contra, and Gunstar Heroes. You have a number of weapons, ranging from the basic dual pistols and rocket launcher to explosive mines, a laser rifle, and a katana. Each one has it's uses situationally, but the game is plenty playable with whatever setup you prefer. I myself like the pistols for accuracy and the katana for its ability to deflect bullets. There's an incredibly controllable triple-jump, wall jumping, and bullet time to help you dodge the massive amount of ordnance that will be flying around. You'll progress through seven short levels, each with a miniboss and a boss. The levels are derivative, as this game is basically a love letter to its influences, but it does a number of neat things with the design. It operates on a checkpoint system, which is good, because while it's not that bad on normal, but it is approaching Nintendo hard, especially on the harder difficulties. Thanks to the liberal use of checkpoint, each inevitable death ceases to sting all that bad. Like Dark Souls, Bleed is very difficult, but never punishing. Every time you die, you will know why, and that's because you messed up. That's in addition to the absolute badassery you'll unleash. While for most games the triple-jump and bullet-time would be gimmicks, in Bleed they are central to both the combat and platforming and allow you to pull off some seriously awesome moves. Rather than being nastily cheap, Bleed gives you the tools to succeed and encourages you to rise to the challenge.\n\nThe story is practically nonexistant, as it was in the old days. It is the year 21XX, and the last century was the time of heroes. However, the heroes have gotten old, there's no new ones, and a cotton-candy-haired girl named Wryn dreams of supplanting them and becoming the greatest hero in the world. There is a twist, if you can call it that, at the end, but ultimately this has a classic-style video game plot to complement it's classic-style gameplay. All it is is a setup to excuse the chaos. If you want depth, look elsewhere.\n\nOne last comment. The game has a wonderful atmosphere. While most of the backgrounds resemble old SNES/Genesis backgrounds, the character designs are extremely cutesy, and pink is a prominent color in Wryn's character design. While I understand that this might be offputting for many gamers, the way the designer used it to contrast with the intense action is delightful, what little story there is is hilarious as a result, and the ending is pure saccharine joy. Give it a chance. Bleed may not be complex or terribly unique, but what it is is an absolute blast.

You also have the ability to change your weapons and dash through the air in order to dodge bullets. Another key element to the mechanics is the implementation of a Bullet-Time (aka slow-mo) mode where you can slow down everything for a limited amount of time. This ability gets recharged automatically after a few seconds. \n\nThe controls are sharp and the game look alright. I wasn't really a fan of the presentation, it seemed like a 5 year old could create more innovative enemies and characters for the game but hey, it didn't bother me as much. Be warned that the game gets Tough and you'll die over and over again in order to progress but the levels are pretty short and there are checkpoints spread throughout in reasonably good places so don't worry about trial and error. Some bosses are pretty challenging indeed.\n\nI played with keyboard+mouse and it worked as it should but I can see that playing with a controller would be fine too. \n\nYou get to purchase new weapons between levels but I found myself pretty fine with the standard dual guns+rocket launcher loadout.  \n\nYou can finish the game in roughly 2 hours or so and there's an Arcade mode to compete for high scores a boss challenge mode as well as 3 additional characters (read: skins) to play with but other than that, I wasn't really compelled to play this game any more than beating the story mode (there are 4 difficulties in all). \n\nTo be quite honest, I can't call this a bad game but there's nothing that special about it either.

It has a great and very distinct art style, very catchy and upbeat music, a funny twist on the standard plot, great control, and a unique and memorable main character. The overall tone is somewhat cutesy, but rather than hindering the game, it gives Bleed a funny and uplifting tone that is oddly in contrast to all the shooting you're doing. I beat the normal game in about an hour and a half on normal difficulty, but there are also options for coop mode (as yet untried), hard mode, and very hard mode. The controls are extremely good, it has customizable options, and it runs very smoothly. It has some interesting weapons that you can unlock by purchasing with points at the in-game store, as well as extra health and time-slowdown energy.\n\nSome people will say the normal mode is extremely hard; don't be fooled, I think people are making it out to be worse than it really is. What kept me playing was the good level design, unique enemies, brevity of the levels, interesting boss battles, and the infinite continues. The game may be difficult (there are some incredibly tough sections, most notably in level 6) but it is incredibly forgiving and very fair. You just have to push yourself through to the next screen and you'll start from there if you die.\n\nI only have two minor gripes with the game. The first is that level 6 begins with an auto-scrolling section with some difficult platforming that the game had never introduced before; I would've preferred a section that introduced the difficult terrain management before the auto-scrolling screen kills you. The other gripe is that level 6 also has a section where you have to try and dodge seemingly infinite bubbles that are constantly in your way; it's a bit like jumping into the ocean and trying to not get wet. \n\nOther than these two sticking points, my only other suggestion for improvement is MORE CUTSCENES! The characters and plot were great, and the main character Wryn's dialogue was very funny and full of personality! She really had spunk, although it was definitely not overdone, and I loved to see that because she felt like a real person. It really felt like the developer made this character effortlessly, so mad props to the dev for a character more memorable than any I've played in a long time, even in big budget games. I wanted to see and hear more of her between each stage, or at least every other stage. The plot is quite funny and the ending was comedically unexpected but satisfying. I only wish it had lasted longer; the main game is unfortunately short. But I hope to see more from this developer, especially a Bleed 2. :)\n\nBleed is kid-friendly but the level of difficulty may be a bit high.

"language": "english", "review": "Bleed is a fun little action platformer.\n\nIn Bleed you play a highly mobile character who platforms while shooting using the analog stick (or mouse I assume). It's comparable to megaman in that it's a platform game with shooting and bosses, however there are a lot of big differences. In Bleed you are able to slow time. Now this might not be the most unique mechanic to video games in general but here it completely allows the game designers to be creative and make normal play very challenging, encouraging you to make careful use of the slow time mechanic. The game starts to feel extremely difficult until you realize it's designed around this mechanic, and you start to get better at managing your energy and slowing time during difficult sections or certain moves from bosses. The game is also different in that as I mentioned you shoot using any angle you wish, which again leads to enemies being more creative, more mobile, and generally harder to hit, but because you have the freedom to aim wherever you want this becomes all balanced out.\n\nThe game itself is flowing with creativity. The levels will surprise you from a moving train to a level that actually rotates while you're moving through it. The levels are designed to be very different and throw you for a loop, hoping for you to slow time to makes things managable. The bosses are also very well done. They have a lot of variety and expect a lot of your attention.\n\nBleed gives you choices in difficulty as well as some RPG elements in terms of upgrading your character and getting new weapons. In playing on the normal difficulty I was challenged but I was still able to beat the game without getting too frustrated. The game is generous with checkpoints which is always a + from me, but it even gives you the option of playing the game in a traditional arcade style with 1 life. The game is a bit short (that might just be because I couldn't get enough) but with the additional modes and difficulties and items you can gather on top of the just overall great feeling I had playing this, it's worth the $5 and a no brainer during a sale.\n\nI really enjoyed this game. I hope that the people behind the creative design choices will continue to make games as it is so blatantly obvious that a lot of love and brilliance went into this. I don't really have any complaints, I wish the game was longer so I could experience more from this company.\n\n[h1]8.5/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1435657116, "timestamp_updated": 1435657116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495663", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16803985": {"recommendationid": "16803985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155905464", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436013033}, "language": "english", "review": "so fun", "timestamp_created": 1435649454, "timestamp_updated": 1435649454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16802057": {"recommendationid": "16802057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074275991", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505960767}, "language": "english", "review": "Bleed is a fast paced, beautiful little bullet time shooter with an unusual game feel. It took me some time to get used to, however, it has become one of my favourite game experiences I've had in a long time. Basically, you fight through a level of level themed mobs and challenges (sometimes with a mini boss included) and then fight a couple unique boss battles. In the end, it's a very short game, but it has a high replayabillity as you unlock more abillities as you go, allowing you to explore new weapons and capabillites. What also contributes to the replayabillity is the fact that as you up the difficulty on the game, the bosses gain more abillities.

consideravelmente dif\u00edcil o que faz com que a dura\u00e7\u00e3o da campanha se estique, mas mesmo assim sendo pequena e SIMPLES por\u00e9m n\u00e3o f\u00e1cil .\n- Gr\u00e1ficos do jogo s\u00e3o simples mas chamam muito aten\u00e7\u00e3o por ter sprites lindos, inclusive quando voc\u00ea d\u00e1 um dash e atira por toda a sala, da pra se sentir dentro do Matrix, \u00e9 simplesmente incr\u00edvel .\n- A Variedade de armas em quest\u00e3o da dura\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo \u00e9 explendida, v\u00e1rios tipo de armas, n\u00e3o apenas muda a apar\u00eancia e o nome, mas sim o modo de atirar, quando usar, como usar e onde usar, \u00e9 bem variado .\n- O jogo consegue te fazer jogar na dificuldade maxima, pois assim voc\u00ea desbloqueia mais personagens e armas, deixando assim o seu jogo mais variado e '' Bonitos '' digamos assim .\n\nContras do Jogo :\n\n- Se voc\u00ea estiver entediado em uma tarde, provavelmente vai zerar Bleed em 80 minutos, e se voc\u00ea for um Gamer Hardcore em menos....\n- O pre\u00e7o do jogo \u00e9 cons\u00edderavelmente se voc\u00ea compra poucos jogos e baratos, o jogo te da pouco tempo de campanha por um pre\u00e7o meio alto em quest\u00e3o disso....\n\nNota Final : 9,999999999999999999999999999999999999 ( O jogo deveria ser um pouco maior ;-; )\n\nLike A Newbie \n", "timestamp_created": 1431832832, "timestamp_updated": 1431832832,

My research on Bleed left me on the fence as to whether I should purchase it or not, as it seemed very mediocre. I decided to pick it up when it was on sale. I was pleasantly suprprised within the first few minutes of playing the game, and my experience stayed pleasant throughout this 2D shooter.\n\nThere's not much for settings for this game. You can choose to play with a keyboard and mouse or controller, with mouse/right stick used for aiming and the WASD keys/left stick for moving. You can't customize the controls for the gamepad. Only the keyboard controls can be customized, unfortunately. That doesn't matter, however, as the button mapping is done well (assuming you're using a controller with Xinput). Since you'll be using your thumbs to move and shoot, the remaing controls (slow time, switch weapons, and jump/ double jump) are mapped to the shoulder buttons, which works well. You can slow time with an ability, but it uses up a gauge that refills as time passes. Anyway, The only face button that does anything is the start button. The keyboard controls are also done well. It's nice to see some customizable settings that allow for more personalization. They include recticle color (the reticicle only appears if you are using the keyboard and mouse, rather than a controller), HUD position, sound options, and you can even turn off the ability to wall jump, which seems strange to me. Why wouldn't you want to be able to wall jump? Overall these features are a nice touch, and I especially like the ability to change the HUD position.\n\nThe game has 7 levels, all of which are action-packed and straightforward; look to other games for exploration or depth. There's not much else to do other than slow time, dodge and shoot, so I can't really say much about that. Each stage is unique and has various elements: on one stage, you'll be on top of a train and have to move to lower cars before the train goes under a tunnel, on another you're inside a dragon, on another you must avoid laser beams that don't hurt you but send enemies after you if you trigger them... You get the Idea. Anyway, there's several mini-bosses in each stage, though I'm not sure if I should call them mini-bosses as they can sometimes be as hard as the stage's end boss. Each stage is extremely fun and unique, and changing the difficulty also changes the stage a bit, rather than just increasing enemy health and damage dealt to you, though it also does those things too.\n\nThe game also has a lot of personality and charm. The music is usually upbeat and catchy (and reminds me of Megaman music), the main character expresses her emotions in game over screens and in the title screen, and when the game ends, it tells you to follow your dreams, never give up, all that jazz. It's refreshing to have something like that, rather than a grim-dark, edgy anti-hero using a ridiculous plot as an excuse to make pretentious social commentary. After beating the game, you unlock a couple of new modes. A challenge mode which allows you to fight up to 3 bosses at once, and an arcade mode that requires you to play through the ENTIRE game without dying. Unless I just suck, it would take many hours to become good enough to complete arcade mode on even easy, and I can't imagine doing it on any level of difficulty higher than that.\n\nThe game's ending brings me to my next point; the bad things about this game. The first of which is the length, as I beat Bleed in a little over 4 hours on the hard difficulty. While I very much enjoyed my time with the game, I wish it lasted longer. You could argue that the arcade mode raises the time the player can spend playing this game before getting bored, and I agree, but I still wish there was more content, because what little content that does exist is fantastic. The next bad thing about this game is the weapon selection. Now, if you know nothing about this game besides what you've been reading, let me explain. You acquire points at the end of every level, and these points can be spent at a shop to buy weapons, health upgrades, and time gauge upgrades. All of the weapons available for purchase besides one are useless. The default dual pistols are the best weapons in the game, and even the one other weapon that isn't useless, the laser rifle, is only useful against some bosses, though to be fair, it's extremely effective against said bosses. All the other weapons either don't do enough damage, have too short of range, are only useful in rare situations, or a combination of the three. More thought and careful balance should have been put into the weapons, as I've never seriously used any of them besides the default pistols and laser rifle, because the other weapons are simply worse, and a waste of points.\n\nThat's all I have to say about the game, really. If you like games of this type, you'll probably love this game, as it's one of the best of it's kind. If you don't like games of this type, you probably won't like this game.

Had a few, looking for something close to Super Meat Boy. Just a quick platformer I could jump into for an hour or so. From the begining I noticed it was top notch. Its hard. But not so hard you cant advance with some practice. I got to the 2nd boss that first night. \n\nWhat really makes this game fun is the style with which you can play with. The jumping is amazing.

Each level is thematically different, with bosses suited to each, and hazards similarly well suited for the environments you encounter, and every last bit of each is (if you ask me) intended to rip away at your health and combo ranking, making it a fantastic game if you like high-speed action and a high skill barrier to master it. \n\nThe art style and music are also really enjoyable, unless you're tired of the retro stylings a little, but even if you are, I'd recommend this on the basis of its gameplay alone, as that it makes it stand out from the loads of other somewhat slower, more methodical puzzle platformers or sidescrolling roguelikes.

You play as Wryn, a pink haired videogame heroine wannabe on a quest to dodge, dash, jump, and shoot herself towards the title of Gretest Hero of All Time. At her disposal she has an arsenal of weapons, a triple jump, and the ability to slow down time. You think you've seen bullet-time done right? You've seen nothing until you've tried this game! I cannot describe with words how incredibly satisfying it feels to air-dash your way, in slow motion, through the one small gap in a wall of bullets (very hard-mode) while maintaining your combo-meter for maximum damage.\n\nBut let's not be completely biased here. Many players will probably be upset by the fact that this is a really short game. Like a [i]really[/i] short game. To make your way through the seven levels on normal will take you about an hour. To get through hard might be another hour or so and after that the same goes for very hard. There are ofcourse some extras like arcade and challenge mode but the main bulk of the game is easily beaten in an evening.\n\nThe weapon unlocks also seem pretty useless, I stuck with the starting weapons through most of my playthrough on both normal and hard as I saw almost no reason to switch weapons during any stage or boss fight.\n\nThat said tho, this is a really, really fun game and I will probably end up spending more hours just replaying this than in most $20+ games I've bought.\n\nPick this up if you're:\nA fan of fast-paced, skill based combat.\nAn old-school gamer with too little time for those 40+ hour AAA titles\nA speedrunner. This game is the perfect speedrunning game.\nYou just want to relax and have som fun for an evening.\n\nDon't pick this up if you:\nAre on a budget and/or want a high Time/$ ratio\nHate pink\nWant to miss out on a great time", "timestamp_created": 1425592470, "timestamp_updated": 1425592817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516514", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14748722": {"recommendationid": "14748722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055054505", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425582270}, "language": "russian", "review": "2D-\u044d\u043a\u0448\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0443, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e\u0449\u0443\u044e \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0451\u043c \u0430\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435 2 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f (\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0445 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445) \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0443\u043c\u043e. \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 7 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0436\u0434\u0451\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441. \n\n\u0418\u0437 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 - \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0435, \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0435. \u041d\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0430. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0441 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e.\n\n\u0412\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443, \u043d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0451 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c.\n\n6,5\\10", "timestamp_created": 1425582600, "timestamp_updated": 1425582600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14733891": {"recommendationid": "14733891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059235026", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406992114}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu tr\u00e8s fun et tr\u00e8s dynamique, amateur de die and retry ce jeu est fait est pour vous, on peux n\u00e9anmois critiquer la dur\u00e9e de vie relativement courte du jeu, mais le gameplay en vaut le d\u00e9tour.

I quite liked the concept of a thruster pack, and the manoverabillity and controlls were great. As far as the level design goes, I was impressed by what they had, but I also wanted more. If I had to state one flaw with this game it would be that it is too short. Fun, but short. This being said, if you are the type of person who finds replay value in increasing the difficulty of a given level-- you may absolutly love this game. Personally, I was impressed with its mechanics, but I felt like it needed more content. As a game, I would recomend it to you if you have excess money to spend. \n\nHere's just one more thing to think about with this game: it is well-designed. I am a part of a game-creation/game-theory club at my school, and I have tasked myself to find well-designed games like ShovelKnight. This game, while it may be lacking in content, provides a good refference to game design in that the levels and mechanics are well-developed. The ideas in this game are great, even if it is short. \n\nOn the whole, I would give this 7/10 for gameplay and enjoyment, and a 8.5/10 if you're looking for good ideas and design in a game.", "timestamp_created": 1424905585, "timestamp_updated": 1472509808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503983", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14643555": {"recommendationid": "14643555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063967022", "num_games_owned": 804, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425364825}, "language": "german", "review": "Bleed kann man defenetiv empfehlen.

Da dieser f\u00fcr mich sehr einzigartig ist , m\u00f6chte ich hier nicht spoilern. Spielt dieses Spiel einfach selbst :D. Der einzige Kritikpunkt ist f\u00fcr mich die L\u00e4nge, da das Spiel nicht wirklich lang ist. Wiederspielwert hat das Game  nur durch Highscores und verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsgraden, was ein bisschen schade ist.

Recently I've come to ponder why. Is it the fun? The challenge? The satisfaction?  Yes. Satisfaction. In my recent gaming history I can only recall the satisfaction from beating a tough level on a game playing Super Meat Boy, back in 2010. \n\n     Bleed made me feel that again. And it is awesome. I knew it was going to be difficult but I thought to myself why not play it in Hard Mode? Boy, was I in for a surprise: Great controls, fast paced ction, amazing sound track, beautiful retro pixelated design and of course Hardore gaming at its bet. The one hour it took me to complete the first level made me want to write this.\n\n     In my humble opinion, videogames are the ultimate media. One can find different art forms in them combined to make a unique interactive experience. \n\n     Sure you can play a AAA game for dozens of hours and enjoy all it has to offer. However, sometimes you just want to have your daily adrenaline fix and the enjoyment of pushing it to the limit to prove you can do better than yourself. Bleed will give you that.\n\nThank you Ian Campbell.", "timestamp_created": 1420768476, "timestamp_updated": 1420768562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505114", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13890248": {"recommendationid": "13890248", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988186581", "num_games_owned": 490, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454109748}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite possibly my favorite game of 2013.

Achei esse aqui mais r\u00e1pido do que eu pensava.\n\nBleed \u00e9 um jogo de plataforma fast-paced feito pela Bootdisk Revolution, onde o plot principal \u00e9 sobre uma garota chamada Wryn que quer se tornar a maior hero\u00edna dos videogames de todos os tempos e entrar no Hall dos Her\u00f3is, e pra isso decide derrotar todos os outros do ranking pra chegar em primeiro. Bom, teoricamente \u00e9 uma t\u00e9cnica v\u00e1lida :v\n\n\u00c9 um jogo de plataforma com um pouco de tiro, por\u00e9m o ponto que eu achei mais interessante no jogo foi a habilidade de deixar o tempo mais lento com o bot\u00e3o direito do mouse para manobrar melhor nos pulos e no movimento. Isso num jogo desses, ainda mais com um pouco de bullet hell no meio \u00e9 uma coisa inovadora e muito aproveit\u00e1vel.\n\nO gameplay \u00e9 bem fluido e r\u00e1pido, qualquer piscada pode tirar sua concentra\u00e7\u00e3o, mesmo usando o recurso de deixar o tempo mais lento em dificuldades maiores. O jogo tamb\u00e9m possui um modo Arcade e personagens extras pra quebrar a monotonia. Pena ser um jogo t\u00e3o curto, consegui zer\u00e1-lo em duas horas.\n\nInfelizmente a hist\u00f3ria do jogo acaba sendo meio tosca. Afinal estamos falando de uma garota aleat\u00f3ria que quer derrotar todos os her\u00f3is do mundo pra se tornar a maior hero\u00edna de todos os tempos. Eu sinceramente achei meio tosco, sen\u00e3o gen\u00e9rico. As m\u00fasicas do jogo lembram um pouco o estilo chiptune, por\u00e9m n\u00e3o chegam a ser muito chamativas.\n\nMas bem, vale a pena mesmo assim comprar esse jogo. Aconselharia comprar durante uma sale ou se tiver um dinheiro sobrando e n\u00e3o souber o que fazer com ele.

Once I got a handle on the dashing I loved the freedom of movement over the 2d action stages. \n\nThe player acumulates coins to buy new weapons but my favorite is still the dual wield pistols you start with, which when combined with your weird flying powers feels like playing John Wu's The Rocketeer. \n\nThe art is silly in a good way and the story is hard to decipher.

The only complaint I have is that it was way too short.\n\nGeneral:\n+ Difficulty is really, really easy at \"easy\" pretty easy at \"normal\", and then gets really hard from there. \"Hard\" and \"Very hard\" are actually really challanging. Basically, for any skill level.\n- GAME WAS WAY TOO SHORT. I wish there were about 10x more levels and bosses.\n\nStory:\n- Not really existant, but doesn't get in the way. The story might as well not be there.\n+ Story doesn't get in the way. The point of the games isn't for the story\n\nAtmosphere/Art/Music:\n* Atmosphere varies by level, but has an overall cartoonish feel to it. Not \"in your face\" pixel art, and overall has a nice aesthetic.\n* Music was mid tier\n\nMechanics:\n+ The best platformer/shooter mechanics I've ever seen. \n+ You get a tripple dash, where you can dash in any direction three times. Insanely fun, and you just want to dash around the screen, shooting things. If you get good at it, you can combine the dashes so you can dodge and couter attack, or to get behind an enemy you would normally think you can't get over. Might take some practice, but you can do things like, tripple jump + wall jump + jump up + right dash + jump up, all withought hitting the ground. Since this game is a bullet hell, it feels amazing when you dash around 10 bullets at once\n+ Interesting weapons. You get to select two weapons, which you can switch out. The default weapon, dual pistos, is basically a machine gun, and can get you though most of the game, but buying different weapons adds a challange or an advantage, depending on the level. Adds a great dynamic to the game\n+ Bullet time: Great tool to get you though tough situations. Has a reasonable cooldown, so you can't spam it but it isn't an \"ult\" move. Combine bullet time and the tripple dash, and you feel like a super hero\n+ Bosses: Not creative, but good. When I say not creative, I mean the bosses really remind me of kirby or super meat boy bosses. They all have patterns, and they cycle through moves. Each boss is very different, and each presented a different challange. Not as fun as the platforming part imo, but still alot of fun\n\ntl;dr: If you wan't a game that's just alot of fun to play, this is it.", "timestamp_created": 1419807381, "timestamp_updated": 1435098449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13667194": {"recommendationid": "13667194", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994591810", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419886397}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent, fast paced twin stick shooter.

Cave Story's composition displays immense amounts of experience and understanding of the craft that Bleed does not. Cave Story, in its original form, is also available to play free of charge, a privilege that Bleed does not, to my knowledge, provide. This is quite ironic to me, since Cave Story feels like a retail-quality game while Bleed feels like a high schooler's B-grade final project.\n\nAfter playing Bleed, I had no clue whatsoever as to why I had it in my wishlist for as long as I did. On the surface, the game looks bland at best. The background art is a few steps above being on the level of placeholders, the main character looks like something an artist in their very early stages of artistic development would draw in their math notebook, and the enemies look like thirty-second doodles with copious amounts of tweening in place of animation. All of these assets are presented in a style popular amongst indie platformers, which is somewhat inspired, if indirectly, by Cave Story, i.e. drawn in a digital paint program, then shrunk down and blown back up again. Despite this, all enemies explode in a high-resolution blood splatter, which is akin to taking a sledgehammer to the game's artstyle. Even if the game's developer was going for simplicity, they failed to take into consideration that simplicity functions best when based on rules of art that this game does not regard.\n\nThe general style of the game as a whole seems to be more directly inspired by Hotline Miami, as both are \"retro-styled\" games with violent gunplay and twin-stick controls. However, Bleed is more than content with throwing a side-scrolling shooter or two (Megaman X and Super Metroid come to mind) into the stew. This leads to the player having to juggle free, any-directional aiming and platforming, making for a mediocre experience in both regards. One remarkably stupid part of the platforming side is the main character's means of vertical movement. The player is given a quadruple-jump, which combines the directional functionality of Cave Story's Jetpack 2.0 with some of Super Metroid's Space Jump's maneuverability. This is much less fun than it may seem on paper. While the Jetpack 2.0 restricts movement to four directions, and the Space Jump only allows the player one direction that can be adjusted slightly, the quad-jump in Bleed can be used in any of eight directions. The variety of orientations are very hard to justify, as diagonal movement is mostly unneccessary and the momentum from the horizontal jump isn't enough to be helpful.\n\nA further ingredient in Bleed's cookbook is Max Payne's bullet time mechanic. While admittedly the most fun part of the game is dodging enemies and shots in slow motion, the novelty wears off as no other mechanics take advantage of it, making it go stale quickly. However, it seems to be almost required in a few situations, the scenario with the helicopter in the game's first level coming to mind. The shots are practically impossible to dodge, since the level is designed with very little cover from the helicopter's highly accurate shots. This leaves the player hiding in very small crevies waiting for their bullet time to recharge.\n\nThe game's balance is almost as laughable as its presentation. Levels are harbingers of torment despite having checkpoints in between every room. Meanwhile, bosses can be faced with comparatively little effort. One of the game's many plagiarized elements, the style meter, brings this to mind, as reaching a rank above a D only occurs once in a blue moon during levels, while it's to be expected to go as high as an A in bosses.\n\nOverall, Bleed feels like a love letter to everything wrong with indie games. The entire experience is bland, the music is forgettable, the art is embarassing, and the gameplay is a chore. Perhaps, wth experience, the developer can one day produce something great, since it is evident that this is a very early attempt at a fully-fledged video game.", "timestamp_created": 1419396621, "timestamp_updated": 1419396621, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.405128", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13557788": {"recommendationid": "13557788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146521539", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495759657}, "language": "english", "review": "When I got this game, it was mainly for the insanely cheap price. Initially, I didn't really like the game, mainly because of the difficulty, but as soon as I got used to the groove of the levels, I found myself extremely enticed with the game.\n\nSeriously, if you like Mega-Man, with the insanely difficult levels and tons of replayability, this is definitely your type of game. This game has a short story, but it doesn't hinder this extremely great game, especially with the arcade mode, which allows you to play until you die, and it uploads your score.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. Everything is colorful and vibrant. The performance is glorious. No matter how much was going on, at no point whatsoever did my frame rate drop down severely to a point where it hindered my gameplay even slightly, both on a strong pc and a measly laptop. The levels are difficult and require many runs through them in order to get the layout down in your mind, and the sheer amount of stuff happening is sure to keep you on edge at all times. The control scheme is absolutely comfortable and fits this game perfectly. Only problem I have is that switching items via scroll, which is my preference, needs a sensitivity adjuster, for uber-sensitive scrollers.\n\nThere are some problems with the game, which sometimes hinder the gameplay. Sometimes, I lose exactly where the mouse is, due to it no having a border or just blending in with the background, which happens a lot, causing me to die a ton. Also, the game is a bit too short for my liking, so I think the developers should make a few new levels for the game. However, the replayability of this should occupy you for a long while, especially with the different difficulties. Completing all 7 levels of this game on normal took me about 2 hours, which felt much longer.\n\nAlso...\n\n\n[b]THIS GAME NEEDS MULTIPLAYER![/b] Although slow motion wouldn't be able to be done, open levels with free for all or killing bosses would be phenomenal. If you are one of the developers, PLEASE make multiplayer levels like this. It would add so much more depth to the game, and add many, many hours of gameplay to it.\n\nAnyways, BUY THIS! It is definitely worth your time and money, and it was a fun time for me. Definitely immersive, colorful, beautiful, performs like a beast, and has tons of replayability, however can get ever-so-slightly better with multiplayer and a few tweaks. 9.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1419380390, "timestamp_updated": 1419380390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13552690": {"recommendationid": "13552690", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994398029", "num_games_owned": 641, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480917726}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was fantastic, it actually left me wanting more.

You play as Wryn, who can jump wryth the left thumb stick, shoot in any direction with the wryght thumbstick, change between two wrypeans, slow time with the left rigger and jump with the wryght trigger. When she jumps, she can aim jump two or three more times in mid air. So you can jump to the left, then aim her to launch herself right, while shooting left, then air jump up all without hitting the ground. She can even jump off walls, but it seems more like a visual aide than a mechanic. The game has a fast pace. There are speedy bullets, bosses and hazards raining down, the slow time mechanic becomes an easy way to deal with it all.\n\nWryn is out to become the #1 hero! So she's got a hit list to kill all the other heroes and work her way to the top of the list! By top I mean bottom! The #1 hero gets revealed at the bottom of the list. These heroes are all bosses. After each death she'll comment things like, \"Don't worry its just a game, I'll be back in a sec,\" \"Do you have an older brother that can play this part, maybe?\" Bleed hits you over the head that its a game, such as hoping you can achieve your dreams for helping her achieve hers.\n\nYou go through the game unlocking all seven levels to play. Each level has a completely different theme. A dark mansion, an underground cavern, inside of a dragon and so on. Different levels have different elements, such as getting trapped in a giant apple and forced to get through the top to the bottom of the screen before the apple drops to the next screen. Others like having to evade sensors or time jumps to avoid lasers that warm up and fire.  The bosses are giant and diverse. Everything from bosses that split when shot, to a girl with a giant pink kitten car to mechanical orbs that shield themselves. The bosses are where most of the lives get lost. You need to make use of the slow time to survive and drain their health meters. Every boss has a wide array of attacks. The patterns seem random, which is great. Every level has more than one boss and I can tell a lot of work went into them.\n\nThere is a good variety of enemies. They change from level to level and fit the theme of each level without being reskins. Cats hopping around, soldiers that ride trains and get hit by tunnels, worms that burro then leap to shoot at you. The levels are fun and there are frequent checkpoints each time you leave an area. Its a nice quick game without much challenge. Its the dual stick, and dual triggers that make it tough at first. It gets a lot easier.\n\nWhen you select a level, you chose one of four difficulties, so you can always go back and play harder difficulties. Between the levels, you can visit the store to buy extra weapons. The default dual pistols are good enough and killing everything with a quick stream of bullets. The default rocket launcher does more damage, but has a slower shooting speed. There is also a revolver, homing missiles, a flame thrower and a short range shotgun to buy. While you only need two weapons if not just one, you can pause the game to equip 2 others. Why equip them when the two bumpers work well enough?\n\nBleed isn't a one hit death game. You have plenty of energy, but there is no way to get more energy. Your slow time bar will regenerate over time depending on the character. Both can even get upgraded in the store, as well as the regeneration speed. \n\nWith all that said, the game is an hour long at least on normal (medium) difficulty. There are extras like arcade mode, that is more like a YOLO where you only get once life and need to complete the game from start to finish. I always thought an arcade would give you three lives.

The controls are a bit odd at first, as jumping is defaulted to a trigger, but this frees up your thumb the ability to run, aim, and jump simultaneously--seldom heard of.  What makes Blleed even more unique is its time-slowing ability, sort of like a Prince of Persia sand of time thing, but meter-based instead of amount of times used.  With this ability in hand and many achievements and upgrades to discover, Bleed may be worth well more than the retail price depending on when you stop playing (a run through of all levels on easy is less than an hour, but attempting arcade mode (no deaths) on very hard could take many many hours to practice for).

I find this to be fun cheaper alternative, with the intense joystick gunplay, slow mo mechanic, but to me my favorite assest of the gameplay is the tight and terrific triple jump, with combined with the slow mo and walljumping makes dodging almost as fun as the shooting.\n\nIt's a pretty simple game, however full of personality from a fun main character; Wyrn, who has fun one-liners. It's a very self-aware meta game. Each level I played so far each have intersting and unique obstacles to give variety and engagment.\n\nThis is a short game, though I'm not finished the game because I like speedrunning along getting S-Ranks, and grinding to get better stats, so I'm taking my time with the game. If you enjoy Practice gameplay. There's four mode of difficulties, so I'm sure anyone can play easy mode and breeze through the game, however I'm not sure the amount content in the game would be enough for most people, I bought this on a sale, and it's one of the best purchases I got from Steam, though 5 bucks is not that much anyway.\n\nI have a few problems with the game, no health packs at all, which it's a bit unfair, your expected to beat the game without dying, I think more than one death lower your score. Though once your max your stats, I'm sure it won't be that difficult, at least on Normal.

Man besiegt die anderen Helden.\n\nIch muss sagen es klingt etwas finster und auch die Helden warfen bei mir nie das Gef\u00fchl auf\nsie seien Helden,wie man sie aus anderen Spielen kennt, Wryn dagegen war mir von Anfang an sympatisch und wirkte wie eine Heldin.\n\nTrotzdem muss ich sagen, dass die Story, wenn sie auch nur leicht vorhanden ist, echt toll\numgesetzt wurde, durch kleine Cutscenes, die bis auf das Intro, jedoch nur aus Bildern\nbestehen.\n\n[b]Zum Gameplay:[/b]\n\nDie Controller steuerung funktioniert gut, allerdings l\u00e4sst es sich auch mit Maus und Tastatur angenehm spielen.\n\nEs ist ein 2D-Shooter. Wir k\u00f6nnen w\u00e4hrend des springens eine art Dash-Sprung ausf\u00fchren\nund das ganze bis zu 3 mal in der Luft. So k\u00f6nnen wir bei Bossk\u00e4mpfen den Kugelhageln, m\u00f6chte ich fast\nschon sagen, ausweichen. Au\u00dferdem beherschen wir eine art Zeitlupen funktion, dadurch wird es einfacher den\nDash-Sprung zu steuern. \n\nEs gibt [i]8 verschiedene Waffen[/i], darunter die Pistolen mit den wir beginen, \u00fcber Flamenwerfer und Minen bis zu einem\nKatana mit dem man (Wryn) kugeln abwehren kann.\nAllerdings starten wir Anfangs mit den Pistolen und einem Raketenwerfer und m\u00fcssen\ndie anderen, Waffen freischalten, au\u00dferdem k\u00f6nnen wir die Lebensanzeige und die Zeitlupen anzeige verbessern\n\nGeld/Punkte bekommen wir durch das besiegen von Gegnern und hochhalten unserer Combo leiste, die \u00e4hnlich wie bei \"Devil May Cry\"\n\nfunktioniert. Desto mehr wir auf die Gegner einschie\u00dfen, desto h\u00f6her steigt sie. gro\u00dfartige\nkombos alla \"DMC\" gibt es hier allerdings nicht.\n\n[b]Es gibt noch einige andere Modie.[/b]\n\nUnter anderem eine Art [i]Boss-Rush-Mode[/i]. In dem k\u00f6nnen wir bis zu 3 Bosse, sowie eine \nArena ausw\u00e4hlen und m\u00fcssen uns dann durchk\u00e4mpfen. (dazu sei gesagt, jeder Boss ist direkt nachdem wir ihn besiegt haben, verf\u00fcgbar.\nWir m\u00fcssen das Spiel daf\u00fcr nicht direkt durchspielen.)\n\nEs gibt unter anderem noch einen [i]Challange-Mode[/i] bei dem wir nur ein Leben haben und alle Level schaffen m\u00fcssen.\n\n[u]Bleed kann auch mit einem Freund an einem PC, sofern ein Controller vorhanden ist, gespielt werden.[/u]\n\nNach dem Durchspielen schallten wir noch bis zu [u]3 weitere Charaktere[/u] frei, je nachdem auf welchem \nSchwierigkeitsgrad wir gespielt haben, bzw. wenn wir den Challange-Mode beendet haben.\n\n[i]Der Soundtrack[/i] ist auch gut gemacht. ich w\u00fcrd ihn mir jetzt nicht unbedingt kaufen (au\u00dfer vielleicht um den Entwickler zu Unterst\u00fctzen), aber \ner passt eigentlich immer gut zur Situation.\n\n[u]Auch die Level sind nett, aber auch nicht Individuell (Villa,Tunnel), wobei das Zuglevel noch das spektakul\u00e4rste war.[/u]\n\nDas Spiel kann mitunter etwas schwer sein. Ich hatte aber nie das gef\u00fchl das es unfair ist. \nDie Checkpoints sind immer gut gesetzt. und Wryn kommentiert das Ableben immer mit einem erheiternden\nSpruch(allerdings komplett auf Englisch), der es fast schon wert macht in jedem level einmal zu sterben. \n\nEin kleines Beispiel gef\u00e4llig? \n\n\"It wasnt your Foult, the enemy got lucky on that one\"\n\n\n[b]Fazit:[/b] \n\nF\u00fcr 5 Euro ist es so eine Sache, ich habe es im Steam Sale f\u00fcr knapp 1,50 gekauft und muss sagen das war es mir wert, ich w\u00e4re jetzt sogar bereit zu sagen die \n5 euro sind es mir, jetzt auch, wert, aber ich habe das Spiel gespielt und es ist sichher nicht f\u00fcr jeden etwas, aber \nwer sich auf das Spiel einl\u00e4sst hat ca. 1,5 stunden Spa\u00df(abh\u00e4ngig wie gut man ist, ich habe an einigen stellen auch mehrere Anl\u00e4ufe gebraucht)\nund wird am ende mit einem, meiner Meinung nach, besten Endscreen der Gameing geschichte belohnt. \n\nWer 2D-Shooter mag und wenn eine kleine Herausforderung nicht st\u00f6rt, der sollte sich dieses Spiel definitiv vormerken.\n\n[i]Wryn w\u00fcrde sich freuen.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1416500569, "timestamp_updated": 1479926539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623437", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12998580": {"recommendationid": "12998580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064721579", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427681844}, "language": "english", "review": "WOW this game is hard.

The slow-motion and dash effects are very nice, and executing an efficient speed run can look quite pleasing. The music and sounds are appropriate for the theme, but I personally found the bit-style music annoying after a time, and resorted to using my own music.\n\nThe controls are fairly easy to learn, however, you will have to take a look at the control scheme to figure out the key bindings. I strongly suggest using a controller if possible, as the feedback will feel much smoother and more responsive; however, a keyboard + mouse combo is still viable. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, however, experience with bullet dodging will benefit you greatly.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty fun - your typical side-scrolling progress until you reach the boss. You are rewarded with money after each completed level and can use this to purchase new weapons and upgrades for your health and slow-motion bars. There is an arcade mode that ramps up the difficulty, and the game supports 2-player coop. An arena (challenge) mode allows you to test your skills against up to 3 bosses, and you can select which ones you'd like to fight (after beating them in the story first).\n\nThe boss fights are good - each boss comes with a unique attack pattern that mixes things up enough to keep things challenging. Each level is not too long, however, achieving a perfect (S-rank) score requires speed, timing, and precision. For achievement junkies, you will spend a few hours on this game if you wish to get 100% completion.\n\nOverall, the game is very fun, and any platforming lovers should definitely give this a try.\n\nRecommend.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/djsfsroguereviews]@DJSF's Rogue Reviews[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1414624891, "timestamp_updated": 1414624891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12618880": {"recommendationid": "12618880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118005728", "num_games_owned": 2012, "num_reviews": 254, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412228402}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, fast-paced platformer and overall good game. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1414204959, "timestamp_updated": 1414204959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527349", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12607511": {"recommendationid": "12607511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139993892", "num_games_owned": 584, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454936561}, "language": "english", "review": "Review Edit:  Sequel confirmed!  Check the developer's page for details!\n\nTo be quite honest, the last side-scrolling platformer I ever played was when I last broke out Megaman X3.  I've had Bleed for a couple months now, and to be very honest, it has that same particular flavor and fun.  \n\nThe backstory is very simple- our heroine, Wryn, wants to be the best Hero ever, so she decides the best way to show that she's better than the heroes currently enshrined in the Hall of Heroes is to hunt them all down and destroy them, wearing a cute smile upon her face.  To be honest, Wryn is a refreshing change from all the big, overly-muscled guys who usually catch this role- not to mention the story that she's just doing this because she wants to prove that she can be a better hero  than all those who came before her.  That's all- just to prove that she's better then they are.\n\nThe heroes you go after are a mix of different patterns, and each boss battle is a different experience.  What worked on th first boss won't work on the next one.  You'll be jumping and learning patterns and generally having a great time.\n\nThe weapons are a lot of fun, as well, but I managed to make it through just by using the starting pistols and the rocket launcher.   To be honest, though, everyone has their own playstyles, and it might be that they suited my play-styles.  You'll find your own style of play, so buy and upgrade them all and see what suits you!\n\nThe graphics are actually well-done for what they are- you don't need supremely-sharp graphics to make a fun game- the cartoon-like graphics actually enhance the game, and even if you and Wryn can't make it through the level, she'll always be there with words of encouragement to get you to keep on trying.\n\nIn short- buy this game!", "timestamp_created": 1414142207, "timestamp_updated": 1414159965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541964", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12605917": {"recommendationid": "12605917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018970237", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414126806}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent side scrolling shooter with a taste of A.R.E.S.

The story goes that you and the main protagonist Wryn have to kill all 6 great heroes in the hall of fame who have hidden themselves from the rest of the world in order to join their ranks, and reveal them for who they really are. The game is pure enjoyment, and in my opinion is what a Matrix game should be, even if it has nothing to do with that franchise. Wryn can do three directional dashes while in the air, making her extremely mobile, if a little hard to control. You use the mouse to aim her weapons and can even go into bullet time (see why I compared it to the Matrix).  Wryn is probaby the best main protagonist in an indie game. She is just so adorable! The only real issue is the control. While you can get used to it, it can cause a lot of death, especially on stage 6.  Many may say this game is too short, but I honestly prefer short but amazing games as opposed to long dull games.

it sat in my backlog for quite a while.  Just a few days ago I decided to play it, and was quite amazed at what I found.  Bleed is a platformer shooter that also has some bullet hell mechanics.  \n\nThe game is about Wryn, a girl who is trying to kill all the heroes in her time period to become the best hero ever.  There isn't much else to the story, but the game doesn't need it.  \n\nThe gamepad controls for this game are great.  I used the Xbox 360 pad and after a while of practice it was quite easy to control Wryn.  It plays like a twinstick shooter, one pad to move the other to shoot.  The right trigger is for jumping which you can move in any direction with the stick. Unfortunately I did try the keyboard and mouse controls and found it lacking.  The keyboard can't compete with a pad, if the developer made it so the mouse controled Wryn's movements it would have been viable but since the arrow keys control it's unusable.  Gamepad is definetely recommended.\n\nThe game does play great though. It is a platforming shooter and the shooting is quite great.  There are 12 weapons to choose from that you can change during the level.  Some of them shoot great others are harder to shoot but have more power.  One of the main mechanics of bleed is slowing down time, which you use to dodge projectiles and move around precise areas.  When I started playing the game I ignored the slowdown as I found it not worth it, but really you learn later how important it is, and with a little bit of practice you should be able easily use it.  \n\nThe music for this game is 8-bit and I feel they do fit the levels and the bosses. Each level has different music but each boss has the same music.  I enjoyed the 8-bit music but after a while they do get old.\n\nBleed is quite short but for the kind of game it is, this works well. In about 2 hours you can complete the campaign on normal, and after that there are two higher difficulties that require a lot more work.  Achievement wise, most of them require just a lot of time and understanding of game mechanics, and enemy patterns.  There is a guide for all of the secret achivements because I honestly didn't understand them, they are harder to do then understand though.  As for the last bunch of achievements the ones that require you to beat the arcade at certain difficulty levels are really tough.  You have to beat the entire game with one life, it will take a lot of practice and a lot of restarting to get them, but they are possible.\n\nOverall I'd say Bleed is a great game.  The controls are good and the mechanics are original.  It will take you between 2-20 hours depending on how many achivements you go for, and at 5$ it's amazing.

Although very difficult on their own, and quite impossible, I was just bothered that nearly every boss arena was just 4 walls and nothing else. No platforms, no nothing. Which bothered me, but mainly at the end boss. It would've made it funner, but it was not needed because I barely noticed it until the end.

Yes, every bit of it, BUT it's one of the shortest games I have ever played. To me, it is satisfying enough to maintain a decent replay value. On normal difficulty I would say that you might need an hour to finish the game from the beginning to the end. This game has rather poor animations and colour depth, but a nice retro soundtrack and excellent gameplay. If you need a challenge willing to revisit the game on it's hardest difficulty, then the sweet gameplay is all you need. If you're not the kind of person who enjoys playing the same levels multiple times, then you probably should stay away from it. \n\nThis sidescrolling action platformer contains only seven short levels with a lot of mini bosses and of course an end boss in each level. The bosses are this game's highlights. In fact, you will spend more time fighting them than fighting through the levels. None of the difficulty settings are really hard and you probably will not be frustrated at all when playing the story mode, because of its MANY check/spawn points. On the other hand you will unlock the challenging arcade mode after you completed the game once. \nIn order to achieve 100% completion you have to beat the arcade mode on the hardest difficulty level, which is one of the most difficult tasks I have ever encountered. The game itself has an extremely stylish gameplay. There are no excuses to hide behind. Just you, the game and a 100% skill. I played it using a gamepad and have to say that there's nothing to complain about the controls.

Bleed is a small 2d platformer where you control the character known as Wryn who wants to become the Greatest Hero of All Time but the heroes have already been chosen so you have to go and kill them and take you rightfull place. It is also a fast-paced action platformer which involves loads of bullets and enemies being thrown at you while you while having bullet time and control over your character at which in no point in time is trying to screw you over. The Game also and upgrades and weapons that you can purchase with points by playing the levels.\n\nWith everything but the kitchen sink coming towards your general direction it can be quite difficult trying to avoid it and you will die quite a bit at the start (Either I just suck or I'm telling the truth) but unlike most games where it insults you for dying, it doesn't really do it in Bleed, Infact half the time Wryn is actually conforting me for my loss saying things like \"Don't worry we'll get them next time\"\n\nThe Bullet time mechanic is really quite neat and helpful and also quite balanced. There is a separate bar for bullet time: Using it in short bursts will allow it to recharge a little and you will be able to use it again, Use it untill the bar goes to zero and you will have to wait untill it refills again to use bullet time once more and that could involve getting hurt when you needed it the most.\n\nI've also noticed the game is very generous in check points meaning it will not send you to the very beginning of that room or level, it's as if the developer knew that it might be a tad bit difficult on players. Now I can't really explain how it all works but just play the game and you will see what I mean.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is fantabolus (yes I purposely did that) there is not a single song that I didn't like. It fits in with the enviroment it is placed in and it has that old school 8-bit feel to it, especially the boss music.\n\nThere is also Co-op in this game, I don't anyone else to play with so yea :C but I had a look on youtube and it's quite nice. Still don't know how it works but it looks good.\n\nI have no complaints about this game: It has great fulid control, awesome soundtrack, fast-paced gameplay, a good challenge and a good price. There is however one thing that I am not fond of and that is the length of the game. while there are other things like arcade, challenge mode and other difficulties to play on, I just find this game to be a little to short and could have been better game than what is already was but hey, don't let that stop ya from buying this game cuz it is worth the price.\n\nIn conclusion I think that this is a great game to play and I had fun every single second of it and for 4.99 Its worth it all the way.....\n\n\n\n....Well what are you waiting for?

I wish there was more!!\"  Fortunately, there is Challenge Mode, where you can fight up to three bosses at once, and Arcade Mode, where you can try to complete Story Mode with only one life.

I think that infinitely spawning enemies/obstacles are bad game design, and this game uses this a lot (especially on very hard).  It requires practice and learning boss tells to finish.  I think that enemies could telegraph a little better.  There are also a few attacks that I still don't understand how to beat or evade, even though I managed to beat the boss.  That's not ideal.  Still, it's rewarding to win at this game because it's so difficult.  If you are seeking a challenging two-stick shooter, this is a good choice.\n\nAlso, use a controller.  I never use controllers, but I tried it on this game and it makes the double jump work so much better.  It's harder to aim, though, because instead of just putting your mouse near the thing you're shooting at, you need to manually correct for angles when you jump or move.

But BLEED is the only game in my opinion which really feels like a good old NES game. Actually I'm really young and I haven't played NES games when the console was new but I played a descent amount of NES games later(over 50 titels). And BLEED really captures the felling of playing an old hard Game. It's kinda like METAL SLUG but with bullet time and dashing. Some enemies really require you to dash through the air to beat them. And slowing the time down is also a must if you don't want to get hit. This game has a really great 32BIT estatic and also has an very cheerful chiptune soundtrack. It manages to feel retro and kinda new at the same time.\nAnd if you really wanna have the difficuilty like an old NES game play it on hard on arcade mode(no continues).

It's a difficult shooter, especially at the harder levels, but never unfairly so; there's frequent checkpoints, no \"gotcha\" death traps, and the bullet-time and multi-jump mechanics make for some really elegant dodging once you get the hang of them. Even the death screens are friendly and encouraging (not to mention varied enough so you won't get sick of the same Game Over screen too much).\n\nA lot of folks have commented on how short the game is; I'd personally use the word \"concise\". It gets done what it's after in a timely manner, and adding too much more would just feel like padding. Same goes for story: the game gives you just enough so that you know what your character is up to, then takes a step back and lets the gameplay take center stage until the final act.\n\nAll in all, this is a really awesome game, with a nice balance of challenge, fairness, and character.

Featuring a cool pixelated purple-haired heroine dual-wielding pistols, you can make sure this game got my attention and getting it for my birthday from a friend, I had to try it out. Is it worth buying or is this indie game just another retro platformer in the sea of retro platformers? Let's find out.\n\nThe story in Bleed isn't exactly complicated stuff. You're basically sent out to kill some ex-heroes who have turned into villains somehow over time in order to become the new ultimate hero. The game does have its own unique humor though and contains several references to oldschool platformers and clich\u00e9s. I particurarily love the level and boss descriptions and the main character has a ton of personality as every time you die, she will utter a comment about how she died, often pertaining to the level or enemy you fought. The story is pretty basic but sufficiently quirky to make it a bit unique although the gameplay is obviously the focus of the game.\n\n\nThe game plays a lot like the old classic Megaman games although with its own spin on things. The basic goal of each level, which can be played alone or co-op with a friend, is to make it through to the end and killing everything in your path, using your abilities to survive the hazards and enemies that come your way. The controls are gonna take some getting used to, especially the jumping mechanics (which confused me a bit at first as your double jump is controlled by aiming it). You're given two weapon slots and start out with dual pistols and a rocket launcher (two of my favourite weapons in any game) although as you complete each level you earn money you can use to buy new weapons and upgrades and you can change your weapon loadout at any time during the level, which expands your inventory slightly. You're also given a slowmo ability which comes in handy during certain areas and boss fights and it can be upgraded to last longer by giving you more energy, and a health bar which can be upgraded and you have infinite lives so losing is not that big of a deal, respawning you in the room you died. This is a godsend because this game is really challenging, even on the Easy difficulty. I really recommend not playing on anything but Easy when first playing this game as even that mode seriously kicked my ass on several occasions, especially since the controls feel a bit awkward at first and take some getting used to.\n\nOnce you have beat the game's 7 levels with the last one basically being a boss run, you can play through those again on higher difficulties or attempt some harder modes such as the Arcade mode (playing through the game on one life) or Challenge mode where you fight 3 bosses simultaneously on one screen. You can also unlock other characters by completing the game on other difficulties so the game does have some replay value although for me the game felt a bit too short and with not enough differences to warrant repeated playthroughs. I would've loved the ability to play more than just 7 levels personally.\n\nThe graphics are pretty decent, sporting the retro pixelated style you can expect from a retro platformer so there's not much to say about it. It feels deliciously 80's though with a lot of purple and pink used and a pretty broad colour palette. The game has a pretty good soundtrack although it just didn't stick that well with me for some reason. The main theme is pretty much the only memorable theme from the game in my opinion which is a shame. I just didn't feel the soundtrack stood out that well for me.\n\nSo overall, how good is Bleed? For me, the game is pretty average and kind of gets lost in the sea of retro indie platformers these days. Although I enjoy the style, especially the dual pistols and just the fact the game has a badass heroine and a quirky story, I found it way too short and way too difficult to really get into. The controls take some getting used to and even then I just can't find much replay value. It might be something I have the odd craving for now and then but I can't see myself playing this much.\n\nSUMMARY:\nSTORY: 5/10\nLargely forgetable and just there to serve the gameplay, although a bit quirky.\nGRAPHICS: 7/10\nColourful retro graphics, but nothing you haven't seen a million times before in other retro platformers. If you like this style, this game is probably for you but for me it just feels a bit above average.\nGAMEPLAY: 5/10\nDifficult controls take a bit getting used to giving the game a bit of an unfair difficulty level for beginners and it will take a while to get into. It's a decent platformer though and the gunplay is fun. I will have to say it's a very short game though, the only replay value is there if you somehow feel the need to play through the same levels over and over.\nSOUND: 6/10\nIt's classic 8bit style sound all the way but just doesn't stand out enough for me. I've seen this done a million times already in other indie platformers and this game just doesn't do anything unique in the sound department. It's decent and definitely fits the game, but just not memorable enough to be anything but average.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1389382271, "timestamp_updated": 1389382271, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496553", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8648805": {"recommendationid": "8648805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060432721", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456512032}, "language": "english", "review": "5 Reasons you should get this Game\n1.The Boss Fights:They are inventive,Challenging and Original\n2.The Triple Dash.In this game you have no jump instead you get 3 dashes in any direction\n3.Bullet Time.This is honestly on of the coolest feautures it allows for some of the best 'did you see that' moments\n4.The Replays.Every time you complete a playthrough on a different difficulty you will unlock new weapons some that are awesome\n5.The Speed.Bleed is a fast game it is nessecary to use bullet time to time jumps to perfection\nMy only critism would be some of the weapons feel a bit useless I have played the whole game on hard with just pistols", "timestamp_created": 1389373214, "timestamp_updated": 1389373214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499990", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8642621": {"recommendationid": "8642621", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999883652", "num_games_owned": 2833, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489351227}, "language": "english", "review": "Bleed is pretty awesome.

It satisfies \"the itch,\" even if you didn't know you had one.\n\nWhile the controls seem strange at first, once you get used to them you will have an absolute blast. Wryn (the main character) is an army of one, capable of dashing through the air multiple times, slowing down time, and utilizing an arsenal of weapons (pistols, RPGs, laser rifles, you name it) as she dodges and destroys her way through each level. All of the movements feel fluid, and it is easy to make snap judgements on the fly to avoid incoming projectiles and the like. Whevever I died, I didn't blame the game; it was almost always a mistake that could have been avoided with better play, which encouraged me to try again.\n\nI can say without a doubt that after the first playtrhough, (which doesn't take very long unfortunately with only 7 levels) I was ready to go for round 2 on the next difficulty.

This allows for the pacing to be pretty intense, and you'll want to just keep running and shooting down enemies without stopping.

There are also a bunch of unlockable weapons, characters, and challenge modes, so the game welcomes you to replay it in order to hone your skills. \n\nAnd there IS local co-op as well, which is a very nice addition.

It plays like a twitchy platforming bullet-hell shooter. \n\nThe controls are a bit weird at first, but manageable as you play more (XBox controller: Left Stick move, Right Stick fire, Right Trigger jump, Left Trigger slow-mo, Left/Right Bumpers toggle between weapons.) If you're in the air you can \"dash\" a few times by hitting jump.  KB/Mouse should work as well. Aiming at things far away is difficult with controller and probably easier with mouse, but the platforming and dodging is probably harder with KB/Mouse. I have no idea, but keep that in mind.\n\nSo the key to the game is activating slow-motion, and jumping/dashing to dodge projectiles. You have infinite ammo, and can purchase additional weapons using points acquired from playing the game, or unlock weapon variations by beating the game. You only have to manage your health and energy bars, but there are upgrades you can purchase to help out.\n\nThe game has 7 levels that get progressively harder. The action never stops as you're always fighting between \"screens\" of enemies with mini-bosses and bosses thrown in frequently. A playthrough on normal difficulty took me ~80 minutes. It is extremely easy to die, but there are checkpoints at every new section. There are no lives, so you can beat the game through repetition (think Super Meat Boy.) The more deaths you get, the less points you get, etc.\n\nYou carry two weapons at a time but can swap out while paused. There are tons of additional weapons to unlock, all with their own style of use, but basic dual pistols are kind of all you need for the majority of the game (although Shotgun helped me a LOT.) There are also additional characters with slight variations in playstyle, but they require beating the game on normal/hard/veryhard.. So if you're dedicated, you can spend a lot of time in this game.\n\nI thought this game was awesome and well designed in all categories (except perhaps story :P)... but again, you probably won't like it if you don't enjoy any of the following: twitchy platformers, bullet-hell shooters, dying frequently, playing as a girl.", "timestamp_created": 1387078110, "timestamp_updated": 1387078354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8047987": {"recommendationid": "8047987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033545086", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445341741}, "language": "english", "review": "Pixel art action/shooter game.

With different unique but yet challenging bosses and minibosses you come across each level really makes the game charming. This game reminds me a lot of the old Megaman games and I wouldn't be surprised that\u2019s where they got their idea of the menu screen from. \n\nThe story of the game got me hooked in an instant as it felt that I could relate from her ambition of becoming a superhero... really who never wanted to become a superhero before.

A shoot-em up platformer that sees the lead character attempting to make a name for herself by 'Bumping off' the great heroes of the land. \n\nIn order to take down each 'hero', you have to go through each level, each one providing many challenges. This is no easy game, gameovers can appear thick and fast and both the levels and bosses take great delight in throwing as much at you as possible. Thankfully the game avoids some pitfalls by making the controls sleek, giving off a great amount of control, especially when it comes to the games 'Double Jump' mechanic which works more like an air-dash. It can take some time getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it flows quick and fast.\n\nThat said, theres not only finishing the game to consider, theres also the score to keep up. Just like in Devil May Cry, every hit you make raises a bonus bar, hitting the top of the bar bumps you up a score level going from 'D' rank and up to S. Getting hit or letting the bar time out resets the multiplier, meaning that if you want to score big, you have to get as much hits in as possible, all while avoiding damage (easier said than done).\n\nIn conclusion: An incredibly sleek, stylish and tough as nails platformer at a cheap price point and one thats well worth grabbing and playing through (even though you may occasionally burst into rounds of swearing thanks to the difficulty)", "timestamp_created": 1385425721, "timestamp_updated": 1385425721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459662", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7753079": {"recommendationid": "7753079", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976824494", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438791369}, "language": "english", "review": "arcade style bullet time super shooter", "timestamp_created": 1385424129, "timestamp_updated": 1385424129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7752707": {"recommendationid": "7752707", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997631907", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1378673408}, "language": "english", "review": "Not wholly lacking in redeeming qualities.

So that's it for the story, but you would only play it for the gameplay of course!\n\nAs a bulletstorm you'll need to move fast and hit things as fast as you can. The level design is very well built with so many traps, different situations and are well-paced. Enemies don't vary much but they do the job and the bosses smash you to pieces! You can only carry two weapons at a time but in-game you can switch to another set but it's annoying that I can't simply change weapons with the number buttons. This is a PC game, you shouldn't go through this trouble of the two-weapon system.  Many of the weapons are generic, however, they're fun to use nonetheless.\n\nOnce you finish this short game, you can replay the different locked characters and difficulty modes. The difficulty modes in this games don't just make the characters harder to kill, they change the spawning and the behaviour of the AI. This is how games should differ their difficulty modes, not just making the enemies bullet-spongy.\n\nThe score system is nothing new but it's good. The more you kill, the higher is the classification level. Try not to die so many times and also don't suck! When you finish a level, use the points you got to buy linear and uninteresting upgrades.\n\nBleed has a pixel cartoony artstyle which I  very much like.

I personally put in more than 25 hours into it. But it's not for a single playthrough. I have to mention though that there are only 7 levels broken up into smaller sections. I played some levels many times. But more on that later. Let's start with what this game is about.\n\nThis is a fast-paced 2D side scroller with a lot of weapons, awesome game mechanics, variety of enemies and it requires some skill to complete it. There are numerous achievements to unlock some of which require hard training. Others are surprisingly simple but require you to read the description of the achievement to get the idea of how to unlock it. As for the graphics there's not much to say but it's nice and pretty in its own way and the art style is consistent and corresponds to game's theme.\n\nThis game is about a girl which I appreciate because I like games with female protagonist. So this girl wants to be a hero but there are some heroes already and her task is to defeat them and become the best hero of all times. She got herself a list of those heroes and set to work. And to 'work' your way through you'll need weapons a lot of weapons. And you'll be able to unlock more of those as you progress. I personally was able to find something to match my playstyle and you can switch between weapons which is very handy when it turns out that in order to beat a boss you need a different gun. But that is not to say that you can beat the boss only with a certain gun. It's just that for some players in some cases one is better than the other. But I found the double pistols more than enough in most cases.\n\nBut this game in not just about the guns it's also about stylish and acrobatic combat. And that is probably what won me over right away. Once I got into first level I tried it and I was amazed and felt very cool. And being stylish also allows you to increase the rank up to an S-Rank. And that's what made this game even more entertaining. To keep your rank at high level you need to keep shooting and being stylish. Not to mention that having that rank up during boss fights is what gets you majority of the achievements. So I haven' talked about how exactly you're getting stylish, have I? You can boost yourself and fly through the air for a short period of time and then do it again. So it's a bit of Matrix-style there. This gameplay mechanic is very important because it allows you to dodge projectiles, avoid being hit by enemies, escape certain death when you're about to fall into a pit after being hit and more.\n\nNow that we've talked about the variety of guns let's talk about variety of enemies. And there are many different ones and they don't feel repetitive. But you may find some of them being similar when they're trying to match or rather to give you a sense of what the boss is going to be like. There are mini bosses as well which I appreciate because they do a great job of preparing me for a boss battle. So when I meet the bastard my reflexes are ready and I already trained my projectile-avoiding skills. And speaking of bosses they're very fun to deal with and give you sense of achievement.\n\nSo what else did I do to keep myself entertained? I played it 3 more times so I beat it on every difficulty level. Which didn't seem impossible in contrast with other games where  very hard means that you only do it if you spend entire year training. But maybe it just me when it comes to some games. But again, in this case it felt very hard but not harder. I haven't tried it in arcade mode even on easy and I don't really feel like I'm going to because I died to many times. However I may fancy that one day.\n\nAt this point you'd expect some sort of conclusion and there it is. I conclude that this game is awesome and bring joy to your everyday life by being crazy fast, fun and balanced. You can argue that it's too short and I may agree with you. But it's cheap too so no regrets on my side\n\n[h1][url=store.steampowered.com/curator/8544169]More reviews from Gameaways Curator[/url][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1380234958, "timestamp_updated": 1452590838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2503408": {"recommendationid": "2503408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008399725", "num_games_owned": 714, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1380142655}, "language": "english", "review": "Great action!", "timestamp_created": 1380143089, "timestamp_updated": 1380143089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499990", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "6705234": {"recommendationid": "6705234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072893635", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507331656}, "language": "english", "review": "I rate this game pretty dope out of the scale of dope", "timestamp_created": 1379961206, "timestamp_updated": 1379961206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499990", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "6494702": {"recommendationid": "6494702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067489830", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417911272}, "language": "english", "review": "I love retro-stylized gaming, and this one is done flawlessly both with single player and co-op modes.

This game by developer Ian Campbell brings incredible gameplay with illustrious graphics to another level where it kicks you off the edge whispering into your ear \u201cdon\u2019t die.\u201d With these words of wisdom ringing in your mind you pick up the controller and begin one of the toughest fights of your life.\n\nIts games like Bleed that from the moment you watch the trailer you know that it isn\u2019t too far from your hard drive. Unlike many of those games on that hard drive, Bleed sets itself aside from others of its genre with several different elements such as the ability to slow time at the touch of a button. Bleed also leaves a lot of the main characters abilities and stats up to you, this is done through the shop that you are able to visit prior to each level. During each level, you are graded depending on how creative you are with your gameplay, and awarded coins conducive to the grade achieved at the end. These coins are what are used to purchase each upgrade and are vital to this game\u2019s progression.\n\nThe heroine of this game is Wryn, a girl with a big dreams and an even bigger arsenal. Your goal as Wryn is to become the ultimate video game hero, and in an action packed bid to claim the title for herself, she must take down the greatest heroes of all time. Bleed is focused on stylish, acrobatic dodging and fluid, challenging gameplay, where Wryn will have to use those abilities to kill hordes of enemies, endure backbreaking obstacles and overpower inventive bosses. Her bitter sarcasm after every tragic death leaves you with a personal vendetta against each level, not to mention a bruised ego.\n\nI give this game 5 broken controllers, because even on the easiest difficulty setting Bleed is more challenging than prying the crack pipe out of Whitney Houstons cold dead lips. The weaponry in Bleed focuses around heavy artillery, starting you off with twin guns and a rocket launcher. By gaining coins throughout each level you can buy new weapons such as a flamethrower or even remote mines. No need to worry about bullets, Wryn seems to have an extended clip with more rounds than the hero of your favorite 80\u2032s cop film. Bleed is fast paced, combined with an intuitive sense of time along with an attention to aiming making gameplay one of a kind.\n\nOffering an EXTRAS option in the main menu extends gameplay making Bleed\u2019s replay value higher than most. With two different modes, Arcade & Challenge, Arcade Mode can be unlocked by beating the story mode, and Challenge Mode consists of fighting bosses complete with your choice of arena. Bleed has a multiplayer option that is available anytime during the Story Mode of the single player campaign as well. Two times the power can sometimes be a burden if you can\u2019t keep up, but also provides the effectiveness needed to complete your objective. Also, each different level is replayable in whatever difficulty may suit you. This way you are able to purchase each of the upgrades and fully experience the game, taking down anything that may come in your path.\n\nAfter playing the demo and then buying the game during the Steam summer sale, in true Bleed fashion I give it a B+. Bleed catches the eye, paired with addictive gameplay and intuitive dynamics it is destined for success. Although a tough one, this game is a joy to play and even better with friends. Endless creativity at your thumbs, there isn\u2019t a bad thing I can think of when it comes to Bleed. Needless to say, the game is beautifully designed and creativity \u201cbleeds\u201d out of every scene, making this game well worth the buy.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nPlayability: 7/10\nStory: 5/10\nChallenge: 9/10\nReplay Value: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1378691549, "timestamp_updated": 1378691549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502890", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "6807117": {"recommendationid": "6807117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075832842", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513483605}, "language": "english", "review": "Through the 1st 12 minutes of Bleed that I played, it changed the way I thought of Shooting Indie games COMPLETELY.

After playing the first levels I quickly got the hang of it and could enjoy the game even more.\nI also like the challenge when you play through the game for the first time. \n\nAlso: I don't know why but I kinda didn't notice the ingame shop. This resulted in me playing through the game on hard without any items, which was of course much more challenging than playing with items, but since I like difficult games (especially platformers) I don't regret not buying anything.\n\nThe gameplay and the bosses remind me of Megaman, and I think this game is pretty much on the same level as Megaman 2 (the only Mega Man game I've played *cough*) when it comes to having fun playing the game.\n\nAll in all:\npros:\nThe controls are really smooth and once you get the hang of them you really start to enjoy this game.\nReally well designed stages and bosses\nThe various game modes are also super fun to play if you want the extra challenge. (Arcade mode and challenge mode)\nThe difficulty settings\nThe 16bit+ graphics look really nice\n\nneutral:\nThe music. It's clearly not bad, but it's also not something that gets stuck in your ears easily (unlike cave story or Mega Man)\nThe story: Honestly: it's a platformer, it doesn't need to have a great story. The great humour makes up for it though.\n\ncons:\nIt could be a little bit longer. If you're fast, you can play through this game in about 1 hour (I have also seen some speedrunners getting <15 minutes) . Honestly, this is not a huge flaw, the games is still fun to play.\n\n\nIf I had to give this game a score, I would give it an 8/10.\n\nAll in all it's a really nice fast paced game.

But don't take that as a knock on it. It's actually a really well-made game with some unique elements to it. The primary story mode is comprised of 7 levels, each of which feature a sub-boss, a final boss, and some steep challenges in between. The gameplay is typical fare (jump and shoot), but with some interesting twists. The most notable thing is the shooting mechanic, which is done is the style of twin-stick shooters (shoot in 360 degrees via the mouse or right-thumbstick). Jumping is another key mechanic with a twist - you can jump up to three times, but the jumps are more like dashes in specific directions. So you have to perform the moves with precision and forethought. The final game mechanic is \"bullet time\", in which the action slows down to a crawl, allowing you to perform crazy dodges, super-precise maneuvers, or get more shots in on bosses. In between levels, you can also buy various upgrades (new weapons, more health, etc) using points you earn by clearing levels (performing well earns more points). The controls are spot-on and the game is very forgiving, having no major penalty for death (at least in the story mode). This allows anyone to eventually be able to beat it if they are persistent enough. Bleed can be completed in around an hour or two at most on normal difficulty (and probably much less if you are really good), so it's not very long, no matter how you slice it. Replay value and longevity comes in the form of higher difficulty levels and an \"arcade mode\", which tasks you to beat the game with just 1 life (good luck with that!). For those who are into brutal challenges and high scores, there's probably enough here to justify a purchase. But if you're like me, and are now \"way too old for that shit\", it's maybe less so of a no-brainer (though I felt it was worth it, regardless). So I would say base your decision on that... If you are into tough platformers and welcome a challenge, this is well worth the money. But if you're more of a casual fan of the genre, take into account the short length for basic completion and decide whether 5 bucks is worth a couple of hours of fun. Overall, the game is solid and has some pretty cool things going for it, so I say it's worth it, but YMMV... I give it a solid B. \n\nTechnical notes: I played the game with a gamepad and it worked fine, though it did take me quite a while to wrap my head around the control scheme, which is quite unusual for games like this (left and right sticks for movement and shooting, left and right triggers for bullet-time and jumping). In retrospect, I realize it probably would have been easier to control via mouse and keyboard, due to the precision aiming a mouse provides.

Controls are tight but it can take some time to get used to the button layout. Using RT on a 360 pad to jump feels very awkward at first, but after a few minutes it starts to become second nature. The \"Slow time\" mechanic is used to great effect, allowing you to perform triple jumps and weave through enemy attacks in a graceful, satisfying manner. Boss battles are very well done and easily the high point of the action. The game offers a respectable challenge at the higher difficulty settings but it never feels overwhelming at any point. The story-mode is quite short, clocking in at about 1 hour, but the budget price makes up for it (a couple extra levels would've been just perfect, though).\n\nOverall, Bleed is an enjoyable arcade-style twin-stick shooter with some neat mechanics and a low price tag.

Nothing the game does is ever truly remarkable or original, but the near-flawless execution of fundamentals in enemy and level design definitely allow it to stand side by side with all those old-school games that it most admires.\n\nBleed adds its own little variations to the formula by allowing you to slow down time as well as a triple dash jump that can be continuously aimed. These mechanics, when used in conjunction with one another, feel satisfying and evoke the action-movie flair that the game wants to emulate so badly.\n\nThe game's only real barrier to entry may be the controls, which will take some getting used to. Trying to shoot enemies at precise angles while jumping around and slowing down time is quite the workout for your hands whether you're on a keyboard and mouse or just a gamepad. There's also some real balance issues when it comes to all the weapons you can unlock, as nothing ever feels quite as versatile as the twin pistols you start the game with, so upgrading doesn't feel quite as exciting as it should.\n\nThat said, Bleed does nearly everything right if you're on the market for a quick-fix action game.

After 10 minutes I got used to the game pad controls and trust me, the controls are so tight that you can develop a very high level of skill in this game.\n\nThe game will force you to pay high attention to evading a huge amount of projectiles flying at you and by making good use of the rechargeable bullet time (slo mo moments) you will be amazed by what crazy situations you can get out of. This is where my heart starts to beat really fast and I just think \"did I just... omg... holy sh*t... I don't even...\" The Boss fight are very hard and fair and a challenge mode lets you play against most bosses quickly without playing the level (even 3 at a time, good for short sessions).  Story mode gives you unlimited continuous and lots of checkpoints. Arcade mode lets you play the whole game in one life and damn, it was probably the most satisfying moment in my gaming life to beat the final boss with my minimum health. \n\nthere are 7 levels and 4 difficulties with 12 unique boss fights.\n\nControls:\nI do recommend to play this with an xbox360 Controller (native support). \nLeft stick to move. right stick to aim (and automatically shoot with infinite ammo)\nLT (hold) activate slo mo. RT jump + dash up to 3 times per jump in any direction.\nwith dashes and slo mo you can wiggle your way out of many situations.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Local multi player is not awesome but it makes the game harder since both drain the same slo mo time and the camera only follows one person. I guess it was experimental.\n- Also the story is just there to justify the scenes. Don't expect too much there.\n- Semi Automatic weapons are not good for the game pad. This could be fixed by a laser pointer (do it plz)\n- It is short, but considering that this is a one man dev team game for 5 bucks it is still awesome.\n\nIf you like the above mentioned games, then you can be sure that bleed will give you a nice gameplay experience.", "timestamp_created": 1372978376, "timestamp_updated": 1385490340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691160", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "4944622": {"recommendationid": "4944622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043609914", "num_games_owned": 1903, "num_reviews": 362, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1374862259}, "language": "english", "review": "Bleed is a game thats gonna be missed by alot of people but it shouldnt be.

It's a challenging platformer/shooter, rising to genuinely hard in arcade mode.  While the default controls are awkward at first, but work well once you get accustomed to them.  The movement and shooting are very smooth and responsive, such that my deaths were usually due to lack of skill than problems with the interface.  The seven levels include some minor enemies and platforming challenges.  The real appeal are the boss fights, usually two per level, and all varied and unique.\n\nThough the main campaign is quite short, there are plenty of challenges, including arcade mode (one life, no healing); the arena, fighting up to three of the bosses; and replaying with the unlockable characters.  This should combine to more than enough playtime for the price.  There's an plot, but it and the fourth wall are pretty flimsy.  The main non-gameplay appeal lies in the vibrant art style and  peppy humour.   The music isn't great, but is servicable.\n\nMy biggest criticism is the lack of an \"Restart from Checkpoint\" option.  Trying to get the achievements for beating the bosses with maximum rank often requires suiciding after mistakes, which can take time and increase frustration.  The difficulty curve is a bit wonky too.

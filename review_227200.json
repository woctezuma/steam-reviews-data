The end game is a mess; there's very little exposition so it's hard to know what's going on and at least for me the choice at the end was completely unclear. And the ending itself isn't explained at all... I *think* I know what happened, but it's also possible I blew up the planet, launched a planet destroying missile at the earth, or who knows. There's a fair amount of annoying grinding involved in getting the \"good\" ending, which is unfortunate in an otherwise really well paced game.\n\nThere are a fair number of bugs: don't play on 3440x1440 as it causes the mouse to behave erratically and makes some of the puzzles unfinishable. Playing in a window doesn't lock the mouse, so you'll constantly be clicking and draging stuff on your desktop. Cutscenes for choices that you didn't make will trigger sometimes, which is mostly just annoying but doesn't seem to break anything. It's possible to get screwed out of the \"good\" ending through no fault of your own; it's also possible to deadlock your game forcing you to start over if you do certain things without any forewarning. If you're a little obsessive about tidying up and exploring you're probably gonna run into bugs and have a bad time.\n\nThe main character is pretty well written as an unlikeable, autistic, and somewhat incompetent science dork, and the supporting cast is great. A bit more world building would be nice; I was especially surprised when [spoiler]I was relieved to finally make it back to base to find that it was literally just a desk and inexplicably a basketball court[/spoiler].\n\nI got it with a bundle and it was definitely worth playing through.

It has a story and plot, and a number of different goals that you will have along the way. Most of the goals are either based on exploration, or increasing the number of life forms to unlock certain doors. The gameplay is largely exploration using your character (a human astronaut in a space suit with jetpack), and planty and tending to the \"gardens\" (essentially a series of isolated ecosystems).\n\nThis is a very unique concept, and definitely appeals to me on both the space storyline as well as the whole ecosystem angle. The artwork is gorgeous, and the soundtrack fitting. However, it's not a perfect game. The puzzles are weak (it would have been great to see them create more unique puzzles using this setup) and the dialogue is cheesy (think a cheesier version of character interaction on \"The Martian\"). However, neither of these two things is a deal killer, and in spite of these flaws it deserves the praise it has received. I think this game represents a considerable improvement over the Spider game (which had awesome puzzles, but was repetitive and lacked a a great story). So I'm a little disappointed to see the developer go back to the Spider series.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n  [*] Well-done ecosystem simulator and plant/animal interactions.\n  [*] Imaginative idea and great mysterious storyline (reminescent of Clarke).\n  [*] Beautiful artwork\n  [*] It's just fun to explore\n  [*] Great idea to combine goal-oriented gameplay and simulation.\n  [*] Use of minority characters.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n  [*] Weak character dialogue. (Doesn't sound very authentic and like a way real people interact outside of low-budget sci-fi)\n  [*] Puzzles pretty much 100% consist of \"grow enough lifeforms\". It would have been nicer to require certain lifeforms in various areas to solve puzzles, or more exploration puzzles centered around using explosives and other types of seed pods.\n[/list]",

That's the biggest strength of the game.\n\nThe amount of content and the whole endgame is great for a small studio game. \nFinish all sublevels optimally (tedious) to unlock the real ending through a last ordeal. \n\nThere are uglier indies out there for sure. Controls aren't great but no dealbreaker. \nStill, the whole technical package is very decent buuut...\n\n...here comes the pain:\nEven though voiceacting is competent, there's no spark to it at all. The game's rhythm is supported by lots of chitchat with your crew members. Since the art ist pretty uninteresting, even bleak, that was, in theory the right idea. However, the crew is a diversity caricature. \nComic relief robot went to Jarjar Binks' comedic academy. \nBlack science grrl is a disaster.

Besides, space broads are not twenty-two but rather unattractive middle age engineers and physicists.\n\nThe asian hero is more believable, but lacks, dunno, something. Action oriented games would have had an easy time painting at least some kind of adverserial backstory fighting demons or whatnot. \n\nSo why not come up with something? There's so much talking, frowning, briefing and so on. \nIt's neither dramatic, funny nor interesting. Think Metal Gear series radiochat without the good cringe and the lunacy.\n\nAnd instead of first establishing Mars with its unique environment, your're nonstop in those extremely boring red caves. There's some slightly less boring caves hours into the game but generally it's red caves 80%. Two minutes after the game begins, you stumble unto alien life just so. All the jabbering between the crew does not give the player the idea about an awesome find being investigated. It's rather confusing.\nThese things kill the atmosphere which this spartan game with its tone of hard scifi is in dire need. \n\nAlso, for a game that comes across as sciency, there's practically zero edutainment but lots of \"energy\" this, \"I'll upload an improved software code for your boosters\" that. \n\nThe last straw was the unforgiving attitude of the gameplay.

The artwork is beautiful, the story is engaging, the voiceacting is excellent, and the cool electronic/ambient music sountrack is also very good. \n\nIn addition, and most importantly, the gameplay is fun. In fact, as good as the story is, it is the gameplay that ultimately makes this a good game, as you have to find out how the different plants/lifeforms interact and grow them in certain combinations. In essence, it's a 2D  puzzle platformer, but I feel like the game is especially unique within the genre, with this scifi alien world exploring farmer/zookeeper idea.The feeling of growing the flora and fauna on mars and \"bringing life back to the planet\" is a rewarding one. There are some grindy elements to the game, as you have to periodically restock on the right items, especially fertilizer, but it doesn't take very long so I don't ultimately feel this detracts much from the experience, especially considering the map system which makes it very easy to teleport around to the parts of the map that give you the items you need.

Waking Mars: a spacey 2D exploration/puzzle game.\nYou and your colleague are the first humans on Mars.  Your mission: to explore the strange and wondrous Martian cave system that near the end of the 21st century, has been found to harbor life (plant looking, bioluminescent life)!  In this 2D Side-scrolling exploration game, you\u2019ll solve ecological puzzles, figure out if humans are alone, and try to recover the lost artificial intelligence OCTO with the help of your own A.I., ART.\n\nSo is Mars all that it\u2019s hyped up to be?\n\nFirst off, I want to give a shout out to the developers of this game for choosing two people of color to represent their characters.  It\u2019s been rare (but increasingly less so), to see an asian male lead, and a supporting black female lead in any kind of media platform, especially video games.  On that note, the characters are wonderfully voiced the whole time there is any dialogue (and there is a LOT of dialogue).  The game does a great job connecting the dialogue with the 2D world in ways I hadn\u2019t imaged possible for a 2D game; I was really tied down, playing a few days consecutively.  \n\nIn most cases the objective of Waking Mars was to raise the biomass levels of cave rooms with the different species of life you\u2019d encounter inside the red planet.  The biomass indicator is at the top right of screen, and has a 1-5 star rating, with 5 being the highest.  The more lifeforms in one cave that you reproduced, the higher the mass.  Towards the end of the game, the 5 star rating greatly helps you get to the end of the game.  I found that after I finished most of the progression, and focused mostly on perfecting biomass throughout the whole map, I lost a bit of interest.  It became a bit repetitive fast traveling through the cave systems, taking seeds from one area to another for transplant.  Figuring out just which species would do the best in any given area could take a bit of thinking, and more than I\u2019d want to devote in some sittings.  Typically, Ledon Zoa create the most biomass (the tallest looking ones, with the floaty seeds).\n\nTying it all together was a sense of peaceful exploration with no repercussions for death on normal mode, unlimited fuel for your jetpack, and aesthetically pleasing music that accompanied this \u201cpeaceful\u201d feeling.  There isn\u2019t really much room for improvement because I think it\u2019s the best game that it could be.  If any request I have lingering, I hope a borderless window mode could be apart of a future patch, and a sequel!  \n", "timestamp_created": 1504142175, "timestamp_updated": 1504142175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485343", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34616379": {"recommendationid": "34616379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051347651", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504213743}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty cool, interesting idea and good execution\nnice UI and intuitive controls\ncalm gameplay, won't get you worked up if you play not long before sleep", "timestamp_created": 1504121401, "timestamp_updated": 1511736764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468750", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34219605": {"recommendationid": "34219605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018999638", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502648052}, "language": "french", "review": "Petit jeu vraiment plaisant.\nOn se sent l'ame d'un jardinier marsien et c'est plut\u00f4t original.\nDe plus les graphismes sont int\u00e9ressants et le gameplay est tr\u00e8s facile \u00e0 prendre en main.", "timestamp_created": 1502648179, "timestamp_updated": 1502648179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34195510": {"recommendationid": "34195510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040919135", "num_games_owned": 513, "num_reviews": 193, "playtime_forever": 1122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514003956}, "language": "english", "review": "I had a lot of fun with this game, its essentially just an exploration and gardening simulator game on mars but I enjoyed its story and gameplay.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1502557204, "timestamp_updated": 1502557204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33959193": {"recommendationid": "33959193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372747910", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501659315}, "language": "english", "review": "At first I was a bit skeptical about this game; not sure what to think...\nBut after only playing about 10 minutes I was hooked.\nThis game has:\n- A great, interesting story\n- Engaging exploration\n- SCIENCE (figure out how all the organisms work; it's very intuitive)\n- Loads of secret passages to discover\n- Challenging puzzles\n- Sweet controls\n- Atmospheric soundtrack\nWaking Mars is truly a game that won me over.

I didn't read too much about it, but from what I gathered it looked like your dime a dozen side scrolling platformer. After starting it initially, the game crashed. That was a bummer. Restarting it worked though. Initially the voices did not work, so I thought I was going to be reading the whole game. Another restart fixed that as well. I was happy to hear that the voice acting is this game was well done and not cheesy. I then realized that there is no combat in this game. I assumed all the creepy plants in the screenshots were enemies. The entire gameplay of Waking Mars consists of literally waking mars. You are planting seeds everywhere and starting life on the planet. Some of the plants hurt you though, and there are a few hazards to avoid. I found the simplistic gameplay fun and the biomass tasks rewarding. Character movement felt a little awkward at first, but I quickly adapted to it. Most of the areas you travel in look the same, but I appreciated the environments and ecology in game. The story is engaging as well. It isn't revolutionary by any means, but it kept my interest. The \"I'm a funny robot\" cliche is kind of tired. I completed all the endings (I think). I finished in about 9 hours, and I was surprised it lasted that long. I appreciate length in games like this.\n\nI highly recommend if you enjoy a chill, not difficult game.

With the sheer number of 'Metroidvania' titles out there anymore, this one does not immediately stand out with its somewhat drab visuals.. However, even an hour with the game will expose it to be something different and, perhaps, deeper than your standard game of this genre.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference here is the means of progression. Most science fiction games are incredibly light on science with the setting being a pretense for futuristic gunfights with monsters. Waking Mars on the other hand feels more authentic, placing you in the role of a scientist who peacefully navigates the planet of Mars. Instead of fighting the inhabitants of the planet, you are rebuilding a dead ecosystem through careful management of the organisms in a manner that vaguely recalls Pikmin. The mixture of these lite strategy elements with Metroid-like exploration delivers a game that is honestly like nothing else on the market at present. Despite the non-violent premise, the action never feels boring with a complex world, interesting puzzles, and solid platforming.\n\nWe likewise get a thoughtful story that avoid most of the common video game cliches. Instead of an evil mastermind or mindless monsters driving the conflict, the struggle of the characters is one against the harsh environment of this alien world and is, to a lesser extent, questions of ethics. There is a surprising amount of drama here, and it makes you wonder why more games can't try this sort of man vs nature type of approach. This is hard sci-fi for fans of authors like Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, and as someone within that camp, it's incredibly satisfying. Waking Mars also gets points for its diverse cast that lacks even a single white male character and stars a British-accented Asian man and an African-American woman. The characters in this game could have come from basically any demographic, but developer Tiger Style went out of their way to represent groups usually not seen in games. The dialogue is smart, furthering the credibility of the science in the game, and the voice actors fit the parts they were cast very well, sounding comfortable and intelligent.\n\nAll in all, Waking Mars is a refreshing game in just about every way, and while it's not an entirely obscure game, due to it appearing in a number bundles, it deserves to be mentioned much more frequently than it is. With this game now being five years old, it does not seem that Waking Mars had the influence on game design and storytelling that it should have, but it stands as a shining example of how science fiction video games can be every bit as insightful and thoughtful as other media. The fact that it is an entertaining game to play, as well, is the icing on the cake.

Despite how it looks and what the Steam tags say, this is neither an adventure game nor a platformer, but more of an exploration puzzle game. You are exploring a cave system on Mars, gradually discovering various interacting lifeforms of a once-thriving ecosystem. It's up to you to restore some of this ecosystem by gathering seeds, and planting them in places where they're most useful. For instance, by providing food for some critter, which you need to multiply so you can feed them to another critter, producing fertilizer so you can grow bigger plants.\n\nThe ecosystems are not particularly deep (which is good, since otherwise they'd get overwhelming), but deep enough that it's a joy to see a restored one at work, with plants waving around, and critters going about their business, eating and getting eaten.\n\nYou move around with a jetpack with unlimited fuel, which is fun.

You play a trapped scientist exploring an subterranean Martian ecosystem, and the only way to survive is to learn how the mysterious organisms coexist and manipulate those relationships to progress through the cave.\n\nYou have no weapons, tools, or keys, except for the seeds of the creatures that surround you, and each room requires a different combination of organisms, planted in fertile soil, to survive the unique conditions there and open the way deeper into Mars' crust.  It is not a fast-paced experience, but it is rewarding.\n\nIt is easy to recommend this game, but it is harder to decide to whom the game is best recommended.  It's nominally an action platformer, but both the action and the platforms are in short supply.  I think it's a management game more than anything else.  You have a supply of seeds, and a series of challenges to overcome with that inventory.  Some rooms will produce surplus seeds for you; others will require seeds from elsewhere to be completed.  \n\nThen you get your hands on the self-propagating pH-altering spores and things get a little frantic while you try to meet your goals without your carefully balanced rooms disintegrating.\n\nThe story is well written and the voice acting is excellent.  The characters are skillfully realized.  The graphics are pretty, for sprites, and the music is good.  The gameplay has some rough edges, but nothing worth a thumbs down.  Mostly you will get information about new species that you don't think you've earned, and whenever a cutscene gets triggered you lose control of your character.  I never got dumped into magma or similar danger, but I think it could happen.

You can read the other reviews for what people like about the game, and I agree with some of that.  It is really neat to see the different ecosystems in each room grow and flourish.  My review will just detail the reason I quit playing.\n\nMy big problem with the game, and the reason I quit playing after enjoying it for a few hours, is that simple mistakes can be too catastrophic.  It's fine to have a way for players to screw up.  A \"fail state\" is healthy for most games.  But usually that means just trying again, resetting the level.  The basic premise of this game is that you must create enough plants/creatures that are worth life points, and upon reaching a certain amount of life points in that room, you can move on to the next area.  I went ahead and threw some plants down in one room, not really thinking much of it.  Before I knew it, one particular plant (spores) had overrun the entire room, killing off everything else.  These plants are worth very few life points, so I needed to replace them with something more impressive.  I then realized that these spores had also ruined all of the fertile patches of ground, so that I could not plant the good things that would actually help me.  To undo this plague, I needed another plant (lava plant) that I didn't have the seeds for.  To get those seeds, I had to wander all over the map just hoping to encounter a lava plant.  There's no indication on the map of where you can get particular seeds, you just have to memorize where you might have left one of those plants.  It took me a while, but I eventually found ONE of the seeds that I needed, that I had apparently missed when collecting them before.  I think if I hadn't left that one seed behind before, I may have soft-locked the game.  Anyway, with this one lava seed I was able to destroy all the spores, as the lava overtook the room in a similar fashion to how the spores had.  The lava plants were still not worth enough life points, though, and I would have to go through another couple layers of destroying and replanting everything through various methods if I wanted to finally get things running.  Upon realizing how long this would take, I just gave up.  Trying to fix this mistake had become far too monotonous, and AFAIK there is no way to reset the level to just try again.  You're stuck spending forever cleaning it all up.\n\nThis wasn't even the first time that placing an incorrect plant had awful consequences-- earlier I came across a tunnel with a couple of acidic fertile patches.  I had encountered only one type of plant that could be placed on these so far, so I went ahead and planted them there.  As it turns out, the only way to beat this level was to let loads of creatures march back and forth through this tunnel so that they can bring seeds back to their hive and reproduce.  If I had not placed my carnivorous plants, this would be very easy.  It would be an automatic win.

But while its non-violent take on the genre is unique, it isn't by itself enough to make an entertaining game. As I mentioned, the difficulty level is almost non-existent; despite its pretense, the Martian ecology it presents is extremely superficial and you can spam seeds to achieve victory. Or you could if you had sufficient numbers of seeds; you can only carry a handful of each and too often I had to scurry between caves looking for a specific plant to re-supply my stocks. This made the latter half of the game rather more of a grind than anything else. The lack of variety in levels is also a sore spot, and I quickly got tired of seeing the same red walls.

You can also encounter areas which are fairly hard to achieve a desirable sustainability.

It starts out pretty strong, there's a solid story throughout, the visuals are decent, the planting mechanics seem pretty interesting. For the first three chapters the game is quite linear, and the fourth (and longest chapter) opens up a little though I would never say it's that exploration-heavy, or much of a metroidvania.\n\nBut the game really starts to drag around chapter 4, with increasingly tedious work needing to be done to hit 4 and 5 level biomasses for the rooms. Thankfully there's an event that doubles the effectiveness of these right near the end, so if you hit 30 you're basically done.

O jogo tem arte, efeitos sonoros e jogabilidade muito bons, mas o destaque do jogo \u00e9 sua est\u00f3ria e a mec\u00e2nica de planta\u00e7\u00e3o/eco sistema, mas o que mais me fisgou foi a liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre as duas. Os personagens s\u00e3o muito interessantes e te influenciam a pesquisar cada uma das esp\u00e9cies alien\u00edgenas e voc\u00ea faz isso enquanto compre os outros objetivos sem nem perceber. O sistema de rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre as sementes, plantas adultas e o ambiente em si s\u00e3o um enorme pluzzle com mais de uma resposta onde aquele que pensa r\u00e1pido e bem realmente \u00e9 recompensado com menos trabalho (como ter que erradicar uma planta que voc\u00ea mesmo plantou e est\u00e1 afetando seus planos), o jogo tamb\u00e9m tem 3 finais (os dois \u00faltimos s\u00e3o trabalhosos de desbloquear), realmente uma experi\u00eancia \u00fanica.

The game features good artwork, sound effects and gameplay, but the highlight of the game is its story and the mechanics of planting / eco system, but what hooked me was the connection between the two. The characters are very interesting and influence you to research each of alien species and you do it as complete other goals without even realizing it. The connection system between the seeds, adult plants and the environment itself is a huge pluzzle with more than one answer where one who thinks fast and well really are rewarded with less work (like having to eradicate a plant that yourself planted and is affecting your plans), the game also has three finals (the last two are laborious to unlock), truly a unique experience.

This game does an excellent job being adventurous without losing the theme of experimentation, exploration, and logic. It is a short but thoroughly enjoyable game and I'm happy I spent the money on it.\n\nPros:\n-Great port to PC. I believe this was originally an APP, but it was ported to PC very well. Using mouse/keyboard or gamepad, the controls were wonderful and I didn't have a single glitch or crash.\n-Simple mechanics- Tossing seeds and floating on my jetpack. Super easy, but to balance the ecosystem, you need to do some planning. Challenging but not obnoxious.\n-Beautiful art AND music- This game nailed it with their art direction. Everythign is beautifully drawn and the music is appropriately surreal.\n-Great story- A nice storyline with two (four if you count AIs) memorable characters. You start off just searching for a lost robot and stumble upon so much more!\n-Three endings- You're given several options on how to end the game, each one with it's own footage.\n\nCons: \n-No room for a sequel-\n-Short-\n-Could benefit from some sort of \"build your own ecosystem\" map.

What can I say, the recent indie games please me more than popular brands. If you are looking for mega graphics then just pass by, and if you want to turn your brain to think a little, enjoy a beautiful story and finally awaken Mars, you should definitely try it! \nRecommend 10/10\n\nStory = Interesting / pretty good\nGameplay = really good\nGraphics = good (aside from cutscenes / dialoges)\nGuidance = overwhelming to the point of confusion\nControls = pretty good\nVoice acting = decent\nReplay value = not really... once 100% completed, why bother?\n\nOverall = Well worth the money, even at full price.\n\nSumary: I haven't completed a game in quite a long time... and I've never once gotten 100% achievements unlocked for any game. But this game was compelling enough for me to keep going and actually get it 100% completed. I'll admit that it got a little frustrating / confusing towards the end and I ended up resorting to some outside guidance through steam discussions in order to figure out my next move, but I'm sure I could have eventually figured it out on my own if I had that kind of patience. The 3 endings for the game (not including the optional pre-mature exiting the cave ending) really helped keep me interested in re-loading the game to see the other endings, and of course, the other endings kept getting better and better. The voice acting was a bit weird in places though. Like the 3rd ending  her reaction was a little anti-climactic and didn't really feel like a realistic reaction. As far as the guidance goes... the game really tries to help you out throughout the entire game, it even gives you an interface of details for each species in the game which helps a lot, unfortunately, if you forget something task related, or make a big mistake (namely the explosive seeds when you first get them and ending related areas)... it's possible to end up being stuck in the game with no clue how to progress further since you can't get the cutscenes / dialogs to repeat, so make sure to read and listen very well the first time.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the game.

Waking Mars doesn't have to do much to stand out from such a thin crowd. And yet Tiger Style went above and beyond to make the game a standard-setting platformer on its own merits.\n\nThis is yet another mobile game that doesn't feel at all like a mobile game. The controls are tight and smooth. The art assets are gorgeous, including the face close-ups which accompany all the dialogue. The voice actors are engaged and well-directed.\n\nMuch has been made of the Metroid roots of the title. The chatty trio of protagonists somehow feel more alone on Mars than silent Samus did on Zebes. Tasks must be completed and resources collected in order to press forward. Paths branch and reconnect, many of them essentially optional. Still, Waking Mars feels like its own game rather than a derivative. The primary mechanic of the game - using alien seeds to establish life in the depths of a cave slowly waking from centuries of slumber - is novel and intuitively implemented. Waking Mars is no reskinned shooter.\n\nWhat most impressed me was the way the curtain was lifted on the final element of revelation. To some extent the game suffers from tutorial syndrome as your helpful companions chatter along; they always seem to be one step behind your own grasp of what you need to do. But the understanding of just what might really be going on under the regolith is something the game lets you deliciously realize on your own. This quiet revelation is well-paced with just the right hints along the way. The game is short, but it's full nonetheless and ends exactly where it should. The endings are brief but satisfying.\n\nIt's absolutely worth picking up, especially if it's on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1434675187, "timestamp_updated": 1434675187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16433277": {"recommendationid": "16433277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087713157", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423414537}, "language": "english", "review": "Waking Mars is truly the closest to a scientific game you can get without encluding any real science. You have the scientific method, and that's about it. You're given a journal, basic jetpack controls, and let out to play around on the inner caves of Mars. Seeds will spawn plants alarmingly quickly, and you record the attributes of the various animals and plants while balancing the populations in order to reach a \"life force\" cap to go to the next bit. It's a nice idea but after only like 5 plants it slows to a crawl as they drastically increase the cap necessitating hours of repetitive violent gardening.

So I bought it hoping it would be something good and fun. And it was a correct choice, let me tell you why. The game is based on platormer gameplay where you fly around with a jet pack, you pick up various seeds and then plant organisms. These are different and there is actually a layer of research of these lifeforms which was quite interesting. Main point of almost each level is to gain most (or maximum) biomass in order to progress further. You do this while trying to balance the environment because all the different ogranisms want to kill each other. It was fun but did get very tedious and repetitive in some levels. Overall the visuals and art style are simple but pretty. You can see this looks like a flash game and it is also visible that this is a mobile game. But it's a good port and the narrative, story and gameplay are enjoyable. Also several endings are a plus (although I feel like the secret ending is a copy from Mission to Mars).

The dialogue is well-written, all characters are well differentiated, and I'd say the highlight of the game is the story -- which is a lot harder scifi than I expected.  A pleasant surprise.\n\nGameplay is based off of studying and manipulating an alien ecosystem, with no weapons to speak of.  In particular, figuring out how to make each life form produce its seed pod, which can be used for many different functions, is vital.  It's one of those games that puts you in an unfamiliar situation, where you have to figure out what you can do all by yourself -- and unlike some of them, it pulls it off neatly.\n\nThe game IS short though.  It took me a little under 10 hours for a blind 90% complete playthrough.  Since I got it on sale for $2, it blew my socks off.  If I had to pay the full $10, or maybe $5-7 on a cheaper sale...?

It's concept is unique and really stands out from other gaming experiences. Simply put, the gameplay consists in gardening, which may sound like one of those shitty simulators at first, but it's so much more than that. For each plant you grow, you increase Mars's biomass (at least the cavern's) and you are truly \"waking up\" the planet from a life that existed a long time ago. The art and the soundtrack are also pleasant aspects of Waking Mars. If this has not convinced you yet, consider this: you are on Mars. You are an astronaut. You maneuver the character using a jetpack that's more fluid than AC Unity's controls. You wake up Mars on search of intelligent alien life. This title is worth more than your time and it's truly an original experience. On another hand the achievement hunting is not really a challenge to the player, but that's up to you if that's a pro or a con.

Well, it has nonexistential difficulty, so all them hipsters won't have gray hair in their beards. It has weird \"artsy\", but pleasant graphics. It has forgetable, but soothing OST, charged extra. And of course it has pretentions, stupid as fuck plot, so all of them herbivore gals and guys can boast, how deep the message of this piece was. Hello everybody, and welcome to Waking Mars review!\n\nThis game is everything i essentially hated in indie games. Pretentions, artsy, making no sense, and of course multiplatform (and with graphics which helps run it on every fucking Apple hardware ever created). After some time, it grew on me to the point, where i dont give a crap and can rip Waking Mars (and similar titles) a new one without thinking about how stupid the entire premise is. Oh well. Lets roll.\n\nGame takes us to year 2xwhogivesacrapx. We are an astronaut, our mission is to tinker around Mars, and see what we can find. After a short, but rather stupid mistake we made, the entrance caves in behind us. Now we must make our way to a secondary base. Plot is way deeper than that, but i dont want to spoil it. Its really stupid, and makes no sense, but this \"mystery\" will probably be the olny thing, which is interesting. Ish. \n\nGameplay is really basic, dare i say, designed to play on mobile devices. And it shows pretty much. We are flying around, throwing stuff and sometimes makes some really simple dodging. Puzzle game 101. Sadly, i dislike puzzle platformers to begin with, especially painfully easy ones, but i promised, i wont harp on it too much. So i wont. The olny thing I want to adress, game feels grindy at times, which is not that great. \n\nGraphics is artsy. That is all there is to say. I neither liked nor disliked it. Hand drawn, but not really my kind of thing. Moving on.\n\nMusic is sadly forgettable. I dont remember any song from the game, and I even bought OST. Sound effects, and especially voice acting on the other hand, is really, really good. It feels natural and pleasant. \n\nWaking Mars is an easy game. The time I spend on it, i managed to perfect it, and i would do it faster if not for the fact,  that im a bit lazy, and i specifically played this game while eating meals, so effectivelly did it with one hand (btw thats what she said apparently). Its good for beginners, achievment whores, such as myself, people who like pretentions and artsy games and apple fanboys. Everybody else will find little value in this game. ITs mediocre, but it have some good elements, so im giving it a recommendation. \n\nYes, this review is mainly to piss off apple fanboys, with each year they are more and more agressive in their conquest to make every game artsy and casual. \"Dis gaem doznt work on my apple!\" Buy yourself a gaming platform man...\n\nZawisza out.", "timestamp_created": 1432051786, "timestamp_updated": 1432052390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15901109": {"recommendationid": "15901109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132102007", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461305768}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game as part of a humble bundle, and I really enjoyed it.\nMake sure you see the 3 different endings... or are there 4?", "timestamp_created": 1432047506, "timestamp_updated": 1432047506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15891426": {"recommendationid": "15891426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152631556", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489018043}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a really driven story and does a wonderful job portraying the characters, the puzzles aren't too difficult but I also haven't finished the game yet, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle plat formers or a driving story line and it's excellent if you love both.", "timestamp_created": 1431986128, "timestamp_updated": 1431986128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15864405": {"recommendationid": "15864405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042757315", "num_games_owned": 671, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421297019}, "language": "english", "review": "My first impression of this game was that of a cheap alien shooter with a jetpack. OOooooh how I was wrong. Sure its graphics are far from impressive, but that's not what they were aiming for.\n\nNow I'll start with what I enjoyed the most of this. The soundtrack. The music is so strange and unique, so it fits this alien world perfectly. But, truly, many of the tunes are just great tunes! You can check it out in the DLC, its free! \n\nWhat I'll remember most profoundly about this game is how unique it was. Its system is unlike any other game out there. Sure, it borrows a few generic concepts from Metroid, so yeah, its a Metroidvania game (but those are awesome!). But it differs in that theres no combat in the usual sense, no weapons, no direct attacking. Rather, you throw seeds around and grow different plants that have unique abilities, to suit your needs. Got hurt from acid or nasty plants? Grow a healing plant. Want to water a dry area to grow more plants? Grow a water plant. Then theres more unusual situations of having to grow predatorial plants to eat the \"enemies\"... but I digress.\n\nAnother unique thing is that there is no enemies, nor antagonist for that matter. Sure, the wildlife you encounter might attack you, but only if you invade their territory or get too close for comfort. They just mind their own business, being generally neutral, like the wild in real life. Its nice not to have stupid cliched \"bad guys\", and it just works! \n\nIts all about the exploration. This game is surprisingly deep and you'll have much to discover, everytime adding a new entry in a nifty little encyclopedia (like a Pokedex), giving you hints on how to interact with things in interesting ways. The game is very smart in how it always manages to surprise you. It presents you with a new lifeform, and you just gotta... experiment with it. Its really fun and I'm not gonna spoil any details. \n\nIf theres one thing that it fails at, sadly, is replayability. Its very long and tedious at times, but it was worth it to see what happens next. If you already know what next, however, theres very little incentive to go through the hoops a second time.  I'd replay it in a heartbeat with a friend though, to showcase it!\n\nAll in all, I REALLY recommend this game and strongly encourage game developpers to take a gander at it, this hidden gem of originality.", "timestamp_created": 1431830948, "timestamp_updated": 1431830948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15837783": {"recommendationid": "15837783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068761861", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499939634}, "language": "french", "review": "L'art de cr\u00e9er des \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes et de mener des recherches sur des esp\u00e8ces v\u00e9g\u00e9tales martiennes hostiles ou pacifiques...\nTr\u00e8s bon jeu original par son gameplay et son ambiance.\nIl est un peu court mais c'est le genre de jeu auquel on rejouera volontier quelques mois plus tard.", "timestamp_created": 1431692183, "timestamp_updated": 1431692324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15807820": {"recommendationid": "15807820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056571790", "num_games_owned": 4632, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431481389}, "language": "english", "review": "This title was sitting in my queue for a while, and finally decided to have a run through it, and what a nice run through it was.

This is pure sci-fi, with a very good story, well-written and well exposed. You play a scientist and explorer who explores a martian cave with an emphasis on research and scientific facts gathering. After some time, you start to understand how the pseudo-animals and pseudo-plants are working together and you can plant a \"seed\" here, remove a \"plant\" there, feed \"animals\" here, change the type of terrain here to plant another kind of \"seed\"... and eventually, you get the desired result to continue your progression. Hazards are not so dangerous, and there is no fighting at all (just the avoiding of some lifeforms that may harm you in some places/phases). Your job is just to understand what's happening and what's in front of you, and how it all works together, so you can use it and make progress in the caves.\n\nAdmittedly this is a game made for tablets and phones, as a few negative comments are pointing out ; but these people stopped too soon in the game (considering their time recorded in the game). Actually, there is lots of meat to this game, lots of things to discover and understand, lots of different lifeforms -most of them interact with each other- and lots of places to explore. If you like the game you're going to spend at least 12 hours there (this is the time needed for completing the game a first time and get one of the endings). The last remnants of the old martian lifeforms are dwelling in this cave, you're going to explore it, and eventually discover the secrets of Mars. The art is good, I love the style. The graphics are more than adequate (even if that's a mobile port). The music is very good. This is very atmospheric and the game made me completely lost track of time several time. \n\nThere is almost no platform gaming in this game. Flying around with a jetpack is fun (you'll be occasionally walking and/or crawling too). But this is never really difficult and the rest is pure exploration, observation of the ecosystem and use of its natural behavior to help your own goals and progress.", "timestamp_created": 1428513380, "timestamp_updated": 1428513380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15255098": {"recommendationid": "15255098", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999226832", "num_games_owned": 948, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1357718400}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game.", "timestamp_created": 1428436741, "timestamp_updated": 1428436741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15245439": {"recommendationid": "15245439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073206334", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428379649}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful.

Really.  And it is quite good.\n\nBasically, life has been discovered on Mars.  You are one of the astronauts who has been sent to explore said life on Mars.  You make first contact with them and discover that they are these plant-like lifeforms, that produce seeds, which you can use to plant more of them.  There are also, conveniently, barriers that open when you have enough of them growing.\n\nThat last bit might seem like a convenient gameplay mechanic, but it actually ties into the story.  Yes, a surprisingly intriguing story follows from all this.  The whole game took me about 11 hours to complete, and I can vouch that the story is interesting.\n\nThe game is an exploration-heavy metroidvania, consisting of interconnected areas to explore and grow things in.  There is a certain depth of strategy to how to grow things, since different things have different biomass values, and you need to exceed a certain biomass value to proceed, or to unlock other features.  Also, you can pick up some seeds, but not others, and not all terrain is suited for planting all things.  And then there are more complex mysteries that lie deeper within...\n\nYour exploration is punctuated by your contact with your fellow crew members -- one person back at base, and one AI who is a little annoying (and the other characters lampshade this).  These characters are okay -- if anything, their voice acting is better than their actual scripts, which are a little redundant.  That said, the characters are (needless to say) part of the plot.  And there are even multiple endings.\n\nIn fact, you could actually make this game more like a silent-protagonist Metroid-like game with a strong element of the player learning game mechanics without being told -- I mean, heck, that's basically what happens anyway, except for the \"I wonder how you might be able to do such-and-such\" that the characters sometimes say.  I strongly recommend this if this game ever gets remade.\n\nAside from the somewhat chatty NPCs and the occasionally irritating physics (the player-character insists on taking a moment to get his footing very often), this is an excellent game, so I definitely recommend it.\n\n(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of the Humble Bundle with Android 6.)", "timestamp_created": 1428258783, "timestamp_updated": 1462346537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652376", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15191392": {"recommendationid": "15191392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078197395", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463855054}, "language": "english", "review": "Exploring caves and new lifeforms on Mars.\nBUY IT!", "timestamp_created": 1428092067, "timestamp_updated": 1428092067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15190786": {"recommendationid": "15190786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221206804", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428572141}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6027\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u2026\u2026\u3002\n\u73fe\u6642\u70b9\u3067\u306f\uff08\u4e00\u304b\u6240\u3001\u3081\u3063\u3061\u3083\u53b3\u3057\u3044\u7b87\u6240\u3092\u9664\u304f\u3068\uff09\u307e\u3042\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u82e6\u624b\u306e\u307c\u304f\u3067\u3082\u697d\u52dd\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u3080\u3057\u308d\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304c\u2026\u2026\u3046\u3046\u3093\u3001\u305d\u3053\u307e\u3067\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3002\n\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u8a00\u8449\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3044\u306e\u304b\u3088\u304f\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\nRPG\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u611f\u3058\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u306a\u304c\u3089\u57ce\u3078\u884c\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3001\u6d1e\u7a9f\u3078\u5165\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3057\u305f\u30c9\u30e9\u30af\u30a8\u3092\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\n\u305f\u3060\u2026\u2026\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u3069\u3061\u3089\u304b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3068\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\n\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u306e\u4f1a\u8a71\u304c\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3068\u9762\u767d\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u3084\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u307b\u3093\u3068\u5927\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3089\u3002\n\n\u305d\u308c\u3067\u2026\u2026\u65e5\u672c\u8a9eMOD\u3092\u5165\u308c\u3066\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\n\u305d\u3046\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3001\u3044\u304f\u3064\u304b\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u4f7f\u3048\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u690d\u7269\u56f3\u9451\u3092\u898b\u308b\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304b\u306a\uff1f\n\u307e\u3042\u305d\u306e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u306f\u307c\u304f\u306f\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304c\n\u2026\u2026\u306a\u305c\u304b\u3001\u3068\u305f\u3093\u306b\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3082\u5897\u3048\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3002\n\u305d\u308c\u3067\u3001\u306a\u3093\u304b\u3044\u3058\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3046\u3061\u306b\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u8a9eMOD\u304c\u5916\u308c\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3001\n\u4eca\u306f\u82f1\u8a9e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\n\u305d\u3046\u306a\u308b\u3068\u3001\u3082\u3046\u3001\u307c\u304f\u306f\u307e\u3063\u305f\u304f\u9762\u767d\u3055\u304c\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\n\u306a\u3093\u304b\u30d8\u30f3\u30c6\u30b3\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3067\u3054\u3081\u3093\u306a\u3055\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1428089674, "timestamp_updated": 1429065116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15185751": {"recommendationid": "15185751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130415895", "num_games_owned": 765, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428146667}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't exactly finished this game yet, but it is so beautiful I couldn't help but write a review. The artwork is really original, the controls are fluid and atisfying, the gameplay is intuitive with some quirky dialogue thrown in and there's a lovely sub-section of research information to read and learn about this bizarre planet we thought we knew so well. \n\nWaking Mars has a deep (you're traversing through caves) exploration asepct to it, there's no combat from what I've experinced so far, there's a lot of planting seeds and throwing stuff at random objects, and watching things grow and collecting water droplets and avoiding some weird acidic droplets or long protruding arm thingies that hurt. It looks very simple, it even plays very simply but it is still challenging enough, but not to the point where you need to stop and collect your thoughts, it's the type of game where you just keep going and eventually you (usually by accident) figure out where you're going and what you're doing.\n\nThe soundtrack is blissful, as I mentioned above, the artwork is glorious to look at and I find myself taking many screenies because every cave has its own distinct beauty that I want to capture.

Chaque type de ZOA g\u00e9n\u00e8re une certaine quantit\u00e9 de biomasse qui permet de d\u00e9bloquer la sortie du niveau. \n\nLa difficult\u00e9 du jeu est tr\u00e8s progressive et le gameplay est d'une fluidit\u00e9 remarquable. Tr\u00e8s peu de contr\u00f4les sont n\u00e9c\u00e9ssaires (4 pour le d\u00e9placement au jetpak et un bouton d'action) puisque de nombreuses actions contextuelles (s'accoupir par exemple) s'effectuent automatiquement. \n\nLes graphismes en 2D sont tr\u00e8s beaux dans leur sobri\u00e9t\u00e9.

The dialogue intelligently mixes hard science with the fantasy aspects and sprinkles in just a little bit of technobabble. It's compelling to play and doesn't rely on overused gaming tropes like leveling up or endless gradual equipment power progression.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix of puzzle and platformer. It's also pretty original. There are few hazards you need to navigate and lots of places to restore your health.

But this game was compelling enough for me to keep going and actually get it 100% completed. I'll admit that it got a little frustrating / confusing towards the end and I ended up resorting to some outside guidance through steam discussions in order to figure out my next move, but I'm sure I could have eventually figured it out on my own if I had that kind of patience. The 3 endings for the game (not including the optional pre-mature exiting the cave ending) really helped keep me interested in re-loading the game to see the other endings, and of course, the other endings kept getting better and better. The voice acting was a bit weird in places though. Like the 3rd ending [spoiler]where he goes up into space,[/spoiler] her reaction was a little anti-climactic and didn't really feel like a realistic reaction. As far as the guidance goes... the game really tries to help you out throughout the entire game, it even gives you an interface of details for each species in the game which helps a lot, unfortunately, if you forget something task related, or make a big mistake (namely the explosive seeds when you first get them and ending related areas)... it's possible to end up being stuck in the game with no clue how to progress further since you can't get the cutscenes / dialogs to repeat, so make sure to read and listen very well the first time.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the game.

It feels awesome exploring the caverns, identifying new species and figuring out what their weaknesses, diets and method of reporduction are. The drawn and animated species in the game look really awesome, and species from the same group have distinct visuals so you can tell they are related. Also, I didnt expect a game like this to have a story but it actually has quite a nice interesting one, and some of the artwork in the game is lovely.  It does, sadly get a little bit repetitive as when not discovering new species you are simply planting old ones in an attempt to beef up the biomass meter, to progress into the next area. Adding to that, due to the fact that the game is set on mars, everything looks fairly similar, red, orange and barren.

Ein Spiel das keine Bugs hat, keine Framedrops, eine interessante und intelligente Geschichte, viel zu Entdecken und Experimentieren und man ist am Schluss nicht froh das man es durch hat, wie bei so vielen Spielen.\n\nIch war misstrauisch selbst nach Gameplay Videos habe ich es lange auf der Wunschliste gehabt, wollte es aber nicht kaufen.\n\nDie Grafik ist einfach, aber sehr sch\u00f6n. Das Spiel beinhaltet keinerlei Gewalt und Kampf. Ausser das ein paar pflanzen aggressive Verteidigungsmechanismen haben die aber zum kreislauf des Biosimbiotischen Lebens da geh\u00f6ren. Man kann z.B einen samen einpflanzen der eine Lebensform generiert die Explosive Fr\u00fcchte herstellt mit der man ger\u00f6ll entfernen kann oder andere Pflanzen wieder zerst\u00f6ren kann um neue zu pflanzen. Pflanzen kann man nur auf bestimmten B\u00f6den.\n\nDie Charaktere sind sympatisch und sogar im deutschen sehr gut synchronnisiert, selbst der Roboter kann \u00fcberzeugen. Das Spiel l\u00e4sst einem Zeit zum \u00fcberlegen und es entstehen keine Situationen wo man stressig entscheidungen treffen muss. Es ist mehr ein Denk und Erforschspiel mit hervoragender Story und Backgroudinformationen die man jederzeit im Research Center abrufen kann. Es gibt sogar ein paar unlockables f\u00fcr das jetpack, mehr wird aber nicht verraten dazu.\n\nIm Prinzip f\u00e4ngt man mit einem Samen an und findet weitere Arten die man miteinander kobinieren kann indem man z.B. die Wasserpflanzensamen zum bew\u00e4ssern anderer Pflanzen benutz um mal das simpelste Beispiel zu nennen. F\u00fcr jede Art muss man herrausfinden wie sie sich reproduziert, was sie isst, wie sie stirbt, wie man ihren zustand ver\u00e4ndern kann und welche f\u00e4higkeiten sie hat (Spieler heilen z.B). Manche arten kann man nicht pflanzen sondern sie erwachen wenn man einen gewisen Biolevel erreicht hat in dem Bereich duch Artenvielfalt etc...\n\nMan ist einfach nur neugierig was wohl als n\u00e4chstes kommt und will tiefer in den Mars vordringen um seine Geheimnisse zu entschl\u00fcsseln.

If I had to give it a genre, I would call it a Dynamic Puzzle Exploration Game. It is a 2D Platformer game with a very user-friendly item management system. It has definite influences from classic Nintendo games, combining the elements of exploration, isolation and atmosphere of Metroid with growing plants and food/nutrient management of Pikmin. Anyone who enjoys either of these should take a look at this game. Anyone who likes both (like myself) will probably sit down and play the entire game in one sitting. It is a rather short game, lasting anywhere from 5-12 hours, depending on how thorough you want to be. The 17 Steam Achievements are all very easy to get on your first playthrough if you give it effort.\n\nSYNOPSIS: The basic premise of the game is this: you are an astronaut exploring a recently-discovered cave system on Mars. The only other characters are the Mars HQ woman and your environmental suit AI. \n\nZOA: As you enter the cave system, you discover living plant-like creatures, termed \"Zoa\" by your AI. These Zoa grow from different types of seeds planted in patches of fertile soil within the caves. You can carry a number of each type of seed at a time, saving them for later use. \n\nRESEARCH: As you interact with the environment, your AI develops a research log. Once you have discovered all of the elements of a certain subject, you unlock a Steam achievement for that subject. Some of the elements are fairly straight-forward; others will take some serious thinking or random luck.\n\nBIOMASS: Each Zoa in a chamber contributes to a Biomass counter. Once different levels of Biomass are reached, certain events occur. Some include barriers opening to new parts of the map, certain Zoa waking out of dormancy, etc.\n\nSOUNDTRACK: The soundtrack is very ambient in nature and has an organic feel to it. It completes the atmospheric sense that the game presents well and does not distract from the action whatsoever.\n\nART: This game does not have your run-of-the-mill shooter 3D render graphics, as it is only a platformer. That doesn't mean that it has the pixelated style that has been popularized of late. Waking Mars has beautifully drawn background layers that fade in and out, giving the illusion of real depth. The art team did an impressive job with very original plant-form creature design. It is a bit on the minimalist side and gives a very realistic, tangible feel to alien Mars.\n\nCONS: The only real downside to this game is the protagonist's personality. The AI is bright, happy and humorous. The HQ woman is funny at moments and believable the rest of the time. The main character is cold and sounds like he's talking in a combination of dictionary-speak and Medieval English. It is very awkward compared to the natural characters he talks to. This only really gets on your nerves during cutscenes, which you can skip (right mouse button).\n\nI picked this game up on sale, but after playing it I'd say it's definitely worth the inexpensive standard price. \n\nFinal Score: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1419837554, "timestamp_updated": 1420043768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577687", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13670716": {"recommendationid": "13670716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028644669", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419794247}, "language": "german", "review": "Sch\u00f6ne Idee der R\u00e4tsel mittels eines \u00d6kosystems.

Before I played the game I thought the graphics were too basic, but somehow when actually playing the game I found the art beautiful.\n\n\nYou land on Mars and have to explore, observe, experiment and learn how the martian ecosystem works. You can then manipulate the ecosystem to progress deeper into the cave system to discover yet more organisms and more complex interactions. It may sound daunting, but it is a very gradual path of discovery that is both addictive and rewarding.\n\nAs well as the well designed graphics, physics, organisisms and their interactions, it also has a good story, multiple endings and great voice acting.

It's a puzzle game based on manipulating an alien ecosystem.  Sometimes you need to find a way to get the plants to reproduce.  Sometimes you need to plant a particular combination of plants.  Sometimes you need to do something in particular with the plants (e.g. herd a mobile plant into a carnivorous plant).\n\nIf you die you will lose your progress since you entered the room.  If you keep at it you will eventually succeed.\n\nThe depiction of science is pretty accurate.  You will need to pay attention to what happens around you, read research, and experiment.  You will frequently learn things by accident.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the game is mildly grindy in places.  Sometimes raising the biomass in a room sufficiently takes doing something repeatedly, for 10 to 15 minutes, rather than just figuring out what to do.  The key to minimizing the frustration with these rooms is usually feeding seeds to the mobile plants while standing next to a plant that produces seeds.

Its sci-fi/ Mars setting and artwork caught my attention; but it was the goal of creating and encouraging an ecosystem within the Red Planet that sold me on it. \n\nThe story is simple and straightforward, but it is intelligently executed and really intriguing. Character development is little, but just right. There are no enemies, only yourself, the 'flauna' and the environment -  but you might be surprised at just how much of a threat you can pose to yourself. The goals are laid out before you in a no-nonsense manner: you are exploring, searching, gathering, manipulating, creating, and de-constructing to create, in a more favourable way to the environment's (and your) needs. There is something to be said for balance, and you learn by trial and error; but don't worry, there is nothing that you can't undo - though it may require a measure of patience.\n\nThe game mechanics are superbly fluid - the game runs without a hitch (it's enough for me to say that if I can run this on my present setup, anyone can - trust me). The time, work and research that went into this game is incredible. Overall gameplay is relaxing with adequate moments of doubt, constant wonder and dashes of uncertainty. It is a wonder to me that I do feel a sense of real isolation while playing - I think this is thanks to the beauty of the graphical style and the great music - but this is exactly what I would expect, it's the lonely and mysterious Red Planet, after all. The time it will take you to complete this game? It depends on you. I completed it (EDITED: start to finish TWICE) at the listed time played.\n  \nOne of the best features of this game for me was the ability to revisit any area at any time without limit. This alone makes this platformer just so non-linear. As well as being vital - you will have to travel around to resupply your seeds, revisit some areas dependant on other areas' progress, or just to re-balance an area if need be - it is a real treat to be able to return and see how the caverns have been thriving (or not) in your absence.\n\nIMPORTANT: If non-stop action, mayhem and destruction - i.e. death-n-glory - are your bread-and-butter, you will fast become bored with Waking Mars. BUT...\n\n...If you enjoy platform games, I believe this is a must for your collection and many will undoubtedly enjoy it.

It cannot be described otherwise.\nI found it on sale at a ridiculous price, and decided to give it a try as I was attracted by the premise of a game about \"mastering an ecosystem\", and by the reviews talking about quality narration and voice acting. This totally exceeded my expectations.\nNot only is this game a quite challenging and extremely enjoyable puzzle/explorer, with a set of original mechanics unlike anything I had ever played, but Waking Mars is a little masterpiece of science fiction. The way the developers struggled to create a set of \"rules\" according to which the wierd and colorful martian \"plant fauna\" functions and thrives, and yet managed to render it - if not entirely likely - at least scientifically plausible, is really something remarkable, and really shows passion and effort - and some good degree of competence in the matter. Story-wise, it's pretty simple and complete within itself, as a good short story should be. A great idea to begin with, that has been chiseled, polished and refined - a gem, as I said. The characters are among the most real and human I've ever found in a game, even if they're just a couple of static drawn faces talking through the radio - and in addition, the voice acting is tremendous. Especially considering this is an indie game.\nSomething I really enjoyed about the story is that there's not something like an immediate danger, or an impending problem that has to be resolved before-it's-too-late. The only part in which you are in some kind of trouble, the only one part in which you are trapped within these caves and have to get out somehow, is not at all pivotal and actually ends before mid-game. After that, what's left to keep you going is just the fact that you're goddamn curious. Both yourself, and your asian astronaut counterpart. The things you discover while venturing deeper and deeper inside this huge network of caves as ancient as the solar system, while making it flourish with life, are bound to keep you stuck with this game until everything is made clear. The kind of curiosity, suspence, and marvel that I experienced while playing through the game are the same that I'd feel while reading a well-written novel.\nIn conclusion: this game is great. The gameplay is original and satisfying, and the setting, narration and atmosphere are terrific. And the price is ridiculous. If you like Clarke-tier hard science fiction, you'll love this.

El caso, que como era de esperar, algo sale mal y una especie de terremoto te deja aislado de la superficie, as\u00ed que te pones a investigar por los t\u00faneles marcianos. All\u00ed descubrir\u00e1s que Marte no estaba deshabitado. Est\u00e1 plagado de plantas y animales con su propio ciclo natural. Para avanzar, tendr\u00e1s que ir cogiendo las semillas de dichas plantas (y alguna cosilla m\u00e1s) y usarlas en tu propio beneficio, puesto que cada una tiene propiedades \u00fanicas, y de paso, ir\u00e1s descubriendo los misterios que encierra el planeta.\nEl juego consiste en ir movi\u00e9ndote por ah\u00ed con tu jetpack a la vez que vas cultivando las plantas marcianas para aumentar la biomasa de cada zona, mientras la chavala que te espera fuera te va dando instrucciones por videoconferencia.\nEl juego parece simpl\u00f3n, y no te voy a enga\u00f1ar. Es simpl\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, es un poco aburrido estar en un sitio como Marte donde est\u00e1s recibiendo extra\u00f1as se\u00f1ales y contemplando misteriosas estructuras, y tu \u00fanica tarea es lanzar semillas aqu\u00ed y all\u00e1. Como juego para jugar de cuando en cuando est\u00e1 bien, porque el mapeado est\u00e1 dividido en zonas no muy grandes, y como la partida se guarda sola, puedes ir con tu club de ganchillo y a la vuelta seguir trasteando con las semillitas marcianas.\nDurante tu progreso, tu jetpack recibir\u00e1 actualizaciones que consisten en cambiarle la velocidad y hacer que te sustente estable en el aire cuando no te muevas en lugar de descender. Dichos modos de vuelo los podr\u00e1s cambiar a voluntad durante el juego. Este rollo de las actualizaciones no lo us\u00e9, porque con cualquiera de los modos te vale para pasarte el juego y es inc\u00f3modo cambiar de un tipo a otro, ya que tienes que darle a \"Ok\" un mont\u00f3n de veces.\nA m\u00ed el juego me pareci\u00f3 bastante repetitivo, como los telediarios cuando llega el fr\u00edo o llueve en Espa\u00f1a, pero como dije arriba, de forma espor\u00e1dica est\u00e1 bien. La variedad de plantas es muy peque\u00f1a, y la verdad, el juego tiene poco jugo que exprimir, pero para momentos puntuales que no te apetece un juego muy profundo, \u00e9ste te puede servir.\nComo consejo, no se te ocurra comprarlo al precio indicado. Aunque tu mayor pasi\u00f3n en la vida sea la jardiner\u00eda o tener un huerto en Marte, espera a que el juego est\u00e9 de oferta o encuentres un bundle por ah\u00ed.\n\n[b]\u00bfEl juego est\u00e1 dividido en niveles o es un mapa grande?[/b] Son zonas peque\u00f1as en la que si sales de una, el juego carga la zona anexa.

As one might expect from the title, they are met with some success.\n\nThe game revolves around exploration, research and biological reproduction of the life that is found on the planet. The map is large enough to give you several hours of playtime. The exploration involved opening up the entire map - fairly simple. Research requires you to \"experiment\" with what is at your disposal, to find out how the biology interacts with itself - simple, but less obvious. \n\nReproduction is  by far the biggest aspect of the game. You try and re-grow life in the various chambers found in the map. This requires you to evenly balance out different types of life. This can be tricky at times, because it is very easy to get \"infestations\" of a particular type of life. Also, worth noting: Although it may seem that you have rendered the game unwinnable, there is almost always a way to fix that, often explained by reading research notes.\n\nThe game can be controlled via. mouse&keyboard or with a controller. I found that the controller is not the easiest thing to use here, so best stick to k&m.\n\nThe 2-D graphics are generally very good. The player's sprite can look a bit static when hovering around, but apart from that everything else seems to fit in and look like it is \"alive\". Some screen tearing can occur, so it is best to enable v-sync in your display driver's control panel if that happens.\n\nThe music is very ambient and goes well with the \"spelunking\" experience.\n\nI didn't find any bugs while playing this game, and as mentioned before, you have to work really hard if you want to try and push the game into an unwinnable state.\n\nFor a game that has been ported to a computer from what was initially an iOS game, this is an extremely good game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1410190193, "timestamp_updated": 1410190193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488456", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12020896": {"recommendationid": "12020896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002986817", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 249, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410146654}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is actually really good for just an app. I'm not usually a puzzle game person but this one sets itself above those kinds of games!

Not having any evil aliens or cool laser-shooting guns isn\u2019t a good premise for dynamic action. Luckily, Waking Mars isn\u2019t actually aiming at cheap thrills or fast-paced shooting, but rather prefers to be a meditative journey and succeeds at it.\n\nThe year is 2093, player takes the role of Liang, chinese astronaut, taking part in international planetary mission to Mars, studying life that was discovered in an underground cavern system. If the thought of some green evil aliens pointing their death-ray guns had crossed your mind at this point, shoo it away. Or maybe you\u2019ve thought of some ancient ruins, secure vaults,containing secrets of advanced precursors? You\u2019re wrong again. Life that has been discovered is rather primitive. It is a strange kind of hybrid between plants and animals. It\u2019s called Zoa. Not much is known about these species; you will be the first and only human to make contact with it and observe it in its natural habitat.\n\nAnd that is the game: travelling and observing, filling built in-game encyclopedia with articles describing behaviour and features of all types of these \u201cplants\u201d. Yes, there\u2019s actually quite a lot of them. Some stay in place, some move around; some feel good on regular soil, some require acidic loam for growing. There are even those whose spores are exploding, killing all other Zoa around. There you have it, this is as much brutality as you can get in Waking Mars. While this is not the first video game declining use of violence as the main plot progression device and problem solver, not even the first among metroidvanias, it\u2019s still an admirable feat. You wander around the caves, first on foot, later using jetpack, unveiling the beauty of an enclosed ecosystem, where various types of Zoa form a perfect cycle of life and death.\n\nMost common obstacles on the player\u2019s path are Cerebranes, gigantic membranes covering passages between caverns. In order to open them you\u2019ll have to increase biomass. Picking up spores and placing them on fertile ground sounds easy enough, and it actually is\u2026 at the beginning. Increasing variety of species requires careful planning to achieve that sweet spot when that number is finally high enough. You\u2019ll have to make everything work together with maximum \u201cprofit\u201d. At its heart the game is nearly a city-builder where you connect houses with roads, provide appliances, keeping in mind the energy, waste and communications. Being a space \u201cgardener\u201d is a rather soothing process if you let it be so. This game doesn\u2019t like those who are in a hurry, who can tip off balance so easily and want some obvious solutions. Eventually they will stumble upon a cave, where just picking up seeds and placing them on all the green spots won\u2019t be enough. I can\u2019t really say that Waking Mars requires out-of-the-box thinking, it\u2019s not actually that hard, but there is space for creativity here. You can try different solutions, experiment with Zoa proportions.\n\nThe pace of the game is emphasized with main hero\u2019s loneliness. Not in some metaphorical way, but in actual one. Liang is the only human here. His colleague Amani safely stays on the base and contacts him on the radio. This distant voice coming somewhere from above is as much company as you can get here. If you don\u2019t count OCTO, mission\u2019s AI, of course. It\u2019s sci-fi after all. Dialogues being rare are wonderfully written, perfectly voiced and are presented in the right amount, are enough to keep the player\u2019s head in the story progression, but not ruining that desolation mood.\n\nDistinctive art-style inspired by 60s and 70s illustrations of popular science magazines glues all of that together, making this truly unique. This is a nich\u00e9 game, sure. But it stands out even among other metroidvanias. Being slow-paced and reflective it never becomes boring. It has that long-lost sense of intergalactic adventure and discovery, which we lost decades ago, surrendering it to Lucas\u2019 space fantasy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have nothing against that. And shooting can be fun too. But can we have more games like Waking Mars as well, please?", "timestamp_created": 1400955807, "timestamp_updated": 1479963185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800248", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10203111": {"recommendationid": "10203111", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984503913", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1370116741}, "language": "english", "review": "Crap...", "timestamp_created": 1400808989, "timestamp_updated": 1400808989, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.306520", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10194350": {"recommendationid": "10194350", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979479197", "num_games_owned": 687, "num_reviews": 282, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1360224000}, "language": "english", "review": "put plants on mars", "timestamp_created": 1400731350, "timestamp_updated": 1400731350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10172132": {"recommendationid": "10172132", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961167439", "num_games_owned": 1346, "num_reviews": 609, "playtime_forever": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1399700165}, "language": "english", "review": "Explore caves of Mars and uncover its secret life.

While the game may broadly be classified as a metroidvania, I'd like to tag it as interactive fiction with light puzzle elements due to its taking great cares with the story-telling.\n\nThe actual gameplay mechanics, on the other hand, are all linked to single idea, which is, refreshingly, to re-create life on an otherwise barren planet. With that goal in mind, you (as scientist Liang) will explore the underground caverns of the titular planet, thinking, wondering, researching, experimenting and step by step, giving life to an alien habitat by literally planting the seeds of it. Simple yet effectively executed, this planting mechanic that forms the core of the game leads to lovely self-sustained eco-systems that flourish by the touch of your hands - and with that comes a great sense of accomplishment that is like no other.\n\nThe caves of Mars themselves are a joy to traverse: elaborately designed and always rich in color. The tunes that accompany you throughout your adventure perfectly capture the mood of any given scene, never taking the forefront yet always enhancing the experience. The controls are fluid and easy to get a hold of, never detracting from the experience. In short, the game is flawless in its audio / visual departments and devoid of technical faults.\n\nAll in all, a ten-hour science-fiction adventure with unique promises on all fronts that you'll be remembering fondly for a long time and that is as effective as any thought-provoking work of art in the said genre.", "timestamp_created": 1399670245, "timestamp_updated": 1399670351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10027354": {"recommendationid": "10027354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018586587", "num_games_owned": 881, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398771730}, "language": "english", "review": "If i want to plant things i have my garden. 10/10 would delete again", "timestamp_created": 1399301470, "timestamp_updated": 1399301470, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.347346", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10025348": {"recommendationid": "10025348", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980303864", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1384370355}, "language": "english", "review": "Main point of the game is planting alien flora in order to progress, which is a pretty unique and fun idea right there.

However, it is not really terraforming, like making habitable to human life, no, it's about \"waking\" the planet!\n\nSo what it is about, then? Basically, it's a puzzle game, with explorational elements, as you go through the caverns of deep and sometimes you have branching paths; though you can return to take the other way any time. There's a story to the game and while it is simple, it is just what it needs: A set of mysteries to make you want to explore the cavern.\n\nAs for the puzzle elements, that's the best part: Basically, in each chamber, you have to reach a certain level of biomass. How you do that? By planting strange animal-plants called the Zoa. Different zoa have different seeds, some just reproduce, other seeds produce water or explode. Some zoa can move and depend on seeds to reproduce. Then there are zoa that eat the moving ones. What your task is in this game basically is to kickstart a whole ecosystem! Every lifeform in the game effects the other in some way or other, making you soon create a whole jungle full of life, each depending on each other to survive and reproduce. It is just brilliant!\n\nThe only two downsides I can think of, first, the artstyle, which is really not the best, the animations are quite choppy (especially on the moving zoas), and while it certainly got its own charm, I did not find it that appealing. My other problem with the game is that maybe I would have loved if there would have been maybe a little more variaties of lifeforms with a more varied roles and dependencies. I mean, don't get me wrong, there's really like a bunch of them, but I would have liked more.

It has the structure of a Metroidvania, but where a Metroidvania has you fighting your way through enemies to acquire new equipment that allows access to new areas, Waking Mars is entirely non-violent (except for the occasional environmental hazard) and has you manipulating the ecosystem in order to open up new paths to explore.\n\nThis is both interesting (going against the normal structure of the genre by leaving out enemies entirely) and terrible (it turns out that manipulating the ecosystem by growing and killing plants isn't a great gameplay experience). In fact, I once screwed up the plant life in a room so badly that I resorted to deleting the save file to reset it (fortunately, each room is saved in its own file, so I didn't lose my progress entirely). I suspect that it is actually possible to render the game unwinnable by accidentally eradicating some of the plant species entirely, although I didn't do this. I did kill off enough of some of the more troublesome species that it became difficult to remember where some of their specimens were in the game world in order to collect their seeds on the rare occasions I needed to use them to progress.\n\nWaking Mars is an interesting but not spectacular experience with some nicely drawn 2D art, good voice acting, actual minority characters for a change, and a gameplay mechanic that outlasted its welcome to the point where I took the easiest to obtain ending and didn't bother with the more difficult options.

"language": "english", "review": "Waking Mars has to be the most grounded Science Fiction game I have ever had the pleasure of playing. It feels like something that could actually happen through to the end. All four(?) of them.\nThe paper cut-out art style makes everything pop in just the right way. It's all very well drawn. Not only is the art good, but the characters are extremely realistic and likeable people that will accompany you via radio on your journey through the vast underground Martian ecosystem.\nThe best way to describe this game is as a casual 2-D puzzle platformer, gardening/ecosystem creation simulation. It's on the easy side, sure, but you'll definitely get your money's worth out of the story alone. For those asking a little more, you can try and perfect the game. All 110% of it! Personally, I reached 103% and two endings in 7.1 hours playtime, and I was stopping to admire a lot of scenery.\nThe only cons I can really think of would be after a certain point, things get tedious. If you're looking to squeeze out every last bit of exploration, dialogue, and completion from this game, you're going to be doing a LOT of backtracking to places where you can easily access certain materials. But if you're going that far, you should be ready to deal with such tedium and technically forfeit your right to complain.\nAll in all, I recommend this game for fans of simple puzzle games, space cadets, and anyone with general interest in good sci-fi. If you really want a deal, wait for it to go on sale or hope it gets thrown into a Humble Bundle again. Maybe even pick it up on Android or IOS if you rather game on-the-go.\nFinally, my recommendation for controls is a 360/PS3 gamepad. The keyboard and mouse controls just don't fit very well, but that's my personal opinion.\nHope you liked the review and thanks for reading.", "timestamp_created": 1392976007, "timestamp_updated": 1392976007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9196409": {"recommendationid": "9196409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006846187", "num_games_owned": 875, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445921158}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Don't let the action tag fool you though, there isn't any combat, much less any real action to speak of, just lots of gardening and pseudoscience. Indeed, Waking Mars is a xenoecological adventure to recover a missing exploration probe as you uncover the secrets hidden within the Lethe Cavern. \n\nStart out in a chamber mostly devoid of life, introduce moisture, plant seeds in fertile terrain and watch them spring to life! But as they start to spread out in the area, you might find that it may not be the most efficient ecosystem, or that certain Zoa may threaten to eliminate the rest of it! It's all very simple and there are limited patches for planting, but the number of cross interactions between different species and their environments makes for a surprising level of complexity. \n\nYou may have beat a zone by hitting a certain biomass within it and unlocked new areas, but later you might want to revist them to increase the efficiency of the ecosystems in them, improving synergies and generating even more biomass. Or you just want to visit it to pick up some seeds for use in a new area. The game encourages you to build ecosystems that benefit heavily from synergistic interactions but isn't afraid to let you build insane unstable ones that have large amounts of biomass constantly in flux as life is rapidly reproduced as it is destroyed. Sometimes planting a single Zoa (ART, an AI program in your suit will tell you that they aren't plants!) too soon can make it hard to fix as it spreads all around before you can start planting your desired Zoa in other patches. Sometimes the easiest way to stop this happening is to kill it. You may however only carry a certain amount of each seed and that makes you have to think about how you have to go about planting them (though it also means  that it can be tedious if you are trying to populate an area with mainly one sort of Zoa). There is even the potential to wipe out an entire species, though many plants do reappear in later chambers if you accidentally do so in an early one.\n\nWhile many of the game's quirks make it arguably a better one, it is not without faults. You are almost required to revist some old chambers to do a quick restock of seeds every few chambers and while you can teleport between chambers you have visited I feel it could have been more streamlined.  Speaking of tedium, Ledon Zoa are amazing at providing biomass AND populating entire zones, but can be a nightmare to plant as they float upwards aimlessly, cannot be picked up and crumble with little force. ART is like a less charming Wheatley and can be quite jarring. Fortunately your player character, Liang, is the most likeable character in the game. The signal decoding segments can be a tad confusing and so can most of the endings.\n\nOverall an excellent title, more enjoyable than gardening.", "timestamp_created": 1390849493, "timestamp_updated": 1390849493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8867824": {"recommendationid": "8867824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019641347", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411683567}, "language": "french", "review": "Bon tit jeu relax.", "timestamp_created": 1390828644, "timestamp_updated": 1390828644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8837236": {"recommendationid": "8837236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095191080", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390677221}, "language": "english", "review": "Exploration\n\nGood dialogue\n\nFun gameplay\n\nGet this game", "timestamp_created": 1390622178, "timestamp_updated": 1390622178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8835147": {"recommendationid": "8835147", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983492256", "num_games_owned": 497, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1383933210}, "language": "polish", "review": "Wspania\u0142a przegryzka pomi\u0119dzy wi\u0119kszymi produkcjami.\nWaking Mars to prosta gra zr\u0119czno\u015bciowo-platformowa skupiaj\u0105ca si\u0119 na odkryciach dokonanych podczas misji na Marsa z udzia\u0142em ma\u0142ej grupy naukowc\u00f3w.

I obtained the game as part of a Humble Bundle.  I'm a fan of Metroidvania games (action/exploration games like Metroid and Castlevania that focus on exploring a large 2D open world for upgrades and other goodies) so this did seem up my alley.\n\nThe gameplay of Waking Mars is similar to metroidvanias in its 2D open world and ability to wander, but that's about where the similarities end.  The core gameplay of Waking Mars is flying around with a jetpack through large 2D spaces manipulating each areas's ecosystem in order to unlock more areas and complete main/side objectives.  The ecosystem is a web of plants and a couple of \"animals\" that depend on each to thrive and reproduce (there's also a research journal that explains each life form's use and abilities as you discover them).  Later in the game you'll find yourself going between several rooms to obtain seeds to enhance other rooms to their maximum biomass level.  Each room has a different ecosystem to work with and different challenges to overcome so the game never feels repetitive or monotonous.  There's no combat here, so you'll purely be picking up and throwing seeds as well as trying to herd around some of the larger seeds you can't carry.  Some plants can hurt and kill you, but the game has a very generous autosave system so death is never more than a minor hindrance as a result of being sloppy (note that I played on normal, the game offers casual and hard settings which I imagine do nothing but change how much damage you receive).\n\nOn the technical side I was extremely impressed at the professional quality of this \"indie\" game.  Graphics are 2D but very detailed and look incredibly sharp and detailed at 1920x1200 screen resolution.  The screenshots on Steam really do not do the look of this game justice.  Voice acting sounds extremely professional and all dialogue in game is fully voiced.  The controls also felt fantastic for a mouse and keyboard user and zooming around on the jetpack and using the mouse to throw seeds felt extremely precise and natural.  The game also ran perfectly without a hitch in Gentoo Linux so clearly the developer has put a lot of effort into proper Linux support which is wonderful.  The only technical hiccup I had was screen tearing during scenes of heavy movement.  My monitor does that worse than many and I normally use vsync because of it but this game had no option for it and it wasn't bad enough to force it in the drivers.\n\nMy first playthrough, getting all 17 achievements was 7.9 hours.  That may seem on the short side but that time was devoid of tedium or reptition, the game never overstayed its welcome and progressed very naturally.  The quality of this was so good I regret getting it so cheap as part of a Humble Bundle, its worth every bit of its current $9.99 US price tag.

Assisting you are Amani Ronga, who chats with you from Base Camp, and ART, another AI who sounds like a Borderlands Claptrap.\n\nI like Liang. He's a thinker. When he speaks, he sounds... not quite subdued, but distracted, by the scientific inquiries and dilemmas surrounding him at all times. So that he's only able to spare a small portion of his thought processes for the conversation at hand. Amani provides the heart, and ART provides the comic relief. Altogether, they have a fascinating dynamic that\n\nOH look at me all wrapped up in people gazing. Where are my manners? Let me tell you about the gameplay.\n\nGameplay's weird, yo.\n\nThis is a game about two things: research, and... well, waking Mars. Science-minded fellow that he is, you'll be helping Liang investigate all of the weird fauna and flora (which is also technically fauna, actually) of Lethe Cavern. You do this by collecting and planting \"seeds\", throwing things at things to see how they react, coaxing things to eat other things, and generally being a bother to everything. Every creature provides a boost to the biomass of an area, and as you become more knowledgeable of your surroundings, you can use that information to help you increase Lethe Cavern's biomass to all new heights, and spread it to all new depths.\n\nThere is a story, here. Bits of mystery and intrigue to investigate. A couple different endings to shoot for. I won't spoil anything, but it's enough to give you goals as you go.\n\nWaking Mars looks nice. I should use a better word there, but \"nice\" is what I feel in my heart, so judge away. Everything looks painted, but not in an artsy-fartsy way. There's a bit of a papery look to things, but you probably won't notice most of the time. It actually makes the game look really cool at times, though, when there are like four or five layers of background scenery moving by at different speeds.\n\nWaking Mars is not for everyone. There's no shooting, and the closest thing you get to a puzzle is the basic physicsy calculational resource management gameplay. You may find yourself spending your time herding creatures or waiting for the local population to build itself up while watching handfuls of hard-earned biomass repeatedly wander straight to their stupid, stupid deaths.

In a great way, I must add!\n\nIn Waking Mars you're an explorer of Mars' caves and its newfound life. As you interact with more and more life, the game registers your findings in a log, showing the amount of work that has been put into designing everything about this game. Every piece of life is highly detailed, and it's worth reading the information you gather as you play.\n\nBUT this isn't a merely exploratory game, despite that being a big focus. After you learn about the life you encounter, you learn how to use it to your advantage, creating the most aproppriate habitat for a certain type of plant or animal to live. In doing so, they'll eventually interact with each other, prospering further and further, that being the main mechanic of this game. Each room has a certain Biomass level requirement for you to progress, a mechanic that makes sense in the context of this game , as the caves' natural defense is to block the exits until there's self-sustainable life in it.\n\nThe story was there merely to guide you through your adventure deeper and deeper into Mars, giving you a helping hand in this journey.\nAs you progress, you start grasping the game's mechanics, and you'll be able to create some pretty cool environments and interactions with everything at your disposal, which feels very satisfying. \n\nSo, I'd advise anyone to definitely try out this game. The sense of discovery is present at all times, keeping you emersed in the world from start to finish. There's a constant drive to keep you moving forward and exploring more and that's a really big plus!

You essentially create ecosystems by planting seeds that grow into plants, building \"biomass\" to unlock new areas and move forward. It's not so much a puzzle game for most of its run as it is a game of discovery, observing how different plants react to each other and trying to build a stable enviorment while only understanding part of what you're doing. Most of the game's delights are in that process of discovery. I've played a lot of novel games, and this one felt like it was exploring a new, fascinating gaming idea, where you model little ecosystems on the fly.\n\nUnfortunately, it never goes very deep- completing most of the areas is effortless, and while the story leaves a tantalizing hook dangling for you to resolve, doing so apparently requires getting a perfect score in every area. Getting that score means messing with a lot of finicky parts that I thought was too frustrating to be worth the time. I wish the game went deeper by creating new puzzle areas and challenges, instead of forcing you to be a completionist. So I never finished this game, but the five hours or so I put into it were pretty rewarding. Bonus points for the amusing way your AI-assistent speaks: video games have a lot of \"funny\" talking robots nowadays, but this one is especially good.\n\nYou'll probably be seeing it a lot in indie bundles, which is where I got my copy.

At it's heart, it's a rather Metroid-esque exploration game.  Rather than focusing on combat, however, your goal is to explore and build an ecosystem within a large cave system on Mars.  While it's pretty simplistic, it does take some work to balance the flora and fauna in each room as certain ones will destroy others and can hurt you as well.\n\nThe game has a light story focused around the exploration which works well, though I wish the dialogue didn't force you to stop playing to listen to it.  It would be a lot nicer if it let you keep playing while the characters conversed.  It does have some nice hand-drawn character portraits though.  The characters themselves are pretty interesting, with the usual insulting AI and some decently acted humans.\n\nGraphically, the game looks quite nice with the same hand-drawn feel, though animation quality is pretty poor.  Some may like it others may not.  One thing I really wish was done better is the music.  Good music could have added so much more atmosphere to the game.\n\nOverall, it's a fun little game worth your time.

For a couple of hours, at least. Then it starts to feel repetitive, and it even manages to become frustrating, especially when you want to 5-star every level and your plants are eating or killing other forms of life around you, decreasing your rating.\n\nOther than creating life there are a few mini-games in the game to spice things up and to get the story going but it's nothing noteworthy to begin with.\n\nI do have to praise the developer for creating such colorful and sharp art.

It starts of slow but gets more complex the deeper you go, unveiling the mysteries of Mars on the way.\n\nI do like the characters in the game, for some reason i can really identify with the main character, and the voice of the woman is just adorable. \n\nThe main theme of the game is building ecosystems in caves. Thats what you do to generate biomass to advance in the story... Sounds dry, yes. But belive me its interresting and fun when you get involved. \n\nYou also can mess it up. This game has the possibility of making and breaking the biosystems that you manage and build. Too many games have the possibility of failing completly eradicated, and thats not a good thing.\n\nThe graphical style... alot of pepole seem to dislike it. For me, it simply works. And its unique and gives the game its own charme. Also, because of this it will be remembered, even in some years from now. I prefer that than cutting edge graphics with zero gameplay.\n\nNow go and buy this gem of a game and play it, its worth your time and money!", "timestamp_created": 1358204105, "timestamp_updated": 1385404390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609430", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2512832": {"recommendationid": "2512832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008559341", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388813563}, "language": "english", "review": "SEEDS ERRYWHERE", "timestamp_created": 1358145462, "timestamp_updated": 1358145462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3144322": {"recommendationid": "3144322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018161255", "num_games_owned": 2921, "num_reviews": 230, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1357891200}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0 \uc0f7\ub9cc \ubd24\uc744 \ub54c\ub294 \ubaa8\uc885\uc758 \uc288\ud305 \ud50c\ub798\ud3ec\uba38 \uac8c\uc784\uac19\uc558\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud574\ubcf4\ub2c8 \ub2ec\ub790\ub294\ub370, \ud654\uc131\uc758 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub807\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uac01 \ub9f5\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc0dd\ud0dc \ubc1c\uc804 \uc9c0\uc218\uac00 \uc788\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300\ud55c \uc62c\ub9ac\uac8c\ub054 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucc38\uc2e0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7f0 \uc800\ub7f0 \ub3d9\uc2dd\ubb3c\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc11c \uc0dd\ud0dc\ub97c \uc870\uc131\ud574\uc57c\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \uc548\ud0c0\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74 \uc774\ubbf8 \uc2ec\uc740 \uc2dd\ubb3c\uc740 \uc5c6\uc560\uae30\uac00 \ud798\ub4e4\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud55c \ubc88 \uc798\ubabb \uc2ec\uc73c\uba74 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\ud0dc \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uaf80\ud558\uae30\uac00 \ud798\ub4e4\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c '\uc810\uc218 \uacb0\ubcbd\uc99d' \ub530\uc704\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub294 \ub2f5\ub2f5\ud560 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub098\uac19\uc740 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub9f5\uc758 \uc0dd\ud0dc \ub808\ubca8\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300\ub85c \uc62c\ub9ac\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5c8\ub294\ub370 \uadf8\ub7ec\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub3c4 \uc885\uc885 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc544\ubb34\ud2bc \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub97c \uac16\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \ub098\ub294 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 Walking Mars\ub77c\uace0 \uc798\ubabb \ubcf4\uc558\uc5c8\ub294\ub370 Waking Mars\uc600\ub2e4\ub2c8, \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uacfc \ub531 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub418\ub294 \ub290\ub08c\uc774\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1357808450, "timestamp_updated": 1357808450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "801587": {"recommendationid": "801587", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978772863", "num_games_owned": 469, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1357718400}, "language": "english", "review": "An interesting little adventure.

Enjoyable Exploration Extraordinaire.[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Genre: 2D Light Platformer, Exploration and Light Metroidvania. \n[*]Developed & Published by: Tiger Style\n[*]Platform: Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Android and iOS. \n[*]Business Model: Base Game\n[*][i]Copy Purchased by Myself[/i]\n[/list]\n[url=http://wp.me/p4fZDz-1SA]Read the unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url]\n\n[b]Overall Gameplay Thoughts[/b]\nWaking Mars is a 2D platformer that's light on exploration and heavy on exploring the depths of a fictional Mars. Through this narrative driven story, you'll need to figure out how the plant and animal life interact with each other. Each area has a required amount of biomass so you'll need to solve the puzzle of the area while using physics to move plants or objects around to grow them. There isn't any combat in Waking Mars but you can potentially die thanks to lava and some aggressive species. So, you'll need to use your jetpack and wits to survive. All of which is to be learned by the player as they go along. There's unlocks to find and secrets to discover too. \n\n[b]Overall Story Thoughts[/b]\nThe year is 2097 on Mars. You play as a astronaut named Liang who is accompanied by an AI named \u201cART\u201d. He is teamed up with another astronaut named Amani who assists by analyzing the data he brings in and being helpful support. At first, Liang is at an outpost that was built for this mission to Mars to explore the Lethe caves. The mission is to find the alien life that had been detected by scouts years ago. Liang is contemplative, quiet and mostly a loner. Amani is more of a upbeat, friendly kind of person. She acts as support and isn't playable in the game though you\u2019ll have plenty of conversations. They have pretty good chemistry and bounce off each other well. ART is an artificial intelligence who speaks like he\u2019s an AI from some bad 70s movie. ART\u2026well, he\u2019s \u201ccute\u201d at first but his computerized speech can get on your nerves as the game progresses. \n\nLiang and his team have been sent to Mars after an initial recon of the planet discovered life on the red planet. You play as Liang as he travels into the depths of the Mars caverns named \u201cLethe cavern\u201d. There he will find the strange lifeforms and begin unraveling the mystery of Mars. The outpost he was working out of is destroyed due to an accident and Liang must return to base camp or run out of oxygen. The conditions on the surface of Mars are too harsh to travel over. So, Liang has to travel through the depths of Lethe cavern to reach the base camp. The caves are filled with dangerous hazards & deadly lifeforms but its also filled with life and intrigue for Liang. His curiosity leads him to continue exploring the depths of Lethe cavern. You\u2019ll have to discover for yourself what those mysteries are. Its an enjoyable story really and the lack of violence really helps keep this game focused on exploration.\n\nI did have one major issue with this game\u2019s story however and that was the ending. It ends abruptly, regardless of which ending you choose. No explanation for what will happen to the planet or the lifeforms you meet. No explanation for what waking up Mars will do for the planet or even the human society. Just nothing. It irritates me to end when a game leaves you hanging. I can\u2019t tell if they didn't know how to end the game or if they planned on doing a sequel. \n\n[b]PC Port Report[/b]\nWhile this is a mobile ported to PC game, it comes with a reasonable settings menu. Keyboard config, resolution options and even joystick support. The art isn't as hi-resolution as I would have liked, but is passable in its current state. The PC port of this game is surprisingly solid. It comes with rebindable keys, joystick support, cinematic speed settings and resolution options. The resolution options were nicely varied and the game also featured resolution \u201cauto-detect\u201d which worked just fine. For the most part, the game stayed at a solid 60 FPS. Well done guys.  \n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nWaking Mars is a well done exploration adventure game. One of the most enjoyable exploration games to come around in a while. Tiger Style managed to make a game that was only about exploration fun and challenging at the same time and I have to give kudos. The characters were also interesting people to get to know. I also have to give them kudos for making a quality PC game from an iOS port. It's refreshing to see iOS app devs take care in the porting of their games. All that said, Waking Mars is an enjoyable game through the depths of a fictional Mars. While the game has some problems, the core of the game is a very solid experience. If you have any interest in exploration or adventure games, you should give Waking Mars a try.\n\n[url=http://wp.me/p4fZDz-1SA]Read this review & more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1355458049, "timestamp_updated": 1450757091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564995", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "4775577": {"recommendationid": "4775577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041714438", "num_games_owned": 5030, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1355472000}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game.

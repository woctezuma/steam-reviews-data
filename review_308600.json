"last_played": 1497908563}, "language": "english", "review": "The below review is taken from my original post at www.gamesfreezer.eu\n\nGeneshift is a top-down shooter video game made by Nik Nak Studios (Ben Johnson). \nThis is another case of a top quality game being released by one man and the fact that the game has such strong, rounded single player and multiplayer modes is a testament to his skill as a developer. \nGeneshift is a game that has taken eight years for Ben to complete and was definitely worth the wait.\n\nThe story in Geneshift focuses on a zombie outbreak which your character is trying to stop with the help of his fellow \u2018Yellowjackets\u2019, whereas the multiplayer aspect focuses on battles between the various factions in the game.\nGeneshift has been compared to the first GTA game but from my experience of playing it, it has more in common with a more tactical Alien Breed in that it\u2019s not so much about open-world mayhem but instead it\u2019s a more focused romp in a near-future setting. \nThe controls are quite complicated but this is to be expected due to the layers on offer, WASD controls your character and the mouse controls the aiming, it\u2019s not quite a twin-stick shooter as distance is also important here, careful aiming is required as opposed to a bullet-hell massacre. Various keyboard shortcuts deal with your weapons, skills, upgrades etc.\n\n\nThe game is split into a ten-level campaign which can be completed either in single player or cooperatively up to four players (on-line only) each stage takes a good half-hour or so to get through so there is longevity here and along with the online leaderboards and other modes, replayability levels are also high. There is also a large online multiplayer community with a plethora of different modes. Although the game is only a few weeks old it has already amassed a healthy amount of players and I had no issues joining in online matches.\nGeneshift\u2019s music has a \u2018Perfect Dark / Goldeneye\u2019 quality to it, in that it\u2019s gently ominous and ambience-building without being intrusive. The sound effects in the game are satisfying, each gunshot carrying weight and the incidental sounds adding to the immersion.\nVisually, Geneshift is a very crisp game. Sometimes in top-down shooters the detail on items and characters can be lost but that\u2019s not an issue here, the only moments of trouble I had were a couple of seconds where the view wasn\u2019t resting in an ideal position for me to make my next move or plan a specific jump but on the whole, it\u2019s a very smoothly animated environment with an intelligent in-game camera.\nYour fellow Yellowjackets follow you through the game, giving tips on how to progress and providing cannon fodder and covering fire, some of the dialogue is funny and occasionally fourth-wall breaking although this is very much a game about action, the story exists purely to move the game forwards.\n\nThe AI in the game is fair and the danger comes from mistakes the player makes as opposed to feeling cheated by the computer. Your allies don\u2019t take as much health off the enemy as you do whilst shooting them so you can\u2019t lazily hide behind a wall whilst they do all the work, you need to get involved, preferably with a gun the size of a Rover 800 and a wheelbarrow full of bullets.\nAs previously mentioned, I got an \u2018Alien Breed\u2019 vibe from Geneshift but also mixed with RPG elements, for instance the use of mana to cast spells such as healing yourself or to become temporarily invisible, unlocking of skill points and there are checkpoints scattered around the levels that allow you to buy more guns and equipment. This isn\u2019t a game that you could just plough through guns blazing; tactics and forethought are definitely needed. The addition of a fully-fledged skill upgrade system really adds to the depth of Geneshift, some sections of the game are rendered much easier by having the right upgrade installed, (you will be using the force field A LOT.)\nWhilst items that you\u2019ve unlocked carry across to the next stage for purchase, your money and equipped weapons reset after each stage so spend it all whilst you can. You never know when you\u2019ll chew through your ammo during a sudden, intense shootout.\nThere are a couple of things that will hopefully be addressed in future updates, One thing I noticed is that every time you make a purchase in the store, it kicks you out back to the game so you have to press \u2018b\u2019 to re-enter the shop to buy other items, it\u2019s a minor gripe but there were a few occasions when I desperately needed ammo to kill approaching enemies and it wasted precious seconds going in and out of the menu resulting in losing a lot of health. Another issue for me was that when I was using the self-healing and my health reached 100%, it didn\u2019t stop burning through my mana, so some of it was wasted. It would make sense for the healing to stop when it reaches the maximum.\n\nYou can create some awesome set-pieces in Geneshift. One section of the game had me driving down a corridor mowing down the enemy before skidding to a halt and diving out of the car as it exploded (thanks to a horde of machine-gun toting enemies), I then hid behind the husk of the burning car and lobbed a grenade into the enemies to deliver the coup de grace. In another part of the game I crept into an enemy building, jumped into a car and ran over everyone like a frenzied Mad Max\u2026before a boss entered, cornered me and utterly mowed me down in a barrage of gunfire.\nThere are some other great sections in the game that have you killing dozens of zombies in a single room and collecting their \u2018souls\u2019 to power a bomb to blow them all up in one fell swoop. These sections combined with the boss battles reminded me of Mean Arenas and Super Smash TV (this is a good thing) with the need for tactical strafing and ammo management a top priority.\nThe later levels really open up once you leave the complex and although there is a linearity to them, it\u2019s a positive as it reduces aimless wandering and gives the game a focus, feeling like you can carve your own way around the expansive city maps without feeling lost.\nThe multiplayer aspect of the game is also a strong draw here, the servers are lively and bountiful and deathmatches takes the game to new heights, the money is more abundant than in the single player campaign and so you can \u2018Arnie up\u2019 much quicker and get involved with some serious firepower. The sheer amount of modes really does give Geneshift a heck of a replayability factor.\nThere\u2019s a free demo for Geneshift available through Steam if you are on the fence about it or fancy a crack before you lay your money down, it contains some multiplayer maps and the first mission of the campaign.\n\nI\u2019ve been having some conversations recently with regards to people lamenting the loss of \u2018the golden age of gaming\u2019 when individuals or small groups of people could complete a game at their own pace without the threat of a crunch, artistic integrity intact. Geneshift is the result of one man\u2019s dedication to his artistic vision and it shows in how uniformly the game is put together, all aspects of Geneshift add up to a remarkably well-designed whole. To those people who think the \u2018golden age\u2019 of gaming has gone, I shove Geneshift into your mouth and tell you to jump on the awesome indie game bus, may it never stop rolling.",

I read an article online about the developer\u2019s odyssey-like experience while working on their first and so far only Steam project. It was all the information I needed, before making the decision to contact them asking for a press copy. Nik Nak Studios is precisely the type of indie dev I like supporting through my writings. Creative and determined folks who manage to share their gaming vision with their potential players and customers, despite time or budgetary constraints. Can\u2019t deny their ambitious debut, a review and they were kind enough to indulge me.\n\n[h1]Story [/h1]\nFor a title that\u2019s been eight years in the making and still launches on Steam in Early Access form, I believe this speaks greatly about Nik Nak Studios\u2019 commitement to deliver a game that gets shaped in equal measure by its player base as well. Geneshift\u2019s story or campaign mode, is currently featuring 10 fairly diversified levels of decent length and complexity. Sure, there could have been more and perhaps this number may grow in time. The plotline is straightforward: two groups fight for control over both territory and a biological weapon capable of turning humans into horrific mutants.\n\nI saw folks comparing Geneshift to the first titles from the GTA series (and predominantly, GTA 2), yet just by focusing on the story, it reminds me more about Resident Evil. And you kinda help out the \u201cUmbrella Corporation\u201d in this game. They\u2019re the good guys, right? Well you (and up to 3 more friends in co-op) are part of the security detail to the Scientist faction, represented in-game by the yellow color. Your opponents from the Rebel faction, are donning purple and their main objective is stopping the Scientists (and you) from conducting any further research, while also unleashing waves upon waves of already transformed test subjects for an ultimate goal that has eluded me so far.\n\nYou\u2019ll be too busy shooting at most things that move, to actually care what some scientists wish to do with their experiments gone wrong. You\u2019re a nameless (and faceless) bodyguard who must survive this ordeal while being assisted by a vast arsenal of firearms and powers. And you\u2019ll need all the help you can get, since the friendly AI cannot really provide more than target practice for the Rebels. I strongly suggest you play the game in co-op with your friends or with strangers on some of Geneshift\u2019s public servers. No matter how much I prefer singleplayer mode in general, I have to admit that some titles are best experienced when you\u2019re cooperating with another human mind.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nI honestly thought this might be another Unity-powered game but it\u2019s apparently not. Geneshift is running on a custom engine and it looks great. From shadows, lighting, misc effects and textures, it\u2019s all carefully placed and tested. Being stuck in development for so many years, seems to have been beneficial in this case at least. Fully 3D environments which were also spared from any frame rate instability. Took 55 screenshots so far and running Geneshift in 4K resolution has been met by no performance issues at all.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe truly underwhelming part in an otherwise great title, is the lack of diversified sounds or a convincing soundtrack. And obviously no voice acting either, despite dialogue between certain NPCs. The songs playing in the background became stale long before I finished the 10 official levels within Geneshift but perhaps the dev team can add some well deserved variety even for the audio department. Looks need to be complemented by sounds too, in the case of quality video games.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay is naturaly the main feature and saving grace for Geneshift. It took many years to reach this not yet final stage and I can imagine that the game had its fair share of trial & error. From what I have played so far, in co-op with a friend, I declare myself more than pleased by the mix of action and strategy. The shooting mechanics and sheer weapon diversity are among the best I\u2019ve ever played in a top-down shooter on Steam or elsewhere. Couple that with a rich selection of power-ups and vehicular combat, in order to form a clear picture and understand why many gamers compare Geneshift to GTA 2.\n\nApart from the main goals such as clearing an area of enemies or setting up a bomb detonation, you have secondary objectives that are not mandatory yet they yield both experience and in-game currency through which players may gain access to far better equipment. No enemy type seems overpowered but by playing in singleplayer campaign mode, I can imagine that it\u2019s fairly difficult since the Artificial Intelligence seems developed only on the enemy Rebel side. With the presence of so many vehicle choices across the maps, I\u2019d certainly like to see them used more often and not just by human players. So far, they\u2019re mostly used to shield you from enemy fire (until the cars explode, of course). Full-on vehicular combat seems like a missed opportunity, in my opinion.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed the Standard Campaign you can reattempt it in Hardcore mode and only after you\u2019ve seen that through, you can try beating the game again on the final, Insane difficulty. Quite a bit of grinding over there, just for unlocking more Achievements while playing on the same 10 official maps. Luckly, you can always try out the levels made by enthusiast players. I do believe that once Geneshift gains more notoriety, there won\u2019t be a shortage of custom levels to enjoy. It\u2019s mostly just a matter of time and I think that by labeling the game as Early Access, customers won\u2019t be disappointed by the current lack of more stages.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nFor all the content it currently holds and the large potential for more, I\u2019d say that Geneshift is fully worth its price tag. The gameplay even as it stands now, sets it apart from most of its genre competitors on Steam. That\u2019s no easy feat, considering the rookie developer. And that\u2019s more of an euphemism since Geneshift had all the time in the world, to reach its current state. Some games really benefit from the trip to \u201cDevelopment Hell\u201d, provided they return determined to prove their detractors wrong.\n\n[h1]Strong Points[/h1]\n+ Beautiful graphics.\n+ Plenty of customization options.\n+ Level editor ensures replay potential.\n+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.\n\n[h1]Weak Points[/h1]\n- Few official levels in the current Early Access stage.\n- Limited sound selection.\n\n[b]Rating 85/100 [/b]\n \n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews]Imperial Reviews[/url] through the generous contribution of the game\u2019s developer.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1496047051, "timestamp_updated": 1496130922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768461", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32037125": {"recommendationid": "32037125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038959398", "num_games_owned": 1243, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513619866}, "language": "english", "review": "It may have took the developer many years to complete it, but he did it and the result is the best you could get.\nWell designed levels, good control, nice graphics, smooth, simple yet interesting and fun gameplay with a small touch of complicated, Geneshift is that game that keeps you playing on and on, it just doesn't get you bored.

The version reviewed was current at the date of this review.\n\nGeneshift is a single- and multi-player top-down twin-stick shooter from new indie developers, Nik Nak Studios.\n\nIn Geneshift, you play a cybernetic mutant combat monster, practiced at dealing swift punishment to anything in your path. Well, that's the way you're portrayed, but really you just seem to be one of the majority, no more or less practiced at death-dealing than any of the many mutants around you.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nGames in the top-down shooter genre often have difficulty in breathing life into the graphics, due to the somewhat-limited perspective. Characters, in particular, can often look like little more than coloured blobs with little parts that wiggle when they walk.\n\nGeneshift renders everything in 3D from a camera looking straight down, but sadly fares no better than most in this regard. The characters -- mutants, apparently -- are less than impressive. Animations are functional, though quite slow, and with no real 'wow' factor. The character models themselves have no personality at all; each one is the same as almost all of the others.\n\nThe environments look quite nice, though, particularly with the excellent dynamic lighting, even if they do all look the same after a while. Everything moves smoothly, even when there's a lot going on at once. Graphics and game options abound, too, so there's a fair bit to customise if the defaults don't quite suit.\n\nThe interface is busy and overly confusing, with a general lack of tooltips that makes working out (and then remembering) what everything means more difficult than it should be. Even after hours of play I'm still finding tabs and options hidden away that I didn't know were there, and still have trouble finding things that should be straightforward. There's some help, sure, but it's hidden away in a separate section of the interface (press F10) and any useful titbits are swamped in the great walls of text therein.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThe title/menu music track suits the game well, but becomes quite repetitive. In-game music only seems to start playing at certain times -- I'm not sure if it's scripted or pseudo-random -- and is similarly themed.\n\nSound effects are pretty good, with some nice gunshots. They get the job done well. There are no voices.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nGeneshift is a science-fiction top-down twin-stick shooter that eschews the rogue-like elements becoming very common to the genre and instead focuses on arena-style multiplayer mayhem. Although Geneshift has a single-player campaign, there's essentially no continuity between its levels: it plays like a series of multi-player arena maps, with bots instead of human players, and scripted events to move the fairly rudimentary story along. If you're after an enthralling single-player twin-stick shooter, Geneshift is not the game for you.\n\nThe game plays essentially like any other twin-stick shooter, with left hand controlling movement and right hand controlling aiming and shooting. Mouse and keyboard controls are good for 'core' actions, but there are lots of other keys to remember for help, activating or swapping skills, using shields, and so on, so it can become overwhelming at first. I didn't try using a controller.\n\nPrimary weapons are purchased or can be picked up. You start only with your knife, and the old saying about bringing a knife to a gunfight holds true here; you'll quickly want to buy or find something else. You can only hold one weapon of each size and ammunition is in short supply, often cutting prolonged battles or guerrilla-style raids short as you turn tail and run for the nearest resupply point.\n\nSkills are powered by mana, which I really can't understand, given the mutant and cybernetic focus of the game. But plot isn't Geneshift's strong point. Once you unlock these and spend skill points on them you have quite a good selection available, with multiple levels of upgrades for each. Each one comes with a downside, though, so using a skill at the wrong time can both drain your mana, making your other skills unavailable, and also leave you exposed from the skill's drawbacks.\n\nProbably the most welcome addition to the genre from my point of view is that of vehicles that you can enter, and drive around. Get a team of your guys together and you can do some serious damage to your opponents, both from running them over and also shooting from the various seats in the car. These handle quite well, too, and can easily turn the tide in a large melee.\n\nAs far as the single-player campaign goes, you can choose from four difficulty levels, with only the first two available when you first start. Once you've completed the campaign once, the third difficulty unlocks, and a further completion at that level unlocks the final difficulty. Honestly, though, I think I'd rather eat a raw ghost chilli than sit through the entire campaign four times! As well as the general feeling of the campaign being 'tacked on' to make the game appeal to non-multi-player gamers, the script is pretty terrible (though with fairly good grammar, I must say) and there's no saving mid-level, so make sure you can spare the time if you sit down to play it.\n\nMulti player provides a number of game modes, but they mostly feel pretty similar to each other, even though they may have different victory conditions. At the moment there's only one official server available (in the USA), and it was the only server to which I was able to connect. With no useful error messages available for the failed connections, I can't even begin to investigate why. Ping times are high across the board, too, with the best I saw being about 250 ms -- a huge disadvantage in a competitive multi-player action game. Given the multi-player focus of the game, though, I would expect server availability and the general experience to improve as the game moves through Early Access.\n\nWith the game still being in Early Access, one might expect some bugs and stability issues, but that doesn't seem to be the case here; it's very stable and seems essentially bug free. I'm not sure what else is planned for EA, but given the focus of the game, I think much more time spent on single player is probably going to be wasted, unless it is completely redesigned from scratch; the multi-player arenas are where the appeal of the game lies.\n\n[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]\nPros:\n+ Plenty of skills and improvements\n+ Good server browser information\n+ Good dynamic lighting\n+ Cars are fun\n+ Good grammar\n+ Steam Achievements and Trading Cards\n\nCons:\n- Game is designed for multi player; single-player campaign feels tacked on\n- Difficulties with server connections; high ping\n- With the limited mana available, skills are a bit naff\n- Platform-style elements are annoying\n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nGeneshift is a mindless, but mildly entertaining single-player game. If you're looking for the next campaign-based twin-stick shooter, then Geneshift probably isn't it. But if you're a fan of arena shooters and you're in your element in top-down environments, then it's probably worth watching.\n\nAutosave\nSave\n[h1]Save for Later[/h1]\nPause\nQuit\nRage Quit\n\nNote: I received this game for free for review purposes.

While the game has singleplayer (which is really a glorified tutorial, but worth playing nevertheless), multiplayer is the main focus of the game. Multiplayer combat is quick & decisive, though one-shot kills are pretty rare & situational, and so its more focused on clever positioning & skill usage rather than raw run & gun ability. Multiplayer matches generally last anywhere between 30min to 1 hour, while the singleplayer can last about 4 hours for your first playthrough, with replay value in unlocking higher difficulties & getting a better speedrun record.\n\nSpeaking from my experience as a player in Singapore connecting to USA or Europe, the game remains very [b]playable even in 300 ping lag[/b]. \n\nI find that the [b]main learning curve is knowing what skills to use or pick in a given situation[/b] - once you get past that you can pretty much do anything, and its fortunately pretty easy to figure out with the in-game descriptions. Don't worry about permanently screwing up your character's build - servers are usually set to Quickmatch (all players are reset to level 5). If you bought the game, you do have permanent mutants you can use on Permanent servers, but you can easily reset your build at no cost as long as you're under level 20 (max level is 50 for context), and even past that it only costs you an hour of gameplay for every skillpoint you wish to put elsewhere.\n\nSeeing as the game is in early access, I can assure you that the [b]sole developer[/b] has put his heart & soul into polishing the game for the past 8 years and won't be abandoning it anytime soon. He is very receptive to community feedback; in fact the idea of zombies and a singleplayer campaign came from the regular player community.

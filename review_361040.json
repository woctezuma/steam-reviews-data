But the story was more about dimensions overlapping and stuff than parody set pieces this time which was okay and I enjoyed the locations and characters, though I hop you do more with them as I find them pretty interesting, like explore Viola and her getting use to technology or Esmeralda's crush on Francis. I know you gonna do something with the Emporer later.\n\nI do have two big things that bother me. One was the opening. I was so confused about what was happening and who Esmeralda was and what was with Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage. It bothered me personaly. Another issue I had was the villain. I didn't find him that fun or interesting. The villain from the last game was just clever in every way and made the world make so much sense. Solomon Steel was just.. I don't know. I just didn't like him.\n\nI would say I liked the ending in this one way more than the last game. How they escaped was pretty clever and I like those kinds of endings.\n\nGameplay: \nSame but different is the best way to describe it. I was a bit put off by the lack of invortory and that everything relied on money, food, mana and stuff. But after awhile and experimenting with some items and classes, I think it works. Like it encouages you to spend them but make sure you have enough.\n\nAnd I also liked the classes I've played so far, with the only exception being the Necromancer. While some we're the same to me only with a few buffs like a counter or increase damge, I put the effort in trying to upgrade them every chance I get. I even liked using the chef for his ability weaken enemies and make them bleed. \n\nAnd finally: OH MY GOD, Death is a freaken truck!\n\nPresentation:\nI'm a sucker for the cute, happy look everyone has and I like the monster deisgns, espiaclly those cute underground squares. The music was okay with my favorite being the one for Limbo or the world map but my least favorite track is the boss music. But I got use to it. It's not god awful.\ntouch\nAnd I really like that you used the same world map but mildly changed it to fit the story and locations was a nice touch.

first Doom and Destiny was an unexpected strike of liquid gold. Despite its generic RPG Maker graphics and sometimes poor translation, it came out swinging as one of the best turn based RPGs since the SNES era. The sequel, however, leaves much to be desired. This review is while the game is still unfinished, but there are some glaring issues not related to bugs, balance, or the unfinished story.\n\nPROS: \n- Custom graphics that while cartoony, fit the tone of the game quite well.\n- Class system has the potential to be interesting, especially when used to find secrets and navigate terrain.\n- Clever introduction to a story: the game functions as a parallel universe to the original story, which has the potential to make a very interesting tale.\n\nCONS:\n- The characters fall flat to the original. This is a big problem, as the charm of the dialog was what made the first game so damn good. Toilet humor rules the day in this sequel, and the characters just don't have much in the way of banter, 4th wall breaking, or personality. I played the whole time waiting for Mike to say or do something really zany, but it just never happened.\n- The story quickly goes nowhere. Interesting ideas like the frog king trying to marry the characters off to his daughters is quickly brushed aside into a boss battle. Instead this game just seems to have a very generic RPG story with a few eccentric ideas used in the background.\n- The class system feels too constrictive. You basically have to dump all your resources to get a decent level for one class per character, leaving the other classes woefully underpowered. This kind of class system would be really good if you could switch between them more liberally and usefully.\n- Equipment management is gone. Characters now auto-equip items and there\u2019s no ability to customize your characters in this regard. This is a huge disappointment, as managing equipment is a big part of any RPG, and leaves the full burden of customization to the class system, which is poorly executed.\n\nOverall I\u2019d say this game needs a lot of work to be anywhere near as enjoyable as the first game. As-is, I stopped playing after a dozen or so hours, not because I reached the end of the content available at the time, but simply because I was getting bored. For now, this sequel is simply a disappointment.", "timestamp_created": 1466267497, "timestamp_updated": 1466267497, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750783", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23600530": {"recommendationid": "23600530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070856203", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465918055}, "language": "italian", "review": "\"Please Emma, I love you!\"\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1466101320, "timestamp_updated": 1466101320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23411203": {"recommendationid": "23411203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020203614", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486310573}, "language": "french", "review": "Apr\u00e8s avoir fait D&D sur portable, D&DA est un v\u00e9ritable vent de fraicheur, certaines nouveaut\u00e9 rendent le gameplay un peu trop simple (genre la modif de l'ar\u00e8ne) mais comme je n'en suis encore qu'au d\u00e9but je ne peux pas juger des cons\u00e9quences ult\u00e9rieures.

The other thing I enjoyed when playing this game is I constantly feel like I'm playing dungeons and dragons the game really gives off that vibe even though it has jrpg style combat. If I were to reccomend improving anything so far it would just be to maybe make the game a little tougher so that the enemies take longer to kill. I think at the present it is a little too easy and making the enemies a little tougher would make the game time longer to.

D'ailleurs les caract\u00e9ristiques pr\u00e9dominantes de chaque job vous permettent de savoir quels sont les caract\u00e9ristiques \u00e0 booster en priorit\u00e9 (+2 de carac' en bonus apr\u00e8s un level up). M\u00eame si les persos ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 des caract\u00e9ristiques pr\u00e9d\u00e9finis de bases (faut se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux couleurs), ils peuvent s'adapter sur tout r\u00f4le. N'importe lequel d'entre eux peut \u00eatre heal, soutien, guerrier, tank. Et chaque techniques/attaques est l'occasion de voir une phrase d\u00e9bile en combat : \"La vie de h\u00e9ros co\u00fbte cher, tu sais ?\"(Avec le passif de rogue de Francis), l'obsession de Mike pour le \"Monstre Spaghetti\" etc.\n\nCela am\u00e8ne parfois les h\u00e9ros \u00e0 sortir des clich\u00e9s et r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 tout et n'importe quoi, m\u00eame les cosplay des diff\u00e9rents jobs n'y \u00e9chappent pas : Le Fighter avec un skin de Kratos, le Rogue qui a un skin de banquier. Le sage Schtroumpf qu'on retrouve dans les mar\u00e9es. On va retrouver la Mort mangeant une pizza (Un p'tit c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"Le Disque-Monde\").\n\nLe jeu a une difficult\u00e9 tr\u00e8s bien dos\u00e9, ni trop dur, ni trop facile, bourr\u00e9 de side-quest et de secret vraiment bien foutus et dissimul\u00e9s (bien que parfois le grind est obligatoire pour les side-quest, notamment si l'on veut le fighter et les tr\u00e9sors de certains rois/reines. Et aussi que le gold peut vite se gagner dans les ar\u00e8nes, notamment celles de l'Empereur). Le trip clich\u00e9 du geek qui se retrouve plong\u00e9 dans un autre monde fonctionne \u00e0 merveille, avec des situations ridicules : les gars qui ne s'embarrassent pas de formalit\u00e9s ou d'autres qui se la jouent RP et qui se foirent lamentablement, sans compter les taunts que se prend Francis sur son premier job (Cuistot, alors que dans leurs jeux RP il incarne un voleur).\n\nL'OST est correct. Sans plus, dans certaines zones les musiques sont bien utilis\u00e9s, on est dans l'ambiance, mais \u00e0 contrario \u00e0 certains moments, les combats de boss notamment, on a pas d'impressions \u00e9piques, ou de mise en ambiance.\n\nPrix plus que raisonnable, il est en Alpha, mais il semblerait que l'aventure principale peut \u00eatre d\u00e9j\u00e0 finis.

Doom & Destiny: Advanced looks to raise the bar and add another insane adventure for you to feast upon. With all new features including classes, revamped abilities, cross platform play, and more! At the heart of the game though, what matters most is the humor and joyous spirit that was so perfectly captured in the first game. Does Do&De2 capture that? I believe so, with the theme being multi-dimensional versions of our main heroes. From the combat system to item management, everything has been streamlined for ease of use and getting to the fun and adventure. The game still does feature quite a bit of customization; stats, classes, and even appearance are yours to tinker with and change. Making a version of the party that is truly unique to your play style is one of the key focuses of Do&De2. The best part is that there is more to come, with new features being cooked up and added all the time. There is still some bumps on the road mind you, some grammar fixes, lack of start up menu, repetitive music. None of the former really stop the game from being an enjoyable experience. So gather your swords, staffs, and spatulas? \nDamn Francis. \nAhem...

As you try to escape you are then teleported back to the real world where you are heading to play Do&De (essentially Dungeons and Dragons).\n\nWhat this game does well is the humor. From the characters dialogue to the enemies you face there's constantly little things to have a good chuckle. For instance one of the first enemies you face is a giant poop monsters. I mean come on, how stupid is that (It's delightfully stupid that's how much).\n\nThe beginning of the game does a good job of taking you through a tutorial without making you feel like that's what it is. Woven into the first parts of the game are npc you can interact with that tell you what different things do. It's an effective way to get you started.\n\nThe rpg parts are typical of a top down rpg. You cast spells, level up, heal up and murder bitches. What really sets this game apart is the humor and charm. The story seems deep and enjoyable. Not without it's faults I've seen others report bugs, I personally didn't run into any. It is an early access game so I'm sure there are plenty of bugs. Even their updates point to bug fixes.\n\nFor more Indie Game, Movie and Music Reviews and Indie Game Podcast - EarlyAccessMedia.com, EarlyAccessPodcast.com and YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast", "timestamp_created": 1434322106, "timestamp_updated": 1434425336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16382172": {"recommendationid": "16382172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149083429", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470744231}, "language": "english", "review": "Less funny than the prequel, but much more interesting gameplay.

I've been having a blast with my band of nerdy bros so far and can't wait for the game to be finished.\n\nDo&DeAdv is more of a parallel universe than a sequel to the original. Many things will be familiar to those who played the first but it's an entirely different story. 17 hours including thorough exploration for secrets, puzzle solving, moderate exp grinding, unlocking and upgrading classes, online matchmaking, party optimisation for online battles, game bug hunting (to help flesh out the game) and I'm just past the half way mark through the game. There is a lot going for Do&DeAdv, though the english translation needs a lot of improvement (it's made by a group of Italians). I'm very forgiving when it comes to this but it may be enough to give others fluent in English a headache every now and then.\n\nThe devs are quite active in the community and are gladly and willingly accepting feedback and suggestions, as they were with the first game for years.\n\nShould you get it? As with every Early Access, not everything is in the game yet and there's a lot of polishing that needs to be done. The main story is complete and every essential location is accessible. A couple of classes still need to be implemented as well as various locations and features such as New Game+, Steam cards/achievements.

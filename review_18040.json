The dialogues are interesting and also, there is a plenty of jokes in them. The characters are interesting, well designed and voice-acted good. Also, there are many items to collect, many weapons to fight with and some delicious food to feed your hungry belly and restore some of your health!\n\nOverall, I'd say the game is a little bit childish, but it doesn't matter, because it's super fun.

It mostly ends up in button mashing and the block button had almost no point for me in the playthrough\n\nCons:\n- The game can be rather Difficult. The game sometimes leads you into zones where you shouldnt be and pushes you into wrong directions. Maybe im bad at listening where the NPCS want me to go, but when the game tells me to go into a zone at lvl 10 and the first enemies i see are level 20 it can lead up to rather confusing moments.\n\n\nOverall its a nice title that should be considered grabbing up if it can be shot at a low price.

After picking it up for PC, I have to say that it met my expectations.\n\nI genuinely feel you'll only be able to get a playthrough or two out of it, since there really isn't enough variety in the path you'll take to complete all the quests to justify coming back through the world again other than for some nostalgia, and/or if you really really get a kick out of the world/story.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd have to say the price range is fair for the quality of experience you get and the amount of playtime you'll see out of this.  I played it through the day I picked it up and finished the main quest line and all side quests in about 10 hours for my first playthrough. If you got a couple bucks to spare and have ever thought about buying Deathspank before, I really recommend taking the chance and picking this up.

It sounds all good until I tell you that the quest system kind of sucks, and I was constantly wondering where to go for the next objective. As well there are a few puzzles in the game that really throw me for a loop and are the type of puzzles seen in 90s adventure games.\n\nAn example of one such puzzle is at some point you get a wheel in the game, and need to use it as a gear inside a dam, to lower the water outside of the damn. In any other game you would just put the wheel in and it would work. However in this game it gives you a hint to remove the wood from the wheel. I then spent a good 10 minutes trying to combine the wheel with fire items in my inventory hoping to burn the wood off since some of the puzzles require combining items. This did not work - also at this point I had run out of fortune cookies, which are used in the game to get hints on how to complete puzzles in this game. So when I finally quit the game and typed it into google, the answer turned out to be \"take the wheel to the termite hill east of the damn, drop it, and the termites will eat the wood off of it.\" For those who have not played the game, it is incredibly easy to miss this hill when going to the damn. \n\nSo it's moments like these (and there were a few in the game) that really frustrated me, because rather than playing the game I had to jump out and google the answer. I would have rather the game give you all of the hints for each puzzle if you wanted them, and maybe reward players who didn't use hints, because any game that requires you to alt-tab to find the answer is not doing a good job of guiding the player in my opinion. That all being said though I still recommend this game for its art style, music, fun combat, and cleaver writing and dialogue - just keep in mind the puzzles and quest system that really should have had some kind of map to help it - will cause a few moments of frustration along the way.\n", "timestamp_created": 1494959217, "timestamp_updated": 1494959217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516786", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31602854": {"recommendationid": "31602854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188545853", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502454731}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5728\u51e0\u5e74\u524d\u6211\u73a9\u7684\u67d0\u6c11\u661f\u7a7a\u6b63\u7248\uff0c\u662f\u6211\u5c11\u6709\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\uff0c\u6253\u51fb\u611f\u90fd\u5f88\u68d2\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u6076\u8da3\u5473\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e5f\u662f\u4eae\u70b9\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e38\u620f\u6d41\u7a0b\u592a\u77ed\uff0c\u8981\u662f\u518d\u52a0\u70b9\u5185\u5bb9\u5c31\u66f4\u597d\u4e86\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u5165\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6b63\u7248\uff0c\u7eaf\u7cb9\u662f\u6000\u5ff5\uff0c\u73a9\u7684\u5c11\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1494159100, "timestamp_updated": 1494159100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31466849": {"recommendationid": "31466849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054004608", "num_games_owned": 512, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476985694}, "language": "english", "review": "A very funny game that uses a cartoon popup book type approach to the graphix, a funny narrative and a very funny protagonist that is comepletely useless.

Along the way he meet a slew of people who will help him defeat Von Prong, with some draw backs. You gradually venture through the world righting wrongs and helping other random people with simple tasks, like settling a married couples problems. Eventually you figure out what he\u2019s doing and the destruction he\u2019s done.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly boring, despite the controls are easy to master. Most of the quests are nothing but fetch quests. You go to a certain location and either kill a certain creature a dozen or so times or find a certain item. Also it locks you out of certain areas before you\u2019re anywhere near that level so it strips some exploration from you due to the fact that you can\u2019t discover things early like in the Elder Scrolls series. All fighting is just clicking and popping potions. This doesn\u2019t require any skill and only makes it more irritating when many areas can easily overwhelm you with enemies. The terrain is limited and lacks interactivity, despite it being well pixelated.\n\nThe graphics are lavishly cartoony and are well shaded. The 2d houses are a nice touch to the game because it leaves room so you can click behind the building and go around it. Other times it allows you to pick up items from enemies you\u2019ve killed behind buildings. There are even areas that the depths in the terrain curves and makes it whole experience feel like you are truly trapped in a small world. To a certain extent it feels like a throw back to top down third person games even though a lot of the world seems like it trys to just round out everything and not over tax whatever system you\u2019re playing it on.\n\nI just completely hate the jokes. Out of all the dialogue and story, which is just bland, the jokes stand out for being the most terrible part of the game. To a certain extent I will admit that comedy is difficult to do in video games. However, after years of experiencing the gaming culture, and how many people take time to go out of their way to mock themselves, the jokes would fall short due to how generic they feel and simplicity of the jokes. Like they have a few pieces of armor that are given names to play off of other RPG cliches, like the Gauntlets of Awesomeness. Then they\u2019ll have quests to get chicken lips and the reason the witch wants you to get them basically amounts to \u201cWhy not?\u201d It\u2019s just lame. Its like they\u2019re late to the party and everyone has already talked about the shit they wanted to and are drunk or asleep. I\u2019m not saying they need to change their humor but a lot of it is too intentional and forced.\n\nI was disappointed by this game. People keep saying its hilarious or a good \u2018comedy game.\u2019 It was rarely funny and the few jokes that did make me chuckle was almost reminiscent of kid humor or some decent play on words. The gameplay was completely boring. There isn\u2019t any real skill to it all. There\u2019s even a option to let the system chose the best armor for you. At most you just need to stock up on potions and grind grind grind your way to level 20 and after that everything else is cake. Even older games like the original Diablo took more skill then this.

introduced a modern war. Currently it was released remaster of this production. which is not bad but available only when you buy CoD: Infinite Warfare what I think is pathetic. According to me, this is one of the best CoD's that you can buy. The game is designed in most for the multiplayer gameplay but the main campaign is very good but short, as it always happens with these games. Online game lasts for many hours of fun, however, as once the game was a lot of dynamic now it is about hiding in the corners and wait for the kill. There is not a lot of weapons but it's good because we do not have to check every weapon that suits us. Modes are pretty cool, standard nothing outstanding. In the game there are different kinds of perks that will improve our game for example, faster reload. And if it was not enough in the internet you can find servers with zombie mod which are really cool. I think it's great production from which I have many pleasant memories. Many hours once I lost and so far nothing has changed so much that it is a little less players and there is not that much cheaters in game. Definitely worth it to go back to the game for those few hours to play with friends.\n", "timestamp_created": 1488069254, "timestamp_updated": 1488069254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.410575", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30104034": {"recommendationid": "30104034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122580316", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487785481}, "language": "english", "review": "I just can't say enough good things about this game!

Sadly the game goes only up to level 20, and ends with a rather open ended end so...\n\nReplayability: 6\nWeak point of the game, is that once you did it all...there is nothing left to do. At most, you could attempt to restart the whole game trying to play it in the hardest difficulty setting, but nothing else. If only the \"good/evil\" bar actually did work and changed dialogues and stuff, it would had been more interesting with plenty of reasons to start all over again.\n\nFun: 9\nI was throroughly amused through the whole game, with each NPC having something funny to say.

With enemies like kangamoos and saber-toothed donkeys, it pretty much explains it all. The dialogs in this game is mostly hilarious with the classic \"everybody is dumb\" jokes. Yes, deathspank is dumb and i love it! I have countless times laughed at his dumb comments and it never gets old! And the people that speaks to Deathspank is sometimes just as fun!\nThe game got cartoonish 3d graphics with 2d elements and it looks very cool. The sound, the art style, the atmosphere, it really makes you smile!\nIts a simple game really, you get your main important quests and you get your secondary less important quests while you slay all possible kinds of enemies to make your way through the different areas to complete them. Tons of weapons and sometimes funny looking armors to choose. Well, you dont really choose because you always take the best armor and weapon but they all look different at least and have different powers. The fighting is basic you either slash them or you shoot them and they drop plenty of loot. You can also block and while youre leveling up you can boost your skills a bit.\nAt first the game holds a very high funfactor but was a bit rushed at the end. Which means that 1/4 of the map is basically landscapes with barely no new quests to find. It ends really fast, just one final bossfight and then youre finished. And the funny dialog gets slimmer further on by the same reason that it was rushed.

The only exception to these are the weapons which allow you to use your Justice Meter, which also have tiered upgrades, but deciding which of them to use is actually slightly interesting - though I found the spinning swords to be the best of them by far, to the point where I didn't really use the others much. This also affects the stores in the game, which have very little worth purchasing until you're level 18 and can just buy the best equipment in the game - before that point, items are far too expensive, don't offer a huge benefit (unless, as it did for me, the game basically refused to ever drop crossbows for you) and will likely be replaced quickly with items dropped by monsters or found in treasure chests.\n\nWith the itemization out of the way, the game is on the simple side - except for a few difficulty spikes like the Pip Village, I found Normal to basically be walking through the early game and killing everything in 1-3 hits, and later doing it just as fast from range with the crossbow. There's a variety of consumable items, but I only really used the healing items because it didn't seem like I ever really needed any of the others, or had a clear idea of when element resistance potions or whatnot would even have been useful. So, yeah. The combat wasn't terribly interesting, and neither were the rewards for the combat.\n\nThe parody elements were occasionally amusing, but frequently fell flat for me - that you're going on a set of stupid fetch quests isn't made any better by the game calling attention to how stupid the fetch quests are, for instance. It's one of my gripes about parody RPGs in general, that they frequently seem to think that it excuses replicating bad game design for the sake of parody. Some of the more puzzle-like quests were amusing, however, and weren't something I was used to in this type of game.\n\nUltimately, DeathSpank is the kind of game I would mostly suggest trying if you think its style of humor would appeal to you. It doesn't really stack up well without that. (Unfortunately, it also seems as if DeathSpank never goes on sale any more, from what I've heard? So I can't even really suggest picking it up on the cheap, even though it's over five years old now.)", "timestamp_created": 1449094937, "timestamp_updated": 1449094937, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534523", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19392975": {"recommendationid": "19392975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181480445", "num_games_owned": 1271, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448900727}, "language": "italian", "review": "One of the funniest games I ever played.\nDeathSpank is a solid Hack 'n' Slash Rpg with a light-hearted\\humorous tone, a simple but interesting story, a diverse cast of hilarious characters, a lot of quests to do (110+ in total), items, weapons and armor sets to buy\\find, treasure chests to open, enemies\\bosses to defeat and a decent sized world map to explore. The graphics is cartoony (in LucasArts style) and very well done, with a 3D world and characters mixed to 2D decorations (like trees, buildings, ecc...). The music is pretty catchy but the strongest point of the game are obviously the dialogues, the dialogues are what makes this game great, they are hilariously entertaining most of the time with a lot of references to other popular games\\movies. The combat is fun, with a lot of weird weapons of any sort (from the Chicken Cannon to the Poop Hammer), the ability of blocking incoming attacks using DeathSpank's shield and recharging his Justice bar to unleash the equipped weapons special abilities. There's also a decent variety of potions\\orbs that grant special effects on him (like Stealth, Elemental Resist, Protect, Invulnerability, Summoning, Haste, ecc...).\n\nOverall the game is great and very funny, it lasts around 12 hours, as much as 15 if you're a completist and want to finish all the quests.

I love this series, though, I did not like the fact that eventually the game starts to get so much more difficult as you get to the mid to higher levels. Now I am not so wimpy that I cannot handle a challenge, but in some areas, you will be swarmed by enemies, some or all of which are tough enemy types, such as the tough mother spider types (it has been a while since I played so I forget a lot of the enemies) and the Jotuns. Yes, they will have minion types with them that just die in a few hits, but then you get swarmed by a bunch of regular spider types or jotuns or demons or w/e, and you are toast.\n\nNow, maybe I am missing something, and there is a trick to it to avoid getting swarmed like that and dying, a lot. But for me, if I die too many times, then it is no longer fun for me. I am not saying I don't like challenging games, I do, I just hate dying every 5 minutes or so, or dying until I figure out the secret... I am in no way saying that makes this game bad, it doesn't, I am saying I am probably a bad player. If you are a fan of crude humor, hilarious plot lines and quests, and hilarious weaponry and quest rewards and action RPGs, then this is your game. If not, or if you are like me and are not a fan of dying, a lot, then this may not be your game, still worth looking at though, to see if you will like it.", "timestamp_created": 1439429560, "timestamp_updated": 1439429560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17398159": {"recommendationid": "17398159", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996919908", "num_games_owned": 939, "num_reviews": 228, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438742076}, "language": "german", "review": "[h1]Der absolute Wahnsinn!!![/h1]\n\nLeider ist DeathSpank nur auf Englisch verf\u00fcgbar, aber auf der anderen Seite w\u00fcrde das Spiel sonst auch wirklich viel von seinem Charm einb\u00fc\u00dfen.\nDer Storyplot ist mehr als einfach: B\u00f6sewicht besiegen, Artefakt besorgen, zwischendurch ein paar ungeliebte Waisenkinder retten.... EINHORN SCHEI\u00dfE SAMMELN? WTF?\nUnd damit sind wir auch an dem gro\u00dfen Pluspunkt von Deathspank: Unser Held und andere Charaktere beweisen super lustigen Humor, wo ich mich \u00f6fters mal am Stuhl festkrallen musste, damit ich nicht runterfalle. Deathspank muss sich stets profilieren und ist nur an EXP und Belohnungen interessiert und die Dialoge gestalten sich einfach wirklich witzig.\nGespielt wird dabei im Dungeoncrawler/Hack n Slay Stil und dieser ist gut gelungen. Insbesondere das Feature, dass man einstellen kann, dass Deathspank immer die beste R\u00fcstung automatisch anlegt, gef\u00e4llt mir sehr. Nur leider konnte ich recht wenig mit dem Gold machen und habe das Spiel mit 2 Millionen Gold abgeschlossen. Abgesehen von Futter und Tr\u00e4nken l\u00e4sst sich lange nichts kaufen. Dennoch ist das Spiel an manchen Stellen fordernd und etwas schwierig.(Insbesondere der letzte Boss).\n\nFazit:\nEin super lustiges Spiel mit einem Grafikstil, den man ganz gut mit dem von \"Don`t Starve\" vergleichen kann(Meine Meinung). Dazu sch\u00f6nes Gemetzel und eine moderate Spielzeit mit ca. 10 Stunden. Zudem gibt es von Deathspank noch weitere Teile und man kann auch zu zweit spielen. Wer auf das Gameplay steht und ein wenig Englisch versteht, wird hier definitv seinen Spa\u00df dran haben :)\n\n\n\nWenn dir das Review gefallen hat, schau doch mal auf meinem Let`s Play Kanal.

"Rozbraja mnie patos z przymru\u017ceniem oka. W DeathSpanku na powa\u017cnie nie jest chyba nic a dodatkowo jest to humor wysokich lot\u00f3w. Kierujemy za to bohaterem mieni\u0105cym si\u0119 wieloma tytu\u0142ami, istnym obro\u0144c\u0105 uci\u015bnionych i nios\u0105cym sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107...chyba tylko DeathSpank bierze to wszystko serio. Rozgrywka to czyste action RPG z prostym i satysfakcjonuj\u0105cym systemem walki, aczkolwiek z przepakowanym blokiem. W\u0142a\u015bciwie element RPG sprowadzono niemal do minimum, bo awanse nast\u0119puj\u0105 automatycznie a lista dost\u0119pnych perk\u00f3w nie powala na kolana. Przedmioty te\u017c nie stawiaj\u0105 dylemat\u00f3w decyzyjnych i warto zwyczajnie w\u0142\u0105czy\u0107 ich automatyczne prze\u0142\u0105czanie na lepszy, gdy\u017c r\u00f3\u017cni\u0105 si\u0119 w\u0142a\u015bciwie tylko statystyk\u0105 obra\u017ce\u0144/pancerza. \u017beby jednak minusy nie przys\u0142oni\u0142y nam plus\u00f3w. DeathSpank nie aspiruje do miana symulatora rzutu kostk\u0105 na wszystko a ma bawi\u0107 i robi to udanie. Questy s\u0105 zabawne i ciekawie pomy\u015blane. \u015awiat ze swoimi dwuwymiarowymi budynkami podkre\u015bla humorystyczne walory gry i wygl\u0105da po prostu dobrze. No i kr\u0119ci si\u0119 jak gdyby planeta mia\u0142a \u015brednic\u0119 wi\u0119kszej pi\u0142ki pla\u017cowej, co mi osobi\u015bcie wpad\u0142o w oko. Przy\u0142o\u017cono si\u0119 tak\u017ce do voice actingu i ka\u017cda posta\u0107 brzmi tak, jak brzmie\u0107 powinna. O DeathSpanku mo\u017cna powiedzie\u0107, \u017ce jest lekki, \u0142atwy i przyjemny.

It's still about orcs, wizards  etc, but in no other rpg you will see all this characters from this funny and crazy perspective.", "timestamp_created": 1393459859, "timestamp_updated": 1393459859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9221846": {"recommendationid": "9221846", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972781843", "num_games_owned": 982, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1389301028}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bueno, ahora que ya he terminado la trilogia voy a hacerle un repasillo...\n\nDeathspank: Donde el heroe deathspank  sigue la pista de un poderoso artefacto conocido unicamente como \"el artefacto\" y que nadie sabe exactamente que utilidad tiene pese a su gran poder.\n\nDeathspank thongs of virtue: Donde continua la historia del anterior y despues de un inesperado giro en la historia habra que encontrar los  legendarios tangas del destino que otorgan grandes y absurdos poderes a sus poseedores.\n\nThe baconing: Tras reunir todos los tangas del destino Deathspank decide usarlos a la vez lo que provoca un desequilibrio en el orden e invoca una version gigantesca y malvada de si mismo, comenzara asi la busqueda de los misticos fuegos del beicon donde fuero forjados los tangas y donde unicamente pueden ser destruidos para restablecer el equilibrio.\n\nTremenda saga de juegos RPG de accion donde controlamos a Deathspank: Heroe de los oprimidos, exterminador del mal, dispensador de justicia, un heroe fanfarron, no demasiado listo y totalmente pasdado de vueltas. El juego cuenta con una jugabilidad cojonuda que permite utilizar hasta 8 armas y/o objetos a la vez desde pociones con efectos varios, armas a distancia, espadas, hachas, granadas, bazookas, orbes con poderes magicos, etc y con mas de 20 sets de armaduras diferentes en cada uno de los juegos. La historia esta bastante bien y llena de sentido del humor con la firma de Ron Gilbert creador de los Monkey island y guionista del mitico maniac mansion cosa que queda patente en los personajes y dialogos que son la risa. graficamente es un juego competente pese a tener ya unos a\u00f1os ya que tampoco pretende tener una estetica realista sino mas bien un aspecto comico y colorista bastante logrado. musicalmente no es ningun alarde pero cumple de manera adecuada.

Par exemple, lorsque votre h\u00e9ros monte de niveau, les points d'exp\u00e9rience sont distribu\u00e9s automatiquement, et vous ne choisissez qu'une carte d'attribut, qui vous donne un pourcentage de vitesse, de d\u00e9fense ou de dommage suppl\u00e9mentaire. Seulement 6 cat\u00e9gories de cartes sont disponibles, avec des attributs de plus en plus puissants. M\u00eame chose du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'inventaire, qui offre l'option de porter automatiquement les meilleures pi\u00e8ces d'armures r\u00e9colt\u00e9es en chemin. Vous devrez tout de m\u00eame \u00e9quiper vos armes selon vos pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\n\nAlors que plusieurs qu\u00eates ne constituent souvent qu'une simple course du point A au point B, leur contexte est largement hilarant. Vous devrez par exemple sauver des orphelins afin d'aider \u00e0 la r\u00e9\u00e9lection du maire d'un petit village, ramasser de la crotte de d\u00e9mon, trouver un d\u00e9guisement \u00e0 un farfadet dont la t\u00eate est mise \u00e0 mort, etc. Vous aurez envie d'essayer toutes les options de dialogue \u00e0 chaque rencontre, afin de savourer les nombreuses blagues et clins d'\u0153il \u00e0 la culture populaire qu'on retrouve \u00e0 chaque tirade. Une partie puzzle s'ajoute \u00e0 l'ensemble, o\u00f9 il vous faudra parfois combiner deux objets pour avancer une qu\u00eate. Visuellement, l'univers de Deathspank est unique et color\u00e9, \u00e9voquant un dessin anim\u00e9 interactif avec des environnements tr\u00e8s stylis\u00e9s. Soulignons le travail impeccable des com\u00e9diens, n\u00e9cessaire en com\u00e9die, ainsi que la musique, qui appuie bien le c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u00e9jant\u00e9 du jeu sans jamais devenir agressante.\n\nUn deuxi\u00e8me joueur peut joindre l'action en tout temps sur la m\u00eame console, et incarner le sorcier Sparkles. Malheureusement, le second personnage ne dispose que de peu d'ind\u00e9pendance, ne poss\u00e9dant pas son propre inventaire et allant jusqu'\u00e0 partager la m\u00eame barre de vie que le personnage principal. Malgr\u00e9 son c\u00f4t\u00e9 incomplet, l'ajout d'un mode coop\u00e9ratif est bienvenu, vu le nombre d'ennemis pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran simultan\u00e9ment et les habilet\u00e9s de gu\u00e9rison du sorcier. On se demande tout de m\u00eame pourquoi les d\u00e9veloppeurs n'ont pas int\u00e9gr\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de jouer en mode coop\u00e9ratif avec une seconde personne en ligne, ce qui aurait ajout\u00e9 \u00e9norm\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9rience. Malgr\u00e9 tout, il est agr\u00e9able de partager l'aventure avec une autre personne sur le m\u00eame sofa, ce que peu de titres permettent aujourd'hui. Si vous aimez les jeux qui ne se prennent pas au s\u00e9rieux, vous risquez de rire \u00e0 plusieurs reprises avec Deathspank, un h\u00e9ros qui transforme le combat contre le Mal en une farce

O seu lema \u00e9 trazer a justi\u00e7a ao de cima sem se importar de como a obt\u00e9m usando todos os meios necess\u00e1rios.\n  Durante anos foi-lhe dada uma miss\u00e3o por uma mulher de cabelos vermehos. Essa miss\u00e3o \u00e9 a cerca de um Artefacto raro e com grandes poderes.\n  Praticamente a hist\u00f3ria do jogo foca-se em volta desse Artefacto mas, \u00e9 claro que vamos achar muitos obst\u00e1culos mas nada que n\u00e3o se resolva com uma bela arma na m\u00e3o.\n\nLongevidade:\n  Demorei cerca de 14 horas a completar o jogo na dificuldade normal. Quando digo em completar refiro-me \u00e0s quests principais e secund\u00e1rias.\n  Portanto 14 horas para um jogo Indie como este \u00e9 excelente.\n\nJogabilidade:\n  A jogabilidade \u00e9 a de um RPG id\u00eantico a Diablo, ou seja, temos o nosso ivent\u00e1rio e as slots para armas, armaduras, colares e an\u00e9is. Mas temos 2 tipos de ivent\u00e1rios. Um pertence aos itens das quests e o outro pertence aos itens do nosso equipamento. Em ambos os ivent\u00e1rios temos uma esp\u00e9cie de moidor que transforma os nossos itens em dinheiro. Dinheiro esse que podemos utilizar para obter novos itens, como armas, po\u00e7\u00f5es, etc.\n  O sistema de cura \u00e9 simples. Recuperamos vida atrav\u00e9s de alimentos ou po\u00e7\u00f5es.\n  O sistema de combate tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 bastante simples. Com o bot\u00e3o direito do rato atacamos com a arma prim\u00e1ria, com o bot\u00e3o esquerdo do rato atacamos com a arma secund\u00e1ria e com a tecla Espa\u00e7o bloqueamos os ataques. E ainda temos 2 sets de armamento e podemos altern\u00e1-los com a tecla TAB.\n  Tem um sistema de n\u00edvel que vai de 1 ao 20 e em cada n\u00edvel que subimos escolhemos um atributo para evoluir, que s\u00e3o, Velocidade, Ataque e Defesa. Os restantes s\u00e3o bon\u00fas como mais ouro ou poder-mos usar itens de n\u00edvel superior.\n  \u00c9 um jogo com uma jogabilidade divertida mas que por vezes se torna repetitiva, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 por isso que a jogabilidade \u00e9 m\u00e1. Muito pelo contr\u00e1rio, tem uma jogabilidade divertida e equilibrada.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos:\n  A parte gr\u00e1fica est\u00e1 simples, cartonesca e bastante variada, o que torna o jogo bastante atractivo e d\u00e1 gosto em o explorar para saber o que h\u00e1 de novo.\n  As personagens s\u00e3o bastante engra\u00e7adas e bem concebidas, de uma forma c\u00f3mica, assim como os inimigos.\n  As anima\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o simples e n\u00e3o tem assim grande variedade, o que \u00e9 pena. Mas mesmo assim est\u00e1 bom.\n\nSom:\n  A banda sonora no geral est\u00e1 boa e torna-se engra\u00e7ada com o tempo. Pois este jogo tem um toque de com\u00e9dia.\n  O ponto forte do jogo s\u00e3o as vozes e falas. Est\u00e1 simplesmente fenomenal. Os actores foram bem escolhidos e as falas est\u00e3o repletas de humor e muitas das vezes uns toques de humor negro muito bem desenvolvido e inteligente.\n\nVale a pena jogar de novo?\n  Bem, depende da perspectiva de cada um.

Hero of the Downtrodden! Those are just a couple of DeathSpank\u2019s other names in this hilarious action RPG from Hot Head Studios. You play as the silly hero DeathSpank in his quest to find The Artifact and kill the evil king Lord Von Prong. LVP wants DeathSpank\u2019s magical Thong to become more evil, but in the mean time you need to do some saving of the downtrodden.\n\nThe overall story isn\u2019t much, but the banter with NPCs is what really makes you crack up with the obvious stabs at RPGs and other games. It will take different shots at the genre without even saying anything some times like one quest has you pleasing an orphan in the Demon Mines to put in your orphan bag. You must run into town and get everything she needs, but the store just so happens to have everything you need when you get there like a cell phone and a pony! This is an obvious jab at RPGs whose stores always have what you need.\n\nThe game also has some more childish jokes like collecting unicorn poop, finding help letters in dragon poop, and helping villagers make their dirt and stone soup taste better using various animal parts. While this humor may not be funny to all, most will get a kick out of it and DeathSpank is chalk full of it. Of course the gameplay is important to and DeathSpank lets you assign four different weapons at a time to use and there are a ton of weapons, armor, and different types of potions to use. You can even eat various foods to heal up like pizza, fries, magic mushrooms, and root beer. When you whack enough enemies you get to unleash your Justice meter which are power-ups for certain weapons. The game consists of a huge map that you can wander around and travel via outhouses spread throughout the world. There are a ton of quests and you\u2019re looking at about 10-15 hours of gameplay here that is very entertaining.\n\nThe game has two major flaws and this is the fact that no matter how high you level up or how good your armor is you will be guzzling potions and healing items every 5 seconds. Enemies re-spawn when you re-enter an area and you can\u2019t move on to some until you are a higher level or those enemies will kill you quickly. This makes progression slow at first and forces you to complete quests because that\u2019s the only way to really level up. You get very little XP killing enemies even if they are a higher level than you. I found this very frustrating and made the game less enjoyable because of all these weird quirks. I also found that some quests were vague on where to go and using fortune cookies spread around give you hints, but those are just mostly useless.\n\nThe visuals are nice, but technically the game is very simple, but there is a huge variety in enemy types and you really won\u2019t get bored on that end. The best part about DeathSpank is the humor in the dialog and the funny voice actors who over exaggerate voices. Even as an action RPG the game is fun and challenging for anyone looking for something out of the ordinary to play, plus it has co-op play for anyone wanting to share the fun and jokes with a friend.\n\n--Score: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1340875972, "timestamp_updated": 1385452038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3259206": {"recommendationid": "3259206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019693119", "num_games_owned": 1534, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1339570800}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Con una jugabilidad que hace parodia al Diablo, con un humor verde y un dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico \u00fanico, este juego puede resultar muy adictivo y entretenido.\nDeathSpank es m\u00e1s un juego de acci\u00f3n que de rol (Tiene muchos elementos de rol, pero no se compara con ninguno ya que son demasiado simples) y esto no es para nada malo, lo hace un juego sencillo y muy divertido.

It's very obvious it's from an Indie developer; the controls are kind of odd, but you can rebind them, or just ignore them like me and hack and slash your way to over 200k damage taken (no death statistic is terrible). The fact that you can't actually turn off click-to-move except while holding down a key is awkward. The music gets repetitive after a while, and it might get confusing as to where to head next. And the questing system is just your generic boring questing system. But where Deathspank shines most is the dialogue, oh my God. Even most item descriptions are pretty random and humerous. The graphics are pretty nice too, I like them, and I also like the very original enemy types (Kangamoos, Bearalopes, and Sabretooth Donkeys come to mind). Dragons look kind of strange, more like reptilian orcs than anything else, but all the others are just amazing and perfect.

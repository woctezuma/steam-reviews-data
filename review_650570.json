This is Stephen King level of scary. No jump-scares involved, just claustrophobic atmosphere and amazing voice acting.\nThe story has nice slow pacing. With couple of conversations, voice recordings and tons of emails we start to explore the vision of future where people are just starting to colonize other planets. You even have small pieces of data on politics.\nCracking passwords based on personal information, man in the middle attacks and hopping through network are very nice mechanics that fit very well with hacker-vibe. Other puzzles are also quite rewarding to solve.\n\nIt is not a perfect game and definitely not for everyone. It is easy to get lost with all new characters, especially given that you don't even have a picture for them while they are talking. With holo lenses and all that advanced tech, we could at least snap a photo to show it to player :)\nSome puzzles require just typing stuff fast enough which can be frustrating even with all the game help like \"autocomplete\", but they are not too bad and make you actually feel the rush.\nI feel that this game could be perceived similarly to \"Life is Strange\".

What starts as two people stuck on a abandoned space station quickly turns into a horror scenario in Episode 0 and once Episode 1 starts, you already come to realize how desperate the situation is, both in space and on earth. And the only thing that motivates you are two questions: What is Code 7? And will you be able to stop it?\n\nGraphics:\nAs expected from a text adventure, the graphics are simple and mostly text based, but in opposition to other games, Code 7 has graphics, mini-games and a smart interface to always keep the player up to date without forcing them through annoying \"Look at Shelf\" shenanigans.\n\nAudio:\nFully voiced characters, plenty of audio logs and amazing electro music always keep the game a pleasure to listen to. Turn off the lights, put on your headphones and you might just forget that you're not really a hacker trying to save the world from S.O.L.I.\n\nGameplay:\nWhile being text-based, you never have to fight with the game not knowing what you want by trying out sixteen variations of \"pick up\". The entire language of the game works via computer-based code to navigate yourself through the network, interact with computers and servers, hack into accounts and activate doors, lights and more.\nWhile it might need a bit of time at the beginning to get into it and really understand the logic behind it, once you're used it, it feels very natural to quickly move across the building, use a Brute Force attack to get into a computer and read through all the private mails you might want.\nAdditionally, you hold control over a human companion who you can ask to move or interact with the parts of the rooms that you don't have access to, allowing you full access over both digital and manual data.\nWhat sounds incredibly complicated right now is unbelievably simple and intuitive in-game and even the very few tutorials never seem annoying or out of place.\n\nOther:\nEpisode 0 and 1 hold a amazing universe full of characters and lore. Reading through the notes and mails reveals real people with wishes, dreams and relationships. Some are married, some have children, some have a really bad case of compulsive hoarding. You can spend hours simply reading and listening through everything the characters have to tell about themselves. \nThe main storyline meanwhile is incredibly intense, rarely allowing a break before throwing the next reveal or horrific fact at you about all the things that are going wrong. It's impossible not to care especially for the main characters Sam, Alex and Zoya as they try their best to survive and reach for help in a world that is slowly going mad.\nBe prepared to be violently tossed around and left speechless at the end of EVERY episode. If you thought the end of Episode 0 is cruel, then wait for the end of Episode 1.\nAnd considering the amazing quality so far, I am very positive that all future episodes will be no different.", "timestamp_created": 1503309924, "timestamp_updated": 1503309924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34283413": {"recommendationid": "34283413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171203194", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503077556}, "language": "german", "review": "it's ok", "timestamp_created": 1502914616, "timestamp_updated": 1502914616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34265031": {"recommendationid": "34265031", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962556048", "num_games_owned": 597, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503238564}, "language": "english", "review": "Really nice hacker game.

On release the game contains the (free) Prologue and Episode 1 out of the planned 4 episodes.\n\nThis means if the developers keep to their planned schedule then it will be close to another 2 years before the final episode is released and the arc is concluded.... so PLEASE be aware of the development span associated with this game (And the potential risks of it never finishing due to fact that anything can happen across 2 years, regardless to the developers best intentions today).\n----\n\n\nDevelopment schedule concerns aside this is a really engaging game with a novel approach to the typical 'hacker command prompt' design, that ends up creating something that feels somewhat like a text adventure game (with all dialogue voice acted) yet having enough UI elements in place to resolve the usual issues text adventure games suffer from.\n\nSo when 'moving' around from one point to another in the prologue for example there's actually a 'map app' that is used that has reference IDs for each area and you simply enter that reference ID into your command prompt to navigate there immediately.\n\nIt just all integrates so well into the command prompt interface aesthetic that it simply 'feels right'.... my only criticisms would be that there are different 'interaction modes' for switching between things like the command prompt and interacting with individuals, and the default bindings and the way the game attempts to relay which one you're in feels somewhat clunky moving between the two during some more time sensitive situations. \n\nIt would have been nice to have had the option to remap such behaviours to another key of my choice. Such as Tab for switching between states, rather than the enforced binding of Spacebar, which triggers even when you're typing into the command prompt and forget for a second that the game doesn't support multiple string input and as such everything has to be typed as a single string (word).\n\nAlso some of the behaviour rules with the UI change for seemingly little reason. In one area pressing Enter may act as a 'go back' option in a menu. Another time it may act as a 'Select Option to change setting'.... the changing rules for what the same button does depending on the specific menu given this is supposedly a singular command prompt interface can be a bit jarring sometimes.", "timestamp_created": 1502571525, "timestamp_updated": 1502572361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34199038": {"recommendationid": "34199038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332939615", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513532755}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend this game to everyone who can afford it", "timestamp_created": 1502568933, "timestamp_updated": 1502568933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417968", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34193695": {"recommendationid": "34193695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260740018", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502857242}, "language": "english", "review": "(Edit: I was mistaken in thinking it comes with all episodes, developer confirmed, I'm just blind) It's fun, slightly challenging, and makes you feel badass about solving puzzles.

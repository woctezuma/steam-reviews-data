It goes on sale for about $15 every month or two, so I'd pick it up then.", "timestamp_created": 1517977858, "timestamp_updated": 1517977858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39855032": {"recommendationid": "39855032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312350637", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492722929}, "language": "english", "review": "LOVED IT", "timestamp_created": 1517784829, "timestamp_updated": 1517784829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39830421": {"recommendationid": "39830421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255017260", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508970280}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a great game thats about ship control i think this is worth the money", "timestamp_created": 1517705336, "timestamp_updated": 1517705336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39799436": {"recommendationid": "39799436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117726825", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "last_played": 1521129534}, "language": "german", "review": "Echt spa\u00dfiges und lustiges Spiel, einziger knackpunkt sind immernoch die Animationen von den Charakteren.\n", "timestamp_created": 1517604218, "timestamp_updated": 1517604218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39783573": {"recommendationid": "39783573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150197251", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517586234}, "language": "thai", "review": "Good game.\n\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01.", "timestamp_created": 1517548557, "timestamp_updated": 1517548557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39778800": {"recommendationid": "39778800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012374961", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 10989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "last_played": 1521327640}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like the old Star Trek with Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy?

Sometimes captains just fly from station to station without action\n- you may need an introduction for your station by a veteran crewmember on your first go but everyone will be happy to introduce you to your panel\n- the walking animations are more like floating, which slightly kills the immersion, but its required to make some pace on planet explorations and you get used to it fast\n\nAwesome game, so much fun, great experience!

A lot of ships and many ways to customize the plug-ins of ships (but here comes a con)\n2. Great team can lead to great experiences (again another con coming)\n3. Plenty of missions and ways to raise reputation\n\nCons:\n1. There should be a way to make your own alignment, flags, and change the layout and design of ships. I can't tell you how many times Id love to see unused area of a ship for something useful or at least cosmatic.\n2. Trolls and little kids will often times come on and drain your coolent! If you are captian, often times your trolls will tell the crew what to do while you give suggestion. This ends up sometimes in a bad experience when the pilot or scientest is shouting orders so loud no one can hear the captian.\n3. Missions are great but trolls and bad playthroughs of a team wanting to shoot everything in sight will make reputation look like playing golf in a wheelchair for the first time is easy. Reputation in the negitive double digits means no allies and just because you kick the troll that made it that low doesnt mean the rep goes back up. Reputation thats in the low for people wanting to at least get it to neutral should be a little easier or at the least have long range contracts to prove you didnt mean to defend yourself from drones (lol).\n\nOverall I love this game but small set backs like easy ways to get negitive rep, and no way to at least drap a colored carpet or a couch over that rust bucket floor can lead to the game getting stale.

I have limited experience with solo play, as I find little interest in playing with bots.

The game itself seemed [i]interesting[/i] but the graphics and Early Access tag were not attractive to me. I typically prefer complete games, and lack the patience to stay with them through development if they don't provide a lot of content out of the gate. \n\nThat being said, Pulsar has exceeded every one of my expectations and turned out to be a stellar experience. This is hands down the most exciting co-op game I've played in a near decade, and delivering a similar experience to Sven co-op in its play style.\n\nIf you're looking for a co-op game that requires a great deal of communication, but leaves room for personalized adventure and lots of chaos look no further!\n\n[b] PROS [/b]\n> A variety of ships with unique designs, strengths, and weaknesses.\n> Role-based co-op with lots of interaction between each role.\n> A large, story-rich galaxy waiting to take you by surprise.\n>Dynamic & challenging ship-to-ship combat.\n>Easy to use interface.\n>Modest learning curve.\n>DIY learning.*\n\n[b] CONS [/b]\n>Poor graphical experience.\n>Planets are typically rather buggy.\n>Ground combat is one dimensional.\n>Lacks a variety of weapons and equipment to choose from.\n>Frequent disconnection issues.\n\n*There is no in-game tutorial aside from the class manuals. Which I find to be a good thing, as the game isn't very difficult to learn but the learning as you go is part of the excitment. Figuring out ways to improve your ship, combat ability, and role functions on your own is actually fun.\n\nThat all said, Pulsar offers hours of experience with lots of replayability.

About half my hours in this game are signle player. \n\nIf you don't have 5 players to fill the five roles -- Captain, Pilot, Gunner, Enigneer, and Scientist -- then you can add bots to fill those roles. \nThe bot AI system is very robust and allows you to really customize how your bots will behave. This is done through p[riorities. You can set the priority for the bot to do a certain thing to change based on circumstances and orders. For example, if the ship health is less that 20%, then the pilot can be told that running away is very important. Maybe your playstyle is a bit more cautious. If so, you can change it to trigger if the health is less than 50%. \nYou can also set custom orders. For example, I created the custom order \"Beam us down, Scotty,\" which tells the bots to all follow the captain and teleport to the enemy ship/planet/station I'm going to. I also created the order \"IT's A TRAP!\" which tells the bots to put all power to sheilds and get the hell out of here. It becomes way more like FTL than like Blackwake or Guns of Icarus, becuase you're think about tactics and giving orders to your AI crew. \n\nThat's not to say the game isn't improved if you have friends to player with-- it is. Trying to launch a mutuny after my noob captain after he spent all our money on a nuke when we didn't have a nuke launcher was hillarious, even if there are no mechnics to support it(You can't kill your own crew) . Like all games, playing with friends makes it way better. \n\nBut it is still a great game single player-- like FTL, only suddendly you're running to put out fires along with your crew, or repelling a boarding party yourself, single handedly holding off three guys as your crew scrambles to jump to lightspeed.

And this is my first review.  I started playing SWG at launch.  (Some older gamers may remember.)  One of the best times I have ever had in a game was when Jump to Lightspeed came out.  I had the KT and a group of guildies and I jumped in it and did some missions.  BEST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  Talk about team work.  I person to pilot, 1 to copilot, 2 gunners, people running around fixing the ship, and docs running around healing people.  When SWG changed and eventually went under, I looked, and looked, and looked for a game similiar to it.  \n\nThat aspect of the game was all about teamwork.  Anyone can go into a dungeon and tank or kill mobs, or heal other players.  But with JTL, almost each person had a certain task, and if they didn't do it correctly, everyone died.  \n\nAnd then I found this game.  I haven't played with other players yet, just the A.I.  I like to tinker with things.  And let me tell you, boy did I get somewhat frustrated.  But then I sat down, and ran test, after test.  Now I can take down 3 ships with A.I. toons manning the stations.  Fires, no problem.  Enemies on board, no problem.  Away missions, no problem.   The only down fall, is the graphics.  But the game is so fun, I find they aren't that bad.\n\nSo for my 1st and only review.  I give this game 10/10.\n\nP.S.  Couple of bugs I have seen so far.  A.I. Pathing.  But that is with most bots.  But with this game, you delete, reinsert, and reload personalities.  Another was getting stuck on warping.  Timer didn't go down.  But I went to an earlier save.

There are times when we would travel through multiple sectors only to find an enemy ship. The questing system allows for some interesting instances.

I was lucky enough to have full crew of friends when playing this game, and it really made a difference, but you could probably get by with 3 or 4 people total (there is an option to add bots to fill in certain roles).\n\nThe game interface is pretty simple, although the game is early access, you can see areas where content will be added. You and your crew pick a ship, become part of a faction within the galaxy, and it's up to you what to do next. You can accept missions, make biscuits or become a space pirate. Some people may ask for a little more direction in the game, but I enjoyed the open world feeling and making our own to-do list. There are other people hosting games, so you can join games in progress as well.\n\nWe had a few intital short playthroughs while we learned the mechanics and explored various ship types (3 total, we got to level 4 or 5 in each one as all the layouts and goals are different for each ship, and will affect playstyle). We went back to our favorite ship, stuck to our guns and finished the game in our 4th full length playthrough. We also didn't read a guide until later on, so we did try to learn things on our own at first (which is pretty intuitive in some ways, not so much in others - there is a good guide on steam if you need it).\n\nUltimately, the captain runs the ship, and is the ultimate decision maker financially and for ship decisions. Your science officer scans for lifeforms and runs offensive/defensive comptuer programs, while your pilot dodges missles or asteroids, your weapons specialist is shooting mines or enemies. Your engineer is trying to keep the core cool while maintaining system powers to science, pilot, weapons and engineers. Overall if you have a good team and enjoy roleplaying, you are going to like this aspect and this is what makes the game special. You really have to depend on your team mates, and together you can disccover new sectors of the galaxy, explore planets or steal from other ships. \n\nAll in all, a good early access game and I cannot wait for more content. 7/10 (8/10 if you take the roles seriously)\n\nTo the developers - \n\nMore late game content, more exotic high level goods as well as tougher bosses\nCrew gear and clothing customization options, captain could select clothing type (pirates, military etc.), this coculd add more late game content in clothing of crew members\nKitchen in the lounge, to make rations and foods\nDevelop planets - wider eco systems, more resources (items to make food, tribal cothing, atomizer items etc.)\nBounties placed on your ship an enemy is hunting you down)\nShips log - access from anywhere on the ship, includes color coded  list of coordinates visited. Captain's ability to add notes (i.e. boss, quest location, etc)\nAccess to other faction quests\nAbility to upgrade ship structural integrity for more cargo, turrets etc.\nMore variety of ships (or the ability to build your own)\nPVP - as a toggle option\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1512944032, "timestamp_updated": 1512944032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.795389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38200470": {"recommendationid": "38200470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274791949", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518331367}, "language": "english", "review": "All I can say about this game is just, wow.

Player input feels like one from Bethesda and the diverse gameplay experiences you can have there is really neet: FPS, RPG, SpaceSim, exploration...\n\nThe only downsides as for now (and to me) are the following:\n-Player models are ugly and lack customization (that's also true for NPCs): more options and better models would be appreciated...\n-The world feels EMPTY: we really should be having randomly generated quests (like in Elite2 for example), more interactive/RP furnitures (showers, sits, ...) and the only populated places we have could have a lot more NPCs to add life to them (NPCs could have small interactions, not only dialogs).\n-Ships can't land nor travel from one system to another seamlessly: going to a planet could have led to a loading screen instead of an explosion (the static ship would then appear landed, and could have a 'take off' button), and systems could load when going for a really long time to another system (or the alternative option would be to add more objects to every system, like more randomly generated planets with ressources or shops with fixed prices to allow for speculation, like in Elite).\n\nTo put it short: this game IS worth getting with a few friends to experience space fights, exploration and the horror of the deep unknown, BUT it would be better with the NPCs and interactive items/elements of TESV and the generated systems/quests of Elite.

While you can move around in the real world in your designated space, you have to use the gamepad to walk without restriction. However, if you are easily susceptible to motion sickness, you're better off playing with mouse and keyboard. I REALLY hope that this can be changed in the future if possible. \n\nGameplay wise, there's 5 roles you can choose from to play, each with distinctive capabilities and advantages.

The basic concept of the game from what I'm understanding is to complete quests by traveling the universe and sell as many 'Biscuits' as you can. It has a pretty complex system of handling your ship and it's subsystems for various explorative and navigational operations.\n\nSo far, I'm giving it a 7/10.

I started a new ship, and turned on the hyper drive. The timer never went down, I never got to my destination, and when I looked outside there was this big grey square next to my ship. I have no idea what it was, but it definitely wasn't supposed to be in the game.\n-All the graphics look like they were made in an old version of blender by an ameteur.\n-Way to much money for a game like this.\n\nI would like to see missions or objectives added to the game, and made obvious so I know where to go. Without any objectives, all you are doing is flying around and visting space stations and planets. I would also like a tutorial for all the controls on the ship at the beginning of the game. I think the way the game is set up right now, it would make a nice space RPG; travelling to different planets and stuff with objective, talking to different people, following a story.

(otherwise you die.. and die... and die.. and go find another server because you've ether raged or no autosave exists) (FYI autosave feature has been put in!! :D)\n-Once you know the mechanics you can be a very effective member of the crew, but remember you are a team!!\n\nCons\n-This game almost requires mics to be effective. The captain, Scientist, and weapons all /need/ a microphone if you have a hope of being successful.\n-Overall game mechanic knowledge is very low in this game because it radically changes with every update.\n-Some times aspects just don't work. (Hey, it's Beta stfu. You get what you get)\n-Bad crew members can make the game stink and the learning curve itself is steep. Get a mic and join in!

As a Captain playing this game it will be necessary to establish goals for yourself and your crew, sometimes not all of the players will be willing to follow along the course of adventure or gear progression so some compromise may need to be made in order to retain a working complicit group of players. Roleplay is definitely a common thread in the community, whenever any of my buddies and I boot up an open game for our reccurring \"Space Pirate\" RP (The Pastrami of the Skies) good lads willing to role play with us usually join in pretty quickly.\n\nIn terms of \"action\" or \"graphics\" the game is pretty bland as it's an interior space ship simulator, however it is by no means boring nor thrilless. When you're running around trying to extinguish fires or sending out a boarding party there is an air of suspense and danger. Additionally, nothing is more satisfying than successfully engaging three CU drones and an Intrepid, limping away after having to jettison your overheated core.\n\nIn terms of classes all of the playable classes are pretty bland, however each of the ships has their own unique stats and personality which definitely shapes the expereince of playing.\n\nMy cheif complaints are the relatively small playerbase and a lack of ships/servers with the ability to support more than 5 crew.

The easiest comparison I could make is it's like the exploration features of Mass Effect except now you are with real people. I would like some sort of overarching narrative to add a purpose to the exploration but what's here already is pretty solid. The devs seem focused on bug fixing and adding content on a frequent basis which is amazing.  Exploring derelicts is creepy. Planets have different kinds of weather, there's some good level design. \n\nThe cons I think is that asides from the ship there's not much complexity. I'd like to see some element of choices like having to choose someone to save in a rescue mission (assuming proper rescue missions are added) or even something as basic as operating as a transport ship. It'd be cool to outfit the cargo bay as a passenger cabin and transport people around.  \n\nThe framework of this game allows for pretty much anything to be possible so I'd say my biggest problem with the game is that it shows its potential so well but has not yet realized it. What's here is amazing but I can't help the feeling that they can do SO much better.   This game is about 27 bucks Canadian. I'd say the price is fair considering what's here now and what will be in the game within the next year. \n\n\nTL;DR  If you are a scifi fan or have any interest in cooperative exploration type games with friends, this is the game for you.  It's a very easy game to apply your own mental canon to add context for your actions.  A real story with choices however would be appreciated.

If you liked FTL and always wanted to play it with your friends, now's your chance. \n\nBe the CAPTAIN- totally useless but you get a NEAT chair!\n\nBe the Science Officer- Wander around with a tablet and look like you're doing things! Get teased for being a TOTAL NERD. \n\nBe the engineer and become the *only* officer than can get anything done! Roll your eyes at your comrades as they fart about pushing your buttons and turning the ships lights on and off!\n\nBe the pilot and BARREL ROLL. \n\nBe the gunner and pick on the Science officer, even though you're MORE USELESS than he is! Or board the enemy ship and sprint to the giant off switch and sacrifice yourself for the better of the universe!\n\n When it comes to gaming with your friends, this one is at the top of my list. A randomly generated universe means that every turn can be either a planet trekking mystery to solve or a dog fight with an enemy faction, environments can be as hostile as they are beautiful and the enemies just as much. You can even use this to your advantage by boarding the enemy ship and cutting their life support, leaving them helpless as your crew pummels them from afar. There's even asteroid fields and wrecks to explore, and those can be quite tense as everyone has to rely on the skills of the pilot... and the gunner as he calls out potential threats. \n\n Devs are always tweaking, updates are regular, controls are easy and simple to master (Especially when it comes to working with instrument panels) and managing ship upgrades/parts/weapons is a breeze. I can't wait to see how this game polishes up. \n\n TL;DR- Grab your friends and board the intergalactic short bus in a spaceship emulator designed to make you work like a team. Communication is a must, but you can still drag your ship's bridge across a space station while your friends kill everyone inside. And yes, there are Firefly references. \n\n10/10- would leave my science officer behind on the swamp planet again.", "timestamp_created": 1500769048, "timestamp_updated": 1500769155, "voted_up": true,

They are MASSIVE maps, but really have very little content at all. I believe this game was put in early access too early and should've added more to the game itself before adding it to steam. Adding to this point is the fact that this game is $25 usd. With a price tag like that, I expect the game to be done, not early access (I did get this game on sale for $16 usd, which I feel is a reasonable price, but my point still remains.)

The devs seem to be very active and update the game regularly which is a VERY good sign. The game itself is also really good. It literally makes me think I'm in star trek. All  the character roles have specific things they do to help the ship function which is great. The problem is that some of the roles can get a little boring from time to time because there is not enough content which could use their specific role. I think if the game gets more content, giving each characters specific role things to do, this game could really get popular. For now though, it can get a little boring after awhile.\n\nAll in all, this game has great potential and good developers which is why I'm going to recommend it.

You're one of five crew members of a star ship, and every position has their own job to do to keep it moving through space. Pilots fly the ship, and make sure the side with the guns is facing the enemy. The Science officer scans sectors and vessels, and uses viruses to mess with an enemy's systems. Engineering keeps an eye on the core, and adjusts power consumption as needed. And the Weapons officer keeps the guns and missiles firing.\n\nBetween bouts of space combat are the moments where the crew can temporarily leave the ship. Maybe it's to a friendly station for trading and repairs, or to investigate a distress signal coming from somewhere on a planet's surface. Or maybe they're just sneaking off to a hostile ship to try and take it over for a little space piracy.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game for other people to buy? Definitely - though I feel I have to qualify that recommendation.\n\nPULSAR is designed to be played by five real people working more-or-less together. The developers did add a system where a vacancy in the crew can be filled with an AI-controlled 'bot, who are extremely useful, but definitely not perfect. For example, I was playing as the Captain position of a ship, and I was able to set things up so ordering the \"emergency jump\" command to the crew would make my Pilot navigate toward the next set of coordinates along my plotted course, and Engineering would start charging up the FTL drive in an attempt to run from battle.\n\nTheoretically, the game could be played alone, with the help of those 'bots. Just know that it will be a fair bit harder, as well as somewhat more boring in the long run. For instance, in the same example I mentioned above, I still had to physically run over and press the \"jump to coordinates\" button on the Engineering console myself. When I went to repair my ship at a depot, I would have to take control away from the Pilot to move the ship into position, run to the other end of the ship to cut power to the shields, run back to the bridge to pay the repair fee via the communications system, and then do it all again in reverse before I could be on my merry way.\n\nFor someone with one to four other friends who will want to play something like this together on a regular basis, PULSAR is definitely worth the full $24.99 asking price. For someone like me, who ends up playing any and all games alone, it would probably be better to wait for the game to drop in price during a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1494728064, "timestamp_updated": 1494728064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31736511": {"recommendationid": "31736511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370767009", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "last_played": 1521059417}, "language": "english", "review": "great game but there shuld be a game mode for the infection its to strong and spreads to fast your never ready for it when it attacks you other than that best game iv played .... but plzzzz make a no infection game mode the just isnt fun whith the infection in it thats all i have to say", "timestamp_created": 1494723133, "timestamp_updated": 1494723133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31735590": {"recommendationid": "31735590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084465626", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494354178}, "language": "german", "review": "Pulsar, wo soll ich anfangen.\nBesser beim wichtigsten Teil.

I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!\n\nHere are the ingredients you will need!\n\nRavioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.\n\nRavioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.\n\nPesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.\n\n\n1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.\n\n2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.\n\n3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.\n\n4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.\n\n5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.\n\n6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.\n\n7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.\n\n8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.\n\n9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.\n\n10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls.

There is no PvP element to this at all, it is strictly PvE.\n\nAs of this review (Beta 14.6) the game lacks both polish and content and is plagued by a multitude of issues that can make the experience less than stellar (pun intended), but everytime you find a crew that is willing to work together - and you do find those crews - you see the beauty of the game and how the core of the game is already working, it just needs flashing out and polish. Lots of polish.\n\nIssues you need to be aware of at this point in time:\n- The AI is mostly useless. You can play alone but it isn't nearly as fun as playing with a crew, at least three players are needed for a fully functional crew.\n- The visuals are not what you'd expect in 2017. They are simply outdated. On the plus side this makes the game run smoothly on toasters aswell.\n- While in total there is quite a bit of content there you have to hunt for it and play all three available factions. It is mostly empty space at this point.\n- The balancing is horrible.\n- Lots of bugs. Save often, save early!\n- There is no proper tutorial or even manual, the ingame instructions are outdated and incomplete.\n- Lack of a reputation system or even the possibility to properly track players make open lobbies an easy target for trolls.\n\nWhile this is quite a list of issues the core of the game already works: your performance is largely depending on how well your crew works together. With a inexperienced or disorganized crew you can lose fights that would be easy pickings when you are coordinated and communicate well enough.\n\nOverall this game is a diamond in the rough, it is Early Access, it is beta, it is unfinished.

I have always played as the captain with my group, so my view of the game is solely based on this perspective. \n\nInitial impressions: We started off in a W.D. Destroyer which is an armored warship, and we ran around friendly space picking up missions and upgrading our reactor, weapons, hull plating, cyber warware capabilities, etc. We never have a full five man crew, so we add bots to fulfill uncrewed positions. As we learned more with each warp and encounter, we learned how to demand credits from science vessels and other weaker ships. I have learned how to tweak the AI's to VERY effectively follow my orders and accomplish our goals.\n\nWarping: First, the captain sets a waypoint to whichever system they desire. The pilot then aligns the ship while the engineer begins charging the warp drive. If you're currently getting smashed by a more capable ship or even boarded by another crew, hopefully your science officer has an available warp charge program to run to instantly charge the drive and maybe a thurster boosting program to help speed up the pilots aligning. When all is ready, the engineer will see his warp computer display the \" Jump to *** \" button. There are science and engineering computers both on the bridge and in the science and engineering sections of the ships, so the captain can press the jump button from the bridge if the engineer is busy extinguishing fires or rerouting power down in engineering. If all else fails, the captain can unlock the \"Emergency Warp\" button, which anyone can then press...but this usually results in death anyways. Once in warp, the captain has the option to skip the warp and immediately land in the new system if they think the ship and crew are ready.\n\nShip Combat: In combat, the captain assigns a target, and then issues orders which may be preset or custom orders. The engineer then reroutes power and works to keep the reactor under control as they or the captain sees fit. The weapons officer is controlling turrets and missiles during this time, and can even target certain systems on enemy ships. The science officer is controlling the shields as well as conducting cyberwarfare and scanning during this time. Scans of the enemy can reveal where they are routing power (sometimes revealing weaknesses) while viruses and firewall programs can be used to attack and defend ship systems. Cyberwarfare can greatly affect a battle such as the Sitting Duck virus to stop a fast agile ship in its tracks, or the Phalanx virus to take the shields down on that destroyer with a huge reactor and shields. There is much more to it, but its fun and doesn't seem overwhelming while playing like some other space games.\n\nBoarding: Once a ships quantum shield (not to be confused with their regular defensive shield) is down, anyone can  teleport to that ships teleporter pad. This allows you to teleport to enemy ships during battle and capture their ship systems which they have to recapture before they can use them again. This can stop an enemy ship from being able to warp, conduct cyberwarfare, regulate its shields, fire weapons, etc. If you really want to take your time with an enemy ship and search their cargo, you can capture all their stations, and then your captain can press the \"Capture\" button on the bridge of the enemy ship to take over that ship. You may have to shoot your old ship to get its shields down before being able to teleport back unless you shut down the shields manually.\n\nCapturing and switching ships: As I mentioned previsouly, you can capture a ship during an engagement. You can even attack an allied ship and board and capture it once its shields are down. Once you capture a ship, as long as your shields are down on your old ship, you can teleport back and forth. You can find the cargo crates and press \"R\" on them to transfer them to the other ship. If your new ship has an extracter, you can attempt to extract modules off of the other ship. Once, you're finished, blow up the old ship and fly through the debris field to see what you can pick up.\n\nStations and Repair Depots: You can fly into repair depots, drop your sheilds, and then hail the depot to request repairs...or you can just teleport to the depot, kill the guard, and access the repair computer yourself without spending any credits. You can't dock with stations, but you can hail them on comms to buy and sell or refit your ship. You can also teleport to stations to look for missions or buy goods.\n\nThere is more to the game than what I have mentioned, but at least you begin to see what you can do in PULSAR.

I would compare it somewhat to a multiplayer FTL.\n\nThere are 5 roles for you and either friends or bots to play as, aboard a variety of different spaceships from battlecruisers to research ships.

There are some quirks and missing content with it being in beta stages still, but none-the-less it is pretty fun, especially when you get with a good crew where everyone has voice chat. Sometimes the ingame voice chat doesn't work so it helps if you have external chat software to use. Buddying up with regular friends is especially fun but it can be difficult at first to find a good crew. Some people just play derpy and joke around all day. Others are more serious players who respect the captain's orders and offer good suggestions. There are also those who are hardcore role players and create real names for their characters instead of weird usernames. Then there's the SUPER hardcore roleplayers who consistently role play as their characters and do everything from bridge crew duties to hanging out in the lounge and talking.\n\nThe systems work very well but flying can be quirky until you get used to it. This is especially true when using upgraded thrusters on an already agile ship. Overall though, if you have a good crew that works well together and a captain that knows what he or she is doing, then the game becomes a really great social experience as well as a fun multiplayer game. Right now there is not much else for the Pilot and Weapons Specialist to do, but I think they are adding more to their roles soon. I would like to see the Pilot have the ability to engage warp instead of the Engineer as sometimes the Pilot may not be properly aligned to the right place and the Engineer will hit the warp button too early. I'd also like to see the Weapons Specialist have access to weapons that the other crew cannot use.\n\nNow overall the game is fun, but every once in awhile you get some trolls who enter your game. They'll do things like mess with power levels, fire at friendly ships, warp you around, turn off oxygen, shut down the ship, destroy ship modules, etc. It's easy to kick if you're hosting, but it would be nice if each station could lock out others from using their systems. This would also help curb the over zealous players who like to do other stations jobs for them. It would also be cool if the captain could lock and unlock specific systems aside from just the emergency warp so players can't mess with them. Gets frustrating when you're on a planet and some other player jumps into the game and engages warp while you're in the middle of a mission and causes everyone to go back to the ship.\n\nI hope the game gets a lot more content like more crew members for ships - especially for larger ships where it takes a minute to get back and forth, it might be good to have a bridge engineer for power management, engine room engineer for core stability duties, bridge science officer for sensors and comms, research science officer and maybe a security officer to help with ship invasions and handle other turrets as 5 man crews are usually busy in their own stations to run to another turret to help fight). fighter jets for the carriers that the pilot and/or weapons specialist can use, ability to put on Exosuits to leave the ship in space to do hull repairs, maybe some PVP against other players (faction vs faction!) and PVE co-op where you could assist other crews in missions and large scale battles. More as well as a better variety of missions could also be added as right now there is not much to explore or do but I will be keeping an eye on this game for a long time.

The nature of the game seemed like alot of learning was required, but don't let that discourage you from getting the game. You will very quickly get used to the controls and be able to play normally. Especially if you get a good team who you can have fun with.This game works best with voice chat of some sort so the team can effectively communicate. Once the team learns to work together, it really feels like you are in Star Trek commanding your own starship. I must say that it is the multiplayer experience that makes this game as great as it is, but it doesn't mean you cannot play it alone. You can recruit AI crew members so that they can assist you. \n\nIn terms of content, there is actually alot to do. There are many quests to complete and many planets and space stations to explore. Occassionally you will run into enemy ships and infested parts of the galaxy in which you will have to fight off or turn tail and run. Team work really comes into play here. When an enemy ship attacks, you can try to use your ships defences to destroy them, or hack them and board their ship. After massacring the crew the ship becomes a sitting duck. You can also claim that ship to be your own! (You can only own 1 ship at one time though)\n\nThis game being in early access and having mediocre graphics may put you off, but you should give it a chance.

Started following this project quite a while back before it came on to Steam, as I was developing a similar game and didn't realize how many there were! \nBut this one, this one stood out. Despite Early Access issues such as clunky AI, clunky UI, clunky Controls, there is great potential, and the dev's understand this. \n\nMy experiences so far are mostly Singleplayer based, but I have had a few good random Online matches.\nOne Kirk-like experience of mine, was spawning onto a dying ship, with a flailing, obvlivious crew. I quickly stepped up command, and threaded our way out of the situation, order after order, until we had finally unwound the mess I'd come across. It was beautiful. Until I realized that the blokes I were playing with were just two bored friends, deciding to troll. Which is fine, each to their own, but once the game has Server settings such as Playstyle: RP, Looney Spaz's, Explorer, Combat Focused etc, it can be a bit confronting, just sliding your hand into the lucky bag, to see what kind of servers and people you end up with.\n\nSo back to Single Player and the over-all game. You really do feel like a captain sitting on a chair, your decision making and crew experience being the deciding factor over whether you enter the next system, or end up being skull-dragged across an asteroid field. \n\nSo far:\n[h1]The AI[/h1] \n[b]Friendly[/b] \nUntil they implement smarter/more diverse AI functionality, they will literally just cut the mark, barely keeping your ship alive whilst you still do a majority of the leg work. The developers have added in Order functionality and AI Customization, to allow for fine-tuning to fit your play style, but it's just a shell for the time being, with frequent bugs causing too many losses than wins.\n\n[b]Enemies[/b]\nDumb as soup, and almost just as difficult to shoot at. Because they are currently just Game Objects moving around based on Logic, there isn't really any form of decent AI YET. Boarding an enemy ship will most often prove useless unless you port in, guns blazing, and strafing/camping like a madman. Everybody moves too fast, and it is just overall unbalanced at the moment.\n\n[h1]The Graphics[/h1] They are simple, but they work! Lessened loading times, futher expansion into functionality over form, but you can still see a box, and know it's a box, not a fugly P.O.S.\n\n[h1]Animations[/h1] Again, it's early access so we can't complain too much, and the devs are active and working hard on improving all aspects, but the animations can be a bit sore on the eyes. This effects immersion, and somewhat on a mechanical level too, the Bot's just sort of, strafe about, with no indication of direction.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1] This is where the game excels. With ever-improving FPS Controllers, the ability to interact with your Ships screens and your inventory is greatly improving.\n\n[h1]Ship-to-Ship Combat:[/h1]\nStill a lot of room for improvement, enemy AI ships just fly around and auto target, there isn't a full feeling of engagement and interaction with ship combat. And boarding can feel quite wanting. \n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nIt's a great game to play with mates, it will get quite repedetive fast, but it's not a write off, as the developers are again, working hard to create a solid product.

Yes; Each individual job you can do on your ship is incredibly fun, and you can spend hours at a time on any single job (I prefer the scientist position),  but as a game in general, there is actually not a lot to do. If you want to have a lot of fun here, expect it to mostly be roleplay - And by that I mean, fake player-made goals.\n\nAll in all, I don't think this game is worth your money. Yet.

Below, I shall leave a detailed manifesto of my feedback regarding PULSAR.\n\n(Let me just say, I love this game a lots.  And I wanna see it succeed.  If anything sounds harsh, it's only 'cause I consider this game family and I believe in tough love.)\n\nTHE VESSEL(S):\n\nThe strongest aspect of this game is truly within the confines of the ships.  Customizing the parts, the simulated touch screens, the mostly detailed interiors help quite a lot with the immersion.  Although there are different ships to choose from, each with their own interior layout, you'll find yourself customizing the specifications to your crews needs.  \n\nBeing unable to jump/jetpack inside of the ship is a bit strange.\n\nThere are some rooms that are strictly cosmetic, like the lounge, that I wish served more of a purpose.  If I could spend credits, or pick up crawler legs to cook in these rooms it would truly add to the immersion and give my \"at ease\" crew passive work and encourage them to use other rooms.  \n\nIt would also be neat to be able to leave actual entries in my ship log so my crew knows what was done in my ship's last voyage.\n\nAside from my nitpicks, I must say the ships keep me coming back to the game.\n\nTHE CREW:\n\nThe Captain:  This is the least intuitive station on the whole ship.  As someone who has played Bridge Commander and other Trek sims, you'd think the Captain would work somewhat similar to PULSAR's predecessors.  \n\nThe Captain shoulders a lot of responsibility, but as it stands right now - it is a very boring position with a lot of power and not a lot of hands-on gameplay.  \n\nThe \"Z\" menu is great for \"general\" commands like the alert statuses and crew statuses.  However, I feel this screen should also tell me where my crew is in relation to me, and I should be able to \"spectate\" them so we can better coach them.\n\nI also think the alert statuses should be able to override engineering settings, ex:  Green Alert lowers power to weapons and shields, almost completely.  Yellow Alert raises shields, and Red Alert raises shields and weapons.\n\nWhen the Captain sits in his chair, issuing commands should be a breeze.  I feel as though 'overview' displays for each station should be closely visible and allow the Captain to queue up commands for a more tactical approach.  \n\nEX:  On the Science overview, I can command my Scientist to run the Thruster Booster program and when my Scientist deems it appropriate, or is available - they run the program.  Of course suggestions for Shields and comm control would be here too.  \n\nOn the Engineering overview, I can monitor core temperature and suggest distress calls as well as coolant usage.  \n\nOn the Weapons overview, I can put in nuclear commands or call for ceasefire/attack/defensive/etc.  \n\nOn the Pilots overview, I should be able to issue directional commands as well as override ship controls (in the case of a fire or 'all hands on deck' repairs).\nThis anchoring to the Captain's Chair would make it that much more devastating when the Captain has to leave his chair to man a turret, or put out a fire - it makes the crew work without their head.\nThe Engineer:  My man should be able to beam people back up to the ship, give it a warmup like the warp drive.  The Engineer is definitely one of the strongest stations to play.  It's hectic, and tons of fun.  I do wish the Engineer could get a talent for swapping out parts we find along the way.  Maybe it destroys the piece you're replacing?  Maybe the engineer can use scrap/other hulls to repair the hull for emergencies?\n\nNot a lot of feedback, but if there were a way to make this role more active in the narrative.  If some missions have broken ships, rather than relaying supplies - can the engineer just board the ship and repair it?  It'd also allow for a bit of drama, where the engineer could be locked on the ship after repairing a ship's shields.\n\nThe Scientist:  There is a lot of potential for this station beyond the scanning aspect.  The programs and viruses are great, but if hacking were more hands on I think ship-to-ship fights would be more rewarding for the Scientist.  A simple timed puzzle would work when trying to run a virus on an enemy ship, or when trying to repel one.  I'd also like to see the respawn mechanic depend on the Scientist more.  Often we found ourselves committing suicide to get back on the ship faster.  Maybe on planets and other stationary areas, the Scientist has to 'resurrect' you - otherwise, the Engineer needs to beam your corpse back up to the ship?  For ship-to-ship invasion, the rematerializer could still be used as those fights are more active and time-sensitive.  \n\nThe search system/database is great in theory, but it doesn't offer enough information on certain sectors.  I wish the active scans/exploring sectors would update the database like a pokedex.  \n\nFor Comms, I think the Scientist should have to again play a puzzle to \"decode\" messages or even translate them.  \n\nThe Atomizer isn't very intuitive, maybe the Scientist can see more information on items before placing them in it, so we know what we're getting?\n\nThe Pilot:  Please rehaul the controls, Space Engineers has a great flying system.  I'd also like to see the Pilot get some sort of remote control talent that allows him to fly the ship from anywhere.  This'll allow the unattended ship to be open for attack, and allow the pilot to take evasive maneuvers.  I think he should be able to engage warpdrive after it's been warmed up and lined up.\n\nThe Weapons Specialist:  In general, I feel like the Weapons Specialist should be able to switch between Modulate and Static shield.  I found myself timing their laser attacks and physical attacks by watching them through the turret, and running back and forth to protect against the appropriate attack.  Ifthe Weapons Specialist had this ability, it'd be very intuitive.\n\nI wish it were a bit more rewarding and easier to attack specific systems of enemy ships.  If the Captain issues the command to target their engineering, the Weapons Specialist should be able to see it clearly highlighted on display.  \n\n\nExploration:  \n\nIt's a big star system, which is great.  I love how it scrambles with each playthrough.\n\nIt would be interesting to put on an exosuit and teleport to asteroids for minerals/research points.  More random abandoned ships and floating wreckage for exploration would be great, extra points if the engineer can get a ship up and running to claim.\n\nThe planets are huge, more nooks and crannies and abandoned outposts outside of quest areas would be super rewarding to explore, especially if there's random logs left around.  \n\nEnemy ships and abandoned ships would greatly benefit from ship logs to read.\n\nDistress calls are great, way more of those.\n\nJust more ruins on unrelated to storyline planets would be dope.  \n\n\"Unexplored sectors\" that give us a chance to make first contact with at least a few new races?\n\nWe love choices as gamers, and as long as you emulate games like Fallout with this backdrop, you'll continue to succeed.  More people to meet, more races to befriend or make enemies of, etc.  I don't mind loose ends and moral conundrums, that's what this is all about, right?\n\nGAMEPLAY: Considering how awesome this game is, it's hard to come down on y'all.  The AI is a little wonky, and they move really fast.  It's hard to explain but - there's no recoil.  There's no snare when you get hit or hit something.  There's no crouch or jump.  If you can get as close to Half-life 1 as you can, you're good to go.  It doesn't need to be anything crazy, just simple gameplay like that and this game becomesinfinitely better.\nThe AI doesn't use cover or anything.", "timestamp_created": 1489536851, "timestamp_updated": 1489536851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.788912", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30460802": {"recommendationid": "30460802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065506419", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517799085}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, but the Community is toxic and it ruins wanting to play at all.

AI isn't all that great, and players will infuriate you.  That being said, its one of my current favorite games, and I want everyone to understand that in its current state, you need to play with others.\n\nTo get the very best experience, I recommend you finding a friend that knows what they are doing and have them teach you  a role, or look for a friendly player when you join.  After you get the basics down, to get the very most out of this game, get a headset and join a game where everyone has a headset.  Communication is big in this game, and being a typer will hurt you in combat.\n\nSome big tips to the new players, when you join for some reason the UI doesn't show and voice chat isn't enabled.  You have to go to game settings (there are two options in the menu, edit game settings and game settings.  Go to just 'game settings') and enable both.  Go to the controls tab in options and set your push to talk key, which is on the third page on the left hand side.  It is defaulted to mouse 3 and T I believe to start, but if you are like me caps lock or pretty much anything is better than mouse 3. \n\nVR users, I've heard poor reviews about VR, and if you are looking for a good VR experience, I recommend looking elsewhere.  I could be wrong, I havn't tried it.  I want everyone to support the game, but a lot of negative reviews on this game is about the VR and lack of singleplayer due to poor ai. \n\nHere is a quick breakdown of the game:\n\nGraphics are mediocre at best. \nSound is mediocre.\nGameplay is amazing.\nTutorial is poor.\nCombat is smashing\nContent is low for how many systems are in the game\n\nRight now for a Beta or alpha, I'm going to give this game a thumbs up since it hits a unique take on working with a team.

It wants to be a starship simualtion experience and it just nails it, even in these early access stages.\n\nI play this game using the HTC VIVE, now with a friend who uses the Oculus Rift DK2, and I plan on inviting more. A largely refreshing element of this game is the fact that it supports VR very well, but it does not *require* it! In addition, it supports motion controls for VR, but it also does not require those. In fact PULSAR seems to be equipped with support for EVERYTHING (VR, screens, gamepad, keyboard, joystick, etc) which results in an inclusive title. Lastly on this point, I despise the motion controls, but I love my VR, so the various input support is appreciated beyond words.\n\nThis game is a definite must-get, especially for VR gamers who've been yearnnig for something more than expensive repetitive shooters. Even at its most basic functions (ie managing the ship, warping, exploring) it succeeds amazingly.\n\nHere is my multiplayer first impressions video of PULSAR, made using footage of my HTC VIVE and footage of my friend's Oculus DK2 point of view.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0Xof9U3io0\n\nIt was easy to immediately engage in the game. We tried operating the starship without bots just the two of us (bad idea) then formed a more conventional crew for our second attempt, which went far better. A suggestion to help kill time during warps would be a PDA type device in the galley that contains the game's manual, so we can read up on gameplay during jumps. Hopefully those tables are intended for future use allowing seating and limited tabletop activities. A simple salvage mission proved quite fun and very immersive for both me and my friend, so this is a great start.\n\nKeep it up devs, and make sure to preserve this awesome support for so many peripherals and input methods as well!", "timestamp_created": 1488220881, "timestamp_updated": 1488220911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30208055": {"recommendationid": "30208055", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982800561", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488150441}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a long way to go.

You must explore the galaxy, jumping between Star Systems, taking on quests, avoiding or fighting pirates, and exploring planets.\n\nThere are 5 different roles, each of which (except captain) can be filled in by bots. The bots are highly customizable and a very well made.\n\nCaptain: In charge of the ship, commands the crew and will generally help out with weapons.\n\nPilot: A good pilot is they key to winning any combat situation. The pilot must work with the weapon's specialist to maneuver the ship during combat and avoid enemy fire. The pilot is also in charge of alligning the ship for warp.\n\nEngineer: A good engineer is essential for any vessel. The Engineer is in charge of managing power and coolant so that the ship's core does not overheat, and charging the warp drive. The engineer must allocate power to different systems according to the situation, such as lowering the engine power to supply more to shields.\n\nWeapon's Specialist: In charge of manning the guns of the ship for combat.\n\nScientist: The support of the ship. The Scientist is in charge of applying buffs to your ship and debuffs to enemy vessels through the usage of viruses and programs.\n\n\n- Best played with 3-5 People (Solo and 2-Player is doable, but not as fun).\n- Devs are actively updating the game, systems are improving.\n- UI and Ground Combat need some work, but it's still playable.\n- Occasional gamebreaking bug/minor issue, but it's an Early Access game so it's expected.\n- Not very many main quests, I imagine this will be worked on in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1487285467, "timestamp_updated": 1487285467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29956580": {"recommendationid": "29956580", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963777193", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498622304}, "language": "english", "review": "The latest Virtual Reality support is amazing, the game has a lot of potential and is already a great coop game to play.", "timestamp_created": 1487227481, "timestamp_updated": 1487227481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29954064": {"recommendationid": "29954064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169437419", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487214325}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is slow to start and there isnt shit to do", "timestamp_created": 1487213241, "timestamp_updated": 1487213241, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421077", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29953963": {"recommendationid": "29953963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089285423", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506626608}, "language": "english", "review": "Quick Review after owning this for about 6 months - \"BUY THIS GAME\"\n\n10/10 would turn off crew's oxygen supply to power sheilds again (and the fact you can do this for strategy purposes totally blew me away)\n\nThe creative ideas that went into this game astound me:\n\n(some as to not spoil this)\n\nIDEA! - Wanna fix your ship?\n- no problem, just shout the engineer to power down the shields so the hull can be repaired!\n\n         - oh wait, He's just the janitor that found the engineer's uniform and has no idea how to do that.. or put out the fires on the ship mid battle.. or the process to turn the shields back on without turning off the power to all the ships many computers.. and weapon systems.. and accidentally ejects the engine in a blind panic while the scientist is yelling at him.. then the pilot loses patience and goes \"space nuts\" - starts firing his pistol at the glass at the front of the ship while hammering on the distress beacon like he's practicing to survive the Torture Scene in a Metal Gear Solid game.\n\n- Learn the engineer role yourself and restart the game as the engineer - sit with a crew while a new pilot warp into new territories to discover an intergalactic hull eating virus that causes everyone else on the ship to start yelling, \"engineer you noob, get the warp core charged now!!!\" - tell the captain, \"I just can't do it, I don't have the power\" - because the captain spent all the money on the giant laser that the weapons specialist was pestering him about last time you docked and forgot the fuel/core charger upgrade... watch with a sense of \"I told you so\" as the weapon's specialist clutches himself in a corner over the fact he never got to use his big gun he always polished in the creeping realisation that in seconds, his life is over...\n\n--> The most underrated, under played game I have ever enjoyed.

I'm mostly going to explain each of the positions main roles, because I can't reveiw right now.\n\nCaptain: You are the Captain. You pretty much tell everyone what to do, and preferably help during battles by shooting one of the smaller guns. A bad captain with a fantastic crew could do worse than a good captain with a bad crew. Don't let them down.\n\nWeapon Specialist: As the Weapon Specialist, or Wep Spec for people who can't say more than 1 syllabyll at a time, you fire the ships biggest gun. You also get extra damage resistance later on for when you warp to other ships, or the surface of planets. Keep your aim steady and try not to miss.\n\nPilot: The Pilot flys the ship. Allign for the next destination, wait for the warp to end, and DEAR GOD THERE IS A ROCK INFRONT OF US WHERE IS THE BREAKS?!?!\n\nScientist: As a 100% normal Scientist who is not mad, I swear, your job is the run viruses and programs to tilt the dogfight in your favor, be it one that stops the opposition in it's tracks, or a simple boost to your shields, as well as scaning planets for hostiles before beaming down. \n\nEngineer: Engineer, you have 1 job, see that glowing ball?

(at least the last time I checked that is), instead you will require a jetpack which for some reason is only available on one of the ship classes, which limits the exploration you can do if you do not choose said ship.\n[*]My other complaint is that Foxxy is no longer to be found anywhere. :c\n[*]I keep coming back to this game after leaving it for several months. And every time I do I am pleasantly surprised by the new content.\n[*]The crew AI is not very smart, and not easy to command either; however the last time I played they improved significantly and I expect them to get better in the future.\n[/list]\n\nSadly I've yet to have the chance to play this game to the fullest as I've never had all 4 of my friends online and willing at the same time to play with.

Even then I was completely mesmerized. I'll state right off that I may be bias as this was the only game me and my brother could play together for several weeks running and I would certianly recommend playing w/ a friend(s) or expect to play online. Thats not to say there isnt an acceptable bot system in the game allowing you to play offline, but it just doesnt quite cut it honestly. This game isnt A+ but it is one of my favorite games. The scope of the gameplay is pretty amazing and with it's replayability factor, your gametime is only limited by your imagination. If you want some polished beautifully designed UI with top of the line graphics this may not be your thing but if you've ever watched Star Trek and wished you could somehow partake, this is about as close as it gets. \nImagine, you can get your own star ship to roam around the somewhat depressingly doomed galaxy with a crew of your buddies. Take on your foes in adrenalizing firefights, cannons blasting away at your enemy's shield and hull as your reactor begins to heat up, all the while your men blaze away against an enemy boarding action in the lower decks. At the same time the enemy captain opens up comms and demands your immediate surrender. Just before he and his ship blow into a thousand pieces and you get to loot the remains and sell it for personal profit..", "timestamp_created": 1484900106, "timestamp_updated": 1484943697,

If you're wondering if you should play it, I would answer \"yes, probably later\".\n\nA brief list of things not done yet:\nAny VR support\nA victory condition\nFinal balance\nMost of the science scans\nNon-trivial progression (I hope this is intended to be added, but not sure)\n\nThere's probably 10-20 hours of gameplay in this thing, unless you like doing the same stuff over and over.\n\nNow for the real review. This is a game about being the crew of one spaceship going about the galaxy doing stuff. It supports up to 5 players, though any role but Captain can be taken over by bots. You're the only player ship; there is no multiplayer except for the rest of your crew. \n\nThere are 5 roles: Captain, Engineer, Scientist, Pilot, Weapons Specialist. The captain basically just sets objectives, controls purchasing, and yells at people. He also can authorize a couple drastic measures, like Emergency Blind Warp. The pilot flies the ship and aligns warps. That's it. The gunner fires the guns. That's also it. The engineer manages power allocation, fixes the ship, charges the warp drive, puts out fires, and reboots the ship, if necessary. The scientist toggles between 2 shield modes, scans other ships and planets for lifeforms, their ship components, and to determine if the environment is safe. They also conduct cyber warfare against enemy ships, and do research.\n\nThese are just the default roles; most players can do most things, as they're not locked to a class. Nothing prevents you from wandering over to the engineer's station to recharge your viruses as the scientist, except the fact it's easier to ask him to do it himself. Even the powerful main gun can be fired by anyone taking the right talent (it costs 1 point, and you get 2 per level). Further, manning guns, fighting fires, doing repairs, and going on away missions are all things that are really shared responsibilities. The pilot can't run off and man a gun in the middle of combat (unless he's replaced at the helm by another crew member), but the engineer, scientist, and/or captain could easily decide their talents would be best used in the weapons bay, depending on the particular combat in question.\n\nCaptain - This role depends entirely on your own communication skills, and if your crew is a box of awfuls or not. In an experienced crew, you may find yourself with little to do beyond picking the objectives and going on away missions.\nGunner - Sit in a gun, shoot it every time it's charged and you have a clean shot. Also the most easily botted role.\nPilot - As piloting plus gunning is enough to have a game, I feel like this is one of the most engaging roles.\nScientist - Cyber warfare is disappointing, because there's no real way to scale it. You can buff your cyber defenses with firewalls, but your offense starts as good as it ever gets. That means your impact on fights is minimal, and you're better off manning a gun most of the time.\nEngineer - Engineers dump coolant, and hope nothing breaks. That's about it.\n\nLets talk about away missions briefly. Most are bad. You beam down to a mission, you fight somewhere between 0 and 50 enemies, most of whom just charge in to melee you and you shoot them while backpedaling. Then you look around for science items and ship parts. Eventually the scientist gets upgrades to make this procedure a lot easier, in the form of a neat scanner that tells him where stuff is. The actual FPS combat feels like they bought it off the shelf and implemented it as-is. It feels worse than Merchant Marine. That said, there are some handcrafted missions/encounters that just feel awesome. If you ever beam down and find yourself on a train, you're in for a good time.\n\nFinally, I'll talk about pacing a bit. I expect they'll stretch it out a bit as they near release; games are usually a lot easier to progress through in Early Access so you can find bugs and/or the good parts faster. For each kind of ship component, there are roughly 2 viable choices, and 3 or so bad ones. Sometimes less. For instance, there's a jump drive that charges quickly, one with a tiny EM signature making you harder to sense, a slower, longer range one, and a standard one. The answer, of course, is pick the longest range one and then pump up your charge time with talents and jump processors. You can also upgrade your ship by boarding an enemy and taking over. This is awesome, but not too exciting from a progression standpoint. The strongest combat ship is the game is one of the starter ships. You can buy the best cyber warfare programs at the beginning of the game, or start with them. Currently the basic path of the game goes: begin, do a few missions for credits and upgrades, then go grind science for a long time or until you have all the talents you want. Then fight the unique \"boss\" ships, steal their special parts, and declare victory.\n\nAnd a bonus pet peeve: something called the infection spreads across the galaxy. You may be able to stop it by fighting, but you definitely can't handle it in any other way. The requirements for fighting it are extremely high. This means that your endgame is a warship or a warship, or having necessarily few choices and opportunities than a warship would.\n\nOverall though, it's an awesome game because you get a persistant universe, and a ship you crew with up to 4 of your closest friends (except that guy in engineering, he's a jerk and he never gives you enough power). The idea is so, so good and the core of the game is so good that in spite of all my whining above, and all the polish the game still needs to reach version 1.0, I highly recommend it.

Did many game with all ship and did all research possible and mission. And my opinion on the thing is kinda mixed up, more on the positive side tho. So from what i've experienced, i could say that sometime you find a game with people that want to play the game seriously, maybe sometime too much, but i think that fine. I play most simulation game in a serious manner, to immerse me in the experience. Really, if you can get some friends (at least one, but i suggest two) you can do a lots in this game. The AI on your ship is really bad, but its getting better with the modification to the crew panel priority. If you play with a friend, get it to be gunner and as captain you can pilot easily. The enemy AI is a little over reactive, but unless you just board everything, you shouldn't notice it that much. After a while, when you know about the game, you can easily upgrade your ship with the best main turret, without needing to have a strong ship, etc, so i find that having more cargo space is more valuable than having firepower at start. The game is definitivly not for everyone, but for the public its targeting, well its great.\n\nThe Dev keep upgrading the game from time to time, its not really fast, but at least they do it. \n\nWhat i would like to see in this game:\n- Scientist hacking mini-game, because right now it pretty non-interactive. Click, its send the virus, now wait. Scientist has nothing more to do most of the time.\n- Engineer salvage mini-game as well, why not.

Pilot was my first role (and the perspective this review is based on). I did read the entire manual before starting, though, so I understood the mechanics before starting (took about 30 minutes to read the manual). The physics of the ship are great. The ship drifts, gradually accelerates and reduces speed, and can move in all 8 directions (up, down, left, right, roll right/left, pitch up/down). Sometimes the enemy will shoot you with something huge and will spin the ship out of control - very crazy and hard to recoup from. At one point I hid behind a comet and would come out to give my gunner visual, take some damage, and duck back down before our shield went down. The enemy A.I maneuver in very smart ways. I was impressed.\nThere are 5 classes: Captain, Pilot, Engineer, Scientists, and Weapons.\n\nEach class can perform the roles of each other and Captains have the option of using A.I. My adventure saw me on a ship with 2 others - a Captain and Engineer for a while. We eventually got a full ship. Many people joined and left. I started playing at 3 am CST and just stopped at 12 pm. These were random people. I did not go into this game with anyone else. I simply joined one of the open ships on the server browser. 2 of the people I adventured with are now on my steam.\n\nAdventuring in the game was seamless and fun. Players use warp drives to go to different star systems. Warping to different star systems sometimes prompts the captain to accept or deny a mission. Accepting a mission will show the players on galactic map which star system to go to accomplish the mission. Missions range from protecting a ship being attacked, salvaging / investigating a destroyed ship, and exploring a planet (There might be more currently or planned).\nStar systems usually contain one of the following: Nothing, A single comet with some enemies / friendlies, a planet, and we ran into something called an \"infected\" star system (very hostile) and we ran into a odd place that looked like ice crystals all around making piloting difficult - very tight spaces - where we picked up scrap to sell for money. Each star system has a different color aura. \n\nThe infected are a mystery to me. They remind me of the flood from halo.\n\nCombat in this game is somewhat complicated but simple at the same time. As a pilot I did not get to see much of what was going on with the crew - however this is what I noticed / read / talked with the crew.\n\nThe engines, guns, and other things necessary for a ship cause the core temperature of the ship to rise. This rising temperature has to be regulated by the engineer of the ship by altering how much power goes to what. For example - i was using thrusters a lot to maneuver around the comet to dodge enemy fire while our weapons guy was firing. This nearly caused overheating so the engineer cut the power to my thrusters by half causing my manueverability to suffer so that I would not overheat the core. Just before writing this we were running away from a fight, preparing to warp jump and I was at max thrust forward while using the smaller thrusters (meant for small movements) to get as much speed as possible. All the sudden all my engines shut off. I went into first person mode and all the lights in the ship were off (it gets very dark - you have flashlights) the crew was scrambling to put out fires (things catch on fire when the ship is taking damage from the enemy), repair equipment (things break too) and reboot the ship (it shut down due to overheating - mainly because of me).\n\nI decided to get off the piloting controls and grab my fire extinguisher and repair tool (it was already in my inventory) and go help - too late. We blew up.\n\nThis may have been prevented if the scientist of the ship had the proper programs. Programs are essentially buffs or debuffs for the player ship or enemy ship.\n\nLuckily, the captain saved his spot. Saving works like this: The host of the server has the option to save the game state. Only the host may load and save. Pretty much, each host has their own ship. Anything a player buys for them self (there are trading stations - I bought a very good laser pistol and alcohol. Yes, you can get drunk. It makes your aim super inaccurate and gives you blurry vision) will be stored in their locker upon exiting the game.\n\nThe captain of the ship allocates funds to the crew. You cannot buy things without the captain authorizing the funds. Pretty much, the game is a co-op game that does not require real people nor does it punish having real people. The host can play with whoever, whenever, and the host's progress is saved - the ship items and the crew items.\nThis is a very good game. The immersion and teamwork are a type of fun I have found in only a few other games. What I really like, though, is the exploration aspect.\n\nI wanted to try some space exploration like No Mans Sky, but without the grinding. I wanted to play a game with teamwork and communication but I wanted a casual setting. This game offers both these things combined.\nIf I were to lable this game it would be:\nSingle player / Co-op, Space Exploration, Casual, Space Flight-Sim", "timestamp_created": 1483380930, "timestamp_updated": 1483381045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28920427": {"recommendationid": "28920427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059994692", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513356460}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoy this game so much that I feel I want to give a review. I don't usually review anything.\n\nAs far as I know, there are no other games that I can compare this with. But if you have a group of friends or relatives to play this with, I would recommend it more. i.e. The game is much better when 5 people are playing together and who play it properly. \n\nPros:\n- Content - For a game that is in Beta, it does have a fair amount of content. We have been playing for about 10 hours on one game so far and we have gone around a quarter of the galaxy. We have not touched the sector commanders just yet. I think we will try one soon though.\n- Updates - Whenever a new update comes out, there is always plenty to add. Most recently, the new ship - Outrider - is absolutely brilliant. I would possibly recommend it to new players too as it's easy to move around and a good starter to research. Plus, the new Ice Train level is really good and took us a little while to complete.\n- Systems - I really enjoy playing as the Engineer. The ability to raise and lower power to keep the ship alive is great. The fact that each change actually changes something in real time is brilliant. So often do you reduce a bit of power from Science and everyone is moaning that they no longer can see that enemy. So you take a bit from Engineering and now the Pilot is struggling to turn around. Then the enemy knocks out Life Support and Oxygen starts to go down. So once that's fixed the core has gone into emergency cooldown. - Fantastic!\n- Role Playing - To play with a group all talking to eachother and actually playing their roles properly is so good. What I mean is: The pilot flys the ship, he isn't manning the turret while the Captain is flying. Meanwhile, the Weapons Specialist is on the Bridge scanning the enemy. (Unless that's how you personally play...) But if everyone does their role and reports to the Captain, it runs smoothly and everyone does their job in the event of an emergency, it is very satisfying.\n- Multiplayer - If you do find yourself playing alone, there are usually a handfull of games to join.\n- AI - Yes, I put AI on the pros... I feel personally that the recent update where you have a lot of control over the AI has made it more bearable. The Captain can now add their own orders and change what the AI do when you give those orders. It's not perfect, but the developers know that. This new way of organising your Bots has made the AI a lot better.\n\nCons:\n- Content - When you have been playing for a little while, the same missions start popping up and you know exactly where to go and who to talk to. With more content and a greater selection of starter missions to choose from would this be overcome. This is coming though so, great!\n- Updates - Sometimes they don't come soon enough...\n- Systems - Some systems are not complete yet. On occasion will you get something pop up and it's not in the game yet. E.g. Auxiliary system: Climate Control.\n- Graphics - I personally like the graphics. But for people who have played uber realistic space sim games, the graphics are not a comparison. (Not that the graphics are bad though...)\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list...\n\n---\n\nWould I recommend this game?\n\nAbsolutely!!! For the price you are paying, you will have quite a lot of hours of gameplay in different ships and different people and different roles. E.g.

Jede Position ob Captain, Engeneer,Pilot, etc. ist mit speziellen Aufgaben und Kontrollarbeiten best\u00fcckt, die wirklich super umgesetzt sind, und auch nicht zu kompliziert sind. Diese vielseitigen Aufgaben dann als Crew im Spielgeschehen umzusetzen machen den gr\u00f6ssten Spass. Besonders da man koordiniert zusammenarbeiten muss. Die Reise auf der Br\u00fccke mit Warpgeschwindigkeit, oder mit automatischer oder manueller Steuerung mit den Piloten gibt einem wirklich das tolle Gef\u00fchl wirklich eine Reise durchs Universum zu machen. Das Erforschen von Raumstationen,Planeten erweitert das Spiel ungemein und wird zum grandiosen Abenteuer. Auch die Raumgefechte sind super. Insgesamt das Spiel auf das ich schon Jahre gewartet habe. Grafisch gesehen l\u00e4uft das soweit ich es erlebt habe fl\u00fcssig, bisher hatte ich auch keine Bugs.

It seems so EPIC and as i saw and bought this game, that was the experience i wanted. Did i get it? For the most.\n\nIf you find a proper crew which uses a microphone, you can really achieve this epic communication and cooperation between the players. It actually happens often and this game turns really immersive and engaging. What is the problem then? I would love each role to achieve greater complexity.

It's like a mix of Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator, FTL, Guns of Icarus, and a few episodes of various space-based sci-fi series. It plays out primarily in first-person view (the pilot can get a third-person external view of the ship when piloting, however), and each player fills one of 5 roles - Captain, Pilot, Engineer, Scientist, Weapons officer. Every role has a few specialities which they'll be useful to have on board to help with.\n\nIn space combat, each player has a station to attend, which provides them with a selection of tools useful for enhancing the ship's performance in many ways. They also have the very high probability of panicking when something gets set on fire and completely losing track of what they're meant to be doing, which is AWESOME.\n\nWhen doing away missions, everyone's job is to basically shoot everything that moves, and pick up anything that isn't bolted down. So... maybe there's a bit of Elder Scrolls or something in the mix too?\n\nAnyway, the point is, you run around on your ship, repairing damage and manning various systems in fights, and you run around on other ships and planets shooting enemies/aliens/robots/anything else that catches your eye. And it's all co-op, played with a crew of up to 5 friends, with each of you playing a different role on board the ship. If you're missing any job, you can stick an AI in that slot to work with you, and it's possible (though not usually easy) to run a ship with only one human player. The game is obviously not intended to be played solo, however, and while the AI has a very flexible customisation system to make them behave pretty much exactly how you need them to, they're just not as entertaining as human crewmates. Even with only 2 people, the AI filling the other slots will be sufficient to provide a pretty good time, but it really shines when you have 3 or more on board the ship, working together (or at least TRYING to).\n\nWhile I recommend the game, I do so with the caveat that it IS an early access title, and it isn't a finished product by any means. The content already in the game is great, and shows a lot of promise for future additions, but it isn't going to live up to everyone's hopes and dreams in its current state. If you're unsure, I recommend checking out a few YouTube videos before you buy.\n\nUPDATE: I wrote this review almost 2 years ago. The game is still in early access, and progressing fairly slowly. It has more content now than it did, and there have been bugfixes and some fairly significant alterations to the specifics of what you do. It's still a great game to play with friends.

There is very little actual game content in yet.  That said however it seems alot of fun, especially if you are a StarTrek fan.  I would highly reccomend revisiting this game closer to completion.  I intend to update my review then.\n\nUpdate:\n\nNot many people found my review useful, so I thought I should add some detail.\n\nSome of the graphics are quite nice, others are a little simple but overall I think its probably a good balance of playable graphics, to support 5-player multiplayer and reasonably low-end systems.\n\nThe game play is very much team-work based, you really need at least 3 players to play effectively and the larger ships would work better with a full compliment.\nAI Bots can be used to fill in any position... as long as you dont mind if they suck.  The role you play as - Captain, Pilot, Wepons etc, mostly affects your stats.  So for example a Pilot can boost their ship manuvering ability, but any other player will only be as good as a level 1 pilot.  Anybody can get a scanner, but only the science officer can later gain an ability to use the scanner to find loot.\n\nMultiplayer there are some small but very annoying bugs.  For example if the ship is warping from A-B the captain can skip the 5-6 minute wait.  I have found that this is very reliable for 1-2 players but as soon as I add a 3rd player its 50:50 if the skip option will work or not.\n\nHowever after all of that, the real reason I cannot reccomend this game however is the content is only about 10% done, you will run out of main-line game play very very quickly at present.\nNot only that but because I think this game will be awesome, and so much story is only partially implemented, I worry that playing now might lessen experience on release - admittedly a risk with almost any early access game.\n\nI with the developers were a bit more communicative with development progession, however updates are reasonably regular and the team seem very competant.\n\nIf you see this game on a heavy sale, I would say buy it as a future investment but if you want a game to play now I wouldnt get it yet.", "timestamp_created": 1480701184, "timestamp_updated": 1481216885, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658281", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28135685": {"recommendationid": "28135685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065887485", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518064003}, "language": "english", "review": "COOL GAME BUT I HAVE A PROBLEM: DEV PLEASE READ\n\nSooo... I really liked the game, it had lots of stuff to do, and ive always wanted to try a concept like this. It's fun to run around the galaxy with your friends and fight with people and take over ships and stuff, but after ever since an update like a year ago, i actually cant even press any buttons in the main menu (including the play button) so i cant start the game. and this was like after the second week of playing the game. So i submitted a bug report, (I believe they still havent gotten back to me.) So i deleted the game and kinda forgot about it. \n\nNow, like a year later, curiosity got the better of me, and i downloaded it again. Launched the game, aaand still cant play.

The ships are easy to control. Ship systems are straight forward and to the point and They are not overcomplicated which keeps the fun aspect rolling. I got the gameplay down within ten to twenty minutes. Based upon the fraction ship you choose you will be given missions which you can recieve from people at space stations. Once on said mission you may have to divert to save a fellow faction member or encounter a hostile species.\n\nThirdly, Story; So far the main story is not there yet (BETA 11.5) but I enjoyed talking to people on space stations and via ship to ship communications.

I forsee a great future in this game.\n\nIf your story is like mine, and you're tired of the same old Early Access story and you're looking for a make it or break it review, this is the one for you.\n\n\nOverview:\nI'd like to start off this review by mentioning that I've gotten tired of \"Early-Access\" games.  I'm all too sick of the same old story: early access game hits the market, promising many innovative ideas and it either fails to deliver or simply stays in early access forever (looking at you, Space Engineers and 7days). My friends encouraged me to buy this game just to have the fun of trying something fresh and new. With 16 hours under my belt (seems like so little time, spent), I can say that I've fully explored the game. I'll go over the different roles and what they do, as well as the basic gameplay aspects, concluding with a pro's and con's list. Finally, this is definitely a team-based game, which is much better with a set of friends to BS with, so keep that in mind as you read and come to your decision on the game.\n\n(Class roles)\nTo start with: the game is fairly simplistic and throws you into a ship of your captains choosing. However, that's the end of it. There is no tutorial to teach you what to do, and most of what you *actually* do is fairly simplistic. If you're a pilot, you fly the ship. If you're weapons, you shoot things, if you're captain, you plot courses and choose what to buy, and if you're science or engineer, well, buckle up cause it's a *little* more in-depth than the other 3 positions.  Fortunately, even that is fairly straight forward, with a simple GUI to guide the players in doing what they need to accomplish. Overall, the positions are all fairly balanced to make everyone feel like they're accomplishing something for the average gameplay. However, that's about as far as it goes. In my opinion, there is not enough for each of the positions to do. After a while, piloting just becomes flying in a straight line, science becomes spamming all the programs, weapons becomes a matter of target practice, and engineer becomes meaningless because the reactors simply become too powerful to even need adjustments to power levels. However, that's not to say that the different positions are not fun when done with other players.\n---TL/DR: Game is simple as it stands, and offers maybe 10 or so hours of actual content.\n\nGameplay (Space-side): \nThe missions themselves are very straightforward and not too fleshed out, yet.  After a while, the game starts to feel like a shoot n' loot, which is not what I think the dev's had in mind, HOWEVER, to get to this point, you need to invest quite a few hours in exploration and fighting. Which leads me into the next part of gameplay: your ship consists of multiple parts that can be upgraded and changed with your credits earned from salvage, missions, and exploration. These items include a warp drive, shields, a hull, a reactor, programs that can be ran to accomplish a multitude of things, and processors that upgrade other ship systems. This is, by far, my favorite part about the game. You can choose to either go for the big ship with lots of weapons or the quiet ship that stealths everywhere. Unfortunately, stealth is not so much a feature yet, and just something planned. Also, there are nowhere near enough items of variable description to make it feel like an adequate upgrade path.  All in all, what they have so far makes me extremelly optimistic for what they can add in the future: a list of endless items to upgrade to, multiple new weapons and shields, etc. However, as the it stands, the upgrade path is extremely linear and quite simplistic.\n---TL/DR: Ships can be upgraded (kinda), and missions are there, but need work.\n\nGameplay (planet-side):\nYour crew can actually leave your space ship and go down to planets for a variety of reasons.  There could be a distress beacon, you could want to explore the planet for salvage or items, or simply because a mission sent you there. Most of the planets are very small and very straight forward, but this does not stop my crew from wanting to explore every single planet for what we call \"lickable shit\" which is a *research* item used to get special bonuses for the crew. Here comes the caveat, the \"lickable shit\" is quite rare and very hard to find. Some planets extend to a radius that doesn't really suit what you can do on them, so you find yourself using your very limited stamina bar to sprint into nothingness for what can seem like hours. In reality, it only takes ten or so minutes, but the time adds up when you're doing it with every planet. \n---TL/DR: Planets are very interesting to explore, but can become monotonous.\n\nFinally, I'll sum everything up with a Pro/Con list that will hopefully convince or deter anyone still on the edge of getting this game\n\nPros:\nFun to play with friends\nFun to play alone\nIn early access, so the dev team is active and working with their community\nDev team is fast to react to community-voiced problems (hackers)\nAI are capable of running the ship without other players\nExploration is new (kind of) a new concept, without being over used\nUpgradeable ships\nBoardable ships\n\nCons:\nGame DOES have bugs\nNot too fleshed out\nUpgrades are linear\nAI handles the ship TOO well on their own (looking at YOU engi-bot)\nMany new features are visible, but not implemeted (scans, for one)\nQuestline is short and repetitive\nDifferent positions can get boring if you don't have a group of friends to mix things up\nUpdates appear to be monthly, which is a downer after Space Engineers\nGame doesn't have a forum yet (from what I've seen) so it's hard to communicate with the devs.", "timestamp_created": 1479801064, "timestamp_updated": 1479801078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710751", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26728543": {"recommendationid": "26728543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154610456", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519341953}, "language": "german", "review": "Jetzt da das Hackerproblem wieder behoben wurden ist habe ich das Review ver\u00e4ndert.

Captain barking orders, negotiating or intimidating the enemy, upgrading ship, setting crew member allowance for small arms, and setting the course for your adventure.  All of this while maintaining life support systems, your engine, weapon systems, while they take fire from enemy ships or catch on fire from being damaged.  You can also play with AI to kinda learn the controls and general layout of a ship, but it's not the same.\n\nThat being said, there are a lot of reviews saying everyone is helpfull, and works together.  There are some, but with online games you will find trolls.  Usually they do their mischeif before you really embark on an adventure, so it really doesn't ruin a 4 hour run or anything - and hey, for a little bit - that is fun too.\n\nTotally worth the $24 for it - but if its on sale, snag this puppy.

This game is pretty damn amazing, even being in early access. It is definitely a game for fans of shows/games like Star Trek that have multiple distinct roles for people to fill. The gameplay and content just in this early access is phenomenal. With that said, I'll give you a list of my pros and cons! I will be assuming a five player crew in most of the points with a few exceptions that I'll point out.\n\n--Pros--\n\n1] First off are the positions that you can take on the ship. Taking a class is truly defining what you do and actually see in the game. Each of the roles is specific and has talent points that enhance their ability to perform their station. During the game, as you go to planets you can pick up research materials lying around that will allow you to research additional bonuses that your crew can spend talent points one. Note, not all research is for the entire crew, some are role specific, but can offer bigger bonuses compared to the all around researchable skills.\n\n2] Next is the universe. . . It's pretty huge tbh. Now, a lot of people are going to say that the stars and whatnot get reused occasionally and honestly, they'd be right. Honestly though, out of the near 20 hours I've been playing, it has never ceased to amaze me with how beautiful space is.\n\n3] The space battles. These are pretty cool, especially some of the tougher fights where you're fighting 3 or more opponents. There are different types of lasers that also have a noticably different color and it makes a spectacular light show that is just amazing to watch. Not to mention you can just feel the ship rumble when the man turret fires lighting your enemy into a bright explosion of debris.\n\n----Neutral----\nI wasn't sure if I was going to add this to the list but there are a couple that I had though about that were a little hit or miss for me.\n\n1] Lighting is a little odd. Now the hull of the ship when lasers are flying by or the star is gently glinting off the ship, all of that looks phenomenal. But at the same time, there is a little problem with the interior lighting that sometimes bugs me. There are places on the ship that even if you have the interior lights turned on, are WAY too dark to see, even using the flashlight. I find these a little troubling because when I think of space age ships, I'm thinking of REALLY brightly lit ships so you can actually see where you're going or if you have a helmet, it outlines the edges of the ship so you know exactly where objects are.\n\n2] Planets are a little small for how big they look out the viewport. I do understand that the developers want to keep you near where stuff actually is on the planet. But the way the developers keep you from just wandering into some crazy wilderness is either by a radiation wall which, if you pass it, will slowly kill you unless you return. Or by having a giant sand critter pop out of the ground to instant nibble on your gibblets. The flipside though, is that the planets themselves look fairly well made. They may need a bit of polish to be sure, but this is early access.\n\n3] The faction system is a nice idea, but i feel at the moment it's a bit to sensitive as well as unused for the most part. I think the only thing that has happened by screwing rep up is giving me a reason to avoid going to ship investigation sites.\n\n--Cons--\n\n1] First up here is the price. At the moment I would recommend waiting for either a sale or something similar before purchasing a copy as I feel, atm 25 dollars is too high. While it may be a great price for it when it goes and releases, atm it's a bit too steep with unfinished content. (Yes I know i received it for free)\n\n2] Next are the bots. At the moment, the npcs (usually the ones with weapons not the little bug things) are exceptionally accurate, yours AND the enemies. This makes trying to either take a ship or clear a facility on a planet just a little bit frustrating. You'll eventually get it done, but it might take you 2-4 tries just to knock out all the enemies because of the pinpoint accuracy.\n\n3] Last is honestly the textures for the characters themselves. To be honest to is just a minor gripe but I feel as if the developers decided to wait before they update the models. \n\nI definitely love the feel of the game, and playing it with 4 other friends is just an amazing experience. There are also a good amount of games that are on the list that are doing roleplay sessions which I can't help but imagine they're amazing.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this game a 7.5/10 AT THIS MOMENT. The game definitely has potential, and is a definite must buy if it's during a sale. Otherwise, keep an eye on the game as it develops and offer these developers as much support as possible.\n\nTL:DR; 7.5/10, great potential, buy during sale, or if you have 4 other friends to jump into the game with you.", "timestamp_created": 1476949150, "timestamp_updated": 1480042940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615308", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26105701": {"recommendationid": "26105701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179687930", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515881481}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of fun to play, great game for early access!

The concept is spot on.\n\nPros:\n - Real Star Trek like experience in multiplayer. It's amazing. It really is. If you don't believe it watch a Let's Play on youtube.\n - Incredible immersion. You are on your post. In a battle you have your job to do. You need to trust your captain to maintain a grip on the overall situation, because you sure can't, as you have to keep the reactor from exploding etc.\n - Runs smoothly at 2K on my gaming rig.\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]The nice way to say it is: It needs polish. Looks like a game of the very early 2000s.\n[*]Even though it looks like it is from the past, it runs terribly on integrated graphics. Couldn't get any playable performance on my Broadwell laptop with Intel GPU even with every setting at the minimum and resolution at 1024x768.\n[*]Little actual content in the way of missions or anything else at this point, but the devs are on it.\n[*]It's less fun if you play with AI bots instead of a real crew of people.\n[/list]\n\nVerdict: If you have a couple of friends and you love Star Trek-like SciFi, go for it.\n\nSuggestions for the devs:\n[list]\n[*]The shop could directly compare what's available to what's installed in your ship. Alternatively, give the engineer a nice one page overview of the ship components.\n[*]A \"stop all thrusters\" button would be nice for the pilot, so would be piloting via gamepad.\n[*]I would welcome more realistic physics for piloting: The ship doesn't decelerate on its own, keeps spinning unless you stop it with thrusters. To compensate for the complexity, you could add \"stabilize\" which automatically stops any rotation. The uptick of all this would be pretty cool space maneuvering a la battlestar galactica.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1476020104, "timestamp_updated": 1476020104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505959", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25947346": {"recommendationid": "25947346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140385550", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515344221}, "language": "english", "review": "PULSAR is an interesting game, but somewhat lacks originality and is reminiscent of many games in the space/adventure genre.

Here is the views of it and what I think of it (please keep in mind that this game is in Early Access, it is being improved as we speak and/or read).\nFirst of all, this game is a multiplayer game where you can play with friends or random people online. You are a crew aboard one of many ships to explore the vast space. Each crew member is assigned a post to fulfill. This may sound lame, but it is quite awesome. The captain gives orders, assigns missions, gives pay for the crew to use on tools and food (for healing). The pilot, well, pilots the ship (this job is my favorite, especially when fighting other ships). The engineer repairs the ship and puts out fire. He can also remove the core (not recommended unless facing death). The scientist observes the ship's status and reports any problems to the engineer. The weapon specialist can shoot the guns. Now, each crew member can do any of these roles whenever they feel like it. However, they can upgrade their talents for their specific job.\nNow, as of right now, all you can do in this game is to attack enemy ships (you can teleport to their ship if it is damaged enough to have its shield down and kill the crew repeatedly until you claim the ship for your own and use it), land on planets and kill creatures that try to kill you, accept quests and do them, and explore the world. However, as I previously stated, this game is in Early Access, and it will continue to improve. There are many mysteries in this game. For example, I found a random ship that was dead floating in space. When I teleported onto it (yes, you have a teleporter you use to get to the planets and other ships), I found out that it was another ship you could decide to use, and it was full of snow. It was dead, so we (my crew and I) had to leave it, but this was the only time I saw it.\nTwo more things. First, if your ship explodes, your crew and you die. You have to restart. I like this feature. It makes you more cautious, which this game is supposed to make you feel. You need to play your role as if you are there. And finally, there is a manual for the game you can use to check up more on the game. Thanks for your time.\n\nUpdate: This game is still awesome. The devs are still working on it. It has updates every two to three days. Honestly, it just gets better and better.", "timestamp_created": 1475371494, "timestamp_updated": 1494119408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25809984": {"recommendationid": "25809984", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970602255", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519944390}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game!

Overall, the game is great if you enjoy working as a team to defeat enemy space ships, completing missions, and visiting different planets each with new things to discover! This is sort of what No mans sky should've been, even though this games map is a lot smaller, it feels much better as you can actually make meaningful upgrades to your crew, and ship. For example, you can buy nuclear warheads for your weapons expert to launch at enemy vessles, or you can increase your ships coolant capacity or engine power etc. \n\nSpace combat feels great on this game, and its very satisfying when you and your crew take out a gigantic enemy space ship which attempted to raid you, and loot the remains of their ship! You can sell scrap which you can obtain from enemy ships, and buy new equipment for your own ship instead to become stronger! \n\nYour crew is made up of a Captain who is in charge of your ship, a Pilot who pilots your ship at the captains will, a weapons expert who is responsible for maintaining weapons and engaging the enemy, an engineer who is in charge of maintaining the ships health, core temp, power etc. And also a scientist who researches new things which you can find on planets! Each crew member has a very unique, yet important role, and having a whole crew co-operating together and making the ship run feels great, it's honestly a very good co-op experience if done right.\n\nThe graphics could be a little better, especially the interiors of the ships, however the skybox, and the planets look great! One drawback of this game however, is that sometimes when on the bigger ships, you tend to get around 30-40 FPS on a pretty decent PC like mine, even though I run games like Arma 3 at around 60 FPS.

A refreshing gem hidden under the heaps of small-time developers, early access garbage games that seem to plague steam these days.\n\nI honestly believe that I've never played anything quite like it, which is why I am so drawn to it at random times throughout the day... It scratches a certain itch that I never knew I had.\n\nEsentially you are tasked to keep a ship (yours or another captains) from being blown to smithereens by space pirates, faction security drones, Deathseekers, civilian ships, sentinals, Infected Carriers, and space police all while exploring a vast galaxy in search of fame and fortune.\n\nSounds bad ass right? The only catch is that there are multiple crew positions on the ship! And each are fairly vital to the success of said ship.\n\nFor instance, the pilot who flys the ship and lines it up for the next warp. The weapons specialist who mans the ship's turrets and leads boarding parties to other enemy ships. The scientist who is in charge of comms between the other vessels you come across, along with running viruses targetted at enemy vessels and quick-fix/boosting programs to aid whichever ship you find youself on, as well as planetary scans to see what lies on the surface of that sketchy looking rock your crew is about to beam down to. The engineer is in charge of power distribution among the ships systems in an attempt to keep the ship from overheating (and exploding) during battles. Last but not least, someone will have to bring together this rag-tag group of space turds and help them function like a proper unit; The Captain. The captain plots the course through the galaxy (which is always randomly generated) and decides where to loot, who to murder, and how much money you'll get to buy space booze and shiny new weapons via a crew allowance!\n\nAs it stands currently, beta 9.5 I believe, the game is really damn fun - at times...\nI'd say about half of the community is willing to help out newcomers with pleasure and give them the lo-down on how the ships work and function.\n\nThe other half though... Will probably be some (irl) morbidly obese 15-16 year old captain yelling that everyone is doing everything wrong while the ship is on fire and he sits in his chair eating twinkies and contributing nothing to the rest of the crew or his ship.\n\nWith all that being said, when a crew comes together, magic begins to happen. You find yourself becoming part of the bigger picture. A truly renown Captain can issue orders from his chair for what he thinks the rest of the crew should be doing... \"Full power to all systems!\" , \"Block their long range comms and prepare to engage!!\" , and my personal favorite... \"FUCK IT! ARM THE NUKES AND PREPARE TO FIRE!!\" All while the crew scramble around the ship ensuring that we all don't die in space.\n\nIMO - A ship is only as good as its captain and crew. Make friends with the people you know and trust to do good work, and you will conquer the stars.\n\nMy only bitch about the game is that the player base is fairly small. On a good day at the right time, you'll see about 1-2 dozen games for you to hop in and out of. Or you can become your own captain and try it from the management/order-giving side of the game. No shitty ports to forward, or lame ass matchmaking, just pick a ship, and your server name and see who shows up!\n\nIf you find only a few players to join, the rest of the crew can be filled with AI specific to their roles in the crew. You might want to edit how they act in the TAB menu though, because they can get a little goofy from time to time. We mainly use them to put out fires and repair the ship, but hey.. Beats trying to do it alone!\n\nThere is actually a lot more content and game mechanics I could go over, but there no exploration in that!\n\nI have high hopes for this game!

There are five classes. Scientist, weapons specialists, engineer, pilot and captian. When you join a game online you join a new crew each time usually, with new people, and possibly new ship. When you start your own ship, you save it and get a different crew each time when people join. Every part of the crew usually makes the decisions on where to go, what missions to take, what things you need, etc. If you are looking for a little bit of info on what you can do, here it is:\n\nWeapons Specialist (WS): You man the weapons in the weapons bay. When on missions you are usually the one with more health and attck from talent points (TP) your crew gets from leveling up. Fighting monsters on planets and shooting and boarding enemy ships is what you do. \n\nScientist: You work in the lab, do all scans, run the shields, do research, and work with programs and viruses. The lab work is done when you stuff random goo and research materials into the 'atomizer' and if gives you research material. When you do research you use those things to give your crew upgrades. When you run the sheilds you set them for physical or energy weapons that you find out about when you scan their ship. When you scan the ship of the A.I. you scan for weapons, components, etc, and it is usuallu important to know your ship's component so you figure out if there is anything you need on the A.I. ship you could get. And with virus and programs you use programs to disable or take things from the enemy ship and stop virusses the enemy ship may puts on you. You also usually get to yell at the engineer to get you fuel capsules.\n\nEngineer: You work all the engineering stuff and systems. There are so many systems to explain that it would take me a while and a lot of time to explain it so I am just gonna leave it to: You get to learn a top to know what to press, when to press it, and how things work. There.\n\nPilot: Pretty straightforward. Not much I can say other than the fact that you pilot the ship.\n\nCaptian: Again, self-explainatory. CAPTIAN.\n\nAs always there is aton more things to all of these things than I explained and said, and there is so much fun to have testing and learning how to use everything.This is a great game, with real-time voice chat, so it feels like you are actually on a crew. That is a very short overview of Pulsar: Really great game.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1473101437, "timestamp_updated": 1473101437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25367870": {"recommendationid": "25367870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071103837", "num_games_owned": 1232, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467235792}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego que no esta mal, por definirlo de alguna manera...\nLamentablemente solo esta en Ingles y le falta algo de material.\nAun as\u00ed lo recomiendo. \nSe salvo gracias al cooperativo en l\u00ednea y al Multijugador que funcionan muy bien.\n\nNota: 06/10", "timestamp_created": 1473097459, "timestamp_updated": 1473097459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25364736": {"recommendationid": "25364736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108926270", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "last_played": 1521164781}, "language": "english", "review": "Started In a Inteped as engineer with the crew, Got blown up to nothing In 30 minutes due to combat.\n\n10/10 would do again", "timestamp_created": 1473086152, "timestamp_updated": 1473086152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25361900": {"recommendationid": "25361900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013234388", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506551608}, "language": "english", "review": "I dip in and out of this game on occassion's and absolutely love the Sci-Fi role playing that's involved. \n\nYes, the graphics aren't anything to write home about but the actual gameplay and environment are totally engrossing! \n\nI'd recommend this game to any Sci-Fi fan who's ever imagined themselves as part of a buccaneering crew on a ship like Serenity or the Raza, or after a few drinks, it often ends up more like Red Dwarf ;)", "timestamp_created": 1473072403, "timestamp_updated": 1473072403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25352245": {"recommendationid": "25352245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050530421", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468414240}, "language": "english", "review": "Way to good rating.

What can go wrong?\n\nThis can be an extremely fun game to play if you get a good dynamic crew. Captain matters most. Thus far I have only been Pilot and Captain, but I got us into some serious adventures as Captain. Ive been under the command of other Captains that were kind of dry and not so exciting - you need a Captain willing to do some crazy sh. \n\nYou will also need to really learn your roles. Captain is a decision maker and really only needs knowledge of how to pilot and man a gun. But if youre Science Officer or Engineer, you need to know what youre doing. A good Science Officer and Enginneer are crucial to getting you OUT of situations the Captain gets you in to. \n\nThis game seems very deep and involved after you start learning it. Its pretty much everything No Mans Sky should have been. This game is one of the most promising and exciting EA titles Ive ever played. \n\nThere are a few cons though. The graphics look like something from 2000, which is fine - but with a graphical overhaul, this game woiuld be utterly amazing. The space graphics are fine - its the the FPS environments that are old-school. The gameplay more than makles up for this though. \n\nRecommended? Absolutely.\n\nOne of my first real adventures found me as a new Captain. Our Weapons Officer had a lot of experience and was somehow assigned to our ship, crewed by newbies. We encountered a very tough and very well armed friendly ship. The weapons officer spied something he wanted - that ship's cannon. \n\nWell, we cant fight this ship, because it has a cannon that can obliterate us in short order in direct combat. \n\nHowever, we formulated a plan to take the ship.. \n\nTwo of us had to beam over after we hit it with our main cannon one time, just enough to drop its shields. The pilot had to keep us under it so it cant hit us with that dreaded cannon. We hit it hard, beamed over, and got intp a firefight with its crew. Our Engineer got to their Engineering deck single handedly while I held the remaining crewman at bay in the teleport room, and shut the ship down. The rest of our crew beamed over and helped us slay the remaining crewmen. \n\nThe ship was now ours. \n\nI claimed our new pride and joy amid cheering of our ragtag crew. \n\nThen the news came from Weapons Officer Barbosa: \n\nWe were now marked as Pirates.", "timestamp_created": 1472183154, "timestamp_updated": 1472183791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25140440": {"recommendationid": "25140440", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960451053", "num_games_owned": 566, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472354177}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried to bark orders as captain to my fiance while she proceeded to flip the lights on and off.

While the game may seem a bit complex at first, it ends up being quite simple if you have a good crew to play it with. I can only imagine how much fun this game would be with a group of 5 close friends, but ive only played with random players. It is difficult to describe the kinds of bonds you will feel with your crewmates, even if they are just random players. Everyone has a distinct role, and during battle, some amazing cooperation and teamwork can occur.

Pulsar is meant to be played as a coop game but can be played with one player and 4 bots I would suggest that you play with at least two players if not just for the beginning when you're trying to understand the game mechanics. In the current version as of this review (Beta 9.5) You don't have a set goal, you can get missions from your faction over long range comms or from finding quest givers scattered throughout the galaxy. Throughout the galaxy which is randomly generated from a seed every play through it will spawn planets, trade and repair stations, exotic shops, and other things that I will not spoil for you. Even in this games very early state it has more than enough content for me to justify dropping 25 dollars which on normal early access games, because of how most developers seem to handle early access.

I wouldn't expect such low fps in a game that isn't even as graphically appealing as things like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or even Team Fortress 2 frankly.

Give me weapons!\" or \"Refill my shield charges ASAP; we're getting hammered!\" in the heat of battle. A really fantastically crafted experience.\n\nThe game provides a really engaging opportunity to run not only your own ship, but various kinds of ships. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking to have a crack at running their own spaceship!\n\nFor those who'd like to see how the game actually plays, feel free to scope out our misadventures here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMZD1JcBH-MIqSwPt6sZztMEjUFf7VdwZ\n\nor here on steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/morjax/videos/?appid=252870", "timestamp_created": 1469626973, "timestamp_updated": 1476737482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24547292": {"recommendationid": "24547292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148899613", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488037640}, "language": "english", "review": "Have you ever wanted to explore the galaxy?

A new ship, The U.S.S Fuccboi, hired me, I was ecstatic that they would hire a C grade engineer who barely passed his finals. I had no job skills or any clue on how to operate any components of the ship, and there was no training day, but the pay was still good enough and the exploration was more than enough to make me content.\n\nSurprisingly we had our first mission within minutes of our maiden voyage, we needed to clear an old waystation of alien creatures. Our Captain gladly accepted asked me to prepare for warp speed, I ran down to the engine room,I had no clue where it was at the time. After minutes of searching I stumbled upon it. I quickly found the button and pressed it, the engine hummed as it charged. We were about to embark on our first mission. The ship shook as we jolted forward into the final frontier.\n\nWe arrived to our destination minutes later, to think that we traveled light years in such a short time blew my mind. An intercom buzzed.\n\n\u201cAlright boys, we gotta kill all these alien rat things, so everyone get your asses to the teleporter bay, or else.\u201d\n\nI quickly ran to the bay and pulled out my phaser pistol, It was time for action.\n\u201cNot so fast Rookie, You're not coming, we need you alive\u201d\n\nI nodded my head and holstered my pistol, both relieved and disappointed.

It's early access, maybe because it doesn't actually have way too much to explore it's still very fun to play. Outside of how it looks, the gameplay is what's worth it. Not much to explore, they constantly add patches and updates, minimum every week or so? There aren't too many planets to explore, well sure there's a fair amount but there's not a lot of planets with a variation, you can meet the same one multiple times in one play through. They even have a Forum for the game, and for being just two people making this game they're really quick at answering questions, they even have a devlog on YouTube. \n\nI really see high potentional for this game, really, really high potentional.

This is the first time I've ever said that about an early access game and hopefully it won't be the last. There is absolutely no story so I won't be covering that.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \nIn a nutshell, imagine what you would do aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. For those who don't know the ship specifically, imagine what is done onboard  the famous spaceship in Star Trek. You have 5 classes; each with their own upgrades that contribute to other crew members and the ship itself. Captain, scientist, pilot, engineer and gunner. I'll list these off individually to make it easier to take in.\n\n[h1] Captain [/h1]\nThe captain chooses what to do, where to go and what to buy. He or she is also the one who gives you a limit on what you can spend as the money you receive goes towards everyone.\n\n[h1] Scientist [/h1]\nThe scientist is responsible for buffing and debuffing ships and scanning for enemies and mines both on the ship and on foot. He can also decide whether to sacrifice shields for a more stealthy approach or keep the shields strong. He's basically the 'support' class of the crew.\n\n[h1] Pilot [/h1] \nThe pilot is self explanatory. They're responsible for maneuvering the ship to align with the current and future destinations and help to either engage or retreat from enemy ships.\n\n[h1] Engineer [/h1]\nThe engineer is probably the most hectic job of all. As the engineer you're responsible for warp ignition and preparation, keeping the core cool, making sure that the right systems are on and the wrong ones off, repairing damaged systems, turning the shields off and on for ship repairs and making sure to send fuel cores up so that the scientist can continue to use his/her buffs and debuffs to keep the ship from exploding. \n\n[h1] Gunner [/h1]\nThe gunner is the most simple job. Your job is to be ready to shoot at hostiles when given the order or when you've received fire.\n\nWhile some jobs are more complicated than others, every crew member is valuable and that is what I love about this game. If you're only interested in singleplayer then this is not the game for you. The A.I. isn't too bright and will end up getting you killed. \n\n[h1] Graphics and Sound [/h1]\nBoth the graphics and the sound are pretty outdated but once you play you definitely won't care. It's a very innovative and interactive game. The pictures on the store page shows you exactly how it will look.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game without a doubt. The community is very friendly and helpful and the adventure no matter if you're starting a new game or helping someone with theirs is always different. I think that the $25 price for an early access game is a bit steep but still worth every penny. If this game is developed further and goes out of early access I have no doubt in my mind that it could end up as one of the greatest and most memorable games ever made. That is how fun this is and how confident I am about it with the direction it's in. This game doesn't require a mic to play but it is strongly recommended as constant communication is key to staying alive in the heat of battle.", "timestamp_created": 1468104151, "timestamp_updated": 1468104151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509372", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24213075": {"recommendationid": "24213075", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961354335", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515225160}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the most fun I've had in a game for a while.

I live for science fiction.  \n\nI used to play a game with my friends called \"what's the worst thing you would do to go to space\".  \"I would eat a bowl of shit\" was the very first answer, and I currently have 2nd place for \"eat a plate of my mother's refrigerated pubes\".\n\nI played thousands of hours of Star Trek: Bridge Commander.  I convinced all my friends to play Artemis and we played it as much as the game's awful interface would allow.  This game is about as good as I could've ever imagine Artemis could be with mods about 6 years ago.\n\nThe potatoes are finished and onto the meat:  \n\nPROS:\n+ There's a universe to explore\n+ There's a learning curve to exploring it that feels \"just right\". \n+ Playing with your friends and training to be a well-oiled crew is easily some of the most fun I've ever had playing videogames\n\n\nCONS:\n- The graphics are bad.  It is ugly.  You won't like looking at anything but space.\n- LOTS of content missing.  If you've ever wondered what half a game feels like, this is it.\n- The current system of ship capturing and respawning is half-baked at best.  It's hard to immerse yourself when the key to success is a highly exploitable metagame\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nIn its current state, I cannot recommend PULSAR: Lost Colony despite it being the #1 game on my watchlist for over a year.  The game is as barely functional as an early access game can barely be.  It is my hope that the development team doesn't take the current level of sales as a success and move onto other projects, leaving PULSAR in the state of development hell that the rest of us know early access titles to be.  It is my hope that this is just the beginning of a long voyage full of setbacks and the lessons we learn from them, culminating in a fruitful return, just like a great episode of Star Trek :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1468057779, "timestamp_updated": 1468057779, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482180", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24193107": {"recommendationid": "24193107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006149799", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467584722}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my friends really hyped this up to me, and told me all the fantastic sounding stories, so I purchased it.

As someone who has loved Star Trek all my life and has always wanted a game that would simulate running a ship simular to the enterprise. I can say that Pulsar is an exquisite game. There are several diffrent ships ranging from the small \"Stargazer\" class stealth transport. To the \"Roland\" class cruiser which is so huge that it could probably fit several other ships in the game inside it. Each of the ship choices are unique and have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, one ship could have signifigantly better armor but its thrusters can't reverse. There are also some less stat based diffrences such as the engineering room being placed closer or farther to the bridge. The ship systems also go above and beyond those of other similar games. In no other game have I ever felt so proud to know the proper procedures that it requires to reboot a ships OS. The classes all feel unique however it does sometimes feel as if you may not be needed as anyone on the ship can do anyone's job with the right knowledge and talents. The game is surprisingly in depth. me and my friends decided to beam down to a seemingly empty planet only for our science officer to report that the scanner was picking up a nearby teleporter, this lead us to a secret weapons shop. Their are three playable factions in game right now, and as to not bother explaining them I will sum them up by naming them what they basicly are: Star Fleet, Semi-evil corporation, and space criminals. Each use two out of the six playable ships which are sadly restricted to their respective factions (However personally I feel it adds realism) In terms of the missions in the game, they each feel like an episode of star trek \"DUDE THIS IS LIKE AN EPISODE OF STAR TREK\" -My friend. The missions will have you find crews encased in cocoons, Crashed ships whose lone survivor wishes for you not to report that he survived so that he can stay with his ship, and abandoned stations full of uncontained beasts for extermination (On that particular misson a scan from our ship showed a humonoid aboard the station which we could never find, Creepy)\n\nIn conclusion this is probably my new favorite game for a long time. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1467346948, "timestamp_updated": 1467659709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718407", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23967362": {"recommendationid": "23967362", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967421109", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506457384}, "language": "english", "review": "I really love this game!  That being said I'll start with the negatives. The game itself can become a little repetative and there is an akwardness in joining quiet or dead games especially when only one person has a mic and is talking the entire time, or you join two friends who are just going to make inside jokes all game. The difficulty level can be steep for new players figuring out the mechanics which I don't see as a negative but a maybe a roadblock for players who don't play many RNG type games. As far as the repetition goes I found that the planets began to feel very confined and cookie cutter. You'll see a cave planet, ice planet, desert planet, lava planet but each planet takes about under 10minutes to see all there is. There are some pretty cool artifacts and other ancient alien type structures to explore but as of my last game they seemed pretty empty other than for having that first time experience they became something just to move on from during gameplay. \n\nWhich brings me to combat... the combat actually requires the crew to work together to do well. This is where games can go dead if one or more players is either too inexperienced or do not have mics to work as fluidly with the other roles. This is another issue that I think makes the game fun but can also make it hard to find players and a working crew during certain hours. I found that during off hours the AI bots did better than many players and farming by myself actually seemed to be a better option. I liked this feature from the sense of being able to farm scrap but quickly noticed how empty/shallow the game started to feel. When I started playing with players again it became a mix of either being too impatient to teach the game again and again or felt impartial when playing with experienced players who just wanted to teach you again and again.\n\nOn the flipside I would also find over about 65% of my games really pushed me into the simulation of having to pull things together on the fly and with other players I definitely made a good amount of new steam friends. The best games were the ones where everyone just started naturally roleplaying to complete the tasks at hand but it was also hard for the subconcious indoctrination of space TV dramas to not make their way onto stage. Throughout all this the need to maintain fires and subsystems while adapating to attack patterns cohesively became very addictive.  I would highly recommend this game especially to sci-fi / spacesim / co-op fans who enjoy casual/moderate core gaming. If this game had pvp I would probably having all my gamer friends playing it. In the meantime as someone who is a huge FTL fan this has been like a dream come true.

These five players working together allow the ship to be run at prime efficiency as they explore uncharted star systems and engage enemy combatants on the ground and in space. Five people are not needed to play this game. I think 3 is a perfect minimum to make things run smoothly. The Captain would also play the role of pilot while two others were Engineer and Science Officer. You could then set two bots (Weapons Bot and Pilot Bot) to man the guns.\n\nA more in-depth description follows:\n\nPULSAR allows up to five friends to take on the role of a starship crew. While any player in any role can do any job, each role has specific perks that make them perform their role more effectively.\n\nThe first role is Captain. The captain is in charge of the ship. He plots the course that the ship will take, manages ship finances and upgrades, gives an allowance to the other members of the crew for personal purchases, decide when to charge up the warp engine and initiate warp as well as how to respond to other vessels. He can take a diplomatic approach, militarisic approach or even extort other ships over the communications system. His skills are based on speech as well as allowing other players to move more quickly.\n\nThe second role is Engineer. The engineer is the one who keeps the ship running. He manages the reactor which supplies power to the entire ship, juggling systems by diverting power to and from ones in need and making sure it does not overheat, charging the warp drive as well as actually initiating the jump upon the captain's order. His skills are designed to make his job easier by making reactor coolant more effective, allowing ship critical systems to begin self repairs, reducing the likelihood of fires during combat and increasing the chances of successfully obtaining working salvage from destroyed ships.\n\nThe third role is Science Officer. The science officer has two primary roles aboard the ship plus a handful of secondary roles. His most important one is managing the cyberwarfare suite during combat. Managing computer viruses designed to perform actions such as kill an enemy's engines, stop their shields from recharging, siphoning credits and blocking long range distress communications as well as running anti-virus programs when his ship is the target of cyber warfare. His second role is research and developement. When research materials are brought aboard, the science officer can study them in order to learn new skills that can affect the crew in a myriad of ways such as faster weapon cooldowns, being able to run while encumbered and more efficient jetpack fuel. Other roles involve scanning ships and planets for lifesigns, EM, radiation and abnormal/dangerous weather conditions. His skills are designed around making shields more efficient, reducing the ship's signature to make detection more difficult and healing nearby crew members.\n\nThe fourth role is Weapons Officer. The weapons officer's primary role is to man the ship's weaponry, including turrets, the main gun, missiles and nuclear armament. He is also responsible for leading the away team when boarding enemy ships or teleporting down to a planet. His skills revolve around making ship weaponry more efficient by reducing cooldowns.\n\nThe last role is Pilot. The pilot's job is to fly the ship, primarily during combat, but also to align the ship with the target sector prior to engaging the warp engines. He is also responsible for getting the ship close enough to gather scrap off of destroyed ships and maneuvering into repair doks. His skills are designed to make the engines more efficient.", "timestamp_created": 1466824546, "timestamp_updated": 1466826198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23744313": {"recommendationid": "23744313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175683369", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466739225}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is honestly the worst game i have ever played. \n-Zero content\n-Roles are useless and you spend most of your time just sitting on  a ship doing nothing\n-literally made me emo all night\n-gameplay the equivalent of taking a 2 hour nap\n-this game actually made me wanna go smoke weed just to not feel like shit any more\n-cried in the shower after\n\nhave no idea why the ratings are so good.  its so terrible...honestly.", "timestamp_created": 1466743533, "timestamp_updated": 1466743533, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.184609", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23739408": {"recommendationid": "23739408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110058187", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509150981}, "language": "english", "review": "Never trust Duncan...", "timestamp_created": 1466728456, "timestamp_updated": 1466728765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427581", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23735651": {"recommendationid": "23735651", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972779575", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514697525}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

I'm always very wary of Early Access titles because many end up not being updated after mere months, abandoned... and many many more end up being scams. This has just been awesome to play! If you're looking for Star Trek Simulator to play with friends (max 5 players), you have found it. There's planets both interesting and sometimes even dangerous, ships that could be friend or foe but often you only have split seconds to act, and the mechanics of the roles you play on the ship are complex enough to give you purpose, but simple enough to learn with a run-through of the in-game manual for that role. I have to say that the manual is definitely your friend and makes it much easier to understand what you have to do.\n\n\nI'm still having fun with this game, and the geek-out moments you'll have firing up the warp drive, getting a course laid-in, and getting in to ship battles that require tight coordination by in-game voice are excellent.

Wenn zwei oder drei Spieler dabei sind, die \u00f6fters mal reden und der Rest sich zumindest ab und zu mal im Chat meldet, kommt dabei eigentlich schon eine gute Spielerfahrung raus. Ich pers\u00f6nlich bin zumindest auf den deutschen Servern eigentlich nur auf nette Mitspieler getroffen. Ich wei\u00df aber nicht, wie viele deutsche Lost Colony noch spielen, deshalb kann ich f\u00fcr nichts garantieren. (Nicht-Deutsche waren auch meist freundlich)\n\nDer Spielspa\u00df steigt auch mit der Anzahl der Mitspieler, wobei es mit weniger als vier nicht wirklich viel Spa\u00df macht, und allein oder zu zweit hat man es echt schwer. Auch ist es nicht gerade lustig, wenn die anderen noch Anf\u00e4nger sind. Aber ich konnte das ganze zumindest schnell lernen.\n\nSo, soll ich eigentlich noch wirklich was zum Spiel an sich sagen? Es gibt \u00fcber 800 Reviews, aus denen man auch einiges erf\u00e4hrt. Deshalb schreibe ich hier einfach mal meine pers\u00f6nliche Meinung zu den einzelnen Rollen\n\nCaptain:\nDer hat's eigentlich am einfachsten und am schwersten gleichzeitig. Am einfachsten, weil er normalerweise wenig zu tun hat, und am schwersten, weil er sich mit der Ausr\u00fcstung des Schiffes auseinandersetzen muss. Das ist nicht immer ganz \u00fcbersichtlich, weshalb der Job am Anfang der schwerste der Crew ist. Mit Ausnahme des engineers vielleicht\n\nPilot:\nDer Pilot richtet das Schiff f\u00fcr warps aus, bringt es in K\u00e4mpfen in einen Winkel, in dem der weapon specialist die Gegner treffen kann, und man\u00f6vriert es in die Teile, in denen es repariert wird. Die Steuerung ist recht schnell gelernt, und an der \u00e4ndert sich auch nichts, abgesehen davon, dass manche schiffe tr\u00e4ger oder langsamer sind als andere. Und es macht auch Spa\u00df, durch ein Minenfeld zu fliegen -und dabei alles unter Kontrolle zu haben-, w\u00e4hrend der Rest der Crew in Panik verf\u00e4llt^^\n\nWeapon Specialist:\nDessen Aufgabe ist auch ziemlich klar: An eine Kanone gehen und die feinde unter Beschuss nehmen. Davon gibt es mehrere, und eine kann auch durch einen skill von den anderen benutzt werden kann. Welche, h\u00e4ngt auch immer von der Ausr\u00fcstung des Schiffes ab. Im gro\u00dfen und ganzen ist es wohl die einfachste der f\u00fcnf rollen, ransetzen und schie\u00dfen. Auf gro\u00dfe Entfernung ist das aber auch nicht einfach, und auch hier kann man sich verbessern.\n\nEngineer:\nDie nach eigener Erfahrung undankbarste Rolle von Lost Colony. (Vielleicht hab ich auch einfach nur mit den falschen Leuten gespielt?) Der engineer k\u00fcmmert sich um die Energieverteilung unter den Systemen und achtet darauf, dass der Reaktor nicht \u00fcberhitzt. Au\u00dferdem bereitet er jeden warp vor, was auch irgendwie das einzige ist, was die Mitspieler mitbekommen. Mehr gibt es eigentlich nicht zu sagen\n\nScientist:\nDie wohl nutzloseste Rolle von allen, kann eigentlich auch weggelassen und vom captain \u00fcbernommen werden. Manchmal aber ist er wirklich n\u00fctzlich. Man verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber ausger\u00fcstete Module, (ich nenn die jetzt einfach mal so) die im Kampf einen tempor\u00e4ren Vorteil bringen, wie z. B. das Herunterfahren feindlicher Schilde, oder das sofortige aufladen des warpantriebs. In letzter Zeit wurde allerdings versucht, die Rolle durch Artefakte mehr Relevanz zu geben. Hier bin ich aber nicht wirklich informiert\n\nFazit:\nJa, mein Fazit steht eigentlich oben. Mehr gibt es nicht zu sagen. Den Rest muss jeder selbst entscheiden.\n\nAch, und wer noch einen Piloten braucht, kann mich gerne adden^^", "timestamp_created": 1466019608, "timestamp_updated": 1466019608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.990025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23573165": {"recommendationid": "23573165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071589104", "num_games_owned": 405, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497373063}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, for starters this game has a negative review.

I normally avoid early access after being burned by Dean Hall and DayZ but this game had me hooked within an hour.\n\nThe sense of exploration and adventure is really the focal point of this game, and they're things that a lot of games set out to achieve. The problem with most games out there is that their goals are attainable by just about anyone who picks them up. Challenges are set by the player themselves, and gaming (even in many multiplayer games) can feel like a very solitary experience.\n\nPULSAR requires coordination with players (I really don't recommend this game unless you have at LEAST 3 other people to play it with) and that coordination is what drives this game. Suddenly it isn't the individual that chooses the difficulty and the challenge, it's everyone. You all work together and stand aside one another in the face of adversity--be it brutal enemy starship fights or exploration of labyrinthine caverns on distant worlds.\n\nThe devs have taken a very simple idea and made it into something very fresh and inspiring. It's hard to adequately describe the rush of emotions you get when winning your first starship fights as a team...or exploring sectors and sending away teams on investigations. \n\nThis is one of the few TRULY \"cooperative\" games out there in recent years.

Up to five players collaborate to tackle exploration and combat objectives.  \n\nEach player assumes a role in a small starship crew: Captain, Scientist, Pilot, Engineer, or Weapons Specialist.  Working together, the crew travels across a randomized galaxy to overcome various obstacles.  Exploration missions task the crew with travelling to remote locations to retrieve items or investigate an area.  Combat includes ship-to-ship battles as well as gunfights between individual players and opposing NPCs.  Enemy ships may be boarded and seized, or destroyed for scrap.\n\nEach player has specific responsibilities.  The Scientist operates the ship's sensors, shield configuration, and opens communications with other vessels.  The Engineer manages the ship's power systems to ensure various parts of the craft are able to operate, without overheating the reactor.  The Pilot flies the craft and acts as the crew's \"eyes\" - identifying hazards or items of interest that do not appear on sensors.  The Weapons Specialist mans the ship's turrets and acts as the craft's security officer.  Finally, the Captain (the player hosting the game) is the crew's decision maker - managing missions, diplomacy over comms, and overseeing the crew's finances.\n\nSimply put, [b]PULSAR: Lost Colony[/b] is a great game.

The most recent major update in Beta 8 allowed you to hail other ships, instead of just flat out fight them the second you see them. It really adds to the immersion of the whole game.\n\nWith any game there's bugs, but none are overwhelmingly large enough to be game breaking and most are minor, for now. The devs have done a good job in QA testing their game and each update. Whenever they see a bug they usually do their best to fix it ASAP. Sometimes a bugfix will come in a patch version big enough to actually introduce a few tidbits of new content too. Always a good thing.\n\nSome things are actually still missing, for instance; there's some key elements to the lore that are implied but not written in stone or shown in the game just yet. Updates have done their best to bring in more lore based content alongside meaningful core mechanics to the game. It should be made clear the devs are focusing on getting all core mechanics down first, before focusing on any big time content. Regardless, the game is still a bit vast in these initial stages.\n\nSome people on the forums on the dev's website have suggested removing warp times and simply allowing a Captain to choose when to skip a warp. This would likely be a very good idea; if your ship has been damaged heavily in a firefight, being in that warp gives you the time to do what you can to get it battle ready, despite whatever shape it's in. Furthermore, let's say your crew is RPing? It would be perfect for RPing crews to use that time inbetween warps to socialize amongst crew and advance their own story. Despite these reasons, the devs have yet to make any adjustments let alone make any comments about this (to my knowledge). This so far, in my view, the only major con.\n\nPulsar: LC is a well done game.

I am the C.O in charge of the C.U Carrier Class \"Paper Airplane\" so cleverly nicknamed by Admiral Hill. My crew is of five members to whom I own my life and vice versa. On weapons is Justin who has the best record of shot to hit in the entire galaxy. On engineer is Sabakyo, a veteren in the fleet and second to none when it comes to reactor management. Rey is our pilot, he is new to the crew but quickly became close friends with everyone. Bovice on science, outstanding record from the academy graduating top of his class 4 years running. \n\nOur usual missions are that of scrap gathering.  We do, however, receive a few agressive missions like defending a mining base, or collecting rouge scout drones by any means nessasary. But last week, everything changed. There is word of an Intrepid class ship who has stolen weapons from the fleet and using them to extort civilian ships and trading outposts all across the galaxy. They are very clever and have thus been unable to be located before they strike and dissappear. We have recieved orders from CU Command that they have recently tried to sell children for credits at a trading station on the outskirts of Mineus Thrive not 5 Warps from our usual gathering spot. We have been ordered to investigate the incident report and find out why the trading depot has been radio silent.\n\nAfter a short briefing, we quickly begin preperations and head out to the trading depot. The journey was quite uneventful though I can tell the crew is a bit nervous. Hell, I am myself. \"Captain, we are dropping out of warp in 10 minutes.\" My science officer announces to me through comms. Leaving my quarters, I head towards the bridge. Shortly after we drop out of warp to see the wreckage of the trading depot we were tasked to locate. It was horrible, debris everywhere. If not for the quick reaction time of our pilot, we may have had a collision. \"Science, see if there is anywhere safe to teleport to and perhaps their computer has information as to what happened here, also do a scan for any lifeforms. Pilot give us some breathing room, i'd prefer not to have a hole in our hull before we face our true objective.\" I calmly order towards my crew.\n\n\"No lifeforms sir, but there is a few blast doors that seal off near their comms array we may be able to get into, I'm sure if it's anything like the depots back home, they'll have at the very least audio logs of the events leading up to their destruction. Permission to beam abord?\" Science hastly says after a few beeps from his station. \"Granted, take weapons with you, I'm sure Colonel Justin would like to stretch his legs\" I say.\n\nThe boarding party went quite fast and sure enough, Bovice was able to return with information as he anticipated. It would seem the depot refused a deal from a recent ship who ported at the depot, calling themselves the Grim Cutlass. Out of anger they opened fire on the depot, according to these logs though, they only fired once. The devistation from just one shot from this weapon was unfathomable. This in no way helped with the nerves of my crew and I was unsure of how to reasure them that this wouldn't be us if we arent careful with how we approach the AWOL ship. With little delay, we warp in the direction of the last warp trail left behind assuming it must be our culprit.\n\nMy Scientist Bovice warns me our odds of survival are increibly low. I order Engineering and Science to turn off everything and then ordered the crew into our Exo-suits. We have yet to be detected by the Grim Cutlass so we have the element of suprise. After a few moments of debate about how well our shields and hull would stand against this weapon the enemy ship has onboard, It is clear the best corse of action is to unload as much fire power we can into them before they can react. The hopes is to disable their weapons and then perhaps get them to surrender. Without their main turret active, they should crumble with fear. We drop out of warp and our scanners confirm it is the signature for our foe, the AWOL CU ship self named \"Grim Cutlass\". My report from CU Command says the weapon they stole when they went AWOL is a prototype weapon called the CU Long Range. We've seen it's power solely from the rubble it left behind.\n\n\"Justin, charge main cannon, load shield piercers and fire at their weapons. Science, load our barrage program, Pilot, face the enemy and be prepared to dodge whatever return fire you can. Engineer, dont let us blow up\" I command. \"No pressure Sabakyo\" Science snickers. Like clockwork, weapons locks on with shield piercer missles and charges our main turret, engineer like conducting flight of the bumblebee works at redirecting power as needed while maintaining a low core temp. Pilot ties what appeared to be a rambo bandana across his forehead and cracks his knuckles. Science was sciencing the shit out of his station.\n\nOur missle flies at almost same time the main cannon hits their shields, our auto turrets fire a few rounds of railgun ammo as our missle hits dead on. \"Captain! Their weapons are disabled.\" Science shouts \"Hail them!\" I say\nOn screen was the captain of the Grim Cutlass, eye patch, exotic fur coat. Suprisingly it was a female, but more now a pirate than an ex-CU Captain. \"Cowards play! she screems \"How dare you fire upon an unprepared opponent! But if you leave now then i'll give you a head start before burning this sector alive to hunt you down. and KILL YOU SLOWLY\" The crude space pirate sneers. \"This is Captain Velcro of the Colonial Union. You are to hereby surrender yourself and your ill gotten ship to us immideatly or face destrustion.\" I say extremely proud that our sneak attack worked. \n\n\"I refuse, but I find it absolutely hilarious that you are so arrogant that you think you've won.\" She barks then closes comms. \"Sir! They are firing their main cannon!\" Science screams. \"But how?\" I ask. In a blink of an eye, a large pulse of energy streaks across space towards our ship. This is it, our end i think to myself as our pilot barely manages to roll the ship out of its way. \"Captain! Our engines and shields are down!\" Science proclaims after taking a moment to see we are still alive. \"It would seem their main turrent is on a seperate power source.\"\n\n\"Load the nuke...\" I barely can believe i said aloud knowing that we should only use it in dire situations and admitting we needed to use it was admitting this was most likely our last rodeo. \"Sir! If we do at this range, well be hit by our own explosion!\" my Weapon's Specialist exclaims. \"He is correct, sir.\" My Scientist says. \"Captain, I could fire full reverse thrusters and put some space between us\" The Pilot states. \"Doing so will require me to give more power engines and our reactor cant handle it, not after the effects of that blast we took..\" Our faithful Engineer adds.\n\n\"You heard me crew!\" I shout. \"Our window of opprotunity will be very short. If they get another shot at us we are finished. I want Science to load all our shield recharge programs, Engines alot all power to science and weapons. Once the nuke is launched, full power to engines and full reverse. I will detonate the warhead manually.\" I command with absolute confidence in my crew. \"Science get on a railgun and shoot any missles they send our way once programs are executed.\"\n\nSitting there with my hand over the detonate button, my crew scrambles between their roles as the Grim Cutlass and ourselves send volley after volley of lasers and missles at eachother. I can see the damage to our systems on my screen before me piling up. Everything is going quiet around me despite the carnage. I can faintly hear Bovice saying they are firing the weapon again. Our nuke was now in range, but so were we. I close my eyes and exhale.\n\nThe Grim Cutlass is no more, but nor are we.\n\n10/10 would totally Martyr my crew again.", "timestamp_created": 1462587590, "timestamp_updated": 1462587590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 43, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705005", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22823566": {"recommendationid": "22823566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053599917", "num_games_owned": 755, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490661882}, "language": "english", "review": "You and four friends (or bots) can now pile into a star ship of your choice and adventure across space.

It's mechanics are great, allowing you to fly around your spaceship, fire weapons, explore planets, and several other things. What makes this game even greater is mutltiplayer. It is so much easier to put hours and hours into this game, when you play with lots of friends. Even if you don't have friends to play with, there is also a great online community to go out and explore.\n\nThere are somethings I don't like about the game however. One of the big things, is that the game feels unfinished. On planets there is not much to do and out in space all you really can do is fight ships.

The graphics in the screen shots and the videos made me wary that this was yet another Early Access title that does the same thing that other, bigger, prettier games do so much better. (And lets be honest, if you've played Early Access you probably know exactly what I mean.)\n\nThen, I decided that I would go on YouTube (something I never do) in order to see what the game play was actually like. What I saw intrigued me enough that I actually bought an Early Access title for what I thought was a lot of money for such a simple looking game. \n\nSo far, I'm pretty amazed by what Leafy Games has managed to put together. After you play this, you'll wonder why it took so long for a game company to see space combat through a cooperative lens. \n\nThe game isn't done yet, don't get me wrong, but what it does is something that no other game has really attempted with any degree of success. It takes the somewhat tried-and-true formula of a space sim/roguelike/shooter/RPG and instead of giving each player their own unique starship they make you cooperate to run that one starship well.\n\nThe five classes they have in the game are mostly well balanced around one another, as each class 'controls' a particular section of the ship. Some roles, like Engineer, involve pushing buttons and pulling levers to keep the ship from overheating and providing power for the other roles to use. Science is the eyes and ears of the ship while providing offensive and defensive buffs through power allocated by the Engineer. The pilot flies the ship and collects space-loot while ensuring that they follow the captains flight plan. There's a lot there, and while it might be confusing your first game nothing is so complex that it will take more than a half-hour to learn it. (Also, the user manual is surprisingly useful for a first-time player that prefers not to engage in trial-by-fire.)\n\nThe community thus far have been very helpful and nice, which is also a refreshing change of pace, although there are the obligatory trolls/children that will join into your game to shut off oxygen to your ship or purposefully start fires/destroy subsystems for the sheer hate of it. So far, they're relatively few and it's generally pretty easy to recover from any of their hijinks. It's also a small community, so after a while you'll probably know enough people to steer clear of any jokers you might encounter. \n\nObviously, the game is growing, and really my only critique is that there needs to be a few more things that the Captain can override as far as crew decisions that could be deemed 'griefing', such as firing off nuclear warheads or turning off shields mid-combat. \n\nThe game play is as fast or as slow as your group can handle. Planets are relatively relaxing without any real threat of losing anything, death is painless as you have infinite clones (Although in hardcore mode you don't get a save at all, so you better not all die at once or it's game over.), and voice chat is almost a must if you really get into this game. Bad decisions are punished hard and fast, often times without you necessarily knowing what went wrong. (Such as shooting at a -much- more powerful ship than your own, only to be one-shot in return because Science didn't bother to scan the enemy ship to determine it's relative strength.) You won't blow up out of nowhere due to any one crew members mistakes though, so don't concern yourself with the engineer accidentally ejecting the warp core or hitting the wrong button and killing everyone instantly.\n\nMost games that label themselves as 'cooperative' are anything but cooperative. This game is a breath of fresh air into the space sim genre and I hope Leafy follows through on this concept and continues their track record of timely updates and great ideas.\n\nAs my last parting thought, if you're at all a fan of Star Trek and always wished there was a game that finally scratched that itch that nothing seems to satisfy, this game is literally tailor made for you. Even if you -don't- like Star Trek, this game is worth a look and a purchase just for the innovation they've already put out into the gaming universe.", "timestamp_created": 1459880292, "timestamp_updated": 1459886563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22243136": {"recommendationid": "22243136", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965256875", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459792281}, "language": "english", "review": "Deceptive trailer. \n\nBuggy, repetitive and shallow gameplay.\n\nLike flying ships?

There's a couple on/off switches and that't about it, it might give you the impression that the panels are complex, but they're not, they just look cool on face value but once you get in the game there's like 3 buttons you can click and trust me when I say that after pressing them twice you don't feel like repeating it.\n\nThis game is extremely shallow and overpriced.

Devs have been updating the game regularly and adding more missions, ships and systems. Space combat has gotten a lot better, though on-foot gunplay is still basic. Still, if you ever wanted FTL in 3D and with multiplayer, this is it. Continued updates and the dedication of this dev make this a no-brainer.

The enemies (generally) aren't over- or under-powered, unless there are more than about 3 of them, in which case one should leave. Quickly.  \n\nOne of my largest problems was the character model quality. While it doesn't affect gameplay, I'm very fussy when it comes to graphics quality. Also, there could be a bit more variety in terms of the ships (not the components, the ships themselves).\n\nI do think that the price was a bit too high, however.

We spent about 30 minutes on a search and destroy until we needed to head back and repair the hull.  I am the pilot and yes, I'm a girl.  My first attempt at docking with the repair station was ...sporty.  If you've ever seen the movie galaxy quest then you will have a good idea of what it's like to fit the destroyer into a repair station docking bay.  \n\nOur first away mission resulted in our captain yelling \"Oh sh*t!\" and then promptly dying.  When asked what killed him, he said something \"Ambiguous\" and told us to head right when we exited the terraforming station.  I headed right and immediately died by the \"Ambiguous\" hostile who seemed intent on shoving a plasma cannon up my posterior.  I was very happy that someone had remembered to turn on the respawning platform on board the ship.  Except for the need to change my uniform, I was ready to beam back to the planet surface and return the favor.  \n\nThis game is all about friends and teamwork.  The better your team, the more fun you will have.  I wasn't happy with the price tag considering the state it's currently in but if you play this with a group of people who have a good sense of humor and a love for space operas, you will never regret the purchase.  I love this game and I see only good things to come because it's only going to get better from here.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1455699238, "timestamp_updated": 1455699238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21269217": {"recommendationid": "21269217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054349064", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456992436}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game a lot, it has amazing potental to become an epic game.

That said, there are still bugs and glitches that has to be fixed and more depth to the game to be added. But the potential is there!\n\nThe game consists of several classes, all of which have their own tasks to make the spaceship run smoothly. They have upgradable talents that will give perks to either themselves or to the ship. \nThe engineer has control of power usage and core temperature, along with the systems on the ship such as weapons, shield and warp drive. \nThe pilot maneuvers the ship. The controls takes some minutes to get used to, but becomes easy after flying around for a little time. \nThe weapon specialist fires the big gun. Probably the easiest positions, but also very entertaining. Railgun, laser turret, missiles, nukes and more. \nThe scientist is more like an electronic warfare operator. Cyberwarfare (infecting enemy ship systems with computer viruses), shield boosting and programming, and scanning of planets and ships. \nThe captain is the big boss. He is in control of buying and selling components and equipment for the ship, has full economical control and makes the plans for where to go and what to do. Personally I think this role is a bit dull, as it consists of mostly just telling people what to do, without doing anything yourself (except from plotting in the course in the starmap). This is realistic, of course, but still the position I like the least. \n\nA good crew can be really fun to play with, and you dont even have to be 5 to play. AI exists, but I haven't really figured them out, and initially i find them to be quite crap as opposed to a player. Another similarity with Guns of Icarus I guess. \n\ntldr; fun co-op game with space exploration and upgradable ship and characters.

I haven't had this much fun playing a co-op game with people online in years.\n\nMy first time trying it  out I was on a small ship with one guy, neither of us having a clue what we were doing but we figured some things out enough to get somewhat comfortable with the basics of a couple of positions. Piloting the ship was straight-forward enough and so was manning the turrets. Time to look for a game with more people.\n\nNext game I hopped in I was the pilot. Whenever I didn't know what to do the captain was kind enough to explain, and things were simple enough to learn. I played and learned with that full crew of 5 for about an hour.\n\nNext game I was the gunner, also very simple to learn if you ever played any games in your life before, and I felt good being an important part of why we made it through fights with drones and other ships.\n\nEngineer took a bit more of friendly people explaining what things did, but I found I didn't always have a lot to do so I continued asking questions so I would have some understanding of science and captain positions.\n\nThe next night I played a game as scientist and the crew had to explain a good number of things to me, but within an hour I had a full understanding of my duties and we played for 5 hours straight.\nThat's right. I played a co-op game with 4 strangers for 5 hours straight.\nWe explored planets, completed missions, applied talent points to improve or characters, collected scrap and upgrades and sold things we found to buy better ship components, and eventually boarded and stole a more powerful enemy ship by sheer planning, strategy, and team work.\n\nI definitely got a strong Star Trek feel from the game, which was very much a good thing in my opinion, and in 2 days I felt like the game by far earned its price of admission, something so many early access games these games never do even up to completion.\n\nThe only downside was that the graphics are pretty dull overall even on highest settings.\n\n9.5/10 for a teamwork based space co-op online game that is still in beta.", "timestamp_created": 1454536168, "timestamp_updated": 1454536168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.885349", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20937374": {"recommendationid": "20937374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085771342", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475492699}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like this game.

The engineer is responsible for making sure the ship's core doesn't over heat, and can turn systems and such off and on to conserve power and keep the temp down. If the core overheats they have to eject the core before it explodes like a mini nuke!

He also plots the course and which quests to go to. The captain is probably one of the most important classes in the game.\nFinally, what i feel about this game! This game is an amazing game to play with a group of friends. The solo experience isn't all that great. The game's art style is done very well and the music is spot on.

This game is a breath of fresh air, this game is exactly what the space Genre needs.  This game has the foundation of possibly the most accessable, but also DEEP space sim games I have played in decades. \n\nI am not going to lie, the game is a bit rough around the edges, the AI, the clunky animations, the tired generic models.  But even this sort of adds to the charm, it gives it a retro quality, and the simplicity of the interfaces make it instantly accessable!\n\nAt first the ugly nature of the graphics can be unsettling. However it all comes together in just the right way so that your imagination, and your interaction with your friends and the universe around you fills in the gaps, and smoothes the edges.  The game strikes the perfect balance of creating a sandbox with stuff to do, but letting your imagination fill in the gaps.  \n\nWe picked a stealthy ship.  Thinking - hey, were newb, lets avoid trouble, and attack only when we have the advantage!  It took us a half hour or so to figure out the controls well enough to go to warp and not blow ourselves up.  \n\nOn the first planet we discovered, We had to wear our space suits to walk around as it was a hot lava planet.  We ran a surface scan, and found 11 life forms.  It took a while but when we found them, it was funny as can be, we had no idea of the aliens would be friendly, or what.  I stood their, pointing my gun at them, asking my engineer for his advice, backing away as these lava slimes appraoched.  they didn't shoot or hurt lava or anything, so I decided to stand my ground. \n\nA split second later I was in agony, my health below 40%!  These aren't friendly aliens at all!  Open fire!\n\nMy engineer dutifully helped me slay all 11 of them, and we went on to explore the rest of the planet and got a few bits of loot for our trouble, including a nice new shield generator. \n\nIn another instance we spawned in and were attacked by an enemy ship, not an easy little drone like we had gotten used to so far, but a full power ship.  Thinking it would be a pushover, we engaged, the jolly roger unfurled!   Within seconds we learned (the hard way) how important the science officers role could be, as our upgraded and powerful shields vanished in the first volley!  We needed to modulate the shields and hit em with programs!\n\nOur ship was on fire!  And so my engineer friend dropped what he was doing and put out the fires. While I modulated the shields and tried to figure out what programs would help.  Whatever I Was doing it helped, the enemy's shots stopped destroying our shields, and our shots started penetrating. \n\nThe battle was white knuckle, with our systems overheating and exhausted, we lost main engine power, and sat toe to toe trading blows.  When it was over, we won by the skin of our teeth, our ship was below 20% hull, almost no armor left... Our ship was full of holes, and we limped to Sector Zero (the main outpost space station with NPC's you can talk to, to get repairs.  \n\nIt took me a minute to figure out how to drop the shields to get repaired, but it was nice to be fully repaired and ready to go.  Plus we had some missions to do next time we play!\n\nIf you have even the slightest bit of love for the captains chair, science officers station, running the guts of a starship, piloting it, or working the guns,  you owe it to yourself to at least give this game a try.  Return it if you don't like it!  \n\nI simply cannot believe that this game isn't being watched as closely as it should be. \n\nTonight, I jumped in with a friend, he chose engineer, and I of course had to be captain. \n\nFrom the first moments to the last moments, we were laughing, arguing, cursing, sweating, and cheering. \n\nI didn't even mind the lack of a tutorial, figuring out the ship and controls wasn't too steep of a learning curve, indeed, learning to properly configure the AI was the hardest part, and if you play with real people you won't have that issue as much. \n\nI would say this game loses a lot of it's charm if you try to play it solo.  I would say play it with 2 people at a minimum the first time you try it, and one should be captain, and one should be pilot.  The captain should run all the stations, while the pilot pilots.  The captain can functionally operate every station, just not as well.  But it's enough that you can have fun and get things done. \n\nWith a full group, cooperating and having a good attitude, the game is a total utter gem. \n\nI can't wait to see the finished product with all the features complete and a universe full of sandbox content to explore... \n\nTRY THIS GAME!\n", "timestamp_created": 1454238664, "timestamp_updated": 1454238664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498772", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20866559": {"recommendationid": "20866559", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967907615", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507274627}, "language": "english", "review": "Yet another game that gets worse and worse the more it's updated.

I understand if they're trying to please everyone, however there is no need to add just raw content such as more ships, planets, or work on bots (which aren't very sophisticated), as the game is made to be played with people rather than being played single-player. The game is rather about flying around in your ship, and this aspect has barely been touched recently with the exception of the sensor dish. Doing something with the lounge on each ship is, for example, something I'd like to see rather than another planet. Maybe a mini-game can be played there during lulls? Or making rations using resources or food.\n\nNew thoughts:\n-Vastly missing fresh polish of all kinds\n-Some roles need a lot of tweaking and improvement.\n-Missing many \"feel-good\" sounds and noises which help with feedback of actions\n-Some large empty worlds (planets and stations) that you spent too long running from 1 often useless location to another (and losing stamina very quickly)\n-Ugly and outdated U.I., panels/monitors, even star map\n-Combat improvements needed\n-Better writing needed\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW 2016:\n\nAlthough I can't recommend this game in its current state to the general public, still being in Alpha, I very much adore this game. Those who enjoyed playing Artemis, or who love Star Trek and playing Escape Velocity back in the day will similarly enjoy this game even as is. The future looks very bright indeed. My only real critique is the pricing for the current state of the game; it should be lower. Nonetheless, $25 or so for this project will be well worth it down the road. I'm very picky with games but this is something a lot of people will enjoy.\n\nPros:\n-Fun and imaginitive gameplay\n-Star Trek lovers will appreciate for sure\n-Not too complicated, and yet has some depth\n-Good co-op teamwork required\n-Successful implementation of a game type rarely achieved\n-Merges smoothly different genres of gaming together\n\nCons:\n-Still needs more time to develop into a fuller game (it is in Alpha obviously)\n For example: More content, more polish, more sounds, more of well, everything...\n-Could still use more stability (Alpha)\n-Still quite buggy (Alpha)\n-Overpriced for its current state\n-Not enough creativity in terms of ship customization or ship types\n-Still a little clunky with its gameplay mechanic of first person shooter and \"point and click on panels\" (although there is every indicaton that this will improve)\n-Still missing a bit of clarity in terms of what needs to be done by certain classes", "timestamp_created": 1453162679, "timestamp_updated": 1520462486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689030", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20607652": {"recommendationid": "20607652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060801820", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491301129}, "language": "english", "review": "Gets in the game\nExicted\nChooses engineer\nGoes in a random ship\nShipmates tell me to not fuck up\nI fuck up\nI destroy the whole ship\nThey all report me\nI lol\nI leave\nI have dreams of the game\nI love it\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1453134579, "timestamp_updated": 1453134579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477760", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20597287": {"recommendationid": "20597287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082014949", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511364300}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool Co-Op space exploration game!", "timestamp_created": 1453082042, "timestamp_updated": 1453082042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20592672": {"recommendationid": "20592672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127471076", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482346194}, "language": "english", "review": "Was invited by some people to play in their crew because they needed a pilot.

There are space battles, there is boarding, there are away missions, and it is all very fun and addicting; especially if you happen to join a good crew.\n\nFor those worried about early access: the game is very stable, in 27 hours the only hiccup I've had is one disconnect. There are latency issues to be expected if you are in Europe and connecting to a game on the US west coast, but game breaking bugs are almost entirely non-existent. The game's core elements are completely in place and it does not leave you feeling like major aspects of the game are missing.\n\nThere is not currently a very high amount of content in the game. After a few planets and a few battles you will definitely get the sense that you have \"Been there, done that\",  but the rogue-like elements and the ever increasing difficulty of the enemies as your journey goes on will keep you wanting to see what's at the end of your next jump, or whats for sale at the shop over in sector 1751. There are currently a few missions available in the game from NPC's that can give your adventures a sense of purpose, but there is no real story as of the time of this review.\n\nThe price is definitely the biggest drawback to this game. In its current state it feels like something that would fit the $10-$15 price range. That being said: having made the $25 commitment, I have no regrets. If you are an impatient gamer who wants non-stop action this game is probably not for you. It is intense action followed by periods of discussing plans, or debating which piece of gear to buy next, etc...

This game is a wonderful concept, and quite frankly is the game I have been searching for on steam recently, and open-world, first person space sim-them up.

But it is just that, an early access game, and it doesn't quite have enough to warrant that \u00a318.99 price tag. I don't particularly like the art style (personal preference) and would like to see it take a turn to the more realistic side. My point is this:\n- It is an early access game, if you like to bug report and are really hyped for this game, then buy it.\n- If you want to jump into a space sim game in the deep end with no tutorial (at the moment), then buy it.\n- If none of the above apply to you, than wait. This will be an amazing game judging by what I have seen on steam and on the website. What they have planned for this is great. But at the moment, it doesn't have enough of the core mechanics in place. At least not for me. So what I'm doing and I recommend, is waiting until it is at a later build, or when it is fully released and buying it as a full game. It has great potential. Just lakes a few essentials for me at the moment.\n(I know I didn't play much but it was enough for me)\n\nI don't know how many people are working on and developing this. But keep going.

There's The Captain, The Pilot, The Scientist, The Engineer and The Weapons Specialist. So 5 players per session.\n\nIt sits on a very nice spot of \"not hardcore\" and \"not casual\". So you can easily read the compact manual about a certain role, take on a game, and most captains will be really helpful if you're a new player (in my experience). \nFor future reference, the game doesn't seem to be intended to be a hardcore sim.\n\nRegarding content, there's not enough to warrant the current price tag. It really is an Early Access project.\nHowever, there's enough fun stuff to get an idea of what's coming:\n\n[b]General Features[/b]:\n- Crew levels up, which grant talent points that the players can assign to become more efficient. Each role have general and specific traits to pick.\n- Quest system in place that gives good amounts of money, experience and helps slow down 'Chaos' build-up (more about that later).\n- Inventory and Locker system. Different guns are available, and improved tools (+3 Fire Extinguisher, etc). There's also a Scanner that helps to detect enemies and loot on planetside missions. The Captain can access and move items between crew members.\n- Every class has its station. Pilots have the helm, Scientists deal with computer programs and viruses (like heals, buffs and debuffs), scanners, and also have passive area healing, Engineers deal with the power system and warp drive, Weapons Specialist with the main guns, missiles and nuclear devices. Captain have talents that benefit the whole crew, and he'll probably be too busy coordinating missions, routes and checking fuel/components/cargo/equipment/crew request to do anything else - but generally he can do whatever he wants.\n- Captain can add money to a shared crew account (\"allowance\") which crew can use to buy better personal equipment. He can also, of course, withdraw money from there so a new player don't spend the last 12k on a gun that someone already have in their locker.\n- Ship can be upgraded and slightly customized (component-wise, at the moment).\n- There are AI bots if you decide to play singleplayer (or if nobody joins on multiplayer). They are not ideal, but it enables you to learn the game, and they perform well enough on their roles. \n[i]However, as soon as you jump into a good session with a real crew (even on public games), you'll not want to play with AI. I already added around 10 good people in 2 days.[/i]\n- There's a save system, so you can revert if things go badly or if someone griefs you. I believe there are options like an \"Ironman mode\", and probably more difficulty options are planned.\n\n[b]Combat Features[/b]:\n- Space battles that could have catastrophic results if your engineer decides to overheat your ship and eject your core, or if your scientist is drunk and refuses to set the shields properly or activate the Emergency Shields program. \n- You can already board and capture enemy ships, which include bosses that have the best ships and gear on the game. Or you can tell one of your crew members to take a walk in an enemy ship, disable their shields, destroy their Engineering Subsystem and come back.\n- Subsystems can be destroyed and repaired. They can also be set on fire, which can spread around the ship if no one looks at the Ship Status screen.\n\n[b]Exploration Features[/b]:\n- Planets that require the team to beam down and engage different enemies, find loot (including some good finds that might make the whole crew yell in excitement), and have everyone hug the Scientist and his passive healing when evil robots start firing everywhere.\n- Minefields with scrap, different systems with different features, black holes, cool sights.\n\n[b]Chaos[/b]:\nChaos is the difficulty meter of the game. It raises little by little the more you play, and the more \"evil\" things you do.\nIt also raises the speed by which civilized systems become \"Infected\" systems - which are [u]really[/u] difficult to fight in. \n\nThere is something of a plot and NPCs on stations tells you some stories, but everything plot-related is probably planned for a later date.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]:\nPULSAR: Lost Colony can be VERY fun if you play with friends or people that want to go through a game properly.\nIf you enjoy cooperative multiplayer games, and like space games enough to support them early on development, by all means, join up.\nHowever, for most audiences, there's not enough content to warrant a buy at the moment. So, at least, wishlist/follow it!\n\nIf you are really on the fence, I suggest you watch some gameplay videos. I did that, and ended up buying the game.\nSee you in space, probably dying in glorious battle against a Small Drone. :)", "timestamp_created": 1452144451, "timestamp_updated": 1452144605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870454", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20365259": {"recommendationid": "20365259", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978695376", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467678643}, "language": "english", "review": "Go read my other game reviews. \n\nI hate a lot of games.

You start off picking a ship.  After that the host (I think) has to choose Captain out of the 5 classes.  The captain can bring up the map, chart a course through the large and extensive universe.  The ship itself has shields, which protect the hull until the shields take enough damage for the enemy ships to deal damage to your hull, which once the hull reaches zero, your ship explodes and either you reload, or start a new ship.  Each class has a station, or their own in-game computer screen that you stand at.  There are many rooms in the ship, and each of the ship's systems are connected to the 4 main systems.  Science, Engineering, Weapons, Life Support.  Those are the 4 systems you must protect.  If they get damaged enough, a fire starts in the room that you have to put out with extinguishers, then repair the system before the fire starts again.\nThere are missions that you can complete which give you credits and fame.  I spend the credits on replacing ship systems with better ones from repair stations located sparingly throughout the solar system.\nThere are factions.  The infested I have never had the pleasure of meeting but I have heard of them.  Some sort of alien race that create organic or living ships.  There are other neutral or hostile factions I have either not met or have had nothing to do with as of yet.  If you play with a group of friends, you WILL have fun with this game.  Play alone, and it gets rather boring.  The UI could use some work, and more game content would be welcome.  Controller support needs to improve, which it has, but I feel like more customization should be had.  I tried using all the buttons on my xbox 360 controller and I was unable to use the bumpers, which isn't that big a deal.

Heavily in beta after their successful kickstarter the game is coming together with updates every month or so. \n\nAs it stands at the time of writing, the game has very limited content, although the core game is solidly in place. A crew of five work together as they travel the galaxy making credits by destroying enemy starships, running missions and collecting scrap which in turn allows them to keep exploring the impressively huge map and keep their own starship upgraded.\n\nThe interactions between the players are the main selling point of the game and like the crew of the Enterprise or Serenity each member relies on the others for their own success and enjoyment, to a point. While it is entirely possible to play the game solo or with 2-3 good crew members the real fun comes from 5 members with mics who are able to smoothly interact and keep their ship running.\n\nA typical gaming session would follow a fairly similar path. The captain chooses the ships destination, the engineer charges the warp core and can allocate power to the science and engineering sections to speed up this process. Once charged the word can be given to jump the ship into warp. After a few minutes of travel time (which can be handily skipped) the ship exits and the players will usually be greeted with an expansive sector littered with asteroids or space debris, a planetary system or trade outpost.  More often than not an enemy will be present and the captain can give the word to engage. The ship can also be keep in silent running with systems powered down in the hope to pass through undetected or use a computer virus to siphon the enemy ship of credits before jumping away silently.\n\nWhile the weapons specialist fires from the main turret the pilot must keep the ship in firing range and within the turrets arc of fire. \nThe science officer uses his station to disable the enemy's shields and thrusters and can buff his own ship with shield recharges and speed boosts all the while scanning the enemy and relaying any useful information back to the crew. Further more he can alter the shield frequencies for added damage reduction and detect any components that might warrant boarding the enemy ship and stripping it for parts.\nWith all this action taking place the ships main reactor is placed under huge stress causing heat to build up and it's up to the engineer deep in the bowls of the ship (or from the bridge) to regulate which systems deserve more or less power, failure on his part could lead to a devastating core meltdown although that too can be handled with the right amount of teamwork.\n\nOnce the battle is over any scrap and parts can be collected, credits added to the ship's wallet and it's off to the next target or station to repair and look for upgrades.\n\nIt's this part of the game that is solid and although there is more content in the form of missions, planetary exploration and boss fights anyone buying the game in it's current state shouldn't look too far in front of what I've outlined. \n\nI'm eager to see where the developers take the game and with more content being added frequently I'd highly recommend picking it up.", "timestamp_created": 1452020852, "timestamp_updated": 1452020852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20327983": {"recommendationid": "20327983", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963318562", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452341289}, "language": "german", "review": "Eine Negativbewertung hat das Game nicht verdient!

I and 4 of my friends get to man and operate an entire spaceship? Warp to unknown star systems and explore planets? This is phenomenal. I feel like I'm playing FTL in first person, with 4 of my friends. The game has a bit of a learning curve, but it's role based, so you really need reliable crew members. Lots of trial and error. I think the farthest we've gotten was 8 jumps, but our Chaos level was maxed at 6. We were under the impression everything in space was hostile, so we immediately fired on anything. We've read a bit about the Chaos levels, and we've now managed to stay hidden from enemy sensors and we're getting a more accurate read on \"hostile\" entities.\n\nIf Hard Science Fiction is your thing, I highly recommend this game. It tickles every sci-fi nerve I have. It promotes team work, laughter, and a sense of accomplishment when you succeed as a crew. This is my first Leafy Green title I've played, but I can tell (based on their updates to the community) that they genuinely care about this experience, and not just pumping out a half-polished P.O.S. to make a quick buck.\n\nTo the developers: We as consumers see where you are taking this, and we like it.

If you have a good group of gaming buddies it will be a blast.\n\nI can remember getting the Ebon Hawk in KOTOR and enjoyed owning a spaceship.

You get to be a crew member on a ship and perform a role to help the team meet their goals.\n\nWhat really makes it a great game is who you play with.

Almost like a hidden Gem.  The game is always being updated with Bug Fixes.  There have also been a number of updates for Ships/Item additions and modifications (Slow but still there) in which also make for a better experiences.  The game is playable in both Single and Multiplayer but I would recommend playing Multiplayer as that is where most of the action is for this game.  As far as actual gameplay, well who doesn't like taking over a Ship and managing its systems like an actual officer of a ship?  I mean, dude... You can teleport to planet or ship, you can take over other ships during battle and kill the crew, you can explore within your means and you can earn tons of cash, ect while doing it!  Not to mention, the skill system is very well thought out and implimented well.  Now on to the pros and cons...\n\nPro:\n* This game is extremely addictive!!!\n* The teleport system works very well even in battles (Must have shields below certain levels) to teleport to ship.\n* The repair system is extremely realistic (As realistic as you can get with scifi games).\n* Weapons respond well on ships with all stats and ship variations, ect.\n* A.I is ectually aggressive in this game when getting into a dog fight.\n* Accumulation of currency is balanced and can be distributed amongst crew.\n* Crew storage in ships allow sharing of items.\n* Ship systems are well thought out.\n\nI AM SURE I AM MISSING MORE!!! THESE ARE WHAT I CAN THINK OF ATM!\n\nCon:\n* This game is extremely addictive!!!\n* Your ship A.I is kind of dull and or un-engaging with actual systems (I find myself often piloting my ship even though I have a navigation bot hired)\n* Some of the energy drain within ships systems while in combat seems to be overdone and exadurated slighty.\n* It is extremely easy to screw your crew mates over if you do not like them.\n* Most online game servers (I know, personal preference I am not minding at all) others put up require a Microphone in order to play otherwise they will kick players.  I understand that is for easier communication in game while dog fighting.\n* Sometimes the ships are very confusing to navigate when you first board the ships and probably should have slightly more direction to where things are at (I know, there are signs)\n\nOtherwise, this is a very solid game for it still being Early Access and still under heavy development. I am very impressed with this game and would recommend it to anyone who is a Scifi and Ship enthusiast or even just a player wanting a good Co-Op Game.", "timestamp_created": 1450932102, "timestamp_updated": 1464271142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19868039": {"recommendationid": "19868039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063042264", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494095453}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the true Co-op experience!", "timestamp_created": 1450865567, "timestamp_updated": 1450865567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19865511": {"recommendationid": "19865511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200490299", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469006694}, "language": "english", "review": "sooooo much fun best for role playing i would say u need good mates to play with! and the AI are hard as sh!t so get ready to fail but it makes it good at the same time hahah", "timestamp_created": 1450857990, "timestamp_updated": 1450857990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19852694": {"recommendationid": "19852694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131018298", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450799058}, "language": "english", "review": "good game with very fun roleplay capability. would not recommend to mac users due to low frame-rate and instability but for Windows users this is a great game for you guys!", "timestamp_created": 1450820626, "timestamp_updated": 1450820626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19839070": {"recommendationid": "19839070", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991063128", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514609310}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun co-op game!

Same went for other people, they were reclutant at first but later, especially while in combat, the voice chat resembled what you can hear in any kind of movie or game involving spaceship fights.\n\nThe game could use some polishing here and there, and of course more content, but overall it's really good. Even better if you ever dreamed to play as a part of spaceship crew.\n\nPros : \n-Immersion.\n-Every station is straight-forward, you can get a grasp of your role really quickly.\n-Every screen is interactive, and you perform your tasks through them - it increases the immersion further.\n\nCons : \n-The animations feel... clunky at times.

I see a lot of potential in this game. As-is, in early access release, there are some quirks, and have even had my server crash while playing with some pals. But, despite that, I'd still recommend playing this game. I was so excited by the initial play that I went out, and bought copies for buddies to get them on-board. \n\nNot meaning to steal thunder from this game, it does remind me of a slightly different variation on \"Artemis - Bridge Simulator\". Different game styles, as Artemis is designed for the group to be in the same room, and the console is the console of the bridge, rather than you controlling an avatar operating a console, the spirit of the game is the same. A grand social design to get players working together towards operating the same ship, with well defined roles.\n\nGranted, there are some things still not working in the game yet, and some odd ball quirks for getting around the galaxy, such as the missing waypoints when the captain issues orders by the starmap, it's very easily overcome. I don't mind asking for each sector to be the next jump alignment to get us going. It gives the captain a little more to do when there isn't fights, and fires, and away team missions.\n\nIn the end, this is a seriously fantastic game for those who want to work cooperatively with a group in control of their respective components of a ship. Very well done. \n\nDear dev's, PLEASE keep the work going on this.

We came underattack by many security drones who engaged us on site. They were easy prey and yielded much needed scrap that eventually sold. The crew seemed pleased. No troubles here\n\nDay 5 Cpatians Log: \nWe found a planet. It appears to be a molten planet inhabited by strange Lava creatures. I gave the order to exterminate them. No creature like that can ever be useful, or friendly. Of course, I would have sent a larger exploration force to the planet had I known there were lifeforms on the surface, but my science officer a man by the name of SCIBOT was more interested in the strange alien pumpkin that resides on the bridge than any of his duties. As soon as we dock at the nearest station He Fired. \nAs for my Engineering officer he seems more focused exploring the vast expanse of the galaxy, or finding enemies to kill than manning his post twice now we nearly had to jettison the core due to overheating. And for the life of me i dont understand how he cant keep our engines online in a fight. \nMy Tactical Officer doesnt want to use her missles and is often times facing the worng direction when we come into a fight. I swear this cannot be the same person i hired 4 days ago. Had i the techincal know how to operate the main cannon i would. I am also beginng to suspect her of an Atrium Healing pad addicition. Perhaps i could replace her and make her the new science officer she cant be any worse than SCIBOT. \nMy pilot has to be the only truely competant member of my crew he's always at his post. He's always vigilant and always ready to react to any situation. \n\nDay 5 Chief Engineers Log: \nHow did i get here? Everything was perfect when I first signed up for this gig, but now its all gone to hell. That Science Officer is worthless. I mean sure he knows his craft, but the guy is more interested in those damend pumpkins all over the ship thna he is with anything else. I'm pretty sure the Captain is going to shoot him pretty soon. Oh and the Captain is a moron. If you push the ship too hard your going to risk a core meltdown. But noooo, every fight he has to have all systems at max power and the ship at full burn FLank speed. Any first year officer would know that with running a ship like that you're going to run a core overheat. Our weapons officer is kinda flakey too I think she just fires the main cannon to watch the pretty light more times than not I jumped on a turret just to kill the enemy. Anyway I should probably get back to fixing the engines. I almost forgot about them. \n\nDay 5 Tactical Officers Log: \nWow I've never been on a real spaceship before. Everyone here is super cool and really nice. I mean the Captian can get yelly sometimes, but he means the best. We must be like the best at our jobs because we keep getting in fights and winning.

Took 10-15 minutes explaining things around the ship, and then my role in particular(Tactical). I knew some of it from watching Youtube, but I wanted to see how things were. We were already in space, and apparently our first goal was to board and take over the enemy ship. It was a rough battle, having to respawn multiple times before I realize we had taken out life support on the other ship, meaning there was no Oxygen...So after donning an environmental suit, I went over, neutralized the remaining crew and we took over the much more impressive ship.\n\nOur next few warps brought us to a derelict ship, layered with mines. After clearing the field with our turrets, scrap was ours for the gathering. We then stopped off at a space port. We repaired, sold our scrap and headed back off.

A difficult co-op sci-fi FTL-like FPS. Fast forward a while and this game pops out of nowhere. I played the game on my own with bots and had a fun time, but I was waiting to write a review until I'd played the multiplayer with friends, since the game IS all about cooperation and teamwork and that bullocks.\nWhen I eventually did play with a friend, we had so much fun getting blown up or turned into swiss cheese by enemy crews. What's even better is that that was before we even discovered you could explore planets!\n\n-PROS-\n-A completely cooperative game, no competitive modes. This might be a con for some people, I don't mind it though.\n-A vast, dangerous galaxy to explore with six different factions (Not including the Infection)\n-Missions, albeit not randomly generated ones, that can sometimes end up being more of an adventure than you originally expected.\n-Procedurally generated planets with different hazards, such as an acidic atmosphere, or a lack of oxygen.\n-Multiple ships to choose from with different interiors, layouts, and specs.\n\n-CONS-\n-The planets are sometimes disappointingly small, and can be glitchy. It IS early access however, so what did you expect?\n-It isn't exactly overflowing with content. It is still VERY entertaining, even if you're only playing with one other person, so it makes up for it.\n-While I don't mind the clean, almost cell shaded look of the equipment and ships-- Infact I think some of the planets I've seen have even made me go \"That's really pretty!\"-- But the people look hideous. They're like tall, chubby space-dwarves.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this game if you have friends, and even if you don't. You're missing out if you don't at least play on a public game. Careful though, I hear there's the rare troll that comes around and screws you and your crew over.\n\n-Things I, and many other people, would like to see in the future-\n-Diplomacy! I'm sure they already have this planned in the future, what with the inclusion of a comms tab, but it still needs to be said (For the billionth time). Perhaps even a special talent for the captain that gives a bonus to diplomacy checks?\n-Larger ships. More vessels like the very popular Roland. Large and spacey, yet somewhat homely.\n-More of a variety of alien lifeforms. Fun things that can pose an actual threat in the long run, something like the creatures in the Thing, or some sort of Xenomorph-like alien parasite (If you've played the game, you thought about that at least once while holding a scanner).\n-Higher 'Level' planets.

Pilot, Gunner, Scientist, Engineer and Captain. Each role requires a certain degree of competence, co-oporation and communiucation (The three big C's essentiually) Without these, you're pretty much doomed.\n\nSo you operate your ship performing your designated role. I won't go into detail about the roles because fuck that. You jump from sector to sector in a procedural map which, with every jump and action performed, can change in regards to political alignment. Therefore a friendly sector may invariably be hostile as you're playing.\n\nOne thing which really does stand out with this game really is the ship to ship battles. The standard set up is you fire weapons at each other and hope they die and you live. Pretty standard. However, there's so much more going on than that. Your scientist is busy keeping you afloat uploading shield boosters, while sending ship crippling computer viruses to the enemy ship (if your ship so has) and protecting your own from hostile ones. The engineer is dashing around keeping your power levels sustainable and preventing the core from exploding. All the while the pilot is trying to get you the hell out of there if you're outmatched. \nWhile this is happening,, you've got the possibility for the opposing ships crew to teleport onto your ship. You're not safe on your comfortable ship. In return, you can board the enemy ship and with skill you can claim it for your own, these ships generally being better than the starting ships.\n\nThere's a lot to this game that I just can't be bothered to detail, but suffice to say it's got great potential.

The game mechanics are such that the different roles one can assume really rely on eachother, but there are some things that could be improved in that department.\n\nThe sound effects are good, but again, in my opinion not as important as the game mechanics and the roles people fill with their characters.\n\nThere are still some bugs, and most environments tend to become a little dull after a while, but that's all work in progress.

The Pilot role for instance doesn't seem as important at times, and the available options for the other roles also seem a bit limited and could do with some expansion.\n\nWith the addition of in-game voicechat (which to be honest, I haven't tested yet myself, but I will later tonight) I think this game and its developers are going in the right direction, and I have high hopes for this title.\n\nIt is already well worth its price, well executed and incredibly addictive to play.

The developers are true gamers, they seemed to add in everything you could of ever wanted to a co-op space sim. It is still early but the game shows a huge amount of promise.  Dont go in expecting next generation graphics like ARK or flawless AI, go in looking for something orginal and well thought out.  \n\nPros: \nUnique play style.  Nothing really like this out there\nEveryone has a job to do.\nIt really is epic.  They have a cool piloting mode that lets you fly the ship with wasd and the mouse. You just have to experience it.\nQuest...check.  Huge random open world...check.   RPG elements...check.  Random encouters...check.  Ship to ship combat...check.  Board enemy ships or get boarded...check.  Beam down to planets...check.  Fly in wrecked stations for loot...check. \n\nCons:\nAI helpers are ok at best.  They pilot like crap and barely do anything more than take fire when you are boarded.  The developers are working on that.\nCharacter graphics are just plain bad.  Doesn't really bother me but some people might have a problem.  It is about game play and it is in beta.\nYou need friends.  Get on reddit or look at forums plenty of people out there who want to fly if you dont have any buds.\nWood panels on the floors in spaceships.  Dont know how I feel about that.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nPulsar brings a lot to the table and in a very early version is more than playable for many many hours.

game highly recommended. Really intruiging.\n\nPros:\nRoleplaying is actually fun... You feel a sense of comraderie exploring new planets and going through things together.\nSmall communication like this:\n\"\nCaptain: Align the ship, pilot.\nPilot: Aye aye, captain.\nCaptain: Prepare to warp, engineer.\nEngineer: Warp ready, sir.\nCaptain\" Warp now.\n\"\n\nMultiplayer\nFun concept\nUpgrades\nBoarding\nPlanets\nReally cool idea... Imagine if they had this format for star-citizen...\n\nCons:\nIn development\nBugs - Mouse\nLack of content, but enough to pay to support the game\nGraphics... The graphics don't matter to me that much, but it would be nice if it looked shinier... Probably due to the unity 3D engine\nPerformance\n\nOverall, one of the few games I've played in a long time that I was excited to play when I got home. I think the real spark of this game is exploring. Not only exploring, but exploring TOGETHER, with your YOUR CREW. Build upon this, and there won't be any other game out there like it. Sure you have artemis, but this game executed much better.\n\n\nFin\n", "timestamp_created": 1444728768, "timestamp_updated": 1444728768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18452650": {"recommendationid": "18452650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054179405", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518849030}, "language": "english", "review": "Be a greenshirt: \"DAMN IT CAPTAIN I TOLD YOU THE PLANET HAD AN ACIDIC ATMOSPHERE!\"\nBe a redshirt: \"DAMN IT CAPTAIN WE LEFT OUR NUKES ON THE OTHER SHIP!\"\nBe a whiteshirt: \"DAMN IT CAPTAIN THIS THING HANDLES LIKE A PREGNANT YAK!\"\nBe a orangeshirt: \"Uhh guys!

Ahora mismo es de los pocos juegos indie ke de verdad capta el concepto de colaboracion entre jugadores.\nlo puedes jugar en solitario si es tu deseo ,pero esta programado y dise\u00f1ado para jugar en ekipo.\n en mi caso, la primera toma de contacto, jugando 2 jugadores y haciendo pruebas y aprendiendo nos hemos pegado 5 horas. al terminar la sesion teniamos esa sensacion extra\u00f1a de haber pegado un salto en el tiempo. clara se\u00f1al de ke el juego ya de inicio es entretenido y divertido. acto seguido hemos probado cooperando 3 jugadores; mas divertido aun. cada uno asumiendo su rol con sus funciones especificas. el fallo de uno es el fracaso de todos. \n resumiendo: jugabilidad epica por momentos.\n\n Sobre el tema grafico voy a comentar poco. cumple sobradamente y recordemos ke no es una megaproduccion AAA.\ninfo de interes:\n -no es un pvp. solo es coop hasta 5 players.\n -puedes jugar solo pero no lo vas a disfrutar como en cooperativo.\n -el mapa de la galaxia actual es \"procedural\" aunke las misiones ke te asignan no lo son.\n -puedes abordar naves enemigas y tambien te pueden abordar a ti.\n -sistemas de navegacion y gestion profundos pero de facil aprendizaje.\n -ser coherente con tu rol. es decir, si eres el ingeniero seras un torpe pilotando la nave.\n\nno comento mas por ke seria demasiado tocho pero si te gusta el rollito \"star trek\", te gusto \"FTL\" y te encantan los juegos donde de verdad colaboras con tus compa\u00f1eros, aki tienes diversion para un buen rato.", "timestamp_created": 1444717742, "timestamp_updated": 1444717742, "voted_up": true,

To retrieve lost medical supplies, save scientists and possibly encounter hostile space vessels. \n\nThis is Pulsar, a game about adventures in space, where the game is buggy (read: indev alpha) but updates are plenty, and features more fulfilling than any game that you will find in this specific category of coop star-(word) film simulator. \n\nIt's got an unexplainable charm of how close it mimics the star-(worded) films, it's not an exact copy of a specific one and it doesn't intend to be, but the exploration feels like star-trek TNG to me (small crew and warp drives).

Scientists have the most utility aside from the captain.\n\nThe engineer, an expert in duct-tape usage and juggling, must allocate the ship's power at its best or worse conditions, or we all explode and die.\n\nAnd the pilot, must dodge missiles, maneuver to mitigate damage in combat, belly up = bad, belly down = good.\n\nBest experienced with VOIP, intoxicants, video recording program, and popcorn.", "timestamp_created": 1444589338, "timestamp_updated": 1444589886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18428418": {"recommendationid": "18428418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116410732", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497437387}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0428\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440, 10 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u043f \u043f\u0440\u044b\u0436\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1444572450, "timestamp_updated": 1444572450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18421003": {"recommendationid": "18421003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096350660", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459390128}, "language": "english", "review": "this is one of the best space games todate", "timestamp_created": 1444528935, "timestamp_updated": 1444528935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18415804": {"recommendationid": "18415804", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976515384", "num_games_owned": 981, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 1124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444528593}, "language": "english", "review": "If you don't mind losing hours of your life then get this game!

The whole idea and concept is honest just a dream game if you want to be running LANs or just want a good game for you and the buds!\nThe basic idea is this, You and your friends are in charge of running a spaceship, so you'll need a pilot, a weapon specialist, a scientist, an engineer and of course, a captain. then you just go exploring the depths of space! completing missions and the like!\n\nPROS:\nDecent multiplayer! didn't have much trouble connecting, making a server, and the server lag wasn't ever a problem.\nGameplay seems solid! the controls and weapons all seem to function well! the weapons aren't too exciting yet though.\nPilot and run your own spaceship with your friends! This all works awesome! the piloting controls, and the whole UI is great if you are changing things in the menus and various panels found throughout your craft.\nJobs are actually fun! the jobs are surprising all filled with interesting things to do at almost every moment of gameplay, no real down time or dull moments for anyone! though admittedly, Pilot and Engineer have the most to do, and the most responsibility.\nGo to planets! You can actually go to a variety of planets and fight monsters, aliens, robots or the general populace for the loot found about the place!\nYou can level up and upgrade your character! You can actually pick from a decent selection of perks that improve your job efficiency, and get a variety of armours and weapons along the way!\n\nCONS:\nShooting isn't so great yet: With the exception of spaceship shooting, the FPS gameplay is weak, but functional. with work, this will be much better in time I imagine!\nPlanets can be dull: Some planets can be strange, or seem very.... glitchy. This part definitely feels the most unpolished, but I'm confident it will improve with time.\nNavigation can be awkward: Too often we got a mission at a such-n-such location, and we had no clue how to get there. I think some work needs to be done in this area.\nProgression is Minimal: The character progression is fine, but the ship progression seems non-existent. to my knowledge, you cannot upgrade your ship to another ship, merely attach upgrades to certain parts of the ship. This is all well and good, but once you start making coin, it would be cool to be able to buy a new spacecraft to use in game.\n \nTHINGS THEY SHOULD INCLUDE IN THIS (AWESOME) GAME\n-Campaign Mode: A full story to experience with your friends spanning a good 6 hours or so! with firefights, exploration, science stuff, and diplomacy! I would love that kind of experience, making the tough decisions as captain, putting controversial decisions to a vote for your crew, or possibly facing Reaper-ish foes! It would be fantastic!\n-Custom-Made Missions: This would fit into the campaign side of things, but A mission builder type of system would be awesome! You could make entire missions or campaigns to then play with friends or share online, with the option of including voiced dialogue and tree-style story elements!\n-Launchable Starfighters: It would be awesome if in the event of a large battle, a launchable craft could be made available to aid the mothership in violent incursions! This could also open the door to additional exploration options!\n\n\nIn closing, this game is freaking great! It is missing a little shine and polish, but is very reminiscent of the \"Mount and Blade\" series, which is definitely a good thing! just add a bit more scope, and some more cool doo-dads here and there, we have a true classic!", "timestamp_created": 1444286314, "timestamp_updated": 1444286314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18378126": {"recommendationid": "18378126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130823013", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480873898}, "language": "english", "review": "idea is amazing, cant wait to see more....", "timestamp_created": 1444275705, "timestamp_updated": 1444275705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18375299": {"recommendationid": "18375299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030393177", "num_games_owned": 774, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444394293}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never really written a review but this game really deserves one. (I hope it doesn't suck)\n\nI bought this game last night and jumped on to captain my first ship! I was really excited hadn't done any research on anything just jumped straight in, As a warning this game has no tutorial [Yet]. \nWithin the first 20 minutes I had a full crew. We all jumped on teamspeak and I meet a couple of great guys that I could enjoy this game with.\nWe were excited and ready to go! We warped we Landed, we died. Very quickly. In fact this happened several times. We weren't annoyed at our death, we talked to each other about what went wrong and what we could do to improve. We got excited to get out and kick some ass  (Finally). By the time we started to win the action heated quickly and we where all having a blast. Each role has their own tasks and they're very interesting and require intricate cooperation so you don't die a horrible fiery death. Within the first few hours of playing we'd explored planets, completed missions and killed lots of bad guys (Without dying!!!). We upgraded our ship, shields, Core, Guns, engines everything. The upgrading of the ships is unreal and one of my favourite things to do as captain. After the 4 hour mark the games difficulty started to sky rocket, we could barely kill anyone, we where getting wrecked almost every time. At this point the science guy was finally able to start his role. Running programs to keep us alive and to stop the enemy ship from moving and or keeping  shields running. We finally started to do well again and then, they attacked. the enemy bored our ship and killed us from within!!! So now we have to run a ship and fend of pirates, shit yeah! We also discovered we could do this, send on two crew to get inside and shut down their reactor bail and kill them with ease. This is the limit of what I've done so far, so I'll go on to points about good and bad.\n\nPros: To sum everything up nicely.\n- Pulsar is very cooperative, in fact working as a team is REQUIRED! Makes every player feel needed even if they're not blowing shit up.\n- Pulsar has one of the best atmospheres ever. Sounds, shacking and lighting. It really sucks you into the action even though you're in a dark room with no windows, You know when you've been shot and you're in an epic space battle!!!\n-  Ship upgrades add more depth and keep in interesting.\n\nCons: Please note this is a beta (Early Access review)\n- The balancing needs work. The game is either too hard or too easy.\n- Content, Yes I've played this game for 8 hours and I'm not bored. But this game needs some content, more ships, more exploration and more missions! We've done all the missions and making credits is getting harder...\n- First person content, is fast paced and exciting. But is currently VERY limited and feels bland compared to space combat.\n- An enemies feel and move like robots.\n\nSome idea I had, thought I could share.\n- Further ship upgrades, Shield resistance modifiers. Science already has one, but upgrades for that would be sweet.\n- Drones! Little tiny helper ships of death, win/win if you ask me.\nHull Breach, You're standing in a room that has hole and got sucked into space, too bad. Not only would it be epic but it would make the room useless. increasing difficulty.\n- Bombarding planets. You have big space guns? Why not take out enemies on the ground.\n- Capturing enemy ships for parts. It should be harder to capture a ship, but the rewards should be greater too.\n- More differences in ships, I should be able to have 10 guns on my ship! on 2 on my other ship. Or more main guns etc. OR even missile boats. So just missiles with bonuses to storage ect.\n- Tractor beam, to get items from a distance.\n- EVA, I should be able to go out of my ship in space to conduct repairs and attack the enemy head on!\n- Upgrade to computers to include a library of viruses. You could load and unload programs, You keep the current max, But you can swap them out in battle to change your load out. It would need to have a load time like, It will take 2 minutes to transfer this program or something.\n- Crew needing sleep and food, More RP like game play?\n\nI think this sums it up nicely, Hope I make sense. This game has a bright future ahead. I won't say buy it now, But I've definitely felt like it was money well spent!\n\nKeep up the work devs!

I was quite disappointed when the developers of Star Trek Online said they'd cut multi-crewed ships from the feature list...thankfully Pulsar: Lost Colony delivers where STO dropped the ball. \n\nThe developers at Leafy Games have figured out *exactly* the game I've always wanted to play: Star Trek meets Artemis meets FTL meets Skyrim in space. The sheer amount of detail they've squeezed into this (still work-in-progress) game is pretty astonishing. For example, in a recent nail-biter space battle I cut power to most of the ship's systems to help our reactor to cool down. After we miraculously survived, we noticed our graphics had all gone grayscale...I'd forgotten to restore power to life support and we were slowly suffocating. :) This game is full of little touches like that.\n\nDon't let the simple graphics fool you, there's real depth in this gameplay. When I play, I feel I'm living a Star Trek episode. When things go pear-shaped in a battle (such as having to deal with a ship overheat AND boarders beaming in), it can get extremely exciting.\n\nWhile this game isn't finished, what's there is really fun. It lacks a tutorial but there is an in-game manual which you can also find on the company's website. If you don't mind figuring stuff out and you have a couple friends on TeamSpeak, I think you will have a lot of fun playing Pulsar: Lost Colony.", "timestamp_created": 1443993582, "timestamp_updated": 1463668618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18332661": {"recommendationid": "18332661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075189228", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494123100}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me Make thit clear.

It boldly goes where no game has gone before: it places you in a crew of 5 other players each having their own responsibilities and when the crew works together you can accomplish almost anything.   That gives you a great sense of achievement both technically and socially that I haven't seen in any other game.  \n\nCommunication is key so if your the silent type, it's probably not for you.  You HAVE to be engaged with your crew because the ships you crew simply won't function well without it.  \n\nThe payoff is huge, you really feel like a member of a starship.  Another fantastic element is roleplay and gameplay are one and the same.  Your captain is your leader and speaking to him in true roleplay talk or just plain talk really makes no difference because it's really all the same thing.\n\nThere's a lot to learn in this game, but not overwhelming.  There's even a manual in the options menu if you need to read up on something.  Most of the game revolves around hanging with your crew as you visit planets and do away missions or space battles where you must fill a role whether it be piloting, managing the power systems, scanning for lifeforms, manning a turret, or what not. \n\nGraphics as some have said, are not best of the best, but hardly bad actually I think they are very, very nice with plenty of fancy surface and lighting details.\n\nThe music has nothing on games like FTL, but again it is very good for it's purpose, and I suspect they will expand the soundtrack a lot more in the future.\n\nThe community is mostly great.  There are some greifers here and there, I find it's best to say hello when you join is a good way to know what kind of people you are going to play with.\n\nIt is still early access, but the devs are very active so lots of content pours in frequently.\n\nBeing EA, the planets you can visit are a bit limited in that you will find yourself visiting the same areas frequently until they add more locations.  However the galaxy map is huge and generated new in every new game and some things such as loot and enemies and backgrounds are generated differently with each planet, plus there's no limit to how many new planets the devs can create.  There's really no limit to the vast amount of possibilities this game has going for it.\n\nThe community is a bit small right now but there's never a shortage of games you can find to join, just make sure to warm up to the captain for best results. (He is the only one that can kick players)\n\nPrice is a bit high for EA, but it is a fully multiplayer game and the base game is already very solid.\n\nOverall this game is really the experience I've been looking for for a long time: a game where you team up as a crew of players and have endless adventures aboard a totally huge randomly generated galaxy.\n\n8.9/10 EA score,  10/10 if they get everything right in the official release.", "timestamp_created": 1443413265, "timestamp_updated": 1443415134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491559", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18227899": {"recommendationid": "18227899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023694898", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443384129}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is on the right track, trying to capture the experience of being at the helm as a Captain or one of the other 4 roles (engineer, weapons officer, scientist, pilot) however I feel it came out half-baked and that the devs should have waited a bit longer.\n\nBefore I begin, take note that I do not care if your game is early access, alpha, beta, testing phase. As soon as you open the door to recieve money, you are gonna get reviewed properly, no cookie points for releasing unfinished games! This has become bad practice...\n\nI will start with what I feel was \"the bad\" in my opinion:\n\n- The game's single player doesn't really exist. (AI is too troublesome to micro manage) Joining other players with random people invites alot of trolling and incompetant Captains.\n- The AI is awful and has odd behaviors, for example, teleporting in combat, unable to perform duties properly when set,\nget stuck all over the place in the ship if they do try to move around in a fight.\n- The first person shooter portion is bad, hit boxes  are small, don't try to go for limbs or headshots, keep all shots in the center of the target. (otherwise just very basic point and click)\n- Game already has people cheating, joined one with a Captain who was giving himself credits to buy the best upgrades.\n\n\"The good\" luckily, is REALLY good and is keeping this game afloat and on people's radar.\n\n- Playing this game with friends on Comms is very rewarding, especially if you roleplay it out a bit.\n- This is a niche game and will shine a light on a genre that has alot of potential to be done right\n- The ship's are the star of this show with tons of functionality! Controlling power to weapons, shields, and various departments, all while controlling your coolant to keep your core under control, issuing orders to your crew or blasting the enemy with your all powerful main cannons and even nukes!\n- Ability to board and sabotage the enemy vessels from the inside and take over the ship for your own.\n- Going planetside to explore and complete various missions (all though the planets need alot of work, but it does help to have them rather then not have them at all).\n\nMy score: 6 / 10 - Recommended, however I would wait for a sale or really think about who you can play this with. You can get your moneys worth if you got friends who are really into it and might play it for a week or so, then patiently see if the devs are gonna add more.\n\nJust like many early access games, this has ALOT of potential, however I find myself saying that alot, only to be disapointed, so I hope this game can pull it together and make something truely authentic to its genre! Hope this helps you with your decision! I made a video below for my review if you want to see more! \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdaNXJyzERM\n\nThings I hope to see:\n- custom things to add around the ship and interact with (they have stoves, lockers, beds, lights)\n- The devs already expressed no PvP content, but I still have my hopes they reconsider.\n- Better random encounters, all AI just wanna fight you.\n- Something to roleplay out a interaction with enemy pirates, a screen to pull up and hail each other would be EPIC.", "timestamp_created": 1443389180, "timestamp_updated": 1443389180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18227408": {"recommendationid": "18227408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059887955", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498195112}, "language": "english", "review": "A true cooperative game !

Another early access.\n\nPeople have described this by using references to other games, but I think that's unfair. It is a game in it's own right, I'll try to explain what it's about. If anything, playing this game feels like watching episodes of Star trek TOS and those types of references are readily used by players. Be my redshirt for a day.\n\nYou play as one out of five crewmen, each have their own class with unique talents (skills) that can be leveled up. The crew share level, which is a nice feature and works well for this co op game. You start of with an under powered ship, warp around to different sectors to engage enemies, navigate minefields, send away teams to planets and just do that whole trek thing. You can also get missions from NPC's on outposts.\n\nSo, if you like these things, maybe this is for you. I say maybe, because we are currently at beta 3 and the game is severily lacking in game content: the planets have very limited areas, model animations are missing, loads of enemies and locations missing and so on. There's not a whole lot to do yet.\n\nThat said, I like the premise and the game mechanics presented so far. The development team, although small, find the time to reply to forum posts (even on Steam!), fix issues and consider suggestions. If AAA-studios had HALF the customer service these guys do the gaming industry would be SO much better. If you are tired of buying early access games that are broken, has no dev communication and take forever to get updates, you might actually find that Leafy games is a fresh breath of air.\n\nIt's Unity 5, so it works pretty well on Linux. There are some optimization issues, but this early in development one cannot expect optimized graphics. In spite of being part of the Unity ghetto, Leafy games showcases that Unity games doesn't have to be unstable, GPU slaughtering beasts of C# nonsense. In particular on the Linuxes!\n\nEDIT: there is one feature missing that everyone has been talking about, it is also probably the hardest thing to do. Right now it has network multiplayer, but only for up to 5 people of the crew and only one player ship per server.

Das ist Immersion, Rollenspiel und Teamspiel in einer hervorragenden Kombination.\nSowas wie ein Artemis Space Sim (Ein Raumschiff-Br\u00fccken-Simulator) aber sehr viel virtueller in einem persistenten RPG Universum.\n\nDas eigene Schiff sowie Stationen und Areale auf Planeten \u00fcberirdisch wie unterirdisch samt Geb\u00e4uden k\u00f6nnen frei erkundet werden. Im Weltraum kann die Galaxie per Schiff frei durchreist werden. Es ist sehr abwechslungsreich gestaltet.\n\nEs gibt Fraktionen, Mission und Shops. Man kann sich und sein Schiff per Skills-System, Player-Items und Schiffskomponenten verbessern. F\u00fcnf Spieler-Klassen (Person oder Bot) bedienen zusammen ein Schiff.\nAls Pilot das Schiff zu fliegen ist auch per Joystick mit voller HOTAS Unterst\u00fctzung m\u00f6glich. Dann das Schiff ausrichten, vom Ingenieur das Warp-Triebwerk laden lassen und frei durch die Galaxie d\u00fcsen. Sehr gut umgesetzt und frei von Ladesequenzen. \n\nUm schneller durch die Galaxie zu kommen gibt es Sprungtore samt Anwahl- und Achsausrichtung-Sequenz die dann auch frei zu durchreisen sind. Auf Planeten wie auch Stationen wird sich per Transporter gebeamt (Vorsicht EVA-Suit nicht vergessen, je nach Klima). Auf der Oberfl\u00e4che von Planeten gibt es Orte mit neuen Items aus Missionen oder frei zu entdecken und hin und wieder auch mit feindlichen Wesen und Robotern. Wenn man gerade keinen EVA-Suit tr\u00e4gt kann per doppelt Leer-Taste tippen und halten ein Jet-pack aktiviert werden. :)\n\nDas bereisen des Weltraums ist dann das Raumschiff-Br\u00fccken-Simulator Element in diesem Spiel.\nEs gibt f\u00fcnf Stationen im Schiff zu besetzen und es wird dann, wie auch wie bei allen Trekkies und Trekkern bekannt, durch eine Br\u00fccken-Crew ein Raumschiff kontrolliert gesteuert, gewartet und verteidigt. Auch die Gesch\u00fctze des Schiffes k\u00f6nnen bemannt werden.\n\nIm Raumkampf kann es durchaus passieren das man geentert wird. Gleiches gilt im Gegenzug f\u00fcr einen Selbst auch sodass man sich hierdurch sogar ein neues Schiff beschaffen kann. Hilft vor allem dann wenn das eigene Schiff gerade vor dem Kern-Bruch steht.\n\nEs gibt jetzt schon so viel Inhalt und Potenzial davon lie\u00dfen sich noch Seiten f\u00fcllen, deshalb mein Fazit:\n\nDaf\u00fcr dass das Spiel noch Early-Access / Beta ist, l\u00e4uft es sehr stabil und zuverl\u00e4ssig bei mir auf Linux.\nDas was bisher schon an Inhalt und Funktionalit\u00e4t im Spiel implementiert ist l\u00e4sst hoffen dass das finale Spiel seinen Weg beibeh\u00e4lt. Alle diese Elemente und RPG-Funktionen zur Interaktion mit dem Schiff und mit NPCs an den verschiedenen Orten ben\u00f6tigen noch ein wenig mehr Tiefgang. Aber das Gameplay ist jetzt schon Ph\u00e4nomenal und macht auch mit Freunden im Voice-Chat eine menge Spa\u00df! Zu empfehlen sind auch die Anleitungen auf der Webseite des Spiels selbst!\n\nSch\u00f6n ist auch das Multiplayer Konzept sodass frei im Singleplayer gespielt werden kann \u2013 das sich aber jederzeit w\u00e4hrend des Spiels aufheben l\u00e4sst und andere Spieler per Password oder komplett Public herein zu lassen.\n\nIch finde das Spiel ist bisher eine gelungene Umsetzung und l\u00e4sst in der finalen Version auf einen guten Abschluss hoffen.\nDiese Kombination von Spiel-Elementen ist in dieser Form bisher einzigartig und vereint viele Elemente anderer Weltraumspiele hervorragen in sich.", "timestamp_created": 1443280339, "timestamp_updated": 1443723036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.729207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18203612": {"recommendationid": "18203612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181593255", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507300273}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game through the offical website with a steam key before it came out on steam and i can tell you that it is a fun game when you are playing with a full crew of friends, exploring planets and getting a fleet of 4 ships with your friends and having a blast of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1443279248, "timestamp_updated": 1443279248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18203397": {"recommendationid": "18203397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164669408", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489232364}, "language": "danish", "review": "hvorn\u00e5r kommer der nye opdateringer til spillet ?", "timestamp_created": 1443278378, "timestamp_updated": 1443278378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18195288": {"recommendationid": "18195288", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987200221", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464138034}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely still incomplete, but this game has great potential.

It had all the good stuff! Space exploration, space ships, space battles, space ants/spiders/robots, and it had space itself. I started playing it, and I just couldn't stop. Started out joining a random game where someone taught me all the basics. And hell, there are a lot of basics! Learning the game is pretty overwhelming at first. Untill you have played all 4 support roles it is hard to be the captain. \n\nThus, the day after the basics I decided to dedicate my day comandeering the U.S.S. Flying dutchman. I found some people, put them on a teamspeak and we played for about 8 hours straight. The experience was amazing! I lead us to planets, bandits, dronespaceships, and all there is to do. Everyone was immersed in their role, and achieving the goals I set for them. The one main problem we found out though was this. \nAfter 8 hours of playing the game, we had seen it all. We had beaten both bosses, seen the infected ( which you cant actually kill yet.), been to all exotic shops, upgraded all the gear on the ship untill there was no proper match for us anymore. It was lacking content, but I kept longing for more. \n\nTl;Dr?\n\nPro's: \n-Awesome gameplay. You are free to do w/e you want.\n-Game really promotes player interaction. You have to function as a team. No soloing here.\n-It is very immersive. You get into your role and stick with it almost naturally. \n\nCons:\n-Some minor bugs. Server list not reloading, mines not blowing up, laser targetting messing up etc. \n-Severe lack of content though this will most probably be worked on by the dev team!\n-The game will take you and make you play it till theres nothing left to play. (might actually be a good thing)\n-Game is quite boring without actual voice chat. (might be different for you)\n\nFinal verdict: \nBuy this!

In the three hours I played I visited 4 desert planets and 3 frozen planets - all of which with repeated terrain and base layouts.\n\nThe combat is also the same each and every fight - you circle your opponent and shoot them until one of you dies. \n\nBoarding is pointless - since you cant have multiple ships there's really no point to ever going onto the enemy ship. Upgrades are fairly easy to get within the first hour of the game, so that is also an issue.\n\nOverall it's not a great game - I'd give it a 5 - as of right now it needs a lot of work and I would not suggest buying it for 25 dollars.\n\nSorry!", "timestamp_created": 1442900672, "timestamp_updated": 1442900672, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 216, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616545", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18141114": {"recommendationid": "18141114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064626530", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494199979}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is lots of fun to play with friends or random stragers that you meet.

It's in 3D and has 5 man online co-op featuring 5 unique roles: a Captain, a Scientist, an Engineer, a Pilot, and a Weapon's Specialist! Each role has it's own bonuses, a rudimentary skill tree, and different things to do such as steering the ship, hacking/scanning, manning turrets, fixing the ship or bossing people around. \n\nI've had some great moments in this game. As the engineer, there's nothing quite like pulling off Scotty like miracle work and saving the ship with last second engine repairs and then punching the button that jumps you all to safety. Similarly when there's a virus in the computer, rebooting the computer involves some Jurassic Park style flipping of big switches that always makes me chuckle to myself every time I see them! They're great. As the pilot I got to show off my piloting skills while gingerly easing the ship through the tight passages of an ancient wrecked structure and navigating around dangerous mines as we tried to salvage some loot. As the weapons specialist there was a moment when we bit off more than we could chew, with our ship blazing, and our weapons knocked offline I made a snap decision to board the enemy ship at the last second and managed to destroy their weapons, haulting incoming damage just long enough for my crewmates to jump the ship to safety. As the captain the first adventure was a blast, with me totally clueless but leading a crew of seasoned veterans, and they just rolled with it, bless them. It was a disaster, but everyone had fun. The scientist is the most underapreciated role, but they have their uses such as scanning for lifeforms and modulating shields. Although underappreciated, I take secret pleasure in joining a game as the scientist. I've heard rumours that there will be some form of scientific research added at a later date to flesh out the role a little more, and I do hope so.\n\nYou can do some similar things in Pulsar that you can do in FTL such as boarding enemy ships, targetting their subsystems, hacking, shutting off their oxygen (or your own), causing/putting out fires, shopping, and upgrading your ship. There are some things you can do in pulsar that you can't do in FTL such as beaming down to planets, visiting space stations, comandeering enemy ships. There are some really nice touches, such as when you grab cargo, that stuff starts appearing on cargo pads in your ship. So when your ship fills up with cargo, it literally does fill up with cargo. Really adds to the immersion.\n\nThe galaxy is open world which to me is a huge plus, so there's a lot of freedom to roam the galaxy as your captain pleases. The open world doesn't extend to planets, with surface areas being small areas around the teleporter pad, more akin to dungeons than planet surfaces. But they are certainly functional enough for their purpose.\n\nIf you're lookng for something to play at the weekends with friends then there is definitely a lot of fun to be found here. Get 4 friends wth you and hilarity ensues. It was watching a live steam of people playing this that made me instantly buy it!\n\nIf you're looking for an FTL-like game you can follow the development of and play occasionally when patches come out then this is a good buy. Judging from their past dev-videos, new content comes approximately on a monthly basis with bugfixes and tweaks more regularly. If you like the concept and are willing to support a dev on the potential of their game alone then you will probably not be disappointed, Personally, I played pulsar for 2 days solid, and stopped playing it, only because I don't want to play it to death at this early stage. I know there is still a lot of content needs to be added and so it's better to only dabble in it for now. So now I just play it for a bit when patches some out.  The base game is complete, and all the core mechanics have been fleshed out to where it's a fully fledged game. There is a large galaxy to explore and missions you can play through. All that is lacking is a decent variety of content to keep things interesting in the long run. To be sure if you're looking for something that you can play all day long, every day, and never run out of content, then this is not the game for you--at least not yet. But if you're looking for something to dabble in until the developer has a chance to flesh it out more then I heartilly recommend.\n\nAs with all Early Access games there's no guarentee it will ever be finished, So really it comes down to whether you're willing to support the developer on the merit of what they have right now and on the future potential. Keep in mind your idea of \"fleshed out\" might differ from the developers. I've been burned before, *cough* Elite Dangerous *cough*. But I still see it as worth the risk to support smaller devs such as this when they have something that really appeals to me.

I'll start with the english one.\nCette \u00e9valuation sera en anglais et en fran\u00e7ais. Je commence par l'anglais.\n\n\n[u][b]Graphics[/b][/u]\n\nThis game is very far from what we are used to in recent or upcoming games like Mad Max, Fallout, or Star Citizen (if we want to stay in the same game spirit). \nYou should not expect some amazing visuals in this game. However, the design of the ships, of the HUBs, and of structures on planets can easily make you forget the flaws if you like space operas like I do.\nAnd even if you don't, there is something else that can get your attention : the possibilities in the gameplay.\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u]\n\nI only played for about 7h at the time I'm writing this. However, I also spent a lot of time reading the manual for every role (quite useful for anyone who wants to be Captain, as you can learn all you need to know to give correct orders to your crew).\nBut I was absolutely amazed by how good the game system is. It's both complex and really simple. Complex because you need a slightly capable crew and a good captain in command to push your ship to its limits and discover all the possibilities the game offers. And simple because every panel speaks for itself and is understandable to anyone with at least 80 I.Q. The difficult part is to coordinate everyone.\n\nBecause it really is a coop game. With your friends or with stranger, you will need a good communication if you don't want to see your core explode your ship because your engineer forgot to apply the coolant liquid in the middle of a furious fight with a drone. Yeah, that can happen, trust me.\nThere is the possibility to play alone, with AI Bots in place of the different roles, but it's really not the same. And the Bots are still a work in progress and are not always responding as you'd expect. \nA good thing is, there's a small but nice community of players and an \"official\" teamspeak if you want to quickly find a crew and easily communicate with them.\n\n\n[u][b]What's in the game yet ?[/b][/u]\n\nRight now, you have several missions available, 5 different ships with differents components, weapons and internal configuration, a trade system for your ship at every station, few merchants in the main HUB to purchase better weapons or tools, the possibility to explore some planets, 5 very specific roles to control your ship and even more ...\nRemember this is still an early access, but it already has a buttload of stuff to do and discover.\n\n\n[u][b]All of that in two sentences ?[/b][/u]\n\nIt's a better Star Trek game than any Star Trek game. It's really about managing your ship and going on an adventure, half simulation, half adventure game. The devs take care of the bugs as soon as they know there are some, there is already tons of content and even more scheduled in the next year, and if you like space opera and have some friends, this is what you need.\n\nGraphics : 6/10\nGameplay : 9.5/10 (It's awesome, but nothing is perfect)\nContent already in game : 8/10\nContent scheduled : 9/10\nDevs communication and reactivity + update frequency : 9/10\n\nOverall quality : 8.5/10 But I expect it to go at 9.5 after a fiew more updates.\n\n\n\nBien, passons maintenant \u00e0 la review fran\u00e7aise.\n\n[u][b]Graphismes[/b][/u]\n\nCe jeu est tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s loin de la qualit\u00e9 graphique que l'on trouve dans des jeux actuels ou \u00e0 venir tels que Mad Max, Fallout ou encore Star Citizen (puisqu'on est dans le space opera).\nNe vous attendez donc pas \u00e0 des graphismes d'une qualit\u00e9 hallucinante. Cependant, le design des vaisseaux, des stations et m\u00eame des structures plan\u00e9taires permet d'oublier tout \u00e7a, en particulier si vous aimez le genre.\nEt m\u00eame si ce n'est pas le cas, vous pourrez \u00eatre s\u00e9duit par les possibilit\u00e9s laiss\u00e9es par le gameplay.\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u]\n\nAu moment o\u00f9 j'\u00e9cris, je n'ai que 7 heures de jeu derri\u00e8re moi. Cependant, j'ai pass\u00e9 un certain temps \u00e0 \u00e9tudier les syt\u00e8mes et \u00e0 lire l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des manuels pr\u00e9sents sur le site (tr\u00e8s utile si vous incarnez le Capitaine et voulez connaitre les syst\u00e8mes \u00e0 votre disposition).\nEt j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s impressionn\u00e9 de la qualit\u00e9 globale du syst\u00e8me de jeu. A la fois complexe et simple d'acc\u00e8s. \nD'abord complexe parce que vous aurez besoin d'un \u00e9quipage r\u00e9actif et d'un capitaine comp\u00e9tent pour pouvoir pousser votre vaisseau \u00e0 ses limites et d\u00e9couvrir tout ce qu'il a \u00e0 offrir. Et en m\u00eame temps simple car chaque panneau de contr\u00f4le est relativement clair et peut \u00eatre compris par n'importe qui. La vraie difficult\u00e9 est de coordonner l'\u00e9quipage.\n\nCar c'est bel et bien un jeu de coop\u00e9ration. Que ce soit avec des amis ou avec des inconnus, vous aurez besoin d'un bonne communication si vous ne voulez pas que votre r\u00e9acteur surchauffe et vous explose dans les mains parce que votre ing\u00e9nieur n'avais pas appliqu\u00e9 le liquide de refroidissement. Oui, \u00e7a arrive, croyez moi.\nIl y a la possibilit\u00e9 de jouer tout seul, en pla\u00e7ant des bots aux diff\u00e9rents postes, mais l'exp\u00e9rience n'est pas du tout la m\u00eame. D'autant plus que les bots ne sont pas encore compl\u00e8tement au point et ne font pas toujours ce que vous attendez d'eux.\nVous pourrez voir qu'il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 une petite communaut\u00e9 sympathique, ainsi qu'un teamspeak plus ou moins officiel qui permet de trouver rapidement un \u00e9quipage et de communiquer efficacement.\n\n\n[u][b]Qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire dans le jeu pour l'instant ?[/b][/u]\n\nA l'heure acutelle, il y a plusieurs missions disponibles, 5 vaisseaux tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents au niveau des composants, de l'armement et de la configuration interne, un syst\u00e8me de commerce pour le vaisseau \u00e0 chaque station, plusieurs marchands dans le HUB principal permettant d'ameliorer vos blasters et outils de r\u00e9paration, 5 r\u00f4les diff\u00e9rents et compl\u00e9mentaires, la possibilit\u00e9 d'explorer quelques plan\u00e8tes, et encore bien d'autres choses surprenantes ...\nSouvenez vous qu'il s'agit d'un acc\u00e8s anticip\u00e9, mais qu'il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 beaucoup \u00e0 faire et \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir.\n\n\n[u][b]Tout \u00e7a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 en trois mots ?[/b][/u]\n\nC'est un meilleur jeu Star Trek que n'importe quel jeu Star Trek.

It's in early access, which never really fills me with hope. However, from what I've seen so far, it shows a great deal of promise (which could be said for other games, really) and the developers are working tirelessly with the playerbase to stabilise and improve the game.\nThe game itself is an interesting concept. 5 players, each with their own role, working together in order to complete missions. Already it sounds like a number of games, but the way that Pulsar does this is not quite what you'd expect (unless you happen to expect something along the lines of guns of spacearus). Bots are available, but I'm writing this review with a Co-op impression in mind. \nThese 5 players are given a Spaceship and a role aboard it. Then, they're left to their own devices. The Galaxy is open to them from T minus 0, and there's quite a wealth of things to do. I recommend finding out firsthand. The game doesn't ease the player in very much. They are briefed on their role, but I learned quickly when I had someone talk me over the ship in a couple of minutes. Of course, there is some reading material that you could make use of.\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. The further out you go, the harder things are going to get. Work with your team and you can overcome all. Surely, this game has a thing for improving communication and building cohesion, However, I recommend a clear medium of communication, such as a Vent, person-person proximity, Teamspeak, and so on. As far as I am aware, there is no in-game VoIP. The options aren't great, and you may have an issue running the game. It's on Unity, I think.\nI wish I could rate things out of 10 easily, but I don't really think that way.

In Pulsar you take control of a spacecraft with a crew of five humans/bots and with this spacecraft you explore a huge galaxy filled with danger. As you take on, and hopefully destroy, enemies you\u2019ll be awarded with credits which can be spent on upgrades for your craft to make it far more effective. Pulsar also allows you to send away teams onto planets to search for items, lifeforms and everything in-between.\n\nI won\u2019t explain what the different classes in the game do but I will talk about them in my review so if you wish to know more about the classes look at the Overview in the Manual: http://www.pulsarthegame.com/manual/\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n\nFirst up, the overall appearance of the game; it\u2019s by no means the best looking game going but the graphical style definitely fits with the game, particularly for the ships, so I can\u2019t fault it here. The ships themselves look absolutely fantastic, both inside and out. The character models and a few of the textures on the planets are a leaning towards the not so great side of things but this can be forgiven since you don\u2019t spend too much time looking at either since most of the time in game is spent keeping the ship working during combat. The main menu is simple and gets the job done, not much to say here. Apart from the chat window there\u2019s not really a UI in the game but the space craft\u2019s ship displays are the equivalent here. The displays are what you spend most of your time looking at if you play as an engineer or a scientist but they\u2019re also important to the other classes. They\u2019re all done very well as they\u2019re simple and easy to use. The one for engineering is particularly good as it\u2019s just sliders and toggle buttons and engineers need to change things quickly.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nPulsar lets you choose from one of five (currently) ships, each with its own stats, advantages, disadvantages etc. Once you\u2019ve selected your ship and you\u2019ve assembled your crew you can either take and complete missions or you can just go off exploring in the randomly generated galaxy. I spent most of my time just travelling around the galaxy randomly, i.e. without trying to complete missions, and it felt rather similar to FTL. The Captain of your ship sets a course for you and then the pilot (human or AI) has to line the ship up with the system you\u2019re travelling to so the engineer can trigger a jump to that system. \n\nArriving in a system can lead to any of the following situations: combat with one or more basic enemies, combat with a \u2018boss\u2019, the discovery of a trading post/repair depot, the discovery of a planet which can be explored or the discovery of empty space. More often than not you find yourself in the first situation so I\u2019ll go ahead and explain how combat works. Depending on which ship you choose you\u2019ll have a number of different weapons available to you, all of which can either be controlled by different players or can be controlled by the WeaponBot. Your weapons can only be used a certain number of times before needing to recharge, how long this recharge time is depends on what weapon it is and how much power you\u2019ve diverted to weaponry. The recharge times are generally rather long and this is my first major issue with the gameplay since it makes combat feel rather slow whereas, in my opinion, it should be much faster paced. Enemy ships can also be boarded once a certain amount of their shields have gone down, boarding a ship allows you to kill its crew and then take over the ship or just destroy its systems.\n\n[h1]AI[/h1]\n\nPulsar: Lost Colony is meant to be played by five real people and it shows in the quality of the currently implemented bots. Firstly, due to the nature of the bots, it\u2019s almost impossible to run a ship with only one human player so if you\u2019re planning to get the game, make sure you find some people to play with. However, it is possible to play with 2+ players quite comfortably, having a captain and engineer as humans and the rest as bots is effective without overworking the humans. The reason I suggest this setup is because the weapon and pilot bots seem to be as good if not better than human players at those jobs as they\u2019re easier to automate. The devs do plan to improve the bots later in development so hopefully things while improve.\n\n[h1]Physics[/h1]\n\nPulsar has several issues with physics in the game, I don\u2019t know how realistic the devs want this game to be so perhaps these issues are in fact not issues at all but I\u2019ll list them anyway. Of course I don\u2019t expect them to have super realistic physics in the game but something less non-realistic would be nice.\n[list]\n[*]Once you stop firing the ship\u2019s thrusters it gradually comes to a stop, since space is a vacuum there\u2019s no resistance hence you should remain at the same speed as when you stopped firing the thrusters.\n[*]Planets have no gravitational pull on your ship.\n[*]Some of the larger ship guns, have ridiculously large amounts of recoil, obviously there should be some force coming back from the shot (Newton\u2019s Third Law if you\u2019re interested) but significantly spinning the ship is over the top.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Miscellaneous[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The audio is great in the game, the sounds that the ship makes are particularly good\n[*]There are already a few customisation options for you character including gender, hair style, hair colour and eye colour etc.\n[*]Personally I think the asking price is a little steep for Early Access but if you\u2019re willing to pay a little extra than you\u2019d expect and you know people to play with then I\u2019d say it\u2019s still worth it.\n[*]The devs seem very proactive when it comes to fixing bugs which are reported in the forum which is really good to see for an Early Access game.\n[*]It\u2019s not beginner friendly at all, the manual doesn\u2019t go into too much detail and it doesn\u2019t really tell you how to actually operate the ship, Pulsar would definitely benefit from a proper tutorial.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\n[b]Worth Purchasing.[/b]\n\nPulsar: Lost Colony is a great co-op space combat game with a vast, randomly generated galaxy, several ships to choose from and fun, if not a little slow, combat. If you\u2019ve always wanted a  co-op version of FTL, or if you\u2019re just looking to scratch a space game itch, Pulsar may just be the game for you.\n\n[b]Review Copy Provided.[/b]\n\n[i]No drama, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/justreviews]Just Reviews.[/url][/i]\n\nEl K.", "timestamp_created": 1442524679, "timestamp_updated": 1443563524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 221, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.876413", "comment_count": "22", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18073039": {"recommendationid": "18073039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131982742", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470776209}, "language": "german", "review": "Hi Leute, ich habe dieses Projekt eine lange Zeit verfolgt. Nun habe ich mir die Beta f\u00fcr 22 Euro geg\u00f6nnt. Ich muss sagen, das ist im Moment so ziemlich das coolste Game, wenn man z.B. Star Trek Fan ist, was man sich kaufen kann. Der Anfang ist etwas friemelig, aber wenn man die Basics verstanden hat, dann steht der Eroberung des Weltalls nichts mehr im Wege. Grafik ist gut, Performance ist super. Ab und an gibt es Bugs, wie z.B. ein Jumpdrive der nicht l\u00e4dt, oder Gegner die nicht angreifen und nicht angegriffen werden k\u00f6nnen. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist anf\u00e4nglich sehr hoch, so kann es sein, das man z.B. direkt nach dem Spawn bereits von Dronen angegriffen und zerst\u00f6rt wird, oder das Schiff die 2. Begegnung im n\u00e4chsten Sektor mit gegnern nicht \u00fcbersteht. Nach der eingew\u00f6hnung ist es dann allerdings das coolste Space Game was ich zur Zeit oder bislang je gespielt habe. \n\nDas Erkunden von Planeten, Annehmen von Aufgaben ect. funktioniert. Eine riesen Galaxie mit aberhunderten Systemen wartet auf Exploration. \n\nDen meisten Spass hat man sicher, wenn man das Game statt mit AI Bots mit seinen Freunden zusammen spielt.

One spaceship. Infinite possibilities? \n \nIf you ever wanted to control a spaceship together with 4 other real players, this might be the game for you. The flight controls, engines and subsystems are all operated from computer terminals, located on the bridge and other places inside the ship. Players must coordinate their actions to effectively repel enemies or even jump from one sector to the next. While it's the Captains job to take over this coordination (and drink coffee), the Pilot controls the movement, the Weapon Specialist operates the gun turrents, the Scientist the ships software and scanners and the Engineer watches over the energy usage and temperature of the core.  \n \nGameplay example: If you need your weapons to reload faster, the Engineer can switch of systems like internal lights and air conditioning to reroute more power to the weapons or he may switch of shields to have even more power available. The Scientist can temporally boost certain systems with his programs or he can try to hack the enemy ships systems. Of course you can't use all systems on full power at all times, since your ships core will heat up dangerously. Gameplay is often described as Faster Than Light in 3D and Coop. \n \nYou can board enemy ships and fight AI crews, explore planets, loot candy and go shopping in space stations. On your travels you will find scrap to sell or ship parts to instal. It's important to plan a route that passes by repair stations to repair the hull or upgrade with new parts. Also you want to stock up on fuel, missiles and coolant fluid used to cool the core in the heat of battle.\n \nAt the moment there are 5 ships to choose from, all different in size and layout. They all have beautiful lounges to relax and one even has a bar. 10/10 points for that alone. \n \nIn the end of the day it's a very fun coop-experience, you want to share with a group of good friends OR the very nice community. \n \nIn future I would love to see more things to do onboard except operation the ship.

It's a multi palyer crew spaceship sim. Basically what Star citizen is going to be jsut on a lower graphical scale.\n\nCurrently it's in alpha and feels like it. A good portian of the mechanices are still not implemented and there is no tutorial. The only way to learn how to play and what's in and what's not is to open the menu and click View manual.\n\nBasically when you first join the server you pick your role: Captain, Pilot, Scientist, Weapons Specialist and Engineer\n\nThe Capt. Pulls all the info from everyone together and tells everyone what to do (this person should know how to play, they should be ableto guide the others) The capt also buys and sell stuff and is more or less in control of the money.\n\nThe Pilot, moves the ship. To warp he has to line up up the ship and the engineeer has to press a button. The pilot doesn't.\n\nThe Weapons Sepc. Shoots the gun (and main gun).\n\nThe scientist has the best job in my opinion.

It aims to be a glorious mashup of Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Sim, FTL, Guns of Icarus, and Star Trek: Away Team, and while it is admittedly a little light on content at the moment, it does a great job of capturing the essential components and atmospheres of all these games.\n\nPlayers get to choose between four different ships to fly in, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, and five classes to play as: captain, pilot, weapons, engineering, and science, each with their own disticnt roles and RPG-style progression trees. At present, you start at The Hub, an expansive space station from which you can purchase items, weapons, and ship components, and also pick up various missions that drive progression in the game. Gameplay involves FTL-esque flight between randomized sectors, replete with derelict ships, crazed security bots, and enemy capital ships. There's also Away Team segments, where you can teleport down to nearby planets to fight the aliens de jour and search for your mission objectives. There are some neat metagame mechanics at work too: factions, reputation, and a Galactic Chaos system that ramps up the difficulty of enemies as you play. Apparently there are also some other surprises in store further out in the galaxy, but I haven't made it far enough out without getting vapourized to encounter them.\n\nAll in all, it's a super promising little title with great atmosphere and ambition that's just a little short on polish and content at time of writing, but is still a blast to play.

Don't get all mad because it doesn't allign with your opinion.\n\nI have been following this game since it first came out on greenlight. This was around the time I still played Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Simulator and what this game promised was that game, but ten billion times better. First person ship bridge simulator is exactly what I wanted and I'm happy to say, this game delivers like there is no tomorrow.\n\nThe game like I said is a first person multiplayer spaceship exploration/combat simulator. I first got the game when it was in early alpha and even though it was very rough, the game still had tons of features and charm. You and perferably 4 other friends begin their journey on one of the five ships avaible (ATM) each with its own personal style of play and interior/exterior looks. One of the things I was really looking for in this kind of game was ship system interaction. By this I mean as a player I control the ship in anyway I want. Its not just go forward and back, shoot weapons, and so on, I can control where the power goes around the ship, I can scan the sector for enemies, I can use programs that boost stats or viruses that infect enemy computer, I can tweak what subsystem need power from lights to atmospherics. The goal of the game is go through this procedurally generated galaxy and kill enemies for scrap. Once you do so you buy upgrades at shops and equip them on your ship. After this you will eventually be powerful enough to take on the galaxy boss and claim victory. On the way to this main goal there is so much to do and see so lets go over some of that.\n\nThings to do:\n1. Kill enemies.\n2. Loot abondoned space stations and structures for scrap all while avoiding dangerous mines.\n3. Find a high class enemy ship and prepare to board!\n4. Kill everything last thing on this enemy ship and hack is subsystems to take control of it!\n5. Use your new sexy ship to fly to a planet.\n6. Use your teleporter and beam down to the surface.\n7. Don't forget your space suit because humans need oxygen.\n8. Explore abondoned strucutes on the surface for food, weapons, collectables, and more!\n9.

Its an open world space game so you can make up stories, role play, and gather your buddies for a awesome LAN party thats not actually LAN because the game doesn't have that feature yet BUT it will. Anyways this game is great on almost all sides. I didn't even mention it but the art style is very clean but detailed and easy to look at. All in all I can give this game tons of my love and I think you should too! If your reading this and you know you could even slightly enjoy this game then you should really click that buy button. Lastly the devs to this game are super open about their development and are awesome dudes. They would love to help you with problems and so would the Pulsar community. The devs even have had polling sessions to vote on content that will be in the game! So buy the game or don't, if you don't your missing out on the best open world spaceship bridge simulator to date.\n\nIf you would like to see more I have a series of the game where me and some friend try our best to plow to the final boss. I will put a link to the first episode if you want to watch it. If not then don't, this isn't ment to be some plug or whatever but if you must think that it is, then i'm shamless about it :) Take care.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kWIOClo4jg", "timestamp_created": 1442348063, "timestamp_updated": 1445115458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18048205": {"recommendationid": "18048205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057938381", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498794346}, "language": "english", "review": "best coop space game availible.", "timestamp_created": 1442347914, "timestamp_updated": 1442347914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18048011": {"recommendationid": "18048011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044482875", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 4953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509408446}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a brilliant game, you are part of a crew of 5 on a space ship, you can play with real players or with bots.

There have been 5 updates, of which 2 were advertised as 'major'. None of them addressed the issues that have been pointed by the community. The idea is still there, and there certainly have been improvements- however the game still fails to provide enough value for its' cost.\n\nA good indicator of how PULSAR fails to keep people interested, even those that were initially excited about it, is the average playtime of the reviewers. \nIts' bad retention rate can also be assumed from the very low number of average and peak concurrent players (http://steamcharts.com/app/252870#All)\n\nI'll certainly keep an eye on it, and hope it will sometime fulfill its' potential, but at its' current state, price and rate of improvement, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.\n\n\n[h1]Beta 1.2 preview[/h1]\n\nPulsar: Lost Colony is a very unique game. It draws heavy inspiration from genre-defining classics such as Star Trek and Firefly, and tries to provide a similar gaming experience, better than any game has so far managed to do. Its' mechanics might seem overly complex or even chaotic at first (and the lack of a tutorial doesn't help), but it doesn't take that long before getting used to how everything works.  \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nA large portion of the gameplay consists of operating your ship through the use of monitors, flips and switches, controlling functions such as energy flow, offensive/defensive software, core temperature etc. Even though the UI can look archaic and out-of-place for an intergalactic spaceship, these monitors succeed in creating immersive and sometimes even frantic gameplay that rewards fast decision-making and combat awareness. \nAnother imporant aspect of Pulsar's gameplay is the ability to leave your spaceship, either to board enemy ships (for a manlier offensive approach) or to explore planets and outposts. Even though the concept is there, the excitement you get from visiting planets is doomed to be on a progressive decline immediately after the first few expeditions, since the ecosystems and architectures available are extremely limited at this point, and most planets' explorable zones are far too small and generic to be jaw-dropping. One can assume, though, that this is an issue that's going to be adressed sooner or later, as more content is being added, resulting in more randomly generated variations and hopefully more non-random, unique planets and outposts. Boarding enemy ships is also quite enjoyable, and allows you to steal initially unavailable spaceships.\nOther parts of the experience Pulsar has to offer include piloting, manning turrets, trading parts to upgrade your ship, using public restrooms, turning interior lights on and off (for a superb rave party experience), isolating yourself in the captain's cabin as well as a currently lackluster quest system.\n\n[b]Classes[/b]\nRole assignment is handled through five classes, each with its' own perks (available through leveling-up). The Captain controls the flow of the game and commands the crew, the Pilot steers the ship, the Engineer is responsible for the energy management, the Scientist ..uses software and the Weapons guy mans the turrets. Roles are fluid and can dynamically change during engagements, thus requiring effective communication between crew members, as is always the case with these kind of games. Even though the classes themselves are on spot, each one's gameplay isn't as deep or rewarding as the other's (with the Pilot and especially the Scientist suffering the most, as they have limited impact and almost no unique presence in the game). \nClass talents are also in certain need of rework, as some are completely must-have whereas others fall into the meh/useless category, resulting in practically no choice over which talents to level and when. Their number is also limited- class talents can be maxed out after just a couple of hours.\n\n[b]Technical[/b]\nGraphics are definitely not state-of-the-art. They certainly don't fail to convey the eeriness of space, but there's room for improvement, especially on characters and animations. \nSound is decent. The soundtrack could be more ambient and trippy- I feel the current background music is rather blant but I guess that's personal taste. The sound effects are especially well-made and convincing, and there's at least one for every major event (warping, taking hull damage, being set on fire, being shot in the face by a space-robot-bandit etc.)\nPerformance was flawless on a system just below the recommended specs, and I was even able to run it decently on a dated laptop just above the minimum specs.\nBugs do occur once in a while, and they can sometimes force you to quit and reload, but that's rather rare (2 forced reloads in 14 hours).\n\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\n+Great potential\n+Fun, unique concept\n+Well implemented mechanics\n+Obviously made with love and passion\n-Graphics aren't really great\n-Limited content\n-Classes and talents need work\n-Game wouldn't let us warp away and leave our bossy captain behind in a desolate desert planet\n\nOverall, the game is already super fun to play with friends, especially if you're into sci-fi. If you don't mind the occasional bugs (of which there really aren't thaaat many), the slight class balance issues, the limited content, the rather high price, and can look past the non-realistic graphics, I recommend buying this game.

The game captures the feeling of being aboard a starship superbly.\nOf course this game is even more fun when You and your crew start to roleplay. I've lost count of how many times i've been yelling orders to my crew desperately trying to outplay the enemy startships. In my total play time i've had nothing but fun and I would honstly reccomend this game to any space fan.\n\nOne of my fondest memories so far was being in a fight against one of the sector commanders, it was a very long fight our ship was no way at all prepared for it but we all agreed to go hard or go home. After an exhausting battle and an extremely close call (We had around 30 hull left) we basked in the new found glory that we were truly unstoppable (After all, we killed one of the hardest Enemies in the game). Thats when poo started to hit the fan. We figured it was best to navigate to the nearest repair depot which was only 4 Warp jumps away (Close amirite?). So off we went, \"Engineer, prepare the warp core for activation\" I said. \"Helmsman, Align us to SE 42\" I continued, barking orders. After which we left the battleground and was on our way travelling at warp speed along our journey. The first 3 stops were quiet, a planet to beam down to and explore, scavanged a few items and we were on our way. When we got to SE 17 they were there. Waiting. I quickly changed the alert code to defend the ship, but I was too late. All three enemy ships had started to fire, our shields taking massive strain, our engineer was trying his best to allocate power accordingly but in the end it didn't matter, we weren't going to win this one. I knew that, and I believe my crew did too. We were overheating at a great pace and we were all out of coolant. Only one thing left to do I thought. \"If we're going down then we are going to take them with us.\" I ordered our Engineer to disengage the reactor safety switch so we could eject the reactor. We did just that and managed to take two of the bastards with us in the explosion that followed.\n\nOf course no game is without its bugs but even the ones present here get hammered down very quickly thanks to Leafy Games' super quick hotfixes.\n\n11/10 would try outsmart AI and blow up again", "timestamp_created": 1442338432, "timestamp_updated": 1442338493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853876", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18045997": {"recommendationid": "18045997", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986204477", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476247440}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is fairly light on hardware, but packs a lot more underneath. At the moment, the game has a few recycled textures which allows it to run fast. \n\nThe ships at the moment are limited. However with the introduction of the Roland-class, we can see a potential for larger ships and perhaps hybrid AI/Human crew. Each ship has their own unique traits or abilities which allow for different styles of play. However the end game items overshadows these abilities which results in the same endgame play. Ship systems as of Beta 1 are moderately balanced however with AI controlled turrets, the main turret becomes less of a priority to man since the AI can hit it's target most of the time when you have a good pilot.\n\nThe ground combat at the moment is a good step in the right direction. Variable landscape that change how the player has to adapt. The new environmental suits allow you to travel to dangerous locations without harm and the weapons are based on a tried and true trade-off method (one shoots fast but weak, one shoots slow but fast, etc.). At the moment, the gameplay requires players to dodge gun fire or melee attacks. Requires every little tactical movement when shooting back so players can easily duck behind cover to protect themselves. Player customization is fairly fixed on implants and tattoos, but allow for colour changes.

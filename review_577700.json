THE VIDEOKID is a runner where you play a kid riding his skateboard delivering video tapes for marked Letter boxes While trying to avoid all sorts of dangerous enemies that mostly are 80ies culture icons like movies/cartoons characters etc. The handling is as simple as it gets as the controls are left and right  and up for jumping while a fourth key is for throwing the video tapes. The game can be played on either keyboard or controller. When colliding with enemies the first time the game ends. The game has 3 different trick updates which in my opinion is a bit limited but still ok as you doesnt have much influence on them anyways. Besides of that different skins can be bought by earning ingame coins.\n\nI think all fans of runners or the original paperboy will be satisfied aquiring this great little game that in my opinion actually is way better than the original and its sequel. The vast ammount of culture references is really staggering and has had me trying to remember what movies and shows they might have appeared in originally.\n\nI bought this game at full price and is really happy that i did so as its a simple but addictive game of nostalgia.\n\nBelow is posted different characters ive spotted ingame but be aware if you are a film buff you might want to skip that part as i had a blast myself trying to figure them out.\n\n[spoiler] various characters/things from same shows/movies turning up on different ocasions down the road (who framed roger rabbit, peanuts, dr who, He-Man, baywatch, karate kid, back to the future, teenage mutant ninja turtles,the blues brothers, 48 hours) - characters showing once, Inspector gadget, care bears, a-team, big bird,  duck tales, star trek, scarface, taxi driver, National Lampoon's Vacation, michael jacksons thriller, terminator, paddington bear, dukes of hazard, beverly hills cop, ghost busters, space invaders/Pac-Man, rocky, herbie, dancing prunes, Short Circuit, lethal weapon, super man, Fraggle Rock, Alvin and the Chipmunks, smurfs, postman pat, scoobie-doo, Peabody and Sherman, Indiana jones, transformers, Ruff Mitchell from Dennis the Menace cartoons, flintstones house, Chucky from Child's Play, gremlins, simpsons, Elliot riding bike with E.T, John McClane from Die Hard, Jason Voorhees, Batman car, pee-wee Herman, Freddy kruger, Beetlejuice, Ash Williams from evil dead, platoon, aliens 2 armored car, poltergeist house, The Fall Guys truck, Snake Plissken/Escape from New York, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Ferris Bueller's Day Off characters in red car, alien rammed down by previously mentioned armored car, nightrider, Giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from ghost busters [/spoiler]\n\nand even then im sure i missed a bunch", "timestamp_created": 1515135902, "timestamp_updated": 1515599354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606074", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39018127": {"recommendationid": "39018127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069966624", "num_games_owned": 828, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515000002}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprised this game isn't more popular.

The score attack part of the game keeps you on your toes while the incentive to collect money also for skins and tricks makes sure there is a benchmark for how good you are getting. The design of the level is ingenious, with plenty of nostalgic references to make sure you keep grinning as you go along. The secret level is cool as well. Overall, the game is fantastic, my only knock on it being that the loading times are \"too long\" for a game that is all about failing and repeating.

My best runs are ridiculously short, yet I can\u2019t stop wanting to play. I keep coming back and going again and again.

PixelTrip Studios' latest update vastly improves the game experience with a controller in hand. The game is not overly hard but can still kill you in seconds and the fact you don't have to reach for a mouse to give it another go anymore makes all the difference. The controller support stil doesn't feel 100% \"native\" but Steam's controller configurator can pick up the slack and make the mouse-driven store and menus navigatable with a pad. If I could only skip the Unity configuration with a launch parameter, the Big Picture experience would be improved even more.\n\nThe game itself is a silly fun time waster with a ton of '80s references but what actually draws me in is the fluid gameplay and the fact it reminds me of Paperboy but doesn't make me want to pull my hair out.

Plug in your walkman and lace up your Reebok Pumps, this is a review for The Video Kid.[/h1]\n\nThe VideoKid is a fantastic experience coming as an 80s kid myself. I enjoyed the constant references while I dodged, grinded on, and threw tapes into mailboxes. The game starts off simple enough, you have tapes that need to be delivered and you\u2019re the guy to do it. There are other challenges thrown in as well, which makes the gameplay somewhat diverse.\n\n[u]UI[/u]\nThe UI is clean. You have your cash earned in the top right, distance traveled in the middle and your score to the top right. Bottom left is also a pause button and a close on the right. There is no menu screen, so to adjust the sound, you\u2019d have to either end a level or die where the sound will be at the top of the score page. Also to note, there isn\u2019t a way to set the difficulty either in case you find yourself struggling. Score page shows your score, earned cash, movies delivered, and a way to spend that cash now. \n\nCash allows you to buy characters of which you\u2019ll recognize immediately like Ferris Bueller and the Karate Kid as well as additional tricks to help boost your score on your routes. All of it costs money and quite a bit of it for the good stuff of course. So, get to landing sweet tricks on your board and these will be yours in no time.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nThe game starts with a goal and a route you\u2019re to take. Unlike Paperboy, you don\u2019t have a limit to videos you carry, you just have to land tricks, dodge obstacles, and throw videos into the red mailboxes. You can also pummel Care Bears, Alvin and the Chipmunks, and dudes who need some chill with tapes that you\u2019ll see on benches. I personally enjoyed hitting the Fraggles myself.\n\nThere are also characters wandering the sidewalks and familiar cars on the streets to land tricks on. Hitting targets, certain characters, and getting red mailboxes consistently earns you points as well as landing tricks on cars. Stringing combos can be tricky as the setting needs to be exact for the trick to land. This was quite difficult at times since I found myself initiating the trick and then failing because of an unexpected obstacle or a Dalek.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on on screen at times and it can sometimes become overwhelming trying to focus on hitting the correct mailboxes while simultaneously trying to dodge Scrooge McDuck and his damn grandkids. The are rewards for distance, a number of correct mailboxes hit in a row, tricks and combos landed as well as targets and coins gathered.\n\nThere is also a moment where you see 4 familiar green turtle open the sewers. What happens when you fall in? Yep, you skate the sewers. These little touches make the game slightly more challenging.\n\nHowever, gameplay can become quite repetitive quickly. And with no way to set difficulty, some may find this game a bit too hard first time around. So, if you find yourself having a bad time, your best bet is to keep trying and work at it until you got it down to a science. Depending on what you\u2019re hoping to achieve, you may find the gameplay lacking with this in mind.\n\nI also found it strange there are no Steam Achievements or Trading Cards to earn for your deeds in-game. Perhaps this may be changed in the future.\n\n[u]Controls[/u]\nThe game uses WAD to move with A and D for left and W to jump. Spacebar is to throw tapes. The controls are responsive and the Video Kid jukes, jumps and throws videos on cue. Hitting mailboxes can take a few tries to get right, but once you get the mechanic down, it\u2019s relatively simple to hit the mailboxes each time.\n\nThere is partial controller support as well if you prefer. Left thumbstick to move and jump, A to throw tapes and Y to jump. I used a wired XBox 360.\n\n[u]Music[/u]\nMusic is fantastic and by DJ Savant. It\u2019s upbeat enough to keep you interested, but not repetitive to the point you end up focusing more on its annoyance than the game.\n\n[u]Overall[/u]\nThe Video Kid is a cute blast from the past and I thoroughly enjoyed all the retro references. I definitely feel my age creeping up when I can name pretty much every reference in the game. :) The addictive fast-paced gameplay, the snappy controls on both KnM and controller, awesome flashbacks all work together in tandem in creating a damn good experience and a retro roller coaster. \n\nIf you can look past the lack of a menu to adjust the sound and difficulty as well as the tedium, then Video Kid is definitely one you don\u2019t want to miss.\n\n[u]Pros[/u]\n+Simple to pick up, tough to master\n+Different characters and moves to unlock\n+80s retro vibe and so much nostalgia\n+Responsive controls\n\n[u]Cons[/u]\n-No menu to adjust settings (Sound, difficulty etc.)\n-Gameplay can become frustrating over time, especially if the difficulty is giving you a hard time\n-No Steam Achievements or Trading Cards\n\n[code]If this review/EAR helped you, please give it a thumbs-up.

This is indeed a cute little title from an indie dev team at the start of their journey onto Steam. As long as you don\u2019t mind the inherent  repetitiveness of this arcade subgenre, you\u2019re good to go. Well, skate.\n\nA trip down Memory Lane indeed, since the main visual diversity offered by this title comes from the multiple film and video game references it alludes, without actually naming them per se. Obviously that is just one of the many caveats imposed by copyright laws. Alas, you shall be able to easily recognize quite a few characters from the \u201880s and early \u201890s. The large pixel visual style is still pleasant on the eyes and the sounds are diversified more than enough.\n\nThe gameplay itself is somewhat lacking though. In both depth and the initial presentation. No tutorial (apart from a brief start screen that indicates which buttons to push or when), no cutscene and definitely not a very complex storyline or motivation. You\u2019re the title\u2019s eponymous Videokid. A silent protagonist whose apparent mission is to skillfully throw VHS tapes from a distance, while avoiding the many traffic and sidewalk obstacles that will surely get in the way. And yes, apparently the game\u2019s goal seems to be meeting \u201cJessica\u201d at the park. Now that\u2019s something easier said than done. In the good ol\u2019 tradition of arcades from the past (which this game really tries to emulate at least in spirit), THE VIDEOKID is hair-raisingly difficult to progress through, let alone master it. I shall not mark this as a weak point simply because I feel that such a game shouldn\u2019t be too easy. It maintains the legacy of coin-hungry arcade machines which both forced players to focus and learn the game\u2019s patterns and at the same gave a real sense of accomplishment for those lucky and skilled few which could best the title and reach an ever impressive highscore.\n\nMost certainly the presence of a difficulty slider would have been welcome. In part, THE VIDEOKID is also hard because of the randomly generated obstacles which offer a new perspective and challenge every time you restart the level. And you will have to do that quite often. Distributive attention and multitasking aren\u2019t unheard of in video games, but in this particular case you will often fail the stage by focusing too much on collecting coins (which help you unlock new outfits and items for your skater) or hitting the red mailboxes with the tapes instead of minding the road and incoming vehicles.\n\nVideokid can aim at many objects and NPCs with grace and doing so is actually encouraged by the scoring system on the upper right side of the screen. You really can\u2019t complain about the pacing but the gameplay itself gets boring eventually. Constantly hitting hurdles and having to restart the entire level, doesn\u2019t help either. At least Unity Engine ensures a smooth and nicely detailed experience. The developer should definitely sweeten the deal by adding Trading Cards and Achievements in a future  update. The price tag is decent but if you\u2019re still not convinced, buy THE VIDEOKID when it shall be inevitably bundled. I\u2019ve decided to recommend the game for its sheer nostalgic value, if nothing more.\n\n\n[h1]Strong Points[/h1]\n+ Old school feel with plenty of pop culture references.\n+ Affordable & challenging.\n\n[h1]Weak Points[/h1]\n- No Steam Achievements nor Trading Cards.\n- Repetitive gameplay.\n\n[b]Rating 60/100[/b]\n \n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews]Imperial Reviews[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Cubbes]Cubbes[/url], through the generous contribution of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/nevenapetar/]ZemunBRE[/url].[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1485956189, "timestamp_updated": 1486050251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29621616": {"recommendationid": "29621616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066364283", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486187484}, "language": "english", "review": "Videokid really embodies the spirit of the old arcades that made history.

The Videokid actually is somewhere between that.\nDo i love this game? I sure dont love it. Do i hate this game? No, i cant hate it. Is it a good or bad game, well, i explain that in my review for the best...\n\n[h1]Its 7.55! Im Late for Jessica![/h1]\nWith that last words, Videokid, the player, goes of to his ride down the street of a whole momento of the 80s. The game play is also already a 80s game, which is for sure a really nice clone of [b]\"Paperboy\"[/b]. That actually makes the game not bad but i come later back to this. As i said already, the street you ride down here is a whole momento of the 80s. Not only more or less [b]known[/b] characters appiers here and there, even more [b]unknown[/b] characters from this timeline appiers. I could name some but since im born in the late 80s, im glad to say [b]-I-[/b] at least know good 80-90% of all the stuff which you will see here ingame\n\nThat exactly is the reason you might even fail the [b]first few times[/b]. Insteed of \"just ridin\u00b4 down the street\", you just cant look away if you see suddendly [b]Michael Jackson, Alvin & the Chipmunks, Homer Simpson, Rocky, Scarface, The Fraggles and what not[/b] - just to name some. That makes you kinda giggle and fail a whole lot time, might give you even a flashback of the whole old time (actually, i had to laugh the fuck out of me as i saw some old characters from my childhood here and there). [b]Is that a bad thing?[/b] Actually, no, its not but i can only say that you should be born at least at the early 90s to understand what you actually see and who you see there.\n\n[h1]\"LAME, DUDE!\"[/h1]\nThe gameplay itself is really like a 80s arcade game. [b]Its brutal hard but not that hard that you actually cant enjoy it[/b] - but you only have [b]one life.[/b] So if you only hit one thing or touch something, its Game Over. Said again, it [b]IS[/b] hard but not that hard that you actually dont enjoy it. For me, its kinda \"ok\" in its difficult but since i must look for every character and giggle about the good old times, i really saw my ass crashed a lot times over and over into a car, with a smile in my face X3.\n\n[h1]Do i recomment it?[/h1]\nI actually say i [b]do recomment it but with caution.[/b] If youre to young or born maybe in the late 90s, 2000s or younger, you might dont understand a whole lot of the game and might miss the \"fun\". Next to this, maybe a lot people would rage about \"its to difficult\" - but since its a \"80s styled\" game with 80s styled gameplay, those games [b]were hard this time.[/b]\n\nSo if you love(d) the 80s or actually are born in the 80s, you sure should play it, there is nothing wrong with it and for the pricetag, its pretty cheap, too.\n\nthe [b]ONLY[/b] thing i wish this game will get is that the game gets sound opinions.

It's a fun spin on the Paperboy games with a ton of references from the time period and maybe a bit of a Skate or Die feel.  If those all seem somewhat foreign to you then maybe a better comparison would be to modern endless runner style games.  \n\nYou take control of a kid on a skateboard who is trying to meet his girl at the park.  But his pesky job of delivering VHS tapes gets in the way.  You skate along and make your deliveries while avoiding various obstacles.  Obstacles that are often references to 80's pop culture.  Maybe you need to avoid the Terminator.  Or peg some Care Bears in the head with a tape.  Drop in a sewer that you saw a few Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles drop into?  You can grind on top of cars and benches in an effort to increase your score.  Make a few extra bucks and you can unlock various characters to use along with some extra moves.  \n\nAt the end of the day if you're a fan of the 80's then this might be right up your alley.  Same if you're into endless runner style titles.  If neither of those things really appeal to you then I'd give this a pass. \n\nIf you want to see how it plays with some horrible commentary: \nhttps://youtu.be/7LGRHS-kfGw", "timestamp_created":

The first is intriguing and allows for more avenues and calculations to figure out where a block could be, the latter being a frustration as you can easily figure out where an empty space is, just to be hit with a roadblock in the form of a big ? taunting you.

Does it improve upon the excellent first entry? This is what I think of Hexcells Plus. \n\nIt's quite difficult to say. There are slightly more puzzles in this one with 36 and as always the simple concept of the game still remains fun. Well designed levels as you would expect from this series along with relaxing ambient music make for an enjoyable first half of the game. Until you are hit square on by a truck called difficulty curve and suddenly it becomes very challenging. I'm not certain I liked that too much. \n\nThe goal is the same as last time around; clear the board by colouring in hexes or deleting them in what is an immensely satisfying activity. It also introduces a new rule in the form of a hex with a number indicating how many hexes in a surrounding area there is by clicking on it. That's good. I thoroughly enjoyed the first few sets but when the difficulty ramped up beyond what I could feasibly work out, in crept my frustration. Part of the reason I don't play many puzzle games is because they can be challenging at times, sometimes unreasonably so, and I feel like I'm wasting time as I agonize over solving them. \n\nAnd this time around it seemed too hard for much of the later part of the game, at least for me. As I pointed out in my last review, I'm not quite at that level of being able to work out any puzzle in these games and once again I resorted to guesswork a lot more than the last game. I wasn't looking forward to this one as I remembered it was hard and it was the same this time around. My least favourite of the Hexcells games but a very good puzzle game.\n\nTo finish off then, I didn't enjoy this as much as the first game. That is not the same as it being a bad game. Far from it. The challenging later levels are probably a delight for those clever enough to appreciate them but for me they were too frustrating. This remains a must buy for puzzle fans and is much more of a challenge than the first, which was more relaxing. If more of the same but a harder challenge sounds like your thing, buy this.

Once again, it's a good Sunday morning game, though two things are worth calling out. For one, it's considerably longer than Hexcells, clocking in at around 9 hours compared to its predecessor's 2. And for another, it leans more heavily on a slightly more fiddly clue type (whammies within a localized area) that may have you poking your screen a bit to count out hexes. The game is still good, but the UI isn't quite as clear as it needs to be for how frequently that comes up.\n\nDo note that the levels are specifically designed rather than randomly generated. If you're looking at this, it's probably worth picking up the entire Logic Puzzle Pack.

Much like the first game, the base mechanic is that tiles are either marked blue or give a number representing the number of blue tiles adjacent to them, somewhat similar to minesweeper. But the game takes that base mechanic, adds a few other basic mechanics (number of blue in a column, marking that some need to be consequtive, having some '?' tiles), and builds it into a wonderfully satisfying and relaxing puzzle game. The music is ambient, and actions taken in game generate tones that go with the music as well. All puzzles can be solved without guessing and have a single solution, so when playing, I find it most enjoyable to take my time and only take action when I know it is correct.\n\nThe puzzles largely pick up where the first game left off. While there is some introduction to the mechanics, it is done in levels that serve to introduce the mechanics while also providing some challenge if you played through the first game. The levels (36 in total) grow in difficulty more quickly than in the first, but even the last few levels, although they can take some time to carefully comb through, remain enjoyable and approachable. The new mechanic, blue cells with numbers that give the number of tiles within 2 blocks, is used well, and makes for neat levels that are just as good, if not better than the levels in the first game. It took me about 7 hours to play through the game originally, and a majority of that time is on the last few, larger, levels (it took me around 40 minutes to do level 35 when I played through a second time, though I probably could have been faster if I'd wanted).\n\nAll achievements but 'Perfectionist' will be unlocked simply by playing through the levels. 'Perfectionist' requires that you beat all levels with no more than 1 mistake each, so if you play through each level the first time with that in mind, it too will be unlocked after a single playthrough. If any levels are completed with more than 1 mistake, you can simply redo them again, so all in all the achievements for this game are straightforward.\n\nThe Hexcells series is wonderful, and I highly suggest you pick up the complete pack of all 3 if you enjoy peaceful deductive puzzle games.", "timestamp_created": 1505019717, "timestamp_updated": 1505019717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34797520": {"recommendationid": "34797520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221435384", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507210473}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[strike] \u6211\u662f\u6709\u591a\u65e0\u804a\u624d\u73a9\u4e86\u5341\u51e0\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6[/strike]\n\u6d88\u78e8\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5229\u5668233", "timestamp_created": 1504800980, "timestamp_updated": 1504800980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34699192": {"recommendationid": "34699192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362734023", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503650030}, "language": "english", "review": "A great puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1504400142, "timestamp_updated": 1504400142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34673491": {"recommendationid": "34673491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075253024", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504315719}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9\u597d\u73a9\uff01\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u8981\u82b1\u597d\u4e45\u624d\u80fd\u53cd\u8bc1\u627e\u5230\u96f7\uff0c\u8d5e", "timestamp_created": 1504315772, "timestamp_updated": 1504315772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34650209": {"recommendationid": "34650209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015003424", "num_games_owned": 1198, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504234380}, "language": "english", "review": "Hexcells Plus expands on Hexcells with all new puzzles and adds a new element in the form of blue cells with numbers that indicate how many other blue cells are in the area.

It's very much like the original \"Hexcells,\" except the puzzle difficulty ramps up immediately (since we already have experience with them from the first game) and the developer added one more puzzle element:  a number in a blue hex indicates the total number of \"hits\" in the surrounding TWO rings of hexes.  That's actually one of my minor complaints with the game:  I kept making silly mistakes because I confused the \"number in the blue hex\" with the \"number in the black hex\" (the number of \"hits\" in the surrounding ONE ring of hexes).\n\nI do have to watch my phraseology in these reviews.  In my review of \"Hexcells,\" I said:  \"...still, it would be nice if it were longer.\"  Well, the developer listened.  The original game took me 4.1 hours to complete its 30 puzzles with all Achievements.  This game took me 21.1 hours to complete its 36 puzzles with all Achievements.  So, it's absolutely worth the price.  The trouble is that most of these puzzles are MUCH harder (and longer) than those in the first game.  And, since progress within puzzles can't be saved (only the completed puzzle is saved), that leads to puzzle fatigue and even more silly mistakes (clicking the wrong mouse button, black vs blue hex numbers, flat out missing hexes, etc.).  Still, I can't really complain.  This is a really entertaining, worthwhile game.

Could just be that I'm not chaining together enough sequential steps in my head though. I'm a bit thick sometimes. YMMV.\n\nAnyway, this one seems to rely a bit too much on those annoying unknown (?) markers to obfuscate or artificially extend the difficulty a bit more than I would like in certain areas. It's especially irritating when some of the marked blue hint cells are redundant or unhelpful, since the inference can sometimes be easily made from a nearby set.\n\nI do recommend it, but it's not as cleanly designed as the first one. I kinda just wanted more of that, and this felt a bit arbitrary at points. It's still the same great core game, with a few added wrinkles.

this one, if you want to buy this game you most likely already played the original Hexcells and want to know if this one is worth it.\nAnd I'd have to somewhat disagree.\n\nFirst of all the puzzles are WAY harder than they were in the original Hexcells. In the original Hexcells they were a bit difficult but not stupidly difficult and I managed to get through the game without a single mistake.\nNow this however is an entirely different story. This just becomes frustratingly stupid at some point and I couldn't manage to get through a single level without having at least one mistake somewhere.\n\nThe puzzles sometimes have up to 100+ hexes that you have to solve (which is just bullsh*t at this point) and just searching for a way to continue some of those puzzles is like searching for a needle in a haystack. \nThey didn't really bring any new elements to the table such as having to actually think around a few corners before you make a decision. Rather this game seems to just be \"Hexcells: Now stupidly increased in size to confuse you!\"\nIt's not a good concept to just make the levels stupidly large without having to actually add in new ideas to make you think around a few more corners. \nDon't get me wrong, the puzzle design is still great, but I'd just wish they'd make a lot more compact puzzles but focus a lot harder on the thinking aspect. Most of my frustration with this game came from the fact I overlooked a blue tile bordering a black one, thus giving me a mistake. This is something that never happened in the original version just because the puzzles were a lot more compact and easier to overlook.\n\nOverall if you really can't get enough of this game I'd recommend it if it's on sale. But if you look for something new or new interesting puzzle concepts and thinking around a few corners to blow your mind and find that piece of the puzzle that lets you continue it, this unfortunately isn't the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1488543554, "timestamp_updated": 1488543554, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0,

I thoroughly enjoyed it though, even with the frustrations of being most of the way through a tough map and then making the wrong call!\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this game, and look forward to getting stuck into the next game!", "timestamp_created": 1486813571, "timestamp_updated": 1486813571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29813455": {"recommendationid": "29813455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045809120", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486686891}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u4ee3\u662f\u5f88\u770b\u597d\u7684\u5e76\u4e14\u8ba4\u771f\u7684\u901a\u5173\u4e86\u3002\u4ece\u4e8c\u5f00\u59cb\u5bc6\u5bc6\u9ebb\u9ebb\u7684\u683c\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u5bc6\u6050\uff0c\u4e00\u5f20\u56fe\u505a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b58\u6863\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5f3a\u8c03\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u683c\u5b50\u53ea\u662f\u8003\u9a8c\u773c\u529b\u800c\u5df2\uff0c\u6bcf\u5173\u4e0d\u731c\u51e0\u4e2a\u6839\u672c[b]\u6ca1\u6709\u8010\u5fc3[/b]\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u6211\u505a\u6570\u72ec\u53ef\u4ee5\u201c\u5ea6\u5c0f\u65f6\u5982\u5206\u949f\u201d\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u201c\u5ea6\u5206\u949f\u5982\u5e74\u3002\u201d", "timestamp_created": 1486688151, "timestamp_updated": 1486688151, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29740916": {"recommendationid": "29740916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070803508", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486387311}, "language": "english", "review": "Some of the games needs guessing in order to be completed", "timestamp_created": 1486387236, "timestamp_updated": 1486387236, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.422925", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29726055": {"recommendationid": "29726055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059140487", "num_games_owned": 1127, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486496433}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun, challenging variation of minesweeper, which uses a hex grid and many different styles of clues.

Ziel des Spiels ist es alle Felder aufzudecken. Diese k\u00f6nnen entweder Blau sein oder Grau sein und dann Informationen \u00fcber die Anzahl benachbarter blauer Felder enthalten. Durch diese Information werden dann benachbarte Felder systematisch nach dem Ausschlussprinzip aufgedeckt. Zus\u00e4tzlich wird durch Zahlen au\u00dferhalb der Felder angezeigt, wie viele blaue Felder sich in einer Linie befinden. In diesem, zweiten Teil der Serie, gibt es zus\u00e4tzlich Informationen \u00fcber die angrenzenden Felder auch in blauen Feldern. Jedoch beschr\u00e4nkt sich die angezeigte Zahl nicht auf die 6 direkt anliegenden Felder sondern auf 18 umliegende Felder, also quasi 2 Kreise um das Feld herum. Dadurch wird dieser Teil deutlich komplexer im Vergleich zum Vorg\u00e4nger.\n\nFalls man mehr als einen Fehler in einem Level macht, bekommt man Punkte abgezogen. Am Ende des Levels erh\u00e4lt man dann eine f\u00fcr das Level festgesetzte Anzahl Punkte. Wenn man nicht alle Punkte freischaltet muss man das Level noch einmal machen und mit nur einem Fehler bestehen. Mit einer gewissen Anzahl Punkten kann man dann immer 6 neue Level freischalten bis insgesamt alle 30 Level freigeschaltet sind.\n\nDa Hexcells ein abwechslungsreiches und auch auf gewisse Weise sch\u00f6nes R\u00e4tselspiel ist, dass sich mit etwas Ruhe und Geduld gut bew\u00e4ltigen l\u00e4sst, kann ich es sehr empfehlen. Der Preis ist recht g\u00fcnstig und die Errungenschaften sind in diesem, zweiten Teil der Serie, mit etwas Engagement gut zu erreichen.\n\nIch empfehle, dass Hexcells Complete Pack zu kaufen, da bei Hexcells Infinite ein Levelgenerator integriert ist, der bis zu 1 Millionen verschiedene Level generieren kann und somit die Mischung aus einfachen, schweren, symmetrischen, chaotischen und in Mustern angeordneten Leveln durch eine riesige Anzahl zuf\u00e4lliger Level abgerundet und dadurch die Wiederspielbarkeit massiv erh\u00f6ht wird. Der Preisvorteil des Complete-Packs gegen\u00fcber dem Einzelkauf der Spiele ist ein weiterer Grund f\u00fcr das Pack.

Some places just requires combining information from two or even three different sources, but those sources are plain to see (though sometimes you have to complete other parts of the level to uncover that information). It's not always easy, but with a firm grasp of the mechanics involved you can always figure out 100% which hexes are what. One of the most fun aspects of the game is finding that logic rather than guessing. \n\nIf you liked the first game and would not mind a more difficult version, I see no reason not to recommend Hexcells Plus to you.", "timestamp_created": 1483610442, "timestamp_updated": 1483621223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505440", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29022027": {"recommendationid": "29022027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072888615", "num_games_owned": 1220, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483577300}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0448\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0438 \u0443\u0436\u0430\u0441\u044b \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u044b. \u0423\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0435\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u043e\u043c. \u041d\u041e. \u041e\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u041d\u041e. \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430. \u0412 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043a, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u044b \"\u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0448\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\" \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u0423\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b. \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0447\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435. \n\u041f\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0431\u0438\u043b \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0432 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0430 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e. \u041d\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u043c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0442\u044c. \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a \u0443\u043c\u0443\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u044b\u043c \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \"\u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e\" \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442. \n9/10, \u0438\u0431\u043e \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0442", "timestamp_created": 1483577886, "timestamp_updated": 1483577886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493207", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29021183": {"recommendationid": "29021183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127981024", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504048534}, "language": "english", "review": "A happy medium between the original Hexcells and Hexcells Infinite.

This is because this game has a 'perfect' rating, in which there must be no missclicks on a puzzle to actually complete it for the achievements.

Sadly there still is little replayability (this is only fixed in the third installment). My only real gripe is that far too often this game derives its difficulty from a bigger quantity rather than a better quality. Most of the later levels are huge and the challenge becomes less figuring out logic puzzles than it is spotting the one tile bottleneck that lets you continue. Still each level typically has an area that is very interesting and makes you feel really satisfied after figuring it out. The absolute high point of this game were the three small levels providing tough nuts to crack with little distraction.\n\nDesign and UI are the same as the first installment. The soundscape created is still interesting but I had to mute the game an hour in because it started to become grinding. During some of the larger levels a save functionality would have been nice to have.

I'm not sure whether I just didn't see the clues or if the puzzles were designed that way. \n\nThink of it like eating chili peppers. The mild ones have a rich taste, not too hot and spicy enough to open a pallet of flavors.

But if you've played Hexcells you are still only slightly ahead of the curve, as these puzzles are much more difficult and require much more attention and deduction than the predecessor.  The first Hexcells took me 3 hours to master all the levels (without a guide, natch) while Hexcells Plus has already taken more than that from me and I've only FINISHED 1/3 of the puzzles so far!  Granted that may say more about me than the game, but I think the general truth of the proposition holds.  A unique introduction is the ? hex, which can lead to a puzzle board dead end that can only be solved by looking off the board rather than on it; no numbered hexes to assist you, and only the beauty of logical deduction can remedy it.  \n\nAs with the first Hexcells, you can always guess (ala Minesweeper's early game \"cheat\" method) but that frankly defeats the purpose of playing a logic puzzle game.  You can also refer to the Steam guides to solve overly difficult puzzles, but I would recommend doing neither; this game is immensely rewarding when you defeat a level using only your reasoning faculties and that is how it should be played.

There are also row and column labels which allow you to see how many tiles need to be highlighted in any given row or column.\n\nEach puzzle mixes these up in a unique way to push you to solve it.\n\nThinking about this game as a more sophisticated version of minesweeper is, I think, fairly ideal, because that is more or less what it is, and the function it serves.

really annoying and game \"breaking\"[/h1]\nI really enjoy playing this game because it's very good brain and attention training and I'd totally recommend it to anyone because the price is great for what you get (Brain training, attention training).\nFor me as a programmer it helps improving my attention when programming a lot, this is the main reason I own this game.\nSo all in all it's awesome.\n\nLet's get over to a very annoying [b]issue[/b] which can break your joy.\nThe problem is the wiggling orange Hexcells, once you hover over them. The wiggling motion reveals what's hidden behind them. For example I am using my mouse to keep my attention on a Row/Column and I hover over one cell. It wiggles and reveals what's underneath so either it is blue or black and once I see that I already know without thinking. It's very distracting a frustrating because I missed the chance of thinking on my own.\nPlease fix (make it grey or something, or orange below)!", "timestamp_created": 1467306012, "timestamp_updated":

I don't find drawing patterns on the screen to find what I'm supposed to be looking for fun. I'd rather be solving the puzzle than trying to figure out *where* the puzzle is. A simple outline to show where the area is, like was done for the slanted lines in previous games, would have gone a long way.\n\nIt's not the worst mechanic ever, and I'm sure some people enjoy it, but I personally cannot recommend this game because of it.", "timestamp_created": 1462657654, "timestamp_updated": 1462657654, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0,

I somehow stumbled across the series, even though none of my friends had played it.  The original Hexcells is great, but short, and leaves you wanting more.  Hexcells Plus delivers on that, giving you basically the same number of levels, but with a few more mechanics in there so that solving each one takes much longer.  The puzzles themselves are also much bigger, so there are more shapes to uncover than the levels of the orginal game.\n\nI'm glad I purchased Plus, as I had a great time with the game.

The concept of minesweeper/sudoku is still the core of the game and just like the first one the soundtrack is excellent.\n\nThe first hexcells managed to achieve a perfect difficulty curve where you never really got stuck for long periods of time which kept the game ticking over and enjoyable. Unfortunately, this one gets too difficult too quickly. There's barely any instruction as to the rules of the game and as this is a standalone from the first one, you shouldn't have had to play the first one to understand the rules.\n\nBy the time I got to the 2nd set of levels (2/6 through the game) I was already getting stuck for 5-10mins fairly often which just became boring and frustrating. It's not like other puzzle games where if you spend that long you might find a good chunk of the solution which makes the effort rewarding. You can literally spend minutes upon minutes staring to uncover a few more cells only to get stuck again because of how big some of the levels are. Maybe it's the way I play; I know there is always a logical way to move forward in the puzzle so I refuse to guess. But in no way does the game punish you if you do guess. You fail if you guess wrong too many times, but it should be like minesweeper where if you make a single wrong move you've failed the whole level. \n\nThis is a hard game to give a thumbs up or down; it is very cheap so is worth getting. I think it would be a good idea to buy the other two hexcells and play them first. So then you become very familiar with the game and learn the strategies, then you can come to this one and enjoy it.\n\nSo, certainly don't buy this if it's going to be your first hexcells game. But also don't but it if you haven't play hexcells and hexcells infinite first.

Correctly uncover all tiles to finish the puzzle. But various other visual clues have been added to the mix, such as: digits telling you the number of blue hexes in a row or column (or diagonal); numbered blue hexes indicating the amount of other blue tiles in its vicinity; question marks hiding information from you; and other intersting hint systems that let you deduce the locations of blue tiles without resorting to luck.\n\nAs far as I know, it is always possible to deduce the tile locations using the hints given. No more of these 50/50 chances that occur all to frequently at the end of a game of Minesweeper. And mistakes are allowed too, you can continue the puzzle even after clicking on a wrong tile. Though you need to keep mistakes at a minimum to unlock everything.\n\nThe presentation is clean, simple and slick. Cool visual aids are provided that help you easily identify all the tiles of a row, or all the hexes in a 2-tile radius around a numbered blue hex. These are particularly useful in big and unusually shaped puzzles (unlike Minesweeper, the shape of the grid varies from puzzle to puzzle).\n\nThe electro-ambient music is also very fitting for a game that requires your full concentration. Notes are played each time you click on a tile, merging beautifully with the ongoing music. It is a detail, but it certainly adds to the experience.\n\nAll in all, if you like this kind of puzzle game, you cannot pass this up.", "timestamp_created": 1453338299, "timestamp_updated": 1453338299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20624733": {"recommendationid": "20624733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098361617", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464545440}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is a great puzzler like the first one, but the difficulty curve is far steeper than the original one.

Cheesing in the Cells.[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Genre: Minimalist Casual Atmospheric Number Puzzlers\n[*]Developed & Published by: Matthew Brown\n[*]Platform: Windows, Mac and Linux\n[*]Business Model: Base Game\n[*][i]Copy Purchased by Myself[/i] \n[/list]\n[i][url=http://wp.me/p4fZDz-2Uz]Read the full & unabridged review about the entire Hexcells Series on A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url][/i]\n\n[b]Overall Gameplay Thoughts[/b]\nHexcells is a minimalist puzzle game that I like to think of as a combination of Minesweeper and Sudoku. A comparison that has probably been made elsewhere. Every level is basically the same. You\u2019re presented with a variable number of cells with a number in the top right corner telling you how many blue cells there are in the puzzle. The challenge is figuring out which cells are blue and which are numbers. If you guess incorrectly, it\u2019s counted as a mistake that will affect how many points you get at the end of a level. The numbers on or adjacent to cells are telling you how many blue cells are connected to them. It\u2019s up to the player to figure out the pattern by examining the numbers. In general terms, if there are two unknown cells connected to a cell that has the number \u201c2\u201d on it, they\u2019re both blue cells. There are several different mechanics used to confuse the player and make them logic out the solution. Upon completing a level, you\u2019ll be rewarded with points that are used to unlock additional groups of levels. As such, this does requires you to complete most of the puzzles with a minimal amount of mistakes in order to progress forward. \n\n[b]Hexcells: Plus Features[/b]\nPlus is the expandalone title to the original featuring 36 new puzzles and a some new twists. The main new mechanics is a cell that tells you how many blue cells are in a radius around it. Otherwise, the game is as good as the rest and there are some tricky levels in it. It\u2019s not required to be played but if you haven\u2019t gotten enough Hexcells, this adds some more to theoretically sate that hunger. \n\n[b]My Main Issue With Hexcells[/b]\nHere\u2019s the problem I have with the entire Hexcells series. It\u2019s a pretty good puzzle experience, if you play it how it\u2019s intended to be played. However, I feel that they have a problematic design flaw: all of the puzzles can be cheesily completed. If you\u2019re stuck at a certain sequence, you can just click through the rest of the puzzle making as many mistakes as you like. (I had some puzzles at 50-60 mistakes). What about the points you would get from a near perfect completion? Well, once you nearly finish the puzzle, take a screenshot and then instantly replay the level with your own personal guide. It\u2019s possible to win all three games this way without much effort on your part. \n\n[b]PC Settings & Audio/Video[/b]\nIt\u2019s a minimalist game so there really aren\u2019t many settings to change. Since its running on the Unity engine, the Unity launcher menu pops up when you start the game every time. It allows you to change resolutions and turn fullscreen on/off. The graphics quality is set to beautiful and can\u2019t be changed. However, I was able to play this on a basic, five year old laptop running Linux Mint and there was absolutely no trouble running it. Alternative keys can be changed here as well. Hexcells Infinite was the only game of the three that allows you to swap the left and right mouse button functions. \n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nOverall, I think the Hexcells series is a decently executed puzzle idea with plenty of content. I take issue with the lack of anti-cheat but it's not enough to make it an anti-recommendation. (Thanks to a friend for making a case to change my mind on this). It\u2019s a fun logic number puzzle series. And I did play the three games how it was intended too, with a few exceptions. I had quite a bit of fun deducing the my way through the levels and had several \u201caha!\u201d moments despite it\u2019s more casual nature. Additionally, it maintains a mellow and atmospheric experience that I can appreciate. While there is the less honorable part of myself thinking \u201cyou can just easily \u2018cheat\u2019 this game and not spend hours on it\u201d, that doesn't disqualify it from being a decent puzzle game. So, if you can avoid cheating yourself, get the Hexcells series. But if you can\u2019t restrain yourself from looking up help on even the slightest bit of challenge, I probably wouldn't get it. Otherwise, that's my thoughts on this series. \n\n[h1][url=http://wp.me/p4fZDz-2Uz]Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1452913297, "timestamp_updated": 1452917789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20548510": {"recommendationid": "20548510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013841641", "num_games_owned": 599, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452895683}, "language": "english", "review": "I finished the original Hexcells in less than two hours, figured I could have played some more, and bought this one too.

The more difficult levels can even take up to 30 minutes or so, which started to feel like too much, especially given that you cannot save the game in the middle of a level! Also, it does feel irritating if you make a mistake towards the end of a level after having spent 20 minutes on it, especially if you're after the Perfectionist achievement without cheating.\n\nAnyway, the puzzles are hand-made and some actually almost made me laugh out loud when they revealed some perfectly composed, might I say beautiful, hint as to how the blue hexes are set. If you liked the original one, then this offers more of the same, but much more challenge too.

Simple design & graphics, fitting music. You have numbered tiles that tell how many adjacent mines there are. And later on there are numbers outside the grid that tell how many mines are in that column. The Plus edition adds numbers inside mine tiles that tell how many mines are within two tiles. You use the information given to get through tiles and eventually uncover the whole area. There are no game overs (so you can continue on despite guessing or making mistakes) but you can do the puzzles without guesswork. However, this game is noticably more difficult and requires much deeper reading of possibilities than the original title.\n\nThe controls are pretty simple (left click to mark as a mine, right click to reveal). You can also right click on column numbers/mine numbers to hide them. It's not very obvious but you can access the menu/restart the stage by clicking on the word MENU on the top left corner.\n\nI enjoy logic puzzles and these kept me entertained for a several hours (I spent a good amount of time just thinking about the problems and eventually got hints from people on the forums).\n\nThere is no save option (like in the original title). However, I found it a lot more annoying in this game because each puzzle requires a lot more time to solve. A physical sudoku or crossword puzzle on paper can be put away for later but this game clears all progress when you leave. I ended up taking screenshots of my progress so I could start from where I left off. [Edit: Hexcells Infinite allows you to save progress]\n\nIf there aren't saves because of save abuse (for perfect levels), then saves could be automatically deleted after they're loaded. And it seems like the devs could make it beyond the power of copy+paste if they really wanted to combat save abuse.\n\nOn a side note, misclicks sometimes ruin runs for a perfect score. I just repeated the puzzle but it could be nice to have an option that requires two clicks instead of one for those prone to misclicking.\n\nA pretty big step up in difficulty from the original Hexcells, I think it has risen a few steps above casual and into the enthusiast level of difficulty. If you like logic puzzles like Sudoku/Kakuro you should try the original Hexcells first.

It's not at all about making you guess, the puzzles are all solvable without any leap of faith. A tile with a question mark is just a tile you already know is not in the pattern... and that's all you know about it. You'll have to think your way around it in order to solve the puzzle.\n\nVery well done, devs, tip of my hat to you.

If you found the original Hexcells too hard, stop here because this sequel is a LOT more complex and harder. The original took me a little under 2 hours and wise nice and smooth to get into the system.\nThis however is in another league, it took me almost 12 hours to complete. Of course you can always guess your way through it, but there's no fun in that. The brilliance of this game lies in the fact that all puzzles can be solved by simply using logical thinking. There's never any guess work needed. On the downside, since there's so many variables to keep track of, it sometimes takes prolonged staring at the screen to figure out what move is next.\nWhich is also part of the greatness in the system. You sometimes have to hop from the left side to the right side of the puzzle or from bottom to top in order to make the next step. A nice change from doing things linear.\n\nAlso the game comes with a new smoothing soundtrack, a bit calm spacy tunes with no lyrics. Keeps you very focused (at least it did for me) but it can get a bit dull when you're stuck for a longer period.\n\nAll in all a worthy sequel, much much harder than the original but highly recommended if you're into logical problem solving or puzzles in general. If you dont want the spend too much get all three games in a package, or if you simple want to test out if this game is anything for you, start with the original.", "timestamp_created": 1451798581, "timestamp_updated": 1451798581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20242560": {"recommendationid": "20242560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051843643", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451794390}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u516d\u89d2\u5f62\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30a4\u30fc\u30d1\u3068\u601d\u308f\u305b\u3066\u3001\u9014\u4e2d\u304b\u3089\u304a\u7d75\u304b\u304d\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af(\u3044\u308f\u3086\u308b\u30d4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9)\u3063\u307d\u3044\u8981\u7d20\u3082\u5165\u308b\u7d14\u7c8b\u306a\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002\n\u4e09\u90e8\u4f5c\u306e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4f5c\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u521d\u4ee3Hexcells\u3088\u308a\u9ad8\u96e3\u5ea6\u306e\u9762\u304c\u5897\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\n\u521d\u4ee3\u3092\u5236\u8987\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3063\u3068\u6b6f\u3054\u305f\u3048\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u3092\u89e3\u304d\u305f\u3044\u4eba\u306b\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3002\n(\u521d\u4ee3\u3067\u632b\u6298\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u4eba\u3084\u521d\u4ee3\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u4eba\u306b\u306f\u52e7\u3081\u8f9b\u3044\u2026)\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\n\u25cf\u3084\u306f\u308a\u521d\u671f\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306e\u64cd\u4f5c\u306f\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30a4\u30fc\u30d1\u3068\u9006\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u5de6\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u53f3\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3092\u9006\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3088\u3044\u3002\n\u25cf\u521d\u4ee3\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u52a0\u3048\u3066\u6b21\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u52a0\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\n\u30fb\u9ed2Hex\u306e?\uff1a\u5468\u56f21\u30de\u30b9\u306e\u9752Hex\u306e\u6570\u306f\u4e0d\u660e\n\u30fb\u9752Hex\u306e\u6570\u5b57\uff1a\u5468\u56f22\u30de\u30b9\u306e\u81ea\u8eab\u3092\u9664\u304f\u9752Hex\u306e\u6570\n\u25cf\u672c\u4f5c\u3082\u5168\u3066\u306e\u9762\u306f\u7406\u8a70\u3081\u30670\u30df\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1451794575, "timestamp_updated": 1451798160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20237123": {"recommendationid": "20237123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053997031", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451766969}, "language": "english", "review": "The key settings doesn't work on MacOS.

If you have not played the original Hexcells, I highly recommend buying that game first; the puzzles are more suited to people just starting this series.\n\nI highly recommend this game, with a personal recommendation of buying the original game first. Even if you're adept at puzzles, it's a good refresher to do well in this version.\n\nThis is a copy+paste of my review from the original. Gameplay is the same, the puzzles are just harder:\n\n-------\n\nHexcells plays like Minesweeper, using hexagons instead of squares. However, unlike Minesweeper which is randomly generated, each level in Hexcells is pre-made by the developer to have a unique and deducible solution. There are bits of spacial thinking that come in play, from crossword puzzles like Sudoku.\n\nHexcells also takes the minesweeper playstyle and increases the complexity (always offering a deducible solution though), by introducing row/column markings in lieu of additional viewable pieces, as well as special tile number markings that denote certain behavior of where the blue pieces will be.\n\nI was a bit skeptical at first, but I'm really enjoying this series. I'm not noticing a terribly large complexity in this game, but I haven't gotten to the other two Hexcells games yet.

Um die richtige Auswahl zu treffen gibt es diverse Hilfsangaben, mit deren Hilfe man in einem logischen Ausschlussverfahren die Hexfelder entsprechend markiert.\nGenau wie in Minesweeper gibt die Zahl in einem schwarzen Feld an, wieviele der maximal sechs angrenzenden Felder blau sind. Zus\u00e4tzlich gibt es manchmal auch Angaben wieviele blaue Felder sich auf einer Linie befinden oder ob die blauen Felder zusammenh\u00e4ngend {x} oder verteilt -x- sind.\n\nZwei Neuerungen gibt es aber dann doch und diese betreffen die L\u00f6sungshilfen. So gibt es nun schwarze Felder, die nur ein ? enthalten, man also nicht wei\u00df wieviele blaue Felder herum vorhanden sind. Damit man trotzdem nicht in Situationen gelangt, in denen nur noch raten weiterhelfen w\u00fcrde, gibt es als neue Hinweise blaue Felder mit einer Zahlenangabe. Diese Zahl gibt an, wieviele blaue Felder in einem Umkreis von 2 Hexfeldern vorhanden sind. Dieses neue Spielelement macht die sp\u00e4teren Puzzle durchaus anspruchsvoller, weil man stellenweise nur \u00fcber die Kombination von mehreren Hinweisen auf die L\u00f6sung kommt.\n\nFazit:\nWer Hexcells gemocht hat bekommt mit Hexcells Plus fairen Puzzlenachschub in gewohnter Qualit\u00e4t. Und wer auch nur im Ansatz gerne Logicals in Zeitschriften l\u00f6st bzw. gern mal eine Partie Minesweeper spielt, der kann auch hier bedenkenlos zugreifen, vor allem bei einem Preis von gerademal 3\u20ac.

On the whole, though, I'm all for it!\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the game, it's very similar to Sudoku, which more people are probably familiar with. The big difference is that you don't have the same structure in every game; instead, you get levels with vastly different layouts.\nThere's never a need to \"guess\" or risk a move that might be wrong. If you combine the information at each turn, you'll find at least one correct move.\nEach moves reveals more information, which forms the game cycle.\n\nThe first game was too easy. Why? Essentially, because you always had a group of valid moves at each turn. This meant that, even if you missed one or two, you could easily make significant progress. This time around, there's a new mechanic: '?' tiles. These don't reveal useful information.\nMany people have reacted negatively to this, but it's not as bad as it seems. I would even say it's necessary, to increase the difficulty.\n\nThis way, you lose the number of valid moves, so you need to combine the more subtle information you get to reach the answer. With bigger levels, information is quite sparse, and you can get some really tricky puzzles.\n\nThat's basically what Hexcells Plus does that its predecessor did not. The last game was fairly easy, while some of these puzzles can take you tens of minutes, if not an hour.\n\nStill, the game is still fair, giving you at least one valid move, if you're carefully looking for it!\n\nThe biggest \"fault\" I find with this new tile is this: the previous game was surprisingly replayable! Since you always had several moves to make, you could choose very different paths to the solution. Each new path seemeed almost like a new level... which made a puzzle game replayable! That was great.\nThis time, that doesn't happen (not to the same degree, anyway) simply because you have less options. \n\nOverall, this is just as great as the previous one!

All of the first opus's flaws are corrected, basically. The music doesn't become annoying anymore after a few minutes. The OST is made of great, relaxing tunes that get you through the puzzles. The game doesn't feel like a big tutorial but like a real game now. Of course, it's all based on simple math and logic, so it's still easy as pie. The first four worlds are a breeze and are merely an introduction to worlds 5 and 6, where the real challenge awaits. No [i]real[/i] difficulty, no traps, no vicious designs though. You just need to look closely at the board, to watch every number, every line, every intersection to figure out how to go further. \n\nAll this game needs to be perfect is an Undo button. How often did I have a \"mistake\" because I accidentally clicked the board (two \"mistakes\" in a level and you're basically playing for nothing)! On the other hand, it's kinda good, gives you a bit of stress, makes the game feel more hardcore.\n\nBottom line: if you like Minesweeper (or games like Kakuro or Sudoku) you're gonna LOVE this. Still a bit much to charge 3 \u20ac for it, especially since there are only 30 levels and basically zero replay value (I've seen many free games with more content than this one), but for a short game it's relatively original, a solid concept, and lots of fun. Your pick.

Players are presented with an orange grid comprised to hexagons and it is up to them to determine whether these cells belong to the blue pattern or not (black cells). The black cells not part of the pattern have a number in them to indicate how many blue cells are adjacent to them, thus providing a clue as to how to proceed.\nAfter completing a puzzle the player is awarded blue hexcells based on the amount of mistakes made; these in time accumulate to unlock one of five new areas - allowing you to complete more difficult puzzles. Some areas also introduce new clues and rules to help you, making the puzzles more complex over time. \nNew additions for the puzzles include blue cells with a number that denotes how many other blue cells are present within a two-cell radius and black cells with a question mark, making it impossible to know whether there are any adjacent blue cells.\n\nAlthough similar to Minesweeper as mentioned, there is a key difference: there is always a logical next step. You never have to take a gamble so if you feel stuck, take a step back and focus on another area.\n\n[b]Why I recommend the game[/b]\nHexcells Plus is a very simple puzzle game in its visual design. The menu is simple and provides the players with the option of turning the ambient music on or off and selecting one of three save slots. The same can be said for the puzzles themselves; a grid of hexagons on a white backdrop. To me this is good design, as I'm here for the puzzles and that's where the focus clearly lies.\nThe puzzles themselves are interesting and more difficult than the original Hexcells, which is a plus.\n\nHowever, multiple problems I had with the original game are also present here. For instance, it is still not possible to erase a save slot so starting completely from scratch is not an option if all three slots are in use.\nMy biggest problem with Hexcells Plus is that, like its predecesor, there is no option to save mid-puzzle forcing you to either finish it or redo the part you already completed next time.\n\nAll that being said, as I have recommended Hexcells and this game is an improvement with the new rules and harder difficulty, I would encourage those interested in puzzle games to give this one a try.", "timestamp_created": 1440936898, "timestamp_updated": 1440937058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17786013": {"recommendationid": "17786013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061825143", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426310751}, "language": "german", "review": "Der Nachfolger von Hexcells wird noch ein wenig anspruchsvoller.

This game can be completed with pure logic and process of elimination, though the difficulty curve on this additional content is much steeper. If you're up for the challenge, then go ahead! It's definetly worth the price. Here is my original Review for \"Hexcells\".\n\n[quote=Enix]A compelling puzzlegame, as an obvious big brother of Minesweeper.\n\nContent\nMany puzzles await your solving. Go through different levels of difficulty and solve all of the puzzles to get to 100%. Can you get every one with no mistakes?\n\nHexcells (apparent from the name) adds new dimensions to the classical game of Minesweeper: More adjacent fields to one hexagon as well as border numbers, which indicate how many fields of the pattern are in a line/row/diagonale. Each boder number can indicate different things, everything is explained within the game. No need to rush things. You are now thinking outside of hexcells.\n\nSound & Music\nShallow but fitting background soundtracks and sounds. Nothing special, but that wasn't needed here. The soundtrack and soundeffects change every once and a while when you complete a puzzle.\n\nGraphics\nDon't expect anything here. The game is primarily a puzzle game, so no high end graphics or effects. The design does its deeds and fulfills its task. Visuals are never irritating and do what they need to do.\n\nWeakpoints\nSometimes, portions of the soundtrack are a little too high-pitched in my opinion. This can get annoying, if you are not used to hearing the same sounds over and over again. They are adjustable ingame though, from soundeffects only to completely mute.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\nGreat puzzlegame, compelling, challenging, tricky but fair. Nice soundtrack, nice sounds, simple gameplay yet sometimes mindwreckingly hard.

Plus offers more of the same as the original, excellent logic puzzler but with considerably more challenge. This can be both a good and a bad thing. Because of the higher challenge level, I strongly recommend you to first play the original Hexcells.\n\nGame has changed little from the original Hexcells. User interface (UI) is exactly the same as before. Just like in Hexcells, you have to deduce whether hexes are blue or black based on simple rules similar to Hanjies and Mine Sweeper. However, the puzzles are completely new. The sequel adds one new mechanic: now blue cells can also have a number on them that dictates how many hexes in two cells' radius are blue. Still no guessing is required at all: everything can be logically deduced.\n\nMusic has changed a bit but it retains the ambient theme from the original.\n\nJust like in Hexcells, there are 36 well-designed, challenging puzzles. Unlike Hexcells, the challenge level jumps up very quickly, and the further you get, the longer the puzzles will take to complete (assuming you are not guessing and strive for perfection). Coming straight from Hexcells it's alright but starting out it would be a bit too much. Especially the new mechanic of numbered blue cells can make it difficult to understand what's going on, though the UI has a convenient helping function to keep your thoughts straight. Unfortunately at least I had to resort to the infamous \"try and exclude\" deduction strategy way more often in this sequel than in the original game, so the puzzles can drag a lot longer. The lack of saving option within puzzles can become a drag if you find yourself in a hurry.\n\nI still recommend Hexcells Plus to anyone who liked the original Hexcells and was left craving for more. The upped difficulty level is more hardcore though and I can't emphasize this quality too much. For me the game took some 10 hours to complete fully, while original Hexcells was just a 2-hour stroll. If you want a smoother difficulty curve and a more pleasant a sequel considering the difficulty level, you should skip straight to [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/304410/]Hexcells Infinite[/url] that also finally adds saves and random levels.\n\nIn that effect Hexcells Plus shares many problems of its predecessor: it has limited content that lacks replayability after being completed and saving feature before that. However, it also shares most of its virtues: well-designed, albeit (perhaps) too challenging puzzles (when compared to the original one) with pretty much perfect user interface and audiovisual outlook for its game type. For challenge's sake it continues from where Hexcells was left so in that effect it is also a fine sequel for the puzzle enthusiast.", "timestamp_created": 1432858604, "timestamp_updated": 1432858604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16038348": {"recommendationid": "16038348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036498823", "num_games_owned": 1136, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426347534}, "language": "english", "review": "If you had one of the older Microsoft Windows versions, than you might remember the game Minesweeper. You had to find the mines and avoid them by marking them. It worked with some clues, since numbers gave away how many mines are close by.\n\nThe Hexcells games are very similar to it, but they are not working in square blocks, they come in hexagon shape and often remind of chemical combinations when you open the next level. These shapes make it sometimes hard to figure out what is going on and in later levels you get extra clues for the lines of hexagons and stuff like that.\n\nplaying Hexcells is fun in a kind of weird way. Even if you don't want to make your math homework, you sit down to \"calculate\" the grids, but it is not that much math anyway, more like drawing lines from dot to dot.\n\nLater versions of Hexcells (Hexcells Plus & Hexcells Ininite) are basically the same thing on harder levels and Infinite includes an Endless-Mode that let's you play levels created by chance.

While Plus technically has the same exact number of puzzles, it will last you a whole lot longer--there are new mechanics that make the game far, far more challenging than the first. The same basic gameplay is still here: it's kind of a mashup of Minesweeper and Picross, and it's incredibly satisfying to logically work out all the solutions.\n\n[b]If you played the first game,[/b] there's two new types of tiles. Black hexes can have a question mark on them; they serve to severely limit the paths one can take to fully solve the board. These end up being an effective way to resolve the primary issue with the game's structure, in that it is otherwise far, far too easy to finish puzzles. The second new mechanic is blue tiles with numbers--the number represents how many blue hexes are present within a two-tile radius. They're great additions; I found them to be a pretty clever way to expand the basic structure of the game.\n\nIt's absolutely wonderful to have a sequel that provides more of what I enjoyed while also resolving every issue I had with  the initial entry in the series. The first Hexcells honestly just feels like a prototype after playing Plus; I'd still recommend it, but there's no reason whatsoever to play it if you've skipped to Plus.

I have played the original Hexcells and quite enjoyed it, getting perfect on each level. While I liked the first game my only problem with it was the few occasions where the game forced you to guess, with literally no way to logically figure out a puzzle without risking a mistake, and having to try it again if you were going for perfect scores. Hexcells Plus claims to be more difficult, but I feel this isn't due to any real increase in difficulty, but due to artificial difficulty, particularly directed towards players who try to get perfect scores. I've finished the first three worlds, halfway through the game at this point. There have not been any new mechanics which make the game more difficult introduced, but I believe every level so far I have had to restart due to being forced to take a risk and failing. There is no logical way to solve the puzzles correctly on your first try, and the game turns into repeating levels over and over while trying to remember what to do with the spaces that have no way to be figured out. If you look at more traditional, non video game puzzles, there is usually a way to solve them without resorting to guesswork. This would have been easily possible with Hexcells Plus but the developers chose not to so they could artificially enhance the sense of difficulty. I really don't understand how this game has gotten so much praise when it's such a terrible sequel and none of the levels are well designed.\n\nSummary: Levels force you to guess rather than using logic, very poor level design overall compared to the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1425000773, "timestamp_updated": 1425000773, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.347808", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14668220": {"recommendationid": "14668220", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971490143", "num_games_owned": 1053, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424991359}, "language": "english", "review": "Same quality at the first one.

If you haven\u2019t played the first Hexcells, then you should either play that before playing Hexcells Plus, or just play Hexcells Inifinte (the last part of this review will cover that more).\n\nWhat I will go over is what\u2019s new and different to Hexcells Plus compared to the first game in the series. The short answer: not much. Hexcells Plus is basically the next series of levels after the final ones in the first Hexcells game. It does re-introduce the mechanics found in the first game, but its difficulty has a sharper spike, and it\u2019s (thankfully) quite a bit more difficult to complete. It only has 10 more levels than the first game (making a total of 36 in Plus), it takes quite a bit longer to complete than the first did, Plus in more in the range of 8-10 hours, as opposed to the scant 2 of the first\n\nNow, what\u2019s new about Plus? Well, it introduces two new types of cells to the game. Vacant cells that have a question mark instead of a number in them, simply not indicating how many adjacent cells contain hexes. The other type is a blue hex that contains a number, indicating how many blue hexes are within a 2 cell radius. These two mechanics add a lot more difficulty to the game, and overall make it more enjoyable.\n\nThat added difficulty spike is also why my two criticisms from the first game are even more noteworthy than before. Those being: 1). An option to save your progress mid-stage to resume later, something I once again get around by taking a screenshot to glance at when re-doing my progress if I need to stop playing before I can complete a stage. 2). A way to test out potential solutions without actually applying them yet (essentially like Picross\u2019 overlay feature). This would be far more useful here than in the first game given the more complicated puzzles, and needing to look at how all the different numbers indicating hexes interact with each so that you can determine which cells have hexes and which do not.\n\nNone-the-less, Hexcells Plus is still a fun puzzle game. If you\u2019ve already played the first game, then this one serves as a fine continuation to it, offering what is essentially a hard mode. If you\u2019ve not played any Hexcells games, then either pick up the complete pack when it\u2019s on sale for under $3, or get just the third and final game Hexcells Infinite, as it offers a level generator, so it offers more gameplay, if you only want one.", "timestamp_created": 1424852479, "timestamp_updated": 1425538177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Remember how fun it was finding those hidden mines, and how you could feel your brain scream \"NOOOOOOOOOOO\" whenever a mine would pop its stupid head up and kill you? Remember how immensely frustrating it was when it was entirely impossible to solve levels without guessing?\n\nWELL, NO MORE! Hexcells to the rescue. \n\nHexcells is very similar to Minesweeper in that you have to use various clues and reasoning to find the hidden blue cells on each level, but unlike Minesweeper, Hexcells' soultions can ALWAYS be reasoned, and if you're doing it right you will never have to guess.\n\nThe levels start out easy, with simple rules and puzzles, but new tricks are added just regularly enough to fully grasp, and before you know it, you'll find yourself scanning through 15 different criteria to find the 1-in-100 blue cell to start a level off. It's very satisfying.\n\nSpeaking of satisfying, the puzzles here never seem overwhelming or too tricky. Take my opinion with a grain of salt (since I have always loved games like this), but the level of difficulty in these puzzles was just perfect, and while some levels did force me to stare at them for a while, the solution was always there somewhere just waiting for me to grab it.\n\nThe Hexcells series is really 3 games: Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They each have different puzzles, and they are each worth getting, but Hexcells Infinite is the one to get if you're on a budget. It has the most advanced puzzles, and it includes a random level generator, so you can literally play to your heart's content. All 3 of them will slowly progress you through the mechanics of the game, though, so don't feel like you will be overwhelmed if you jump right into Infinite.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the random levels in Infinite are mere pale shadows compared to the premade levels (they are often quite easy), but for fans that cannot get enough and don't want to go back to the guess-fest Minesweeper, they can be a lot of fun.\n\nI highly recommend this game. If you're a fan of logic-based puzzle games, you can't go wrong with any of these 3 games. The prices are cheap, and the series is rather unique. If the devs could have just tightened up the infinite level generator ever-so-slightly, this game might be the only game I've rated to pass Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.\n\nScratch that Minesweeper itch, my friend!", "timestamp_created": 1421873192, "timestamp_updated": 1421873192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556280", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14075735": {"recommendationid": "14075735", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998351191", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426236618}, "language": "english", "review": "Clever puzzles.

This game was pretty fun. The puzzles are pretty neat, with math and logic being the primary factors. For me, it was a fairly relaxing way to spend an evening.

Because of this, you are really needing to memorize the patterns since the occasional question mark instead of a numeric hint throws math and logic out the window.\n\nSo...what I did was finish each puzzle and unlock enough points to progress to the next set on y own, until I was able to finish the game (which took me around an hour and a half or so, then went back today with a guide and got each one perfect for the final achievement.\n\nI would have given this game about an 8.5 out of 10, but the cheap moments sort of work to nullify actual logic and math thus defeating the actual purpose of the game, and so I knock this down to a 6 out of 10. Still a good game, but the random moments force you to rely solely on memorizing the puzzles that have the question marks (this will make more sense when you play it by the way) rather than the intended math and logic.

If you've played (Microsoft) Minesweeper on 'Advanced', you'll know the feeling of having to guess at least once per game. In Hexcells you'll be guessing a lot and that is frustrating as hell.\nThe game does give you some leeway in regards to the number of mistakes you can make, but while I could make it to the end of Hexcells in about 2 hours, and achieve a perfect score with some determination, I have given up on making it further than the 5th 'World' in Hexcells Plus. There is no difficulty setting, nor a hint system.\n\nIf there is some sort of system to solving the game (other than what is taught in the first few levels), I certainly haven't been able to figure it out, and the game hasn't led me in the right direction.\n\n(Edit: [i]To clarify; the puzzles are 100% solveable by logic and time spent (unlike Minesweeper), but you'll be guessing a lot [/i]if you find the game difficult[i], as I did.

The board starts with an oddly shaped field made of orange hexagons. Mines are marked by left-clicking a hexagon, turning it blue. Hexagons are revealed by right-clicking, showing the number underneath if you click correctly and shaking the piece and adding a tally mark to your mistake count if you're too hasty in your decisions.\n\nUnlike the original Minesweeper, Hexcells is a much more complex game involving a board marked with various different types of clues that give the player hints about how many mines are in each column or in the surrounding area of the board. Hexcells Plus expands upon the original Hexcells by giving players an additional thirty-six puzzles to complete with a couple of added gameplay elements. These elements include the dreaded ?, a marking that denotes a hexagon that has an unrevealed amount of mines around it, as well as numbered mines that indicate how many mines are in a two-piece radius surrounding the hexagon.\n\nUnfortunately, the addition of ? hexagons adds a somewhat frustrating element to an otherwise well-balanced game. I often found myself encountering large walls of ?'s that split the board in half, preventing me from continuing on without making a few risky clicks based off some logical guesswork. Altogether, I found Hexcells Plus to be fun, but slightly less enjoyable and more frustration-inducing than the original Hexcells (although that, perhaps, might have been caused in part by the ridiculously long span of time I had been playing Hexcells for by the time I reached some of Hexcells Plus's more challenging levels).\n\nNonetheless, Hexcells Plus is an engrossing way to spend an afternoon. Hexcells Plus can be seen as an expansion to the original Hexcells, adding thirty-six new levels for players to complete, or it can be played as a standalone experience, with the basics of the original Hexcells being explained in the earliest levels of Hexcells Plus.

Then I picked this one up.  Hexcells Plus is RIDICULOUSLY harder than the original, and I love it.  I almost never use walkthroughs for these types of games, but one puzzle had me stumped for so long that I had to resort to it once.\n\nThe puzzles themself are brilliantly designed, and it's clear that the developer put a large amount of time into making sure they were of the highest quality.  The ambient music in the background is wonderful and calming; it also adds to the wonderful experience this game provides.  The graphics are simple but gorgeous and charming.\n\nOverall, this is by far one of, if not the best puzzle game I've ever played and there is no reason to not pick it up.

If you thought the first game was too easy (and let's face it, that surely includes everyone) then this is the real game right here. The first Hexcells only gets interesting in the last few levels; well, Hexcells Plus starts off from that point, so it's logically a much better game. The concept is simple: find which cells are occupied and which are empty using surrounding clues that tell you how many occupied cells are in a row, how many occupied cells are adjacent to each occupied cell, and how many occupied cells are found within a certain radius of an occupied cell. It looks like Minesweeper at first glance, but it's far more interesting than that. Some of the later levels here get pretty tough, and there are times when you find it difficult to believe that it's possible without guessing, but then suddenly you'll spot a line of reasoning that you've missed and a few more pieces of the puzzle fall into place.

At the time of writing that review, I was unprepared to spend another few dollars on Hexcells Plus. One day Hexcells Plus was on sale, and I figured I should give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. \n\nThis game is certainly an improvement on the first one and I enjoyed it a lot. The puzzles are a bit harder and some present an actual challenge, particularly if you are disciplined and refuse to let yourself make a blind guess. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe concept of this game is intriguing, adding a few levels of complication and being much more accurate in the solution than Minesweeper is. No guesses are required, everything can be figured out with logic and enough persistence. Harness your inner vulcan!\n\nSome of those complications I mentioned include: cells are hexagons, there are more numbers (rather than just being on the cells they are also found on columns and rows), there are different sorts of numbers (some mean that a string of \"mines\" are all adjacent, others that \"mine\" strings are interrupted by a gap). \n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nVery simple - right click and left click. Still no option in game to change which button does what, but you can change it at game launch. However, by now I've become mostly accustomed to them and didn't make too many stupid mistakes by hitting the wrong button.\n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1]\nNo storyline, doesn't need one.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nRelaxing gentle zen echoie noises. Also, when you click a cell you get nice tinkling chime-like noises. I don't know why that makes it more satisfying to click on cells, but it does!\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nVery crisp, clean, and clear. The numbers are reasonably large. Some puzzles form an interesting overall image or pattern, and overall, the puzzles come across as well designed.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[b]+ [/b]crisp clean graphics whose job is to be functional\n[b]+ [/b]simple controls to grasp\n[b]+ [/b]more interesting concept than random old Minesweeper\n[b]+ [/b]improvements over the first game\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[b]- [/b]still a fairly short game\n[b]- [/b]the option to switch the mouse button actions is outside the game\n\n[h1]Help Me Help You[/h1]\n[b]If you did not find this review helpful,[/b] I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn\u2019t helpful for you.

This game is just puzzles, no story or characters or whatever.)  -- But I haven't really found something that utilized the ambient atmosphere and logic as well as this, to my memory. On PC*. Not that there is anyhing wrong with the puzle game selection on PCs. I'm just picky.\n\nAnyway, highly recommended for fans of peaceful (or chaotic. You could always mute the games music and play Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, instead.

I took around 8-9 hours to complete the game, and it's been a long time since I've felt the same level of satisfaction that I did when I finally beat the game.\n\nThis is an excellent, excellent puzzle game and I cannot recommend it enough. Those familiar with Minesweeper or logical principles can probably feel free to jump in here without having played Hexcells., Those less familiar may want to look into Hexcells first, but keep in mind it's effectively \"easy/intro\" mode -

Aber im Gegensatz zu Hexcells, wo ich mit genug suchen und Hinweise abklappern immer den einen Hinweis gefunden habe, der einen weitermachen l\u00e4sst, fehlte mir dieser Aha-Effekt in Hexcells Plus die meiste Zeit \u00fcber. Selbst wenn ich dann mal geraten habe und dann ja wusste, was es sein muss, ist es mir oft nicht gelungen, die betreffenden Hinweise zu finden oder zu interpretieren. Keine Ahnung. So oder so, mein Fall war das Spiel nicht, obwohl ich den Vorg\u00e4nger wirklich super fand.\n\n[b]Optik:[/b] 8/10\nWie schon der Vorg\u00e4nger: Hell und freundlich, durchaus ansprechend und liebevoll gemacht. Wer es aber lieber etwas dunkler hat, bekommt hier schnell schmerzende Augen. Deshalb etwas Abzug, weil es ein extrem helles Design ist und ich viele Leute kenne, die es schon allein deswegen nicht spielen k\u00f6nnten.\n\n[b]Musik:[/b] 8/10\nAbgesehen davon, dass man die Lautst\u00e4rke nicht steuern kann und Hintergrund und Soundeffekt die gleiche Lautst\u00e4rke haben, fand ich die Musik durchaus nett und entspannend. \n\n[b]Unterhaltung:[/b] 5/10\nF\u00fcr die ersten Level war es super. Die letzten Level waren einfach nur nervig. Hinweise, die keine Hinweise sind (? anstatt Zahlen in den grauen Feldern) sind mir einfach nur auf den Zeiger gegangen und Wenn man wirklich jeden Hinweis durch hat und noch immer nicht weiter kommt, bleibt am Ende nur noch zu raten. Vielleicht hab ich das ein oder andere Mal einen Hinweis \u00fcbersehen, aber trotzdem hat mir das Spiel einfach nur halb so viel Spa\u00df gemacht wie zuvor Hexcells.\n\n[b]Zeitaufwand:[/b] 2/10\nTrotz allem ist man relativ schnell durch. Das Einzige, was hier aufh\u00e4lt, sind vermutlich die Widerholungen, wenn man versucht, alle Level ohne Fehler durchzuspielen. Schon allein dass man sich manchmal verklickt, kostet da dann schon Zeit, aber trotzdem ist das Spiel recht schnell fertig gespielt. \n\n[b]Wiederspielbarkeit:[/b] 1/10\nNicht wirklich. Wenn man es durch hat, kennt man die Level, wei\u00df wie man vorgehen muss und wie es ungef\u00e4hr auszusehen hat. Das ganze dann nochmal durchzuspielen, ist eher langweilig. \n\n[b]Preis/Leistung:[/b] 1/10\nAu\u00dferhalb von Steam Sales ist das Spiel einfach zu teuer. Gerade auch, weil man es so schnell durch hat und ein erneutes Spielen wohl erst nach einigen Wochen oder Monaten auch nur ann\u00e4hernd interessant ist. \n\n[b]Pers\u00f6nlicher Eindruck/Bewertung:[/b] 4/10\nLogik hin oder her, ich habe mich bei dieser Version st\u00e4ndig in Sackgassen wiedergefunden und trotzd ewigem suchen und Hinweise abklappern keinen Weg gefunden, weiterzukommen. Also raten und sehen wie weit man dieses mal kommt. Hat mich alles in allem einfach nicht so fesseln k\u00f6nnen und mir nicht wirklich gefallen. \n\n[b]Gesamtwertung: [/b]\nAlles in Allem f\u00fcr mich nur 4/10 und ich w\u00fcrde das Spiel meinen Freunden nicht empfehlen. \n", "timestamp_created": 1403603984, "timestamp_updated": 1403603984, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.938272", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10745518": {"recommendationid": "10745518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015865147", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432171998}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u667a\u5546\u518d\u6b21\u88ab\u538b\u5236\uff0c\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u6211\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662f\u626b\u96f7\u3002\u3002\u3002\u540e\u6765\u6211\u5c31GG\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1403598225, "timestamp_updated": 1403598225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.990025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10743225": {"recommendationid": "10743225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088036457", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403595029}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u96be\u5ea6\u633a\u5927\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5173\u771f\u7684\u597d\u96be\uff0c\u5fcd\u4f4f\u4e0d\u731c\u770b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u8fd8\u6ca1\u60f3\u51fa\u6765\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1403591676, "timestamp_updated": 1403591676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10721381": {"recommendationid": "10721381", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982038480", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409667030}, "language": "english", "review": "Possibly the best puzzle game I've ver played.

The developer definitely put in a ton of effort making these puzzles - there's always times where you'll get completely stumped for a few minutes, then suddenly notice something you didn't earlier! The game is extremely addicting; I kept getting an urge to play the next puzzle immediately after finishing one!\n\nThe game does have its flaws, though. There's a special blue numbered cell that creates a highlighted area when clicked on, but that area is white on a white background, which led to me making mistakes more than just a few times. That really ruins your current puzzle, because getting more than 2 mistakes makes you lose your perfect puzzle status, which I went for!\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who even remotely likes puzzles and Minesweeper - it's an extremely unique game with calming music and an ambient atmosphere! :)\n\n[url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/12/11/wot-i-think-hexcells-plus/]Oh, and check out Rock Paper Shotgun's review if you haven't yet![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1403489148, "timestamp_updated": 1403489148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10663788": {"recommendationid": "10663788", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992293259", "num_games_owned": 626, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406578549}, "language": "english", "review": "There isn't that much to say about a game like this.

(Though admittedly, a few of the levels were filler / instructional, and didn't pose as much of a challenge.) I wonder if an optional timed mode would be a good idea.

In this version of the game there are additional ways you can work out the puzzles.\n\nIt is very similar to the Mine swiper game you find in any version of Windows, but with a little twist. The idea of the puzzles is very simple. I found this version of the game a bit harder than the orginal game. Also I believe that there are more situations whereby you need to make a outright guess. This spoils the michanic of the game a little.\n\nLike the orginal game, it does get fustrating in the last couple of stages were the puzzles get bigger. Specially if you are after the achivements.\n\nThe graphics are simple and styled well for this game.\n\nThe music and sound is very good and compliments the game well.

Unfortunately for me, my brain's pattern recognition breaks there and I start to believe huge levels like these aren't possible to beat purely on logic \u2013 I thought there's a couple of levels you need to rely on guesswork to advance, but it would battle against the grain of the game so I'm going to assume I'm the guilty party, not the game. At first some of the levels appeared entirely unbeatable by using logic, but then again a lot of my favourite games incur an initial feel of despair.\n\nOne initial gripe of mine was that unlike Minesweeper, there's really no penalty to messing up \u2013 you get a score reduction and advancing to the final levels requires a certain amount of points, so you're either puzzling through them like you should, or trial-and-erroring through them and then \"beating\" them with zero mistakes via memorization or screenshots just to advance to the new puzzles. (I didn't do this.) However, if you play the game fair and square, the pressure to stay frosty and not to mess up during the later stages of a huge level is tangible.

I mean, I get that the puzzles don't require you to guess. That much has been pounded into my head thirty times per discussion board thread. And it's been proven to me to a degree that I accept. Okay. The puzzles don't require you to guess.\n\n...who cares? They're not fun.\n\nI think that the main reason I don't like these puzzles is because if I'm stuck, there's nothing I can really try. What I mean is that the puzzles are completely binary - every space only has two possible choices. So if I'm stuck and I decide that I want to make a guess, I can either guess left click or right click, and my guess is either correct, in which case I know the answer, or it's incorrect... in which case I know the answer. There's no exploration of the puzzle. If I'm stuck in this game and don't want to automatically give myself the answer to the part of the puzzle I'm working on, my only option is to literally just stare at the screen.\n\nLink-A-Pix is a good example of an interesting puzzle because while it only has a single solution, it allows me to try many things without giving parts of the puzzle away to me for trying them. If I'm stuck, I don't have to just stare at the screen - I can try to connect the 9s in one place a different way to make room for something else, or I can pick a different 9 to connect to altogether, or I can even completely erase a small section and redo it to see if it makes room for something I haven't connected yet. Link-A-Pix is not at all binary - when I'm stuck, I can actively search for the solution to a single piece of the puzzle without it being handed to me if that guess is wrong.\n\nOf course, Sudoku is another great (and probably way more popular) example. How many of you guys have come to the end of a Sudoku board and realized \"Oh crap, something's wrong here\"? That's because Sudoku cleverly gives you options and ways to mess up without giving the answer away if you do mess up. Can you imagine if putting a number in the wrong place revealed to you the right number to put in that place? It would be silly because you wouldn't be able to try anything without parts of the puzzle being handed to you every time you make a mistake. And yet, it also only has one solution, [b]and can even be solved without ever guessing[/b].\n\nWith Hexcells, I can't very actively try anything - I can sit and stare at the same material until one little piece jumps out at me, and then I can sit and stare at the same material some more. Spending hours just staring at the same obscure clues over and over again... is just not fun. I don't find the puzzles to be engaging.\n\nI really don't care if you disagree with me. I'm not saying the game was poorly made - like you've all said a million times, the game has logical solutions that do not require you to guess. Okay. I still don't think it's fun. And who seriously recommends a game on Steam that they don't think is fun? I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to pretend that reviewing games is an objective process. No amount of fact can make me like Hexcells, or recommend it to someone. I just simply can't do either one.\n\nSo, I guess I'm the lone negative review.

Minesweeper fit to a hex grid with some additional clues/rules is how this game plays. The basic numbers reveal how many surrounding areas need to be marked, just like Minesweeper. There are also clues for total number along a line of the grid, and the blue hexes tell how many are to be marked within two hexes away. Clues can be clicked to highlight the region they apply to. Around a number, curly braces mean that number is touching/contiguous, while hyphens mean they are not. Throw in only one ambient track, and that is the game. It consists of 36 puzzles which took me 16 hours to \"perfect,\" which seemingly allows one mistake.\n\nIt's good this is the case, as the clicking is opposite that of Minesweeper. It can be changed, but I say stick with default for consistency of marking lines and blue hexes, which cannot be changed. Also, when a puzzle is solved, the results screen instantly comes up to cover the puzzle, which limits solving-satisfaction.

Hexcells Plus is far more difficult than the original and for me, that sapped some of the fun out of it.  I LOVE the original Hexcells and recommend it wholeheartedly.  It's a casual, relaxing little game that introduces you to some new puzzles that will stretch your mind a little by challenging you to think in a new way.  A lot of people compare it to Minesweeper, with the major distinction being that you never have to guess in Hexcells.  You can reach the solution to each puzzle with logic alone.  The difficulty curve on the original is great and most likely the whole way through you're going to have a smile on your face and feel enough of a challenge as new methods are introduced.  Is it going to leave you wanting more?   More than likely.  That's where Hexcells Plus comes in and why I was really looking forward to it.  Did it provide me with more Hexcells? Yes.  Did it give me more of the Hexcells I love? No.  The new puzzle solving techniques introduced in Hexcells Plus, although a logical progression, take it too far.  What the original Hexcells has in common with Minesweeper (other than searching a grid to mark empty and occupied tiles) is an addictive simplicity.  In Hexcells Plus, by making things more complicated to up the difficulty level, some of that charming simplicity is lost and sorely missed.  \nBottom Line - Hexcells Plus is not simply more Hexcells.  It will most appeal, I think, to people who felt the original was too easy.  I thought the orignal was just right.

No es un juego para \"5 minutos de pausa\".", "timestamp_created": 1397071740, "timestamp_updated": 1397071740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505650", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9746991": {"recommendationid": "9746991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031837797", "num_games_owned": 6097, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476608399}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u516d\u8fb9\u5f62\u626b\u96f7\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u3002\n\n\u73a9\u4e86\u666e\u901a\u7248\u4e4b\u540e\u610f\u72b9\u672a\u5c3d\uff0c\u8fc5\u901f\u4e70\u4e86plus\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u96be\u5ea6\u4e00\u4e0b\u52a0\u5927\u4e86\u3002\u8d85\u7ea7\u8010\u73a9\u3002\n\u6700\u540e\u5173\uff08\u5c31\u662f\u5546\u5e97\u622a\u56fe\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5f20\uff09\u73a9\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u67091\u4e2a\u591a\u5c0f\u65f6\u5427\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8fd8\u662f\u9760\u731c\u4e862\u4e2a\u624d\u8fc7\u7684\u3002\n\u5509\uff0c\u667a\u5546\u600e\u4e48\u5c31\u8fd9\u4e48\u7740\u6025\u5462\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1396808078, "timestamp_updated": 1396808078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602003", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9728657": {"recommendationid": "9728657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028022589", "num_games_owned": 917, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514644745}, "language": "english", "review": "Hexcells took me a couple of hours to unlock and perfect every level.

At least, if you're still interested after the first one, which won't take you long to get through. \n\nThey're both magnificent.\n\nHexcells is often compared to Minesweeper and that's quite apt (also, Sudoku), but where Minesweeper usually devolves into frustrating guesswork, the puzzles in Hexcells are finely crafted individual pieces that (as far as I can tell) always contain just enough information to solve. So often, when the combination of elements that unlocked some part of the puzzle finally revealed itself to me, I would not just feel the wave of satisfaction at my own accomplishment, but would find myself nodding in appreciation, seeing how carefully that whole side of the board was put together.\n\nAnd despite Hexcells Plus containing some incredibly tough puzzles (I have one level left to do at the time of writing), perhaps the aspect most worthy of raving about is that they're both such [i]calming[/i] games. The gorgeous ambient soundtrack is...gorgeous, and the developer has enough respect for his puzzles to not add some forced layer of pressure like a time limit. The pace is then whatever you need it to be - for me, the harder puzzles in Hexcells Plus were often a \"leave it on all day, have another look at it in half an hour\" pace - and I love that. \n\nTaken together (and they should be, because Hexcells is almost just an introduction to Hexcells Plus), these form a really marvelous little game.", "timestamp_created": 1392891314, "timestamp_updated": 1403847612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9189212": {"recommendationid": "9189212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028054269", "num_games_owned": 1153, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392877736}, "language": "english", "review": "Regular Hexcells is like super happy fun puzzle time.

The boards are much bigger and there are added game mechanics that result in more complicated play. It's way more like sudoku, with times when you have make complicated deductions based on the overlap of number clues.\n\nIf you want a nice, relaxing puzzle game, buy regular Hexcells.

In fact, I played it three or four times over!]\n\nHexcells Plus is everything I am always looking for in a puzzle game, distilled to a deceptively simple interface. Though comparisons to Minesweeper are not unwarranted, these comparisons miss a crucial difference: in Minesweeper, the final moves often (and annoyingly) come down to chance, debasing all the carefully planned moves you'd made before should you--at the end of a long game--happen to click a mine.\n\nIn Hexcells (and Hexcells Plus), however, the game gives you JUST enough information to never, ever have to guess. But you will often spend many, many minutes searching for and debating your next move. While the game provides various clues as to where you can find Hexes and numbers, it does not (at least past the first few levels) make this obvious (as it is in a game like Picross, for example, where every column's number of squares is provided). It only provides clues for a limited number of columns, rows, sections, etc.; based on this, and based on tricks you'll pick up and teach yourself as you go along, you'll have to very carefully make your next move.\n\nAnd this is the crucial difference: any mistake you make in Hexcells is your own fault--thus Hexcells corrects an unfortunate norm in the puzzle genre. So, between chess-like demands on your every move, between the security of knowing the game will not force you to guess, between the pleasing visuals and soothing ambient soundtrack, Hexcells Plus is one of, if not THE, best puzzle games I have ever played, and I play many.\n\n5/5", "timestamp_created": 1392837566, "timestamp_updated": 1401278103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768130", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9181747": {"recommendationid": "9181747", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994451532", "num_games_owned": 709, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508343349}, "language": "english", "review": "Like its predecessor, this is the best puzzle game I have ever played.

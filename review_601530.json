Still, there is enough diverse content to keep fans of the genre satisfied.\n\nAll that is fine. The game's core flaw is its storytelling. The story is an ambitious weaving of two narratives (one of which is steeped in South Asian lore) via reincarnation. That sounds like it [I]could[/I] be great, but unfortunately the dev team's skills are not up to the task. The end result is an emotionally confusing field of narrative debris. The many cut scenes are well produced, but in the end they fall flat because the context is weak. I almost never want to skip cutscenes, in any game, but Dakarta really tried my patience.\n\nAnother flaw is the game engine: annoyingly slow movement between scenes and general clunkiness.\n\nSo, thumbs up, I enjoyed this, but see lots of room for improvement.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515052811, "timestamp_updated": 1515052811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515845", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39029656": {"recommendationid": "39029656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124609711", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515021616}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game!!!

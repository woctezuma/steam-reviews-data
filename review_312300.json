As always Choice of Games never fail to deliver an unbeliveable quality in there works. The story continued the relevance and importance of different characters.

When ever I read these interactive novel I become fully immersed and as a result of the immersion I feel the impact of each action I take. With conscience present, I feel bad If I take a bad/wrong choice or feel overwhelmingly happy that I managed not to get myself or others killed (others being characters of importance to me in a positive light).

Fucking finally, this took me forever to do because  never got around to playing it but tonight I decided to sit my ass down and beat this game. I have to be honest with you here. This is the best game in the trilogy, my actions actually matter and affect me from what I've done in the last two games, it's great really great. I start off again from the cabin from the last game and it turns out dun! Dun! Dun! Prodigal's alive. I called it bitches. So we escape in this car and we have to drive real fast and we go to some hideout and we team up with Sonja's sister, Juhi. I bought the trilogy pack so I have ad space so I buy her all the ad space and then I tell Jenny to fuck off because she's a bitch. Then we go to this place and fatass GG is there and we're at Gay Gardens so we relax at Gay Gardens and decide what to do next because I have no damn clue what's going on. So we go to some place and fight the six people trying to kill me and so I just punch a couple in the face and thinking I clicked on fight Rebellion I actually chose \"Ah hell nah, I'mma go home get myself some doorwitoes and dwink some Muntain Daw fug dis shizzle.\" So I run away with my tail between my legs but two faced bitch comes anyway, oh I mean Jenny. (Shots fired.) After doing that I can't gather the the power in my asshole to give a shit if she comes or not, so I say \"Yeah your my best friend and remember how you think you saved me all those times when I actually saved your ass? Remember that?\" I decide to teleport but I need a teleporter so I go to Gay Gardens and I talk to GG and he gives me information and a cock slap to the face. We go to Millenial Tower where since I didn't tattle on the two... things? Having sex in the bathroom they don't fuck me up. So after having my record of straight sex not being broken a drug addict calls \"da police.\" So they can hook him up with some of those drugs Rebellion offered me. So I command the Millenial group to do some stuff and I succeed on every one because it's so easy. I face Rebellion after having powedered our noses in his secret little hideout place in a museum. I roll then punch rebellion then I cripple rebllion using my gun, pew, pew. I take no damage, but bitch is in trouble oh sorry, I mean Jenny (Roasted!) is in trouble so I move her a cenimeter very awkwardly and she gets shot. My character is sad but in real life I'm celebrating my friends are over I invited the neighborhood, we opened up some beers, we have party hats, Black Magic comes and fucks up Rebellion... Oh shit she's awake. I had already knocked out Rebellion on 3v so I tell Black Magic \"BB, it ain't the wight fing to do, you hero, me stick my dick in you, we all happy.\" She is touched by my words and we awake on some boat, I then kiss her and we fortify our relationship. This won't backfire, not at all. I wake up on the boat and Prodigal's there after me and Black Magic had sex. Then I see something from the sky somethingon a magic carpet! It's a Saudian Arabian, holy shit! It's Aladin! No, it's just Pressie... Holy shit Pressie! My favorite character from the entire game he's so happy and cheerful and... \"I'm serious now Metal Man, I jacked off to wikipedia in the rain forest so some monks let me jack off to their old man bodies so I'm good now.\" Damnit, you bastards ruined Pressie! How the hell do you mess up Pressie, he's Pressie for gods sake? \"I'm going to fuck off once I get you on this boat.\" No! Why god, why would you do this? Pressie was amazing but you messed him up. Anyways he never says anything else and is not mentioned ever again. We're on the ship and I answer these door questions correctly. Then I see Miss Artillery being lifted into a big bowl of chili, I shoot with my plama pistol but it doesn't fire. She dies and writes \"Dad VI\" What does that, oh shit her dad is Victon. Yeah game, it's pretty damn obvious, I didn't need a clue or anything. Prodigal punches me but I regain my powers but this time thier infinite so I fuck up some shit and I fly back to Millenia City. Is that what it's called? I dunno. After getting back to Millenia city I go to the hospital thinking I'm going to fuck some shit up. No, I'm seeing Jenny. \"Oh thank godd your here Metal Man, if that blast was an inch closer it would've killed me.\" Fuck. I dropped the ball here, I though I killed the bitch, but I fucked up in killing her. I then tell her it's Victon and she's like, \"okay biatch.\" Then she says we're even...? I let my girlfriend go into a coma because I wasn't there to protect her because you wanted to investigate some sneaky shit and then you try to help me when I didn't want you to and you get your ass handed to you? Then I save your life, and you did what exactly, came at the right time when I could handle myself and just beat some simple guys for me and you called that even... Fuck you. No seriously fuck Jenny I'm fed up with her shit. Jury comes and says I'm right about Victon and then I recruit him. Let's cut to the chase. I have an army and I've broken into the devoid I break out the Millenial group and that one guy that put my girlfriend in a coma, then I re-capture all of the prisoners. I do some cool shit, I save my parents from getting de-powered, my girlfriend Black Magic shows up and I tell her to do some shit. I then team up with every enemy I've ever made and they join my side (Except Rebllion and Victon.) I walk up and Jury an his mom dry hump while I confront Victon. Victon shoots at me but Prodigal takes the shot because she showed up just in time. I try to heal her but she's fucked so I take her blood sample and it's a 100% chance she's Victon's daughter. I punch Victon in the face, not killing him. The war is over and I get my reward I look over my options and then I see something, despicable. The Millenial Group Leader is not an option... what the fuck! After everything I've done for them! My relationship with Black Magic is 100% and she's a member, I've always chosen their side and I beat their leader twice. I'm the strongest infi powered in the world and what the fuck do I get? Fringe guy, and sponsored hero. What the fuck! I changed history itself I bend physics I beat your leader, I stand by you through thick and thin, and I lead you in an army and you don't think I'm good enough to be your leader? Is one of my stats not high enough? Fuck stats  want my choices to matter I want to be their leader I want to be the one that in the end you give me a fucking reward not some \"you got your parents back who said one word each throughout the entire game, hurray?\" No fuck you Hero's Rise I'm fucking done with you thank god your trilogy is over and I don't have to be dissaointed with your ending again, fuck you. I still reccomend my ass off you buy the entire trilogy. But it's just this one is just so dissafuckingpointing. I'm a swear-aholic I know. But this game deserved it's ass to be put on the cross for its ending, thank god it's all over. Wait, what did you say? There's some sort of sequel to the trilogy, so like a second trilogy?

This instalment finally feels like an actual superhero story from the comics, a rollicking good Big Summer Crossover Event exploring the setting's ideas, advancing storylines, and setting up new ideas for further comics, etc, where The Hero Project was clunky and The Prodigy spent too much time filling in a science-fictional world in which to place its superheroes.\n\nHowever, it's still the only Choice Of Games product I've yet played which keeps putting the game mechanics in the text. And that's clunky as all get out.\n\nA middle act that stripped out the reality show aspect of THP while doing the same conflict with the InfraOrder and the Meek, strip out the more obvious gamist intrusions and, if the game proved too hard for people to continue on without those in-text hints, some recalibration - I mean, transferring your health to beef up your power reserves as a character option ahead of combats?

This story is all about you facing all those who oppose you, your ideals and the future you envision. This Choose Your Adventure story offers different story paths, relationship routes and so on, depending on the choices you take and where your alignments lie. Are you consumed by revenge that you want to crush all those that oppose you? Do you want to achieve favourable results by minimizing bloodshed? Or do you want to walk a path that lies in-between? That's all up to the choices you decide to take in this epic finale of the Heroes Rise trilogy. \nIt's a shame you can't do certain things regardless of your alignment (such as killing one of the bigbads because you lean towards ideals as opposed to revenge), but I guess that's just a way to prevent your character from acting too much out-of-character, but I guess that's something I personally disagree with. The game tries to give you the possibility to act \"neutral\" or take part in both the good and the bad, but the game definitely punishes you if you even dare to slide a bit off from past actions. I guess that's something to keep in mind when you want to unlock all the possible routes of the game, but for a first playthrough in which you just want to go all role-playing, it ain't THAT bad, just a shame it prevents you or berates you for doing certain things.\nIn the end, the game was overall satisfying and fascinating to both read and engage in. The entire Heroes Rise series made me reconsider the charm and fun behind Text-based Adventure games. I never thought that going through a piece of software with only text and some options here and there (no pictures, no sound, no music) could be so much fun. For the superhero-enthousiasts out there, this is definitely worth picking up, that goes for the previous two installments without saying.

Hope a update comes out that lets me save my world because I'd love to have another playthrough but would hate to lose Rowan (my hero) in the process.\n\nAnyway now I have to go buy the rest of the choice of games library and will be sure to pick up Versus when it comes out!", "timestamp_created": 1427751246, "timestamp_updated": 1427751246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15007744": {"recommendationid": "15007744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049457197", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405272055}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game just so much fun and such a amazing story", "timestamp_created": 1427042453, "timestamp_updated": 1427042453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14900657": {"recommendationid": "14900657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055920039", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435320890}, "language": "french", "review": "Si vous avez aimez les livres dont vous \u00eates le h\u00e9ros vous allez adorer ce jeux!", "timestamp_created": 1426420041, "timestamp_updated": 1426420041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14816184": {"recommendationid": "14816184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011267324", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425849728}, "language": "english", "review": "No words.

In it's place a much better mechanic is introduced- balancing regaining your powers and keeping your health up. The plot this time around is also much more exciting. Your characters are constantly on the run, keeping things exciting. There are some nice twists and turns along the way and I have to mention that I was actually genuinely impressed by one of the character of Prodigal. The game actually tries to experiment a little bit with the story telling with her character. Even though she is an ex villain she gets a chance at redemption and the player gets a chance to work alongside her and even romance her in a really adorable scene with very bitter consequences. Personally I'd love to see more of experimental things like that in the future, since I hardly think any Bioware game will ever allow you to form any sort of bond with the main antagonist, it's up to indie studios like Choice of games to play around with stuff like that. \nOver all I'd recommend all 3 games.

I highly recommend giving this a try.\nWith its truly engaging storyline, it helps establish a connection the player has with their own character; a connection inevitably strengthened by one's ability to choose to respond to every event in ways they see fit, whether one wishes to play into the narrative-identity of one's character or decides to be radically different at every step.

Oppression and discrimination are strong themes i.e. against people with super powers. This is the third title in a trilogy. But you can play this without having completed the previous two games. But I think it's recommended that you have at least completed certain chapter of the previous books.\n\nYou have to read a lot lol. From what I can gather from these games you can't really choose to play as a Villain which is what I would like to do. But it does put in you in a situation where you can or you have to cooperate with the bad guys. Which from the look's of it will be a major element of the plot here. Okay, maybe the ideas in this game aren't completely original. I'm pretty X-men had featured same sort of stuff. And some of the scenes are kind of cliche. For example one character repeatedly attempts to warn their companions that danger is imminently approaching, but each time is ignored or cut off until the danger is right at the doorstep and that character even says 'I told you so' lol. But to be honest this didn't really bother me. The narrative seem to have enough substance to be interesting. It's far from the worst thing I've read.\n\nI really enjoyed really playing this game.

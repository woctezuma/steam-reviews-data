Pero, \u00bfeso es Under Night? , \u00bfUn juego de pelea m\u00e1s? Mira, si bien es cierto que este juego aporta muy poco al g\u00e9nero no puedo negar que es altamente divertido y adictivo.  \n\nEl juego te hace pasar un muy buen rato tanto solo como con amigos , obvio que con amigos mucho mas , y tal vez ment\u00ed con que no aporta nada al g\u00e9nero , solo que no lo mencione ya que es lo \u00fanico que vi diferente y es una habilidad especial cuando tu vida est\u00e1 en un punto cr\u00edtico y que cambia totalmente el rumbo de la pelea :  Nuestro oponente nos tiene arrinconados , nuestra derrota es eminente pero nuestro amigos de Under Night no quer\u00edan que los \u00faltimos momentos sean tan tranquilos para aquel que va ganando por ello implementado esta habilidad especial para que el juego sea tenso y te mantenga en la acci\u00f3n hasta al final .\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, cada personaje tiene su historia, sus habilidades, sus puntos de vida, ataque, personalidad y much\u00edsimas cosas m\u00e1s. Tambi\u00e9n tiene una especie de sistema de \"Turnos\" que no se bien como funciona pero ah\u00ed esta.\nLa verdad recomiendo Under Night , como dije antes puede que aporte poco pero nos hace pasar un rato muy bueno y si tus amigos est\u00e1n en casa y no saben muy bien que hacer esta es una opci\u00f3n mas que buena . \n\nPara terminar el juego tiene un sistema de puntos, cada pelea te da puntos y estos lo podes gastar tanto en un icono, en un titulo, colores para tu personaje y un fondo para el jugador. Si bien esto est\u00e1 perfecto y motiva al jugador a seguir jugando con los t\u00edtulos se quedaron cortos, solo podemos elegir entre palabras predeterminadas y no escribir lo que queramos, entiendo que si se escribir\u00eda no habr\u00eda forma de cobrar por ello pero qu\u00e9 m\u00e1s da, eso solo un titulo, y si quieren cobrar que te cobren por las fuentes o color que tenga el texto. \n\nLo que s\u00ed , me gustar\u00eda que agreguen mas idiomas , me entere muy poco de la historia y s\u00e9 que no es muy importante en juegos de este estilo , pero no s\u00e9 , me gustar\u00eda saber algo de aquel personaje que uso para destruir al oponente y saber un poco mas de los personajes que me enfrento. Tambi\u00e9n me gustar\u00eda que le pongan m\u00e1s ganas a eso de personalizar tu perfil y un personaje, lo de los colores es muy t\u00edpico en los juegos de pelea lo entiendo pero siento que Under Night puede hacer algo mejor, como crear skins realmente sorprendente y que me lleven a querer comprarlas y no que sea un color m\u00e1s que me gusto como queda", "timestamp_created": 1515411227, "timestamp_updated": 1515411450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39142281": {"recommendationid": "39142281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006477147", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1515813129}, "language": "english", "review": "a good fight\n\ndont play gordeau.", "timestamp_created": 1515305763, "timestamp_updated": 1515305763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39090515": {"recommendationid": "39090515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147939064", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1055, "last_played": 1516392593}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best fighting game there is, awesome soundtracks,cool characters and Eltnum's breaking the 4th wall XD (Waiting for the release of late[st]", "timestamp_created": 1515173225, "timestamp_updated": 1515173225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39052953": {"recommendationid": "39052953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017227505", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515073373}, "language": "japanese", "review": "ALL.Net P-ras MULTI\u7b50\u4f53\u3084NESiCAxLive\u7b49\u306b\u5165\u3063\u3066\u308b\u30de\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u7cfb\u683c\u30b2\u30fc\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u7248\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u305f\u3044\u3002\n\u30a2\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\n\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\n\u30e1\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\n\u604b\u59eb\n\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\n\u96fb\u6483\u6587\u5eabFC\n\u30cb\u30c8\u30ed\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba\n\u30a2\u30af\u30a2\u30d1\u30c3\u30c4\u30a1\n\u7b49\u3005\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb", "timestamp_created": 1515081666, "timestamp_updated": 1515081666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39052414": {"recommendationid": "39052414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099351571", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514893888}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a good game for me to have kill time when there's no internet.

However, don't let that discourage you from buying the game because there's still enough to at least carry you over or prepare for UNIST's release!\n\nI'm doing to divide this into several major topics: story, art-style & graphics, casual content, mechanics, accesibility, and netcode.\n\nStory: \nThis section is going to be short because it's not something I prioritize in fighting games. Simply put, the story is a over the place. The gist is that Hyde was just a ordinary high school dude, but everything changed when [strike] when the fire nation attacked [/strike] some beings of darkness attacked him and awakened his ability to use a strange energy called exs after being saved by a young girl named Linne. Did I say young girl? I meant 500 year-old soul of a princess that takes control over new bodies every time she dies thus making her immortal. After seeing hyde's potential she teaches him swordsmanship and gives him the Danretsu no Menzaifu. Together, they try to kill Hilda the ringmaster of the void. \n\nThe game doesn't really do a good job filling us in what kind of past each character had or where each relationship comes from. At the very least, they could have told us how other characters discovered their ability to use exs. Whatever, it's not an anime fighter without a convuluded story. \n\nArt Style:\nThis is one the games major selling points. It took me bit to realize this game uses sprites. The characters have good designs with Merkava and Carmine probably being the best ones. Some are good but a bit generic with Hyde being the biggest offender. The anime opening before the title screen looks fantastic and the song is catchy too! Kinda makes you feel like you're standing in front of cabinet in Mikido, Japan. The characters animate well, stages are colorful but not distracting, the special moves are flashy as hell. The game looks damn good. Moving on. \n\nCasual Content:\nAside from story mode there's a few modes to keep you playing. Time attack has you defeating fighters as fast as you can, arcade mode is your traditional 10 stages of fighters but no cheap boss at the end (Can't really tell if that's good or bad), survival mode is where you only have one round and your health is only slightly restored after each fight and your goal is to beat as many fighters you can until you die. You earn in game currency (no microtransactions) to get more colors for characters and customization for your title block but title blocks don't really matter if you're not doing netplay which in most cases, casual players stay away from. In short, there's really nothing to write home about. Just ok.\n\nMechanics:\nOh boy, my favorite part of any fighting game. The core mechanics. UNIEL is a four button fighter A, B, C, D which are light medium heavy and concetraition respectively. The first thing you'll notice is the Grd system in the bottom middle of the screen. When the circle fills up the fighter with more diamonds will get a buff called Vorpal. While in Vorpal, you get 10% bonus damage and the ability to use chain shift, which converts whatever diamonds you have on the grd, into meter. The grd circle is a timer so whoever has vorpal has the ability to lose it if their opponent has more grd. On a side note, you can mash A to do an auto combo which is perfect for casual play. It looks flashy and it's easy to do. There's more to this game but this is all you need to know to start with. Which leads to the games' major flaw.\n\nAcessibility:\nThe combos are not too difficult, but not really easy either you want the big boy damage and setups. If you've played arc sys fighter, you'll feel right at home. Some characters are more difficult than others, with Seth being the most unforgiving. Training mode is solid with recording functions and the ability to set you input delay by the frame. Perfect for practicing for offline tournaments as the Ps4 has a native 3f input delay. So what's the big flaw?\n\nThere's no tutorial mode.\n\nThis is a HUGE turnoff for most players (Although a minor inconvience for me because I usually do outside research on fighting games anyway). There's a good amount mechanics I didn't mention that are imparitive in order to be good at the game. So you want to learn the game and character, you're going have to consult some outside sources. \n\nAlthough a tutorial mode is added in UNIST along with character combo trials to fix this issue, It still should have been in there initially. \n\nNetcode:\nThe most important part of any fighting game and I'm happy to say that the netcode is great. It can handle coast to coast connection pretty well, and on average I only get 2-4F max when playing online. The lobby system is where most players reside (which the player base is really small, but it's up to you if that's good or bad. Personally I like it) and like most anime fighters, ranked mode is dead because nobody plays it so don't bother with it. \n\nConclusion:\nThe balancing of the cast is pretty solid, but not perfect. Despite that, all the characters are unqiue in terms of playstyle and their personal mechanics. However, if you want to git gud, you gotta put some effort outside the game, but then again, what fighting game doesn't? \n\nIf you like anime fighters or a fan of Blazblue & Guilty Gear, I'd highly recommend you pick this game up. If you're on the fence about it, wait until UNIST is released on Ps4 this feburary since it will have a tutorial mode and 4 new characters. \nHopefully, a PC port of UNIST will be developed shortly after the ps4 release, but until then have fun with UNIEL!", "timestamp_created": 1512356931, "timestamp_updated": 1512356931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466401", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37943872": {"recommendationid": "37943872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043999933", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512609700}, "language": "english", "review": "I was wondering what this comfy feeling I was getting from this game and then the credits rolled and I knew.

Unlike other ASW fighting games, though, UNIEL is much more accessible, and thus much easier to recommend, and its dark/gothic anime aesthetic is much different than their other works.\n\nPROS:\n*Simplified fighting systems that still have great depth, making the game good for all skill levels\n*Grind Vorpal system rewards agressive play, naturally making matches fast and action-packed\n*Fluid combat with combos that string together easily and look cool while doing so\n*Strong character diversity with really fun characters\n*Multiple singleplayer game modes to keep you occupied with a variety of challenges\n*Soundtrack is a nonstop list of epic music\n\nCONS:\n*The newest version of the game, UNIST, comes out in February on Steam, so you may just want to wait for that\n*No tutorial or combo challenges, so you have to learn and test everything with no ingame guidance\n*Online scene is very quiet since ArcSys didn't do much to tell people the game existed\n*Only 16 characters, making for a comparably small character pool compared to other games\n*Not much content to unlock, just some artworks, extra colors, and profile decorations that can all be unlocked decently quickly, leaving you with nothing to spend your ingame currency on\n\nUltimately, even if you only play the singleplayer content, this game is still great, and when you fight against your friends it becomes basically magical. Unless you want to wait for UNIST to come out, I strongly recommend getting this game and then playing as Gordeau for a good time.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511833465, "timestamp_updated": 1511833465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466401", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37770168": {"recommendationid": "37770168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142347795", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511006269}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0410\u043a\u0430\u0446\u043a\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u0414\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430.", "timestamp_created": 1511781448, "timestamp_updated": 1511781448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37763859": {"recommendationid": "37763859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054214794", "num_games_owned": 728, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1516168511}, "language": "english", "review": "PS3 port, clearly 720p content, but this game is some of the most fun I have had with a fighting game in a very long time.

Motions and specials have been streamlined to be much easier to perform and learn and with the addition of a smart-combo function, UNIEL is a very easy fighter to pick up and play.\n\nUnlike Guilty Gear and BlazBlue which had very comprehensive tutorials however, UNIEL is lacking in that department so seeking third party help via wikis, videos or a friend is the best a player can do in terms of explanations of mechanics which can be a bit discouraging. Thankfully the aforementioned streamlined controls makes it so that once you get your head around the mechanics and terminology, it's smooth sailing from then on.\n\nWhile I personally got the game initially because of hype for the upcoming BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle, UNIEL's well balanced cast of characters, clean artstyle and incredible soundtrack makes me excited not just for BCTB but for a potential port of UNDER NIGHT In-Birth Exe:Late[st] as well.", "timestamp_created": 1510575027, "timestamp_updated": 1510575027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708505", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36484219": {"recommendationid": "36484219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132679938", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515173967}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00e9 um game interessante pelo seu design, se voc\u00ea bater o olho vai pensar ''esse jogo n\u00e3o vale tudo isso'' mas pela divers\u00e3o que da pra conseguir com ele, principalmente com algum amigo tirando aquele famoso ''1x1''.

Soft Circle French Bread did great with developing and is a underrated name in the fighting game business, especially in games like Melty Blood (which I recommend you check out as well). And with the publishing done by the most passionate fighting game developer, Arc System Works, it's one fighting game you need to play.\n\nPresentation\nWhen it comes to graphics, they may seem simple. But they are very pleasing to the eye. Especially with the 3D Backgrounds and stylish looking HUDs. If you're too picky about 3D Graphics, please don't play this game. But if you enjoy really well hand-drawn pixels and 3D backgrounds, this game is great. The cast of 16 diverse characters with great voice acting, appearances, and skins are all unique in their own way and appeal to different fighting styles.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is not as simple as it seems. The game of course comes with A (light) attacks, B (medium) attacks, C (heavy) attacks, and D (drive) attacks. But be aware that the characters do separate themselves due to difficulty and control. So choose your character wisely! The GRD and EXS systems are really nice and make the fights more interesting and rewarding. The game modes are full of variety like the Arcade Mode, where you can go through a character's story in a visual novel format with fights sprinkled in. With these game modes and mechanics, the game truly feels complete.\n\nVerdict\nSoft Circle French Bread & Arc System Works know fighters. This game needs to be played and needs to receive a lot more attention. Under Night In-Birth is honestly one of the best, if not, the best fighting game ever made. If you have any anti weeb bias, you need to put them aside and play this game.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1509667185, "timestamp_updated": 1509667185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36198980": {"recommendationid": "36198980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175606141", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511808511}, "language": "english", "review": "Hyde has a cool sword", "timestamp_created": 1509561663, "timestamp_updated": 1509561663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36190432": {"recommendationid": "36190432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198421850968", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514900960}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bon jeu, bien plus dynamique qu'un Blazblue et avec une direction artistique plut\u00f4t sympa, je recommande.\n", "timestamp_created": 1509539371, "timestamp_updated": 1509539371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36187610": {"recommendationid": "36187610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134135489", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509517460}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: This review is from a guy that is not good at fighting games (besides smash bros) and doesn't like them that much. On the other hand, I think this should give a fresh review for those who are like me. Now then on to the review---\n\n\nReview: The first thing I think is worth mentioning is the ease of controls. It is literally the first 2d fightning game (besides smash bros) that I was able to learn the combos of and not button mash. It is very easy to pick up but hard to master. Unlike almost every fighting game out there, that has very difficult and bullshit comboing such as--up, down, x, a, left, y, up, right, right, x, b~~~~you can do a decent combo with a single button continiously pressed with very minor arrows (up, down, left, right) enabling you to pick up decent combos to give you a fighting chance within minutes of playing the game, without having to look at the combo list and trying to pull it off. It is from the makers of BlazBlue for those who like that. Now onto the story--I haven't played other stories besides the main protagonist Hyde. His story arc is very interesting and his character and storyline is what actually made me want to get this game. If you want a basic geist of the story, check the 'about this game' section of the product page. I'm only saying this because 2d fighting games tend to usually have short stories, so I wouldn't want to spoil any of it. Graphics---The graphics are what you might expect from a fightning game but the visuals and effects have a slight resembalence to Fate/Stay Night. Characters---As I said above, the controls are easy to use, so any character you could basically do alright with during fights after a few minutes of learning their combos. The characters are unique and diverse, which is rarely seen in fighting games. Replay---There is a fair amount of replay by being awarded with points to spend in the custom store for backgrounds, player icons, titles, and color/costume palletes for the characters. Final verdict--8/10. It is worth a pick up if you are a fighting fan, or a guy/girl that doesn't like the genre but would like to if they could find one that's fair to new comers.", "timestamp_created": 1509530931, "timestamp_updated": 1509530931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36180421": {"recommendationid": "36180421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218712356", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514093116}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the game to death. the characters are nicely made, the moves and combos are fluid, but I can't play the game without it lagging or going extremely slow for no reason and idk what to do about it.", "timestamp_created": 1509500006, "timestamp_updated": 1509500006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36154270": {"recommendationid": "36154270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138241699", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 71, "last_played": 1516332248}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una joya oculta de los fighting.\n\nFrench-Bread, creadores de Melty Blood, vuelven a sorprender con este nuevo t\u00edtulo de lucha que logra desmarcarse de sus influencias m\u00e1s claras (Blazblue & Guilty Gear) al introducir mecanicas como el Grind Grid, a\u00f1adiendo un punto estrat\u00e9gico al combate y m\u00e1s tensi\u00f3n aun si cabe a su ya de por si profunda jugabilidad.

I've been playing fighting games for my entire life, starting at the age of 4 with Super Smash Brothers: Melee. And after fourteen years of growing to appreciate the complexities of other fighting games outside of the SB lineup such as Soul Caliber, Street Fighter and Blazblue, I came across Under Night In-Birth after it was suggested to my by an over-zealous friend. At that point I already had a basic understanding of how 2D fighting games worked. I could block low on my wake-up and had mastered all of the basic execution necessary to get me started. (Quarter circles, DP motions, that sort of thing). At first glance I expected it to be just another airdasher to add to the pile, primarily due to the anime artstyle and the fact that I had never seen it played at any major tournaments. It all just appeared to be so generic, with it's anime intro and hit or miss character designs that I felt could be interchanged with other designs of the same archtype. Due to this  heavy bias I had already developed before I even got to the start menu, you can imagine my surprize when I went into training mode and found out that I could not instant air dash like in Guilty Gear or Blazblue. It was at this moment that I knew that Under Night would be different from anything I had played before.\n\nUnder Night hits the perfect balance between the speed of an anime fighter like Blazblue, and the simplicity of Street Fighter. I classify fighting games based on two elements: Speed and Complexity. The faster a game is, the less time there is inbetween the moments when the characters are beating the  shit  out of eachother. Marvel vs. Capcom games are incredibly fast, while Street Fighter is generally slow, Third Strike being the only exception to that rule. The more complex a game is, the more tools the player has at their disposal. Once again, Marvel is very complex, while something like Divekick is very simple. Under Night hits the perfect balance of these two elements for me. Fast enough to keep me entertained, while simple enough to make blocking actually possible but not too simple as to cause stagnation. In my eyes, Under Night is the perfect fighting game in these two aspects. I've found no other fighting game that appeals to me more based on these two pieces of criteria.\n\nThat being said, speed and complexity aren't everything when it comes to fighting games. System mechanics can make or break games, and I'm happy to say that Under Night delivers a well thought out mechanic with room for depth and meaningful interaction, all wrapped up in a cute little bow. I am of course talking about the GRD system. GRD defines Under Night. It is it's most distinct feature that separates it from other fighting games. During a round, players are rewarded for good offense and defense with GRD meter. Landing attacks, moving forward, actively defending against your opponent's pressure using the shield mechanic (Which I will talk about later), or manually charging the meter by placing yourself in a totally vulnerable state called concentration all charge GRD. Players can also lose GRD, by getting hit, retreating from your opponent and having your throws teched. There are probably other ways of gaining and losing GRD that I'm overlooking, but these were the most prominent ways of interacting with the GRD system in my experience. After a certain amount of time has passed in the round, the character with the most GRD meter enters Vorpal State.\n\nVorpal gives a character access to a small damage boost and more importantly, Chain Shift, a mechanic that works like a rapid cancel from Blazblue or a roman cancel from Guilty Gear. At any moment you may cancel almost any move in the game by removing yourself from Vorpal State using a Chain Shift, removing any lag from the move that was cancelled. This allows you to extend combos and reset pressure. The Chain Shift animation also pauses the game for a short time, allowing you to see what your opponent is doing, and react accordingly. A common tactic is to Chain Shift after you are knocked down to see if your opponent is trying to attack you on your wakeup, and then countering their attack with a guaranteed invincible reversal. It is also worthy to note that Chain Shifting uses all of your GRD meter, and converts it into regualr meter that is used for super attacks. I could go on forever about the uses of the GRD system, but what is almost as, if not more important as the GRD system, is how you can prevent your opponent from using it, or how the same thing may happen to you.\n\nGRD Breaking adds an element of risk to the game that I absolutely love. While defending against your opponents attacks, you can shield their attacks to gain GRD meter and increase the pushback of their moves significanlty.And as we know, GRD meter leads to Vorpal State, which leads to Chain Shift, which can be used to end your opponents offence in multiple different ways. Sheilding is essetially an amalgamation of barrier blocking and instant blocking from Blazblue, and the value that it brings cannot be understated. However, that value comes at certain risk and limitation. While you are shielding, you cannot change the direction you are blocking in, and you cannot tech throws. Furthermore, if your opponent manages to break through your defense while shielding, (Which is more likely due to the disadvantages that shielding brings) They will break your GRD meter, which prevents you from gaining GRD or doing any action that involves GRD for a significant amount of time. Everytime you shield an attack there is a possibility that you may get GRD broken, and lose access to all of the GRD you just gained shielding. As such, smart players do not shield wantonly, and instead wait for attacks that they know they can block, and shield only those attacks. Or, if your opponent's offense is becoming predictable, you can shield their entire blockstring and gain a ton of GRd in the process. This in turn will incentivize your opponent to mixup their offense, which will result in more meaningful interactions, and a more interesting game.\n\nMechanically, Under Night In-Birth is the best fighting game I have ever played, and it will always have merit for that, but it is also the first fighting game I extensively played with friends. This goes for every fighting game, but I feel this game is more enjoyable if you can sit down with a  friend at a similair skill level and go back and forth for hours. Whether it's offline or online, every fighting game is more fun with friends to play with. Under Night is no exception.\n\nThat being said, the online community is practically dead due to the release of the newest version of the game on PS4 :(. Anyone you do find online is of considerable skill, and is probably playing a mid to top tier character so it goes without saying that people that are new to fighting games are going to get slaughtered if they can find a match. Even if you can find a match, the probability that the netcode will co-operate is slim.\n\nPick this game up if you've got friends to play it with.

Good time killer until better version UNIST arrives in NA within this year. Buy on sale and play with friends for a good time.\n\nI got this game on a whim and while riding a hype train with some friends. Ignored it for about a year anf came back to it and loved it. The community discord is fantastic, with channels for every character and people always willing to help. You'll find the link to it on the discussion page.\n\nNow the best way to describe this game (I've used this comparison multiple times and people like it) is that it's Streetfighter, but faster, anime, and has a reward for not being overly defensive. It's kind of Unbalanced though. But it's still a really fun game to play with friends, and with it's sequel UNIST coming to North America within the year (already out in Japan) and being the actually really well balanced version of this game, UNIEL is a good way to dip your toes in to see if you like the overall style.

Simple controls and inputs make crossing the initial execution barrier fairly easy. Even a new player should be able to get the basics down in one to two training sessions. There's even a built-in \"smart-steer\" combo (pushing the A-button repeatedly), but it is wise to graduate from that ASAP if your plan is to play this game competitively as without option-selecting, your offense will be completely ineffective. \nFor any gameplay past beginner-level, learning about spacing and mix-ups is crutial. Damage is generally dealt in combos, so that would be the next game element in the priority order. The execution barrier for them differs from character to character, but effort is far more often than not rewarded. \n\nVisually, the game is pretty to look at. The visual aspect is rooted in the anime style, reflected in the vibrant colours, smooth animation and pleasant sprite-art. It's definitely not breathtaking but should appease anyone who doesn't have exquisite standards.\n\nThe soundtrack doesn't fall behind. The themes are composed to fit the characters, and they do a pretty good job.\n\nA few warnings... The lack of a tutorial makes the entry a bit harder than it should. In order to learn all the uses of the D button, one has to either go through trial and error or consult an external source. If nothing else, the game already has a wiki in english, containing sufficient information on the gameplay basics so the player won't feel completely lost at the start. \nMuch like many other games in the 2D fighting genre, Under Night in-Birth is easy to learn but hard to master. If you want to be any good at it, you'll need to put in some effort.\n\nEdit: Some characters definitely require more patience and effort.

It's sort of... uh... Relevant, at least.\n\nSo this is another one of those games like BlazBlue that just starts off at a full sprint and if you don't know what's going on you're just kind of looking back and forth going \"What the fuck is going on?!\" but this is the first game in the series, you're not missing anything. You have to play through it a few times to figure out the whole thing, but essentially we're in Japan (in actual locations I believe) and occasionally, like Japan does, big holes to another reality open up and horrible monsters from nothingness come out and try to eat you. Most of the time people can't even see them, but people that do USUALLY go nuts or get murdered. This is being in the \"Hollow Night.\" So that's the 'Under Night' part of the title.\n\nThere ARE people that see these creatures and actually survive \"Nights.\" Those that do get special powers, but also get thrown into a sort of not-life not-death that screws with them from that point onward. Those are In-Births. They're mostly the main characters of the story.\n\nWhy Exe:Late? I dunno. Probably for the same reason that Guilty Gear has 'Xrd' tacked on to it now. Or maybe it has a reason and I haven't found it yet.\n\nEither way, the actual fight mechanics are pretty fun, I get a lot of flashbacks to my time with a janked copy of Melty Blood (no not the one in the steam library right now) but it definitely has a Guilty Gear feel as well, similar to BlazBlue, but rather than everyone having a weird super mechanic or meter they're all defined by style and a funny system called Grid Grind which punishes defensive behavior and rewards attack gambles for extra super gauge and easier to access combos.\n\nEither way, real neat fighter!", "timestamp_created": 1499202150, "timestamp_updated": 1499202150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33167777": {"recommendationid": "33167777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141566348", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509171241}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc815\ub9d0 \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc544 \uc808\ub300 \uc81c \ucde8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uadf8\ub7ec\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2c8\uae50 \ud06c\ud760-\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud55c\uae00\ub85c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \ud558\uc2e4 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc740 \uc778\ud130\ub137\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc774\ub809\ud2b8 \uac8c\uc784\uc988 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uc154\uc11c \uadf8\ucabd\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ub9e4\ud558\uc154\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2a4\ud300\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ub9e4\ub97c \ud558\uba74 \ud55c\uae00 \uc548 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1499057851, "timestamp_updated": 1499057851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33163221": {"recommendationid": "33163221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035328638", "num_games_owned": 512, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514737783}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Bem, comprei o jogo na promo\u00e7\u00e3o de ver\u00e3o depois que vi um colega de steam tinha ele rsrs.

I'm someone who's only ever played Street Fighter semi-seriously nearly a decade ago, and who enjoys King of Fighters despite being pathetically awful at it, yet I found it quite easy to jump in. The more unique mechanical aspects of this game, such as the GRD bar that assigns mid-battle power-ups to players based on combat performance, don't create a huge inaccessibility wall - they're a \"simple to understand, hard to master\" kind of thing. GRD even works in conjunction with the normal special bars present in most other fighters, adding an extra layer of strategy. There is far less to take in before you can properly get started when compared to something like King of Fighters, with its many dashes and dodges; it's more akin to Street Fighter in that regard and it should be easier to get your normie friends to play.\n\nSadly, the lack of an in-game tutorial is definitely a flaw, especially since the online video tutorial is Japanese-only and the fan-made translation is not perfect, along with the tutorial itself leaving some thinsg out. Nonetheless, it's the best you have. Since I still recommend this game despite this glaring flaw, I will instruct you on how to get the best out of said tutorial. Simply search \"Under Night In-Birth Exe Late: Basic System & Mechanics Tutorial\" on Youtube and watch both videos while keeping these things in mind: \"blocking hitstun\" is a strange choice of words, as it simply means \"in the process of being attacked while blocking\". The numbered inputs such as \"1/4/7\" refer to numpad directions, so simply look at the right side of your keyboard. KD simply means \"knockdown\". \"Tech\" means escaping from a combo by pressing A, B or C and a direction. Force function is B+C.\n\nNetplay is hit-or-miss. Sometimes you'll easily find people to play with, sometimes not so much. I recommend finding at least one friend willing to play with you regularly before buying. Though to be fair, there is still an aspect of online competition even when playing against the computer - in the form of time attack mode, survival mode and whatnot.\n\nVisually, the game's definitely more good than bad. Some of the character designs have a sort of visual novel blandness to them, lacking the unique appeal of the super-iconically designed Capcom & SNK fighters (or at least strong influences; Street Fighter borrowed a lot from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure after all), but they're definitely not tasteless and the stand-out characters are super appealing; my favorites by far being Merkava, an Evangelion Unit 01-like monstrosity with shape-shifting powers and fittingly beastly attacks and animations, and the obviously Cyborg 009-influenced Akatsuki, cameo-ing from the game Akatsuki Blitzkrampf. The animations, though, are where the game shines from a visual perspective. They might not be as mind-blowing as the stuff you'll find in games like Darkstalkers or Garou: Mark of the Wolves, but they're still quite impressive. Even looking at Merkava's idle animations should be enough, with his hyper-fluid and organic breathing animation and his ethereal flowing hair both resembling something out of an anime with particularly high production values. \n\nThe Infinite Worth animations are suitably over the top, yet they go beyond mere serviceability with a really cool detail that goes a long way; they are punctuated with brief, snappy, yet fully-animated sequences taking up the entire screen vertically. It's a great way of adding cinematic flair to a game without sacrificing gameplay.\n\nThe music hasn't hugely grabbed me, but it definitely adds to the overall cool feeling of the experience.\n\nOverall a fun game, well worth the 7,27\u20ac I paid for it.

However, if you have a bunch of friends who you want to play with to get ready for the new one, it's a really well made fighting game. The core mechanics of this game reward fun and exciting gameplay, for the most part. UNIEL is often dubbed \"the anime street fighter\" because it is pretty ground based, but I think as of right now this game is more enjoyable than SFV. The one question a lot of people have about fighting games before they buy them is if the netcode is stable enough for it to be worth, and honestly, this game has pretty decent netcode. The art style is really cool. All the sprites look really well made and the stages look really cool. The game has unlockable color palettes with currency you get from playing the game too, which is cool. Have I mentioned the soundtrack? The character themes, loading music and everything in UNIEL music wise sounds really really good, and has a lot of personality. Also, maybe just a personal preference, but the lobby screens look really beautiful. The only REAL problems in this game are the lack of story mode (which is forgivable, there is arcade with bits of story in there), and character balance. The top 3 characters in the game, Gordeau, Merkava, and Waldstein, are way ahead of the rest of the cast in pretty much everything. But even then it isn't that huge of a deal. There is just a lot of content for a $30 price tag, which says a lot in the current era of big $50-$60 fighting games. Even Blazblue is $40, and I personally prefer this game to that. Honestly, wait for the new one to come out unless you are getting this with a couple friends. And if you normally don't like anime games but you're willing to try them, start here. UNIEL is a really good introduction to anime, especially since it feels a little like street fighter. Buy the new one on launch.

I really can't get enough of it, and I honestly can't wait until they port the next game to Steam.\n\nThey put quite a bit of work into the stories behind the characters, even if you have to play the previous game to get most of it. Each character has a really cool personality that's different from all the others and you really will get attached to your main after seeing their different victory quotes after every round you win. It's not terribly complex or anything, more or less just a bit better than what you'd normally expect from an anime fighting game. \n\nThe gameplay is literally do or die. When you get good with combos you'll start to realize that once you get one started, it usually lasts long enough to get your opponent to around 25% health. *cough* SETH *cough*\nThey also have a really cool mechanic. Basically, you have a thing called a Guard Meter at the bottom of the screen between both players' health that fills up as you pressure your opponent and stay close to them. Moving back will make your meter go down. After a certain point, while you have meter, you'll be able to perform something called a Chain Shift. Basically, this consumes your meter to immediately cancel all lag, allow you to cancel into another move, and increases your EXS Gauge based on how much meter you consumed when you performed this. It's the best way to continue your supposed-to-end combos into longer ones. \nThen of course, you have the EXS Gauge, which I mentioned earlier. Just like every other super gauge in anime fighting games. By pressing C (on the fight pad) you'll consume part of it to turn whatever move you were using into an EXS variant, which will do much more damage and has more invincibility. \nAnd finally, each character has their own cool cutscene when they do their Infinite Worth, which is their strongest move, consuming 200% of the EXS Gauge. Some last longer than others, but it boils down to the fact that it looks exactly like what you'd want to see from a character's most powerful move. \n \nAll in all, I'd give this game a 9/10. It has a couple small points that could be changed, and the netcode is pretty shit.

Incorporating a tug-of-war-like momentum gauge that physically rewards the player in favour? Genius. Now, of course, that's not to say that no other fighting game has something like it. After all, all do in the form of the classic 'super gauge', but that momentum is in the form of theoretical rewards, since the super gauge must be expended in order to be capitalised on, whereas UNIEL's Grind Grid (a.k.a. GRD) buffs automatically the player who has the momentum according to the games' rules.\n\nOther areas in which the game excels are in its relatively less challenging skill caliber requirement for players new to anime fighting games (or even fighting games in general), and the fact that although impractical, extremely-situational high damage combos exist, the game will not restrict your combos (unlike BBCPE) yet you won't die in one combo, and nearly all of them end in a knockdown. Also, the move (not movement) animations of each character reveal their personas exceptionally, in a way that I have rarely seen in fighting games (most of the time it is revealed only in their movement or idle animations).\n\nSome notably good things about the game that aren't necessarily exceptional is the fact that there is a story that is not difficult to follow (and has its dedicated mode, too) and that there are more modes than just Training, Arcade, and Versus modes. I don't like that there isn't a depthful tutorial for this great game so that new entries into the FG scene can be enlightened and encouraged from square one. However, at least there are brief yet comprehensive official tutorials (that are in Japanese! D'x ) for each character on YouTube (and one YouTuber has even subbed most of them for English speakers) and should help with at least learning a character of the player's choice, though the system is not explained well enough in those tutorials, so third-party wikis are almost necessary to fully grasp the game mechanics.\n\nNow, the reason why this game won't be earning the highest mark overall has most to do with both the balancing of the characters (i.e., the meta). I am very fond of games that have a small meta, since it makes it easier to learn all of the matchups (and Xrd R has done this perfectly), but in this case the curve is insanely skewed. Really the only characters seen in the competitive scene on a regular basis are Merkava, Gordeau, Eltnum, Waldstein, Linne (and the occasional troll Akatsuki), all five of which are the top five best characters in the game by overall favourable matchups (according to EventHubs; though my opinion closely matches theirs). Merkava, Gordeau, and Waldstein all have ridiculously long reach, which requires extreme patience, composure, and discipline to work around. This, and the fact that consoles/PC haven't yet received a port for the newest version, are some of the reasons why this game has not received its deserved acclaim in the competitive FGC.\n\nThere is also the overpowered-ness of some characters over others (yes, and I am legitimised in using this word, even though OP is overused, typically by novice players). The rule of thumb in this game is that characters with absolutely poor range (like Nanase and Orie) are almost 92% guaranteed to be bodied by characters who either are zoners (like Hilda or Vatista) or have stupid reach (like Gordeau and Merkava). Some trolls online will abuse this rule to keep you out and frustrate you; if you don't enjoy this idea, then either don't play online or reconsider whether this is a good buy (or if you're looking at your computer reading this review and see that I am enjoying this abuse of parentheses, you can either endure through it to the end or I suppose you can downvote this review; though I'm sure that if you've been reading this far you have found it to be at least a little helpful c; ). Fixing this, however, is as simple as resizing the hurtboxes of moves that make this rule law and releasing another version, which I'm sure the company will do if there is enough support. Either way, this is one of the main reasons that the curve is so skewed. And also: putting a shoto-clone character in an anime fighting game? That's like a day-one no-no (this is a note to French Bread to buff Akatsuki, which I hear has already happened in UNIst; please port this game to console/PC).\n\nTL;DR (yeah, I had to use this for once)\n\nPros:\n- Unique and exceptional game system\n- Easy-to-follow storyline with a story mode in visual-novel format\n- More offline content than just the classic three (Training, Arcade, and Versus)\n- Intricate character-defining move animations (something I rarely see in fighting games)\n- Great entryway for novice fighting gamers looking to have their first exposure to one (Smart Steer auto combo by pressing A seven times, freeflow gatlings, etc.)\n- Has a combo system that allows for freedom without having the traditionally long combos of most anime FGs\n- Low skill ceiling compared to mainstream FGs (SF, GG, etc.)\n- Small meta\n\nCons:\n- Unbalanced\n- No tutorial mode\n- Some anime fluff (i.e., fanservice)\n- So-so netcode\n- Small meta\n\nOverall: 8.8/10 (I'm rating it higher than I would otherwise because of UNIst's improvements from this version, UNIEL)\n\n*EDIT* (20.04.17; time 20:04) - after posting this review, I was looking through UNIEL's discussion forums here on Steam and saw the discussion about UNIst's confirmed forthcoming port to consoles (along with a tutorial mode 0_0). If this excites you, you can brace yourself for the new release along with its proposed improvements, and delay buying this version.

Feels a lot like blazBlue which is fine. \n\nSomething I dislike a lot is how high you spin out considering the spinout mechanics. Sure, you use it to control where you land so your opponent doesn't have all the control in a dropped combo. I just don't like how it looks. It looks like I should be able to hit a button and come down with an attack, but I can't so I just land like a dufus, usually pressing a button, and get hit for it and back into another combo. \n\nI'm also not a fan of the fact that someone who was hard knockdowned has like... I wanna say 2 or 3 frames of invinicibility on wakeup. I get swiped by crouching lights a lot when they get up and I have a hitbox inside of them. Then they get full combo because light naturally auto cancels into mediums and heavies on mash. \n\nI like the air dash mechanic. Smart choice to only go forward. \n\nI like the character designs. \n\nI thought it was funny the way the windmil's story (spoilers btw) was about her being pissed she became this demon thing. Even though she looks fine and all she does is talk about it like she was raped. Though the joke fell seriously flat when she starts going over terms like chastity that aren't synonomous with the demon transformation. Took me out of the joke when they revealed the punchline because misdirection in humor shouldn't be to lie to the audience. \n\nI love the variety. Granted, 3 characters feel like copies of eachother, but everyone else has their own look and feel that I really appreciate. \n\nIt looks nice. \n\nThe netcode is super duper awesome. \n\nIt's a very easy game to pick up and get good at (took me about a week to stop losing.) \n\nCarmine not being able to do any chip damage with his projectiles bugs me, but I'll get over it unless they wanna fix it.

This game somewhat seems like a standard anime fighter, with just a smaller cast than some of the bigger titles like Guilty Gear or BlazBlue, but it's definitely unique.  This game's unique feature is the \"Grind Grid\" system, or GRD for short.  It's a mechanic in which both players have access to, but will give an advantage to those who play more offensively, or whose defense outperforms the one on the offensive.  It also discourages overtly unsafe or campy play, so having your throw attempts rejected, backdashing constantly, and having your blockstrings blocked with the barrier lowers your GRD meter.  In short, the GRD system is basically a carry/comeback mechanic, as it can benefit honest, safe offense or defense.  \n\nMoving from the gameplay for a bit, the art is amazing, as is with most ASW games, with the usual cast of characters in most anime fighting games: you have your sword-wielding edgy main protagonist, your battle loli who's actually a couple hundred years old, your giant-fist sporting behemoth of a character that moves and hits like a bag of bricks, your bishie-looking a$$hole, and you have your genki-as-fuck female character with the annoying voice.  The game even has two guest characters from two other games made by French Bread (the developers of this game): Sion Eltnam from Melty Blood (some say its a different character entirely cuz the name is spelled Eltnum, but you ain't fooling me, French Bread), and Akatsuki from Akatsuki Blitzkampf.  While you have your usual tropes, there are some characters that definitely break the usual mold, such as a mage teen with a giant ass lizard at his disposal and a giant being that to me looks like a fusion between Susaan'o from BlazBlue and Twelve from Street Fighter.  There are also some characters that definitely have movesets similar to characters from other ASW games, such as the blood-controlling Carmine, who has some fullscreen bullcrap that he uses to space much like Yuki Terumi, and Orie, who looks like Mitsuru and literally has a Persona/Stand (which ever you prefer lol).  The roster is small, but fortunately, there's no two characters that have similar properties to another.\n\nAs for my impressions when playing, the game plays wonderfully.  A new player can feel safe knowing that mashing standing weak can literally do an auto-combo, but veterans can feel good knowing that there are more options beyond standing weak for combos lol.  The combo system is similar to BlazBlue, allowing for OTG resets that, from what I've played so far, most characters can do, like Hyde (the main protagonist) when using 3C, and relies on a combo meter that, upon depletion, allows the combo victim to ukemi, or 'tech,' out of the combo state.  Each character has their own unique command normals, some can double jump, some can't, and only a few (Eltnum and Akatsuki, from what I remember) can air grab.  As such, you won't have to worry about anyone being a clone of another character in the roster, and can find a variety of playstyles to choose from.\n\nHowever, I do have a couple of discrepancies.  For one, this game has a very small, but dedicated and helpful community, but if you want to find matches, I'd suggest going to the UNiEL discord server.  You'll find a lot of resources and helpful people on your journey to advance your skill.  Secondly, the price tag of this game is a bit much, so unless you really want a change of pace, I'd wait for it to go on sale.  Finally, the game lacks a tutorial mode, so if you want to learn the game, again, check out the UNiEL discord or go to the Mizuumi Wiki to check on the game's mechanics.\n\nAll in all, Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late is a great game, good for newcomers and veterans alike, and is definitely worth a look. 9.25/10", "timestamp_created": 1491144436, "timestamp_updated": 1491145904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604079", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30872395": {"recommendationid": "30872395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198093774", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492006089}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u8d28\u8fd8\u884c\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u7f8e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u8fde\u62db\u6559\u5b66\uff0c\u8981\u81ea\u5df1\u6478\u7d22\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1491040350, "timestamp_updated": 1491040350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30866047": {"recommendationid": "30866047", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987994982", "num_games_owned": 463, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492599974}, "language": "english", "review": "Just got this on sale since haven't heard of Late(st) version announcement for ages. \n\nI am a huge fan of Melty Blood series and reading through Sion (Eltnum here) story gave me so much laugh, she is adorable.

attension and wish that I could play it Untill Now that it comes to steam and I can enjoy it as much as I want.\ngameplay is really interesting its not looks like the games that you play before if you play BlazBlue you should know that the game have two mechanic for input one technical and the other is Stylish in Under Night when you play the game it feels like the Stylish mode which by pressing a button repeatedly the character will perform a combo but its not just this beginners like me that didnt play this game before prefer to just use this method at first but more and more you play the game you realize that you can do better and you will make your own combo by combining moves together the gameplay is simple but hard to master so keep practicing and you will become a pro player.\n\npros:\ncool gamplay\nbuffs in Fight (corpal state)\nso many special move and super moves for each character\neach character has its own play style and you must practice with each to realize which one suits you\nUnlockable colors via Points\n\nNeg:\nI dont see any the game is cool but there is few people in online mode which I dont know why and I wish that there is more\n\nat the end I

The game's art style and aesthetics are amazing. One of French Bread's main goals with UNIB was definitely style, and they succeeded undoubtedly. Compared to most anime fighters, it's simple, yet very sleek. As the title suggests, UNIB's world is in a state of seemingly perpetual nighttime, yet the designers kept the lighting strong with bright moonlight and cool color tones, all contrasted with hard strikes of red throughout. UNIB also aims for a \"modern fantasy\" look, which it does very well, making its universe fit snug into the look of the new millennium. It may not be as beautiful as Guilty Gear Xrd's spot-on anime cell shading, nor as complex and excruciatingly detailed as BlazBlue, but its looks send a strong message regardless, so maybe it doesn't need it in the end.\n\n#2: The fighting system is very solid, appearing quite accessible and easy to learn at first, but it masks much deeper systems for more hardcore players to sink their teeth into, as any good fighter does. While things like long, hard-to-execute combos and deceptive mixups and setups are apparent, UNIB's main focus seems to be poured into the neutral game, encouraging the player to get better at being patient, finding openings, and making the opponent respect you. No fighting game is ever easy, and those who say they are are lying to your face, but UNIB is likely one of the more accessible fighters out on the market.\n\n#3. The game's unique \"GRID\" system is something I haven't encountered before, but it offers a new level of gameplay to the table, and enforces the points I made in Pro #2. Put very simply, it's a tug-of-war mechanic between you and your opponent, plainly telling you who has the advantage and disadvantage in the fight, and rewarding the one who can keep up the advantage. It rewards and punishes you for doing various actions both offensively and defensively, playing into UNIB's encouragement of learning the neutral game. You are free to ignore the GRID system and play how you like, but considering it can give you buffs such as a straight damage increase, as well as the ability to instantly cancel practically anything for both offensive and defensive reasons, you might as well learn it.\n\n#4. What UNIB lacks in character quantity, it makes up for in quality. Everyone in the cast plays differently and has their own systems to learn. Of course some characters are easier to learn than others, but that doesn't make trying out the more complicated ones any less fun. The characters' looks and personalities are also diverse, while simultaneously fitting into the game's world. Want to feel like a boss? Pick up Gordeau or Linne. Prefer the edgier types? Try Seth or Carmine. Don't like being human? Merkava's right there. Not interested in UNIB's main cast at all? Mess with Eltnum or Akatsuki, the guest characters.\n\n#5. The soundtrack is pretty good. Excluding a few tracks, I have heard better, but all the songs fit the game's universe and characters quite well. If you like rock, electronica, piano tunes, and/or a mixture of the three, you'll enjoy this soundtrack. If you like anime soundtracks in general, you might just have to add this one to your collection. I can see the potential of the game's music really coming into its own in future installments, especially from what I'm hearing in the series' latest iteration, Late[st].\n\nCons (Ranked in terms of woe):\n\n#1. The online netcode can be choppy and inconsistent. While actual matches rarely ever lag, I've had trouble connecting to some player lobbies, as well as instances where everyone would suddenly disconnect from the lobby, leaving the host alone. It's certainly not the worst netcode out there, and you can chalk up most of the netcode problems to usual stuff like distance lag or computer performance, but the game could use a few more patches to refine it and make things more stable.\n\n#2. UNIB is an anime fighter, and not the most popular anime fighter out there, so don't expect a 24/7 steady flow of player lobbies and ranked matches. The game is ~4 years old if you count arcade releases, but only ~2 years old in terms of mainstream console releases. UNIB as a whole is still a budding flower in a land of old, experienced veterans, so the population surrounding the game is still gaining traction. Some people are fine with that and like growing along with a series, but for those who want a large community to jump into, you'll struggle a bit. You can take comfort in the fact that what community is here is largely friendly and helpful, however.\n\n#3. There is no in-game formal tutorial to teach you the in-and-outs of the game's mechanics. The available practice mode is rather extensive and customizable, but there's nothing to directly tell you how something works, something that BlazBlue and Guilty Gear Xrd have an edge over UNIB about. A bit of Googling and reading/watching, or consulting someone who's knowledgeable of the game, will fix that issue pretty fast, but for those spoiled by the recent inclusion of extensive tutorials in more popular fighters nowadays, this might prove as a minor annoyance for them.\n\n#4. It's not immediately obvious, but the game's character balance in this edition of the UNIB series is a bit polarized. Nothing broken by any means, but some characters struggle to be a huge threat in a match, and others dominate the tiers with an iron fist. Characters like Gordeau, Merkava, and Waldstein will have players rubbing their temples in frustration trying to figure out how to get past their amazing tools, and characters like Seth, Chaos, and Akatsuki are a game in of themselves in optimizing their effectiveness. It's not the worst and most confusing balancing out there, though, and you can learn how to handle anyone with time and effort. It's just more of a struggle compared to the balance of UNIB's latest edition, Late[st], which is arcade-exclusive currently.\n\n#5. For those wishing to seek good stories in fighting games, well... 1. You're a trooper, and 2. UNIB's story can be hard to get into without a wiki handy. There isn't really a gradual introduction into the game's universe and terminology, and while playing through every character's arcade path can give you a better idea of what's going on, you might be left wondering what the heck you're reading initially. When you do understand, though, the story is actually pretty interesting, and has a lot of potential. What's currently here in UNIEL offers more of an establishment of setting and characters, and leaves a lot of the bigger plot points, backstories, and developments in mystery.\n\nThere's some other minors things I could praise or gripe about, but this should cover the main points of interest. Plus I believe I've gone on long enough, lol. Personally, I'm making this game one of my main fighters along with Tekken, just because there's so much this game has that appeals to me. I highly recommend that you at least give this a try, whether you do or don't like fighters, and I'm very eager to see the future developments of this series.", "timestamp_created": 1469332558, "timestamp_updated": 1469332558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24489728": {"recommendationid": "24489728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309207006", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496803157}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good game but why its running slow, please fix it,sometimes game stucks when a ranked match its canceled , NANASE need to be fixed and improve her recovery and balance please , i really like this game but it need to be fixed, also bring VERSION ST soon  please.", "timestamp_created": 1469319950, "timestamp_updated": 1469670969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24482247": {"recommendationid": "24482247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294748204", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509038110}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519 \uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u5bf9\u6218\u5b58\u6863\u529f\u80fd\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0d\u80fd\u7528", "timestamp_created": 1469291328, "timestamp_updated": 1469291328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24480912": {"recommendationid": "24480912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319141225", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487544508}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing artwork, neat character designs from both visual and gameplay perspectives, deep yet accessible core mechanics to all levels of play.

Well, first off, let me preface with: I am not a fan of anime. I am not a fan of anime fighting games. However, I am a fan of fighting games and I always thought this game had some solid mechanics, a diverse roster and was made by French Bread, the company that made the Melty Blood series. I first played this game in a JPN arcade in my travels about 3 years ago now and fell in love with Merkava like, instantly. When I got back home, I found out it had a PS3 release and so, I quickly scooped that up on a JPN PSN account. I got some friends into the game and damn was it fun. Unfortunately, it died out rather quickly on PS3 but I definitely had some good times with it. I had a purple square (the highest player rating) and everything.\n\nFast forward to 2016 and I find out this game is now on steam. With nostalgia in my pocket, I quickly got the game again. The rust is definitely there but I am working out those kinks and am currently up to an orange square (2nd best player rating) and keep on training in this game with little more purpose than the love of the game.\n\nSo, as you can see, I definitely have a history with UNIB/UNIEL and I have many, many more hours than what my steam says. So, why do I like this game? What do I dislike? Let me make a quick rundown of both:\n\n+Pros\n*Easy to pick up and play. It's very user-friendly if you played fighting games before.\n*Diverse roster. There aren't any clone characters in the game.\n*Merkava. My bae. <3\n*Good netcode... when 2 bars or higher.\n*High skill ceiling. There's a lot of tech to this game, a lot of which you have to figure out yourself. This promotes the notion of player growth wherein as they get more skilled, they really have something to show for it.\n*Has an actual story mode... unlike a certain other fighting game that was released this year that didn't get a story mode for several months...\n\n-Cons\n*This game isn't particularly balanced. You will have to work much harder with a low tier character than a top tier one. That being said, there are plenty of viable characters and, as stated before, you can win if you are a skilled player; you just will have to work harder.\n*When it rains; it pours. This game's netcode, when you're playing against someone with poor ping to you, is reaaally hard to play in. This can be circumvented by only playing people 2+ bars or higher to you though.\n*Not a large community. Since this game is fairly obscure, there isn't a large playerbase. This isn't the game's fault but it can be frustrating to find matches, especially if you beat a player and they refuse to rematch you.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of fighting games or anime or whatever floats your boat. If you want to learn the mechanics of the game and whatnot, I suggest looking to dustloop or the mizuumi wiki to learn more about the game, your character and tech for UNIEL.

Of course, if you're nostalgic of the PS3 version, go for it, but here's what, as a newcomer, the game feels like:\n\nPros:\n-Good netcode (no lag)\n-Nice character design, each having a pretty unique style\n-Very good OST\n-A good number of modes and content\n-Hum... Nice color palettes on the character? I like that your projectile's color and such will change accordingly to your weapon's color\n\nCons:\n-New players are absolutely not welcome (only experienced players are to be found online)\n-The online is already next to dead\n-Nothing to let you learn character's combos or even the game's very basics (so yeah, if you don't know this game, run towards Guilty Gear Xrd, not this, it's better on pretty much every aspect)\n-Very few characters are actually technical to play, most don't have anything unique or interesting \"mechanic-wise\"\n-Combos are annoyingly long and the game doesn't have any burst mechanic to escape them\n-Only 2 people can play in an online room, others have to wait\n-No real chat in the said room\n-You have to choose your character, stage and OST before each game (which is a detail, but feels like the loading screen of a loading screen)\n-Some combined inputs have a shortcut, some don't (ie: you have to use JoyToKey to get a A+B button, which is really useful to Seth players)\n\nOverall, the most fun you'll end up having is in training mode, trying to do what you see in youtube combos videos", "timestamp_created": 1468735507, "timestamp_updated": 1468735507, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.404872", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24363107": {"recommendationid": "24363107", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979661647", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469567947}, "language": "english", "review": "Summary: UNIEL is a great game, enjoyable from all ranges of skill level.\nThe gameplay is smooth, combos are a breeze to perform and every character is interesting.\nHowever, the game has it's flaws : Kinda bland character design, and (as I am writing this review) EXTREMELY whimsical netcode.\nIs it a good buy? Despite the netcode, I enjoy every single bit of it. So, yes, go ahead!\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*][b]Decent mechanical design[/b]. UNIEL's characters are, gameplay-wise, very well made and inventive, and some of the main game mechanics are very interesting (GRD in mind). However, it limits it's reset/combo game by adding restraining mechanics : Hitstun is reduced after every hit, forcing the opponent out of your grasp, and their teching recovery has a lot of advantages, such as full invulnerability during the whole animation, and cancellable frames, which almost completely prevent grab resets and the likes (crossups, despite the protections, work well in certain cases).\n[*][b]Good Soundtrack.[/b]\n[*][b]A diverse cast of characters[/b], ranging from hard rushdown with airdashes (Seth) to screen-wide zoning (Hilda/Vatista), (pup)pet characters (Chaos), etc.\n[*][b]Decent spritework[/b]. This does not reach SNK levels of quality, but still manages to look good.\n[*][b]Ok low-poly backgrounds[/b].\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*][b]Kinda uninspired character design[/b]. Most characters have almost stereotyped, underdeveloped personalities, and their visual design is edgy as f***, this might put off people who dislike japanese-styled graphics, as well as older or more close-minded gamers.\n[*][b]Lack of tutorials/trials[/b]. UNIEL doesn't take you by hand, you're on your own if you wish to learn the game and git gud. Resources online are mostly in japanese, a scarce amount of them being translated or written in english.\n[*](Might change)[b]Terrible, whimsical netcode[/b]. Decent online matches will only happen against people with [b]extremely[/b] stable network, as the delay function doesn't work in a good, logical way. Once there is even one single lagspike during a match, even if the latency is super low overall, the game will add ridiculously long delays to your inputs, for them to never come down for the rest of the match. FPS drops also influence the netcode somehow. This will cripple you infinitely, especially if you play fast, input-heavy characters such as Seth for instance.

Each match went with very little, to no lag whatsoever. (And these were on 2 and 3 bar connections)\n\nOnly thing I was hoping they would decide to add in, would have been a challenge or trial mode. This way it would help to guide newer players into the game by teaching them basic BnB combos, and other things.

I always get excited looking at the games but when it came time to find a character that I would main or at least do the trails with, I was never really able to find anyone who drew my attention or fit my playstyle.\n\nAnd here comes UNIEL a game where I can't decide who I want to main because everyone is fun to play!\n\nThe artwork in the game is beautiful and the gameplay is buttery smooth. In my opinon it is the easiest of the ArcSys published games to get into that I have played.  I mainly play Street Fighter and transitioning to this game right after was incredibly easy (due the the imputs being very similar). The controls are simple compared to some of the other ArcSys games. The game speed and movement is more grounded (not everyone has a double jump, 1 air dash) and I like seeing parts of other ArcSys games that I did enjoy show up in here (moves and customization). \n\n[b][u]Now to address the current state of online. -July 14 2016[/u][/b] - [b]THE NETCODE IS AVERAGE![/b]\nThe games I have played online have ran better than SFV lobby matches tend to (no hate to sfv) and that was playing people with 1 bar connections (stages take a bit to load and the game stutters every now and then but not once has someone teleported across the screen). Some stages take a while to load if the connection to the host is weak (just play training stage online if needed, there are one or two others which load quite quick).\n\nYes the game has issues and bugs (none of which havent been solved with a simple restart of the game), as all games do in their first week or two of a launch. I would just like to remind others of this due to complaints of the game being buggy. Almost all fighting games launch a bit messed up due to how small the teams that work on certain parts of the game are. \n\nIn conclusion I can easliy suggest UNIEL to ANYONE who as a intrest in the anime fighting game genre.", "timestamp_created": 1468550077, "timestamp_updated": 1468550150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24325854": {"recommendationid": "24325854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043381029", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501204361}, "language": "english", "review": "greenshield b tatsu", "timestamp_created": 1468547436, "timestamp_updated": 1468547436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24324723": {"recommendationid": "24324723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062272923", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510712583}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "waifu", "timestamp_created": 1468541006, "timestamp_updated": 1468541006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24320919": {"recommendationid": "24320919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044248040", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506246321}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21 \u0e40\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e42\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e14 \u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01yuzuriha 10/10 \u0e41\u0e04\u0e48\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e19\u0e21\u0e01\u0e47\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27!! //\u0e25\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1468525844, "timestamp_updated": 1468525844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24319313": {"recommendationid": "24319313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250127510", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495620162}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7f51\u6218\u6bd4ps3\u597d\u591a\u4e86\n\u4f46\u662f\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u600e\u4e48\u76f4\u63a5\u9009 \u88c5\u5907\u7684\u989c\u8272", "timestamp_created": 1468520067, "timestamp_updated": 1468520067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24318156": {"recommendationid": "24318156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024592068", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513390840}, "language": "english", "review": "Now I can main Sion in 2 games!!!", "timestamp_created": 1468515931, "timestamp_updated": 1468515931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24317429": {"recommendationid": "24317429", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999027324", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498509255}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n- nice graphics\n- gameplay is pretty cool, it's less air based than most anime fighters and combos are slightly less overwhelming than usual.\n- interesting character design\n- netplay is totally fine for me with no really noticeable input lag or network delay, although many people report issues. I think if you play it on a good PC and against people who aren't on the other side of the world you'll be fine.\n- if you're into achievements, you can pretty much 100% the game in 8-9 hours\n\nCons:\n- this is basically a lazy 1:1 port of a PS3 title released 3 years ago and they're asking 30 bucks for it. They even left PS buttons in some menus, come on.\n- absolute lack of any kind of tutorial inside the game, which is a shame for a relatively technical fighter in 2016.\n- single player content is much poorer and more boring than in other titles published by ASW.\n- on day 2 there is already almost no one playing it online whether in ranked or in player matches...\n- ...and the only opponents you'll find clearly already have a ton of experience in this type of games or even in this game in particular. They won't hesitate to counterpick your character and steamroll you to show that you're not welcome.\n\nI'd really like to recommend UNIEL as an introduction to anime fighters, but as it is it can only interest seasoned FG players. If you want more and better SP content as well as flawless netplay (sadly without players), buy Skullgirls. If you're new to fighting games and you wanna play online against a lot of opponents around your level, you'd better pick Street Fighter V which may cost you more but at least won't be dead in a

Asw.\n\nJugabilidad: Es similar al Melty Blood pero mas evolucionado y con mecanicas a\u00f1adidas , se basa en encadenar combos cuanto mas largos mejor y en este caso se ha a\u00f1adido un medidor llamado \"grid\" el cual nos bonificar\u00e1 o penalizar\u00e1 segun las acciones que hagamos , atacar , huir , etc....\n\nGraficos: Supera notablemente al Melty Blood pero por debajo de Blazblue o Guilty Gear Sign , en las animaciones y sobretodo en los escenarios que a pesar de ser en 3d se encuentran totalmente desiertos sin ningun tipo de detalles ofreciendo sensacion de no estar acabados.\nPor otro lado el dise\u00f1o de los personajes al mas puro estilo anime es muy bueno.\n\nSonido: Buena musica , acompa\u00f1a bastante bien en el juego , voces en japones y los efectos tipicos de los titulos de Asw.\n\nDuracion: El juego cuenta con los modos clasicos de toda la vida , arcade , vs , training , online , etc....\nEl plantel de personajes no es muy extenso pero la cantidad de tecnicas que poseen cada uno y las formas de combinarlas nos tendran muchas horas ante la pantalla , si bien hubiese sido necesario un modo tutorial , pues , la mecanica es bastante profunda y al principio podemos liarnos bastante.\nEl online lo he intentado unas 6 veces y solo he podido jugar una , cuesta muuucho encontrar partida , pero eso si , la que he jugado iba bastante bien.\n\nConclusion: Si te gustan los juegos de peleas compra obligada , es un genero que escasea y ademas el juego cumple su funcion mas principal , divertir.\nEso s\u00ed , abstenerse de jugar con gente de nivel por que no os dejaran ni moveros. xDD\nEl gran punto negativo , vuelvo a recalcarlo es que no traiga un modo tutorial o desafios para aprender las mecanicas del juego.\nAhm , se me olvidaba , si teneis problemas de tearing , se debe a que el Vsync viene desactivado , teneis que forzarlo desde el panel de la grafica.\n\nAdjunto a modo de guia unos enlaces (en perfecto

I'm a left-handed keyboard player, so I had to map the movement keys to O, K, L, and :, and the buttons to Q, W, E, 1, and 3 as to not overlap with the default W, A, S, D that you're forced to use in the menu.

The OST is the best in the fighting game genre with it's variety of character's. Different characters to choose from, different stages and modes to play through. You can enjoy various gameplay mode's such as Arcade, Survival, Time Attack, Training and Network! You can also customize your characters by puchasing colors set to your profile, as well as your online Avatar, Title plate, and title! Play in VS, Arcade, or Network to rake IP points to buy all colors! *10 additional colors for every character to purchase in the store*. \n\nUnder Night in-Birth is my favorite fighting game, however, it is being proclaimed dead by the FGC. It my favorite fighting game, I will give it my honest review for anyone than being biased about their traits. \n\nGameplay (8/10): For those who enjoy fast, chain-combo'ing fighting games, this one's for you! If you've enjoyed Blazblue or any of it's iterations, give this one a shot! Flashy vibrant colors, awesome sound effects, and an enjoyable soundtrack to go through makes this the perfect anime fighting game. Different variety of characters to choose from, all being very distinct to their character and not being copy/pasted. Modes ranging from Arcade, Time attack, Survival, and Network, you can choose to play different types for maximum playthrough. \n\nNetcode/Online (8/10): Having played Network as soon as the release, based off the initial Netcode, it is most like the PS3 version of  the game. Rarely any lag spikes, and smooth sailing for your combos. \n\nArtstyle (10/10): The game's beautiful!!

You might be more familiar with their work on Melty Blood, and if you are then you should certainly already know the quality of the game. The roster in UNIEL is amazingly varied, with everything from your robotic lolita girl, to a creature that looks like he came straight out of EVA. Gameplay-wise, the roster is balanced as well, with the top-tiers not being as dominating as one would usually think they are in an anime fighting game.\n\nOne thing that might shy people away from the game is their previous experience with anime fighters, the overly fast pace and intense combo game in particular. While there is potential for long, execution-heavy combos, they are not mandatory to learn the game, which is going to come as a relief to many. Your bread and butter can be found online without much difficulty, and the community tends to be very welcoming towards newcomers.\n\nWith it previously having been a PS3 exclusive, the PC playerbase have previously not had access to the game. Fighting games have a terrible tendency of getting the previous iteration released on PC just when the new one is coming out, but that's not the case this time around, as the sequel titled UNIst, is still not out on console. UNIEL is the latest iteration on the franchise both on PC and console, so don't worry about making a poor business decision in that sense. \n\n\nI hope you all have as much fun with this game as I have.

That being said, this game is criminally under rated. It's a fantastic fighter game with some of the best music in any game today (just look up \"Beat Eat Nest\" and \"Blood Drain -again-\" for examples). Each charecter feels unique and like they have a story behind them, which you get to explore a little with story scenes in the arcade mode. Controls feel great and playing with friends online is great fun. Not to mention, this game runs smoothly on even the weakest of computers.\n\nNo game is perfect though, and here are a few of the issues I have with this game. This game was clearly made for arcade machines, and playing using a keyboard can be very difficult, but just plug in a controller and you should have no problems. Content can feel a bit short, with no real story mode, and a lack of a tutorial, plus often times difficult inputs really puts a high learning curve on this game.\n\nI love this game, it's personally one of my favorite games out there, and the release of Under Night In-Birth Exe:Latest for the playstation 3, 4, and vita, fixed many of the issues stated above, and hopefully we will see a PC release as well. What really makes me sad is how little there is in the community about this game. No one has really heard of it, and tutorials and other informtion on the game are extremely hard to come by. Hopefully, Under Night will get the recognition it deserves in the future.

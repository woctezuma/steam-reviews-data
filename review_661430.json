As the levels progress, several additional mechanics are thrown into the mix such as rectangular tiles and tiles that can only be filled in by wrapping around them in a circle.\n\nThe concept here isn't exactly original, nor do the majority of the levels pose a significant challenge \u2014 out of the ~50 levels, I'm going to say I had to take my time with only around 10 of them. My total playtime according to Steam is only 2.4 hours, and I am fairly certain at least a third of that was because I forgot to turn the game off while I was doing something else. Quite frankly, there are other games on Steam in the line-drawing subgenre that have been released prior, such as [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/357600/Unium/]Unium[/url], that will likely give you more bang for your buck.\n\nThat being said, the presentation of the game hit all the right notes for me. The minimalist palette is easy on the eyes, the sole music track is pleasant and unobtrusive, and sprightly sound effects play as tiles are filled in and levels are completed. It's a very soothing experience.\n\nOverall, for a dollar, this is a nice, easygoing puzzle game that I recommend as a bite-sized relaxer.", "timestamp_created": 1515649726, "timestamp_updated": 1515649726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39162165": {"recommendationid": "39162165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042701126", "num_games_owned": 1609, "num_reviews": 230, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "last_played": 1515331336}, "language": "english", "review": "A very interesting puzzle game, with difficulty from easy to hard with decent learning curve, it have about 80 diferent levels to complete.\nSimplistic graphic, relaxing music and some funny sound effect, if you like puzzles, try this one, very good to pass time.", "timestamp_created": 1515354154, "timestamp_updated": 1515354154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39161975": {"recommendationid": "39161975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008538874", "num_games_owned": 809, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500320920}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u7c21\u55ae\u6613\u7834\u7684\u76ca\u667a\u904a\u6232\uff0c\u97f3\u6a02\u4e0d\u932f~", "timestamp_created": 1515353751, "timestamp_updated": 1515353751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39088633": {"recommendationid": "39088633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383742878", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1515412726}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud3c9\ubc94\ud55c \ud55c\ubd93 \uadf8\ub9ac\uae30 \uc2dd \uac8c\uc784\n\n\uaddc\uce59\ub3c4 \uac8c\uc784\ub3c4 \uadf8\ub0e5 \ud754\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4\n\n\ucc38\uc2e0\ud55c \ud37c\uc990\uc694\uc18c\ub294 \uc5c6\ub294\ub4ef", "timestamp_created": 1515169380, "timestamp_updated": 1515169380, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38980101": {"recommendationid": "38980101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198265246014", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514912042}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u97f3\u6548\u5f88\u53ef\u611b\uff5e\n\n\u6709\u4e9b\u95dc\u5361\u6eff\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u8981\u60f3\u5f88\u4e45\u624d\u80fd\u904e\u3002\n\u6eff\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u63a8\u85a6\u7d66\u60f3\u52d5\u8166\u7684\u4eba\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1514912153, "timestamp_updated": 1514912153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38935704": {"recommendationid": "38935704", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991465987", "num_games_owned": 852, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514812826}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple and easy puzzle game - the last 20 levels contain some medium challenges.

The rest is not.\n\nThe basic mechanic is simple and time-tested: Click on the start tile, drag the mouse to create a line, fill all tiles to complete the level. After a while new mechanics are introduced: locked tiles that require you pick up a key first, arrow tiles enforcing a direction, color changers, etc. Most of them are fine additions. I didn't really like the tiles removing or adding other tiles as they changed the level layout on the fly and it took me too long to work out how to predict which tiles would be affected.\n\nThe game starts in fullscreen. The undocumented windowed mode (Alt+Enter) doesn't allow you to resize or change the resolution and isn't remembered the next time you start the game. There are no keyboard controls, even though gameplay would lend itself to it. This being a mobile port does not excuse the lack of desktop support, as other developers manage just fine.\n\nThere is exactly one music loop which starts to grind on you around the 30 minute mark. But the really frustrating kicker is the sound it plays when you don't interact with the game. I liked staring at a new level, figuring out my path in advance. But apparently the developer thinks their players are so stupid, they need to be reminded to play the game they're looking at. So every two seconds the starting tile pulses and this really terrible *DING* sound pierces your ears. Perhaps as mockery, perhaps out of cruelty, the dev chose to include a message recommending to use headphones as the game starts. Don't. You'll have to click the tile and hold down the mouse button while you figure out the level if you want to keep your anger levels low.\n\nAnd then after less than an hour the game just loops back to the first level. No end, no congratulation, nothing.\n\nThis is not a horrible trainwreck, but it just doesn't offer enough to warrant a recommendation. The price is probably fair though.

A lot of the early levels felt obvious, but some of the later ones did have me stumped for a bit. Fairly basic UI and music which works well for the game (I thought the simple music fit particularly well). It is short - took me around 50 minutes to beat - but for the price, that's fair.

That creates a pleasant learning curve and a sense of progress. \n+ There aren't a wide variety of soundtracks, but it doesn\u2019t get irritating. Smooth and relaxing. \n+ Sound effects and visuals are crisp and clean. \n\nCons:\n- Game doesn't get too challenging. You can figure out most of puzzles rather fast. You shouldn't take longer than 1-1.5h to complete whole game. \n- While the game introduces number of new mechanics, it does a poor job of combining them together into a challenging puzzle. \n- User interface non-existent. No menu, no settings. It\u2019s literally bare boned. \n\nAll in all, it was a pleasant and relaxing experience.

anime battles accompanied by a rocking soundtrack. \nOnline has Steamworks Integration for easier matchmaking with friends. \nTraining mode online and skippable win animation so you and your opponent can keep on fighting without wasting time watching the same winners cutscene over and over. \nFantastic tutorial mode that teaches newcomers to fighting game basics of neutral, pressure, hit confirming, whiff punishing, anti airing, and more. \nHelpful combo trials that even has sample button inputs to show you the button press timing. Plenty of these combos are useful in real match too. \nNetcode is delay based.

The tutorial this game has is one of the best in all of fighting games, being treated almost like a minigame as it gets you to adapt to how to read the games inputs and learn its mechanics. After that it will go into the advanced mechanics \n\nNow we have the main modes. For offline you have Episodic which is your traditional Arcade mode, going through about 8 to 9 stages with each character having a different story in it. Versus is your Offline fighting mode, for 1v1 or 1vAI and ability to pick characters. M.O.M. is an RPG survival mode where your fighting the same cast of 23, with various stats and gear items. For instance you can even equip moves by other characters in your loadout. Personally I do miss the GGXrd Sign map but dam that map was REALLY grindy. And for those looking for a good single player challenge, MOM will do its best to test your skills. Lastly is the Dojo which has your training modes that will go and show you everything this game has to offer.\n\nStory is more along the lines of a visual novel, so its great to learn the story and lore. Also is very rewarding 50k W$ (the games currency) which can be used to help unlock Raven (200k W$).\n\nOkay as far as multiplayer, you do have your ranked and unranked along with a small lobby. But the kicker is that the PC community is rather small, sitting alltime peak of 1300 players and normaly sits around 500 daily(steam charts). I dont know the PS4 player count, but Arc Sys tends to do a lot better on those platforms. Not that its going to be impossible to find a match, but be on the look out for discords and other LFG communities to help find players.\n\nOverall this is a great fighting game to get into and while its content is vast, deep and complex, this game will show you how to 'git gud' with all of its mechanics. GG Xrd didn't dumb its self down for new commers like SFV, it gave those new commers the tools they need to get better. Almost forgot, the sound track is god teir and keeps you pumped.

The game is very accessible to new players and boasts a ton of replay value with plenty of characters to learn and collectibles to earn. I would definitely recommend this game to people who are looking to get into fighting games or are just looking for a good fighting game to sink their teeth into.\n\n\n\n\nTo go a bit more in depth, starting off with characters, all of them are unique in their own style, whether it be look, personality, or playstyle. No two characters play the same, each with their own unique styles of play and gimmicks which allow each character to provide a different experience for old and new players. The characters are all very balanced, with one character not really being objectively \"better\" than another, due to the fact that it's not really about which character is \"better\" overall, but about matchups between two characters, as a character could be really bad at fighting one character, but would matchup really well with another.\n\nThe gameplay has been fine tuned to near perfection when it comes to fast and fluid fighting game goodness. Although it may be a bit rough at first to learn the button layout, once you learn it becomes easy to learn new moves and combos for each character. Through combinations of punches, kicks, and slashes you can perform either short or long combos to really keep your opponent guessing. Learning what moves can chain or cancel into others and what matchups work can really help in getting better at the game.\n\nThe art style and look of the game is where Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator- really shines above all the other fighting games. By using cell shaded 3D animation the team behind Xrd was able to capture a style that looks exactly like something straight out of an anime, but with 3D models. All the characters are crafted beautifully with hyper detailed model work and animation that keeps the snappy look of regular sprite based fighting games but with a very nice hand drawn-esque twist to really bring out the best in a fighting game's look. The environments are no exception, with stunning detail going into the backgrounds, all locations being unique and beautiful in their own right.\n\nAnd obviously, the highlight of any fighting game, the online play. The online for Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator- is much improved from -SIGN- with the frame delay being very accurate and the game being able to maintain smooth gameplay. Note: however, while the online can be really good, I would strongly recommend trying to stick to local play for those with non-stable internet connections, as the frame delay and frame rate drops dramatically with bad connections on PC.\n\nAs stated before, this is a great, high quality fighting game for the price point and anyone who wants to get into fighting games or is looking for a great fighting game, and I would strongly recommend picking this up for those looking for a great time.\n\n\nNote: If you haven't heard this already, I would strongly recommend getting the \"GUILTY GEAR Xrd -REVELATOR- (+DLC Characters) + REV 2 All-in-One\" for the definitive and best version of Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator- as the Rev 2 DLC improves online and adds a lot more content to the base game.", "timestamp_created": 1515013937, "timestamp_updated": 1515014029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39003267": {"recommendationid": "39003267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271422332", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "last_played": 1515896323}, "language": "english", "review": "Me and my brother Play this game All most all the time. it is so fun, It was really worth the Price if you ask me. but hey not everyone would agree with me.", "timestamp_created": 1514967640, "timestamp_updated": 1514967640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38998222": {"recommendationid": "38998222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031660160", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1479, "last_played": 1516407627}, "language": "english", "review": "ANIME.

Period.\n\n[h1]Main Pros : [/h1]\n[list]\n [*] It mastered a new level of cell shading and rendering, creating a style that can seduce even the biggest 2D lovers (like myself)\n\n [*] The game mechanics push the boundaries of fighting games even further than usual, with crazy systems that remain balanced.\n\n [*] Has one of the most advanced practice modes in the world, which actually teach you what a \"2D\" fighter is about, as well as specific matchup tips (as in : here is a tip to beat character X which is giving you problems)\n\n [*] The world and characters are 200% anime, with a lot of flamboyant and exaggerated personnalities, as well as crazy and memorable visual designs. All of those are a lot of fun, especially if you are into anime style.\n\n [*] A system of loot allows you to unlock images, musics, and \"digital figures\", which are pretty much a way to enjoy and customize the 3D models for display in a gallery mode. \n\n [*] All loot items are cosmetic or extras : they do not affect balace or the gameplay of the main game. You are also guaranteed to eventually get all of the loot within a reasonable timeframe of about 100 hours. No real money microtransactions.\n\n [*] Multiplayer is pretty well made with its simulated arcade rooms, and the frame-delay netcode used for compensating lag quite good \n\n [*] There is usually a multiplayer room for unranked matches opened at all times.\n\n [*] It has Dizzy, the greatest character ever, in it (shut up, my inner fanboy!)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Main Cons (yeah, there are a few) : [/h1]\n[*] Ranked matches are almost completely deserted, making it pretty much impossible  to rank up and get most of the \"badges\" (achievements). Fortunately the badges don't unlock things besides pride.\n\n[*] Single player modes are slightly limited. You can play a pseudo RPG in \"MOM mode\", which allows you to keep grinding towards something (even when you have unlocked all the loot)... but the grind is specific to this mode, and nobody plays it online.\n\n[*] Dragon Ball Fighter Z will overshadow this game when it releases : it will use the same graphic style, but it already has the power of a nostalgic licence.

of its competitors. the graphics look fantastic, the cleanest looking fighter/game out right now. the pure amount of finesse used to make the 3d models look exactly like 2d animations is incredbile. the combat feels smooth and fluid. training with all of the characters that interested me was a joy. the training mode makes combos simple to understand but difficult to master and pull off in an actual match, which felt rewarding to those who decide to put in the time. the \"roman cancel\" system also helps bring the combat to a new level that speeds up the flow of battle the gives more options to all players. all of this is easily accessable with possibly the best tutorial ever offered in a fighting game. i don't have much to say about the tutorial other than to play it for yourself. the character designs are amazing. the redesigns of old and the designs of new characters are both equally great. the online felt passable when both players had good connection, and most/all of the music was phenomenal.\n\ntl;dr: great weeb fighter\n5/5", "timestamp_created": 1514417112, "timestamp_updated": 1514417112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

The reason why I also own this on PC is because I think it's easily the best fighting game out there. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a scrub and online I lose most of the time. Still, I think this game taught me more about fighting games than Street Fighter ever did before. \n\nGuilty Gear might be one of the most complex fighting games in existence, but I've enjoyed my time with it a lot more than with Street Fighter V. Which is a nice game as well, Guilty Gear Xrd just appeals a lot more to me. The graphics are, after countless hours of play, still amazing to look at. The soundtrack is great if you like rock and metal (and who doesn't like to sing along with Birthday Train?). The story, I don't understand any of it, but it's great to dive into if you have the persistence. \n\nBut the characters are what stands out the most to me. Most of these have been tweaked and improved for more than twenty years. Yeah, it's all anime, but it's great anime. Anime done right and I love it. All of the characters have their own traits and play very different from each other. It's proof of Arc System Works craftsmanship that these characters are balanced so well. Sure, there is a tier list, but a good player can still do a lot of damage with a low tier character. It might only matter in truly high level gameplay, something you shouldn't worry about if you never played Guilty Gear before.\n\nThe thing I dislike is the low popularity of this game. Since this title has been out for a while there is a small group of high level die-hard players always playing online. For a new player this could become a frustrating experience. Sure, everyone is nice enough most of the time, but I doubt you'll learn anything if the difference of skill is too big. Also due to the small amount of players nobody in the US and Europe plays ranked matches (while Japan still does). It's all player rooms, which is designed really well by Arc System Works (and will be used in a similar way for Dragon Ball Fighters), but it's sometimes hard to find a proper room or someone to play with.\n\nBefore I forget, for new players the game should be very interesting, because it basically has multiple tutorials where it teaches you how to play a fighting game. It really is something no other Japanese fighting game did before (Killer Instinct also has a great tutorial) and it truly teaches you techniques from low level to high level stuff. You can't blame the developers for trying to get new blood on board of the (Birthday) train.\n\nAll in all, just get Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator with the Rev2 DLC if you want to dive into a fighting game. Beginner or expert. I'm sure there are a lot of SFV players who are looking for something with more depth to chew on.

The netcode is terrific. Me and my buddy can play for a good while and it won't hiccup or lag once. If that's the redemption factor for you when it comes to fighters, you're in luck with this game.\n\nThe game itself is a gem. Artwork and animations is phenomenal, combat and gameplay mechanics don't leave anything to complain about, character selection is just about what you'd expect from a fighter (well, a quality fighter. (looking at you, SFV) My only complaint is that there's not much variety of modes but maybe it's because I feel Injustice 2 set the bar very high for me. The tutorial and the dojo missions are terrific to play and learn. The best part of the dojo is that you can use what you learned in player-vs-player combat. \n\nI have the Rev 2 upgrade also. I don't think it is a standalone game like on PS4, so make a note of that.

I wish other anime games had such refined artwork and presentation.\n\nThere are plenty of more technical reviews about the awesomeness of the combat and all that. I'm casual so I'll just focus on experience.\n\nThe colors pop nicely, the controls are resonspive, characters expressive, modes of gameplay are deep. There are plenty of things to do in this game if you choose, all while looking very nice and setting a standard other games fail to meet (frankly highly rated 3D anime TV and movies fail to meet these standards, for shame!)\n\nMany 3D (anime) movies and TV shows are very inhuman, stiff and lacking personality. Guilty Gear is not this. They actually use 3D to make thier characters and concepts more detailed and articulated than their 2D predecessors. They do surpass the early 2000's versions of their game in that area for sure. While you will still see polygons, its nowhere as bad as the vast majority of games that go with the 3D \"anime\" styling, this isn't some cheap attempt. This wasn't done on a budget. (well it probably was, but much better than all the other games in my library...)\n\nI loved the old Dreamcast Guilty Gear. However many of the later games bothered me for one reason or another. I own the PS4 version of Guilty Gear Xrd. The crummy frame rate during cutscenes and certain skills made me too uneasy to play. While there are still issues with PC version, (even while the the PC version is 60fps rock-solid all times) I can now clearly see its not a hardware issue but a data/direction issue. Like much anime (including 3D anime), they do 15 fps sequences, even when the art is 3D. This makes the visuals jarring at times. \n\nThe gameplay itself is a solid and clean 60fps. Each frame is animated properly. So you won't be distracted at the most important times. \n\nI have no intention of being competitive, I just want to play for lore and all GG games have been rich in that area. So even a single player, that just wants to mash buttons and see good visuals will have something to enjoy.

and success - at making 3D work look like 2D animation. While anime isn't everybody's cuppa, their hard work at doing hand-adjusted animation and \"inbetween\" models really makes it stand out from the crowd. It's easily the best-looking fighting game in my opinion, if not one of the best looking games in general. They avoid the tendency for costume and character overdesign you see in other series, but the level of detail in outfits is striking, from little rivets to even tiny bits of text you can only spot during certain animations. It really is something else.\n\n\"But how is the game?\" Well, it's a very refined high-mobility 2D fighting game that sticks to its roots, largely for good and to a lesser extent for worse. Characters have fast, big, and creative attacks, a wide variety of strategies and strengths, and are loaded with personality and visual flair. There are several ways to try and turn games around, from increased damage on supers at low life to \"bursts\" that knock enemies away. However, if you're not into doing half-circles followed by a direction reversal, you might find this more than a little intimidating. While it's not the worst old-school fighting game motions I've seen, there is the occassional 360 degree joystick motion or quarter-circle plus half-circle archaic notions that, unfortunately, keep games like Guilty Gear targeted squarely at their default audience. However, it does feature one of the best training modes in the genre, so if you're willing to dig in, the game will teach you some surprisingly pro techniques.\n\nThe story is pure word salad nonsense at this point, concluding the story from Guilty Gear Xrd #SIGN and the barely-played-by-anybody Guilty Gear X2 Overture. Having played the series since the original Guilty Gear game on the Playstation 1, I can only imagine what it would be like to come in at this point in the story. The arcade modes set up endings for each of the characters which plays into a straightforward anime movie / visual novel mode without any actual gameplay. And while it's pretty (and the story is enjoyable for those already invested in it), I wish they had come up with a way to engage the player better. Still, it is very, very easy on the eyes. And the soundtrack is an an amazing collection of hard rock, albeit with some questionable english lyrics at times...\n\nWhile it doesn't really push the fighting genre forward at all game-play wise, Guilty Gear Xrd #REVELATOR is an extremely refined and tuned entry in the series. It's nearly the Platonic ideal of what it strives to be. If you like anime or metal and you like fighting games, get on top of this. It isn't going to change videogames, but it's a great entry in an already very original and memorable series.\n\nPlayed through every character on arcade mode to completion and went through the story. Did a little online play, but not much. I'm only \"good casual\" or \"low pro\" at this sort of game, so take that into account, get gooders.", "timestamp_created": 1513541505, "timestamp_updated": 1513541505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38370545": {"recommendationid": "38370545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348591817", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 305, "last_played": 1515754936}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought it 4 times.\nYou should buy it at least once.\nWait for a sale if you have doubts.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513498549, "timestamp_updated": 1513498549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38333530": {"recommendationid": "38333530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327157209", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1515746307}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8054\u673a\u5751\u7239\u554a\u4e70\u6e38\u620f\u9001\u52a8\u753b", "timestamp_created": 1513370033, "timestamp_updated": 1513370033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38333049": {"recommendationid": "38333049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050007436", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502324065}, "language": "english", "review": "Straight up amazing fighting game, I really enjoyed my time learning when I got into a Discord Group and made some friends.

If you already own Revelator, you simply need Rev2 DLC.\n\n(Begin walloftext)\n\nGuilty Gear is a long running 2D fighting game dating originally back to 1998. I can only speculate it began when someone watched too much shonen anime while playing wildly mistuned guitar in a garage and decided to put them both in a blender and I dare to say some folk may have encountered the name purely due to its pretty rocking soundtrack. It is perhaps the first (?) example of a fighting game where air is equally common place to duke it out as the ground due air mobility, leading to a common term \"airdasher\" to describe Guilty Gear and some other anime-style fighting games as well. Another notable aspect is how basic combo structure is more lenient than in several other entries combined, which on very basic level makes it easier to pick up and play without need to read a fighter jet manual how to combo several attacks. It boomerangs back later in another form however.\n\nLike in any other fighting game, the purpose is to beat the living crap out of the opponent before the same happens to yourself. Aforementioned airdashing adds another element to it as the to the casual observer, the gameplay often appears as if two angry bees trying to hit eachother. Each character has their own moveset of normal moves and special moves, and some have unique movement options or even restrictions as well: someone has teleport dash instead of regular ground dash, someone has no real ground dash but it instead functions as air-hoverdash, one character cannot dash at all and so on. Characters' unique selling point often makes up a good part of their gameplan or tools of trade they can use. Mechanically the game provides good set of universal options, ranging from reducing chip damage and pushing the opponent back to blitz shielding to \"parry\" an attack essentially to simple \"get off me\" in form of a burst, to double jumps and instant kills - which are mostly used to either goof around or swag round-enders in certain conditions - and whatnot.\n\nPerhaps most bizarrely (for the genre) the game actually has functional and understandable tutorial which teaches you plenty of basics how game works roughly, followed by plenty of missions where you can learn how some other characters work or prefer to use in without need to consult the fighter jet manual just yet. Multiplayer lobbies allow 8x players total playing on either four separate \"cabinets\" or lining up as they see fit, there is a training room so you can do a quick check of x or y before picking up a cabinet, spectate-only is possible and whatnot. Feature-wise quality of life Guilty Gear is a gold standard that should be put on a pedestral. For those who are more interested in offline content or unlocking something, there are unlockables in form of artwork, extra background music from older games or new tracks introduced in Xrd, voice actor messages, colour palettes for characters and whatnot. The main story of the game is more like a low-key anime OVA (if not outright visual novel minus naughty bits) and as far as the story goes, all I was able to decipher is that apparently in alternate universe Freddie Mercury was a scientific genius who also engineered some weapons of mass destruction with someone after magic appeared in the world and destroyed most of the ye olde tech, and then as expected something went wrong and apparently some Christians formed a resistance against newfound weapons of mass destruction taking over the world and then new crusades happened and... something something fastforward nearly 20 years of games to the actual story of Revelator. At least I found it quite entertaining and consistent.\n\nFor all the hype of quality of life, the game has pretty notable learning curve. It is nothing too uncommon in fighting games nor I would consider it a bad thing at all, but Guilty Gear is rather technical to the point you will eventually have to consult a fighter jet manual to understand what is going on, and simply practice proper (and sometimes outright rigid) procedures how to deal with various situations. Some of them are easy to search or try out in training, mode others are really convoluted and bizarre until you simply memorise what the deal was in the first place. Depending on the character in question, character matchup and other variables it can range from simple answers to the need to memorise several very specific circumstances and having only one real option to deal with it, where even tiniest mistake can mean instant loss. The game is also heavy on setplay, which is about forcing knockdowns into circumstances where they retain the advantage and ensure the opponent has as few options as possible to keep it their turn. The overwhelming amount of \"you are not allowed to do anything\" hits very hard and improving in the game is a pretty long road to deal with, especially for those with no former genre experience or more casual background. Another notable aspect is the game's playerbase. Random lobbies do exist but due to variable connections, where on Earth you live and GG being bit of a niche in already not-necessarily-that-popular-genre, your best bet may to find people to play with either by Steam or Discord or [insert something here]. Preferably with a touch of masochism while at it.\n\nIt is a very solid package of fluid gameplay and a good example how a fighting game's quality of life should be handled to ensure in spite of requiring a fighter jet pilot training to understand it on deeper level, all the necessary information how to get started is actually in the game as opposed to hidden on a 1990's 28k dialup optimised

are a fighting game fan that has only stuck to what you've grown up with, then I highly recommend you come out of your shell and give this a try. The game has a great tutorial for beginners and a high level of depth due to how different all the characters and the options that they all have. \n\nGameplay wise, the game was made a bit easier so that it's more acessible to new comers. For example, the Roman Cancel system doesn't require strict timing for FRC anymore. Now you have YRC which is your new FRC and it's way easier to perform. However, just because the game was made easier doesn't mean it's any harder to master. You still need a solid understanding of fighting games to be good. Guilty gear has had an emphasis on the more aggessive side of things with mechanics such as negative penalty which removes all your meter for not fighting or back dashing too much. Also, you're rewarded with meter by attacking and moving forward. That doesn't mean that defense is completely butchered (SFV, I'm looking at you!). You have an alpha counter that you can use for half meter, DP, Burst, back dash, Faultless Defense, Blitz Shield and back dash.\n\nOn the more technical side of things, I would like to say that the PC version has the lowest input lag of all the platforms because you can turn a bunch of the fancy graphics settings. As for netcode, it can be a bit iffy if you don't have a good connection with your opponent because it's delay based (GREED SEVER) but most of the time it's playable.\n\nUnfortunately, we're missing a few of the classic characters such as Bridget, Testament, Zappa and Anji.

Ishiwatari rides again!\n\n- The controls are as solid as ever, and still wonderfully responsive.  The series' fast and fluid combat has ruined me on Street Fighter, which seems horribly slow by comparison.\n\n- While the game accomodates new or casual players with a \"stylish\" option (button masher's delight), the core game is still deeply nuaced for the hard core fans with roman canels and other high end play modifiers.\n\n-The charcter roster is as divers as allways, with almost every character feeling unique. \n\n-The world and back ground story is fleshed out via your regular \"story mode\" of cuts scenes beetween battles, but also an additional multi- epiosode animated tale telling the back story and helping to further build on the world crisis.  \n\n- A robust networkj mode with solid coding allows you to go online and play to your hearts content. (if thats you thing)  I tried it out a bit but prefer to play against people i can actually see in the same room)\n\n-   While I'm not a fan in general of the dripfeed content method most fighting games seem to have embaced (holding back finished characters and adding them slowly as paid DLC) I must admit that Arcsystem seems to be trying to do tright by its fan base in releasing not a whole nrew physical erdition at full price, but a \"REV2 update\" which adds not only 2 new characters but new chapters of the animated story and more. \n\nOverall I highly recommend Guilty Gear Xrd to any fighting game fan.", "timestamp_created": 1511826577, "timestamp_updated": 1511826577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37813406": {"recommendationid": "37813406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038469910", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 57, "last_played": 1516302154}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Best fighting game.", "timestamp_created": 1511809615, "timestamp_updated": 1511809615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37809656": {"recommendationid": "37809656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343746367", "num_games_owned": 497, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 1607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511798435}, "language": "english", "review": "the latest iteration of a long running series, and the 2nd part of the xrd trilogy, guilty gear xrd -revelator- is truly a magnificent beast.\n\nsince the launch of the xrd series in xrd -sign-, arc system works have moved from the traditional sprite based art, to a fully 3rd rendered, cell-shaded art direction instead, and it has worked wonderfully. graphically, guilty gear looks amazing, and as it stands, one of the prettiest looking fighters out in the market, more so if you're an anime fan. it's this art style that would bring to life the (also) amazing lookng dragon ball fighter z, but that's another story (or review rather) for another game.\n\nin terms of gameplay, the basic combos system and mechanics of guilty gear have been brought over (primarily from the xx series it seems), and it translates very well too, with constant tweaks made since xrd -sign-  so it essentially feels very much like any guilty gear game and not a complete overhaul in that sense.\n\nthere's also a good variety of characters for you to pick and choose from; some are old favorites from the previous guilty gear series, reworked; and some are completely new ones, but it's fairly well balanced regardless. of course, some fan favorites are missing from the older series, but personally, i think it's not a bad thing. let the sleeping dogs lie, and let the new guys come out and play.\n\nas for the story, revelator makes a point of taking you through one hell of a ride, and with the graphics engine now, it feels like you're watching a very well animated 2d anime. even the arcade mode tells you a bit of the characters' back stories, so everything ties up nicely.\n\nall in all, guilty gear xrd -revelator- is a superb game, and nearly perfect in many aspects. while i have always been more of a king of fighters player, and while street fighter have always been the biggest title in terms of 2d fighters, i have to concede that this current iteration of the guilty gear series, may well be just one of the best fighters out there now!\n\nhighly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1511807280, "timestamp_updated": 1511807280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37793250": {"recommendationid": "37793250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028057411", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 83, "last_played": 1515670597}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game ever made - after DoDonPachi Saidaioujou of course.

And the community is pretty chill, even if it's smaller compared to the bigger titles like Tekken 7 and SFV.\n\nWith that all said, this is one of the best fighting games out on the market. Game runs amazing, gameplay is fluid and rewards patience, all the characters are pretty badass, the story is also worth (it's basically a 3d anime), just get it and you won't regret it.\n\nBTW, if you are lost on what version to buy and want the latest version, get the one that says \"GUILTY GEAR Xrd -REVELATOR- (+DLC Characters) + REV 2 All-in-One (does not include optional DLCs)\" This won't

already\n\nOPINION\nI gotta be honest, this game is what makes me love fighting games, got me hooked for 10 hours straight for testing all characters, watching the story, fishing (yeah, you can get figurines, music, and collectibles), etc. I prefer keyboard over usual controllers because there are 6 buttons (actually 5, 1 is a macro)\n\nSTORY\nThe story is pretty confusing if you are new to the series, which is why GG put a terminology button if the players are confused with the words.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nGuilty Gear is a fast-paced fighting game with lots of characters with different playstyle.\nFor example: \nSol Badguy: an all-rounder which makes it perfect for newcomers\nSin Kiske: a character who deals huge damage and easy to execute combos, but requires appetite gauge. If a player tries to make Sin do a special move with zero appetite gauge, he will be \"stunned\" and will be more vulnerable to attacks\nJack-O: Summons her minions, and can explode them on command, dealing huge damage\nPotemkin: a slow character who can't run, but has huge defense and great throwing power, keep your distance if you are fighting him.\nChipp: he can teleport to either enemy's front, back, or above, a very fast character with unpredictable moves, but has the lowest defense of the game\n\nAfter all that, there are some mechanics that makes GG unique to other fighting games:\nTension gauge: filled by moving to your opponent, dealing and receiving damage, tension gauge can be used for Roman Cancels, Overdrives, and much more.\nRoman Cancel: slows down time for a while and cancels your action, making it perfect to execute more combos or escape from enemy projectiles. Uses 25% tension gauge\n\nI can go on for a more lengthy review but I'm too lazy to type all of it. There's so many to love from this game, I really recommend this game to everyone who loves fighting games.", "timestamp_created": 1511451574, "timestamp_updated": 1511522976, "voted_up": true,

competitive time of good 2D fighters.\n\nThe character variety is beyond what I've seen elsewhere.  Take the movement mechanics, for one example: I-no's regular dash lifts her off the ground, allowing her to access her air moves easily while approaching; Slayer teleports short distances instead of dashing; fitting his manly character, Johnny's forward dash is longer than his backwards hop; even Sin's pretty average backdash is animated as a backflip using his staff.  People run, jump, fly and teleport ninja-style all over the place.  Stylin.  There's a lot of personality here, and there's bound to be a character you like among the mix of heavy metal and anime inspired designs.  Sol has a giant belt buckle with the word FREE scratched into it, and his bandana says ROCK YOU.  The visuals and music are top tier.\n\nThe online features are very well done.  The lobbies are like little arcades; you walk around as your avatar, type in chat, and spectate or jump on one of the little arcade machines and join somebody for a battle.  It's awesome, you can easily jump off a machine and watch somebody else's fight to relax until you're ready to go again.  Best lobby system for a fighting game that I've ever seen.  Being able to switch to spectating right away helps to dim the pain of getting rekt (many beginners aren't brave enough to try an online lobby - those people tend to stay beginners.  Be brave, and don't let damaged pride stop you from fighting to improve!).  It really hearkens back to ye olde arcade days.\n\nI can't explain it in terms of frame data, but where combos in BlazBlue felt 'restrictive' to me, I find that the gattling combos here tend to be more freeform and custom once you figure out what-links-into-what.  That's not to say certain characters aren't extremely execution-heavy; try Chipp or Millia if you're a combo pro.  Of course, certain chains only work on characters of the right height/size, so you sometimes have to adapt your 'maximal' combos to suit the character you're fighting.  You don't just learn your own character: you learn how your character deals with the other 20-some characters.  You do that by playing, watching, and maybe doing research if you really want to crack a certain character who's beating you.  Ya gotta figure out what your own good moves are, too!\n\nThere's a lot of casual content to enjoy (an entertaining story mode, the usual arcade modes and color/gallery unlockables, etc.) and an incredibly rich tutorial system (tons of challenges to teach you the systems and get your muscle memory started).  There's even a 'stylish' control mode for people who need some time understand the flow of a fighting game, and who want to do some flashy moves without having to learn complex inputs right away.\n\nBut, if you really want to get good at this game, you have to be prepared to lose a lot in PvP.  That's just the nature of a fighting game: the journey from noob to pro is the content.  Instead of grinding an RPG character, you're grinding your brain, reflexes and muscle memory.  This is real.  You may face one or two people who have been doing that since the original Guilty Gear about 20 years ago.  You're going to want to join a Discord channel or other community hub so you can absorb other peoples' experience and complain together about Raven.

An attention to detail I've seldom seen, and it comes through in every aspect of the game. Between the intros, outros, overdrives, instakill cinematics, character lines/interactions and godly rock/metal OST, I don't see how anybody can make the case for this game not looking and sounding amazing.\n\nThe gameplay is absolutely fantastic. Between the myriad of universal mechanics and the wacky character specific stances/setups/quirks, you will be able to play this game for hundreds of hours and still find yourself saying \"Wait, that WORKS?\" on some matches.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is that this game has basically turned me into a Jehovah's witness.

Blitz Shield is much easier to use, Side Dusts are now a thing, less input delay, even better online, lots of balance changes to help close the gaps between tiers and numerous features that cater to both hardcore and casual fans. \n\nBlitz Charge is probably my favorite addition as it not only makes the Blitz mechanic easier to use (at the cost of less reward), but it allows for some intense mindgames. The overhauled Side Dusts are amazing too, giving players even more ways to punish their opponents in the corner and opening up a plethora of new combos and strats. \n\nIf you are completely new to Guilty Gear, fear not, for Revelator has lots of in-depth tutorials (Most of them from Sign, but the main tutorial is brand new!) to help teach newcomers all about the game and even a Stylish control scheme. Combos too hard? Struggling to learn command inputs? Why, for only 20% less health pick up the Stylish type and you'll be good to go! The in-game encyclopedia from Sign has also been carried over and updated with entries related to all the new stuff in Revelator.\n\nAll the new extras are amazing too. Currently I have 600+ hours, but a good chunk of those were spent just messing around in Gallery, Story and Digital Figure. A lot of the online stuff is sadly carried over from Sign, but there's stil a lot of new content to be unlocked! The VA interviews were definitely my favorite thing to unlock. It was really nice listening to them share their thoughts on the game.\n\nThat said, you're gonna need the Rev 2 DLC, if you wanna play online, since everybody has moved on to that version. You can still ask for matches, as long as folks are willing to switch back to the previous version.\n\nA must buy.

Une r\u00e9ussite graphique et technique pouvant tous \u00e0 fait vous occuper des heures et rentabiliser son prix largement. Bien que la communaut\u00e9 soit petite, le jeu reste jou\u00e9 et vous trouverez toujours des joueurs le soir et le week-end. N\u2019h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 passer le logiciel discord (il y a un discord europ\u00e9en et un fran\u00e7ais actif pour guilty) pour prendre contact avec la communaut\u00e9.

Je ne peux pas par contre supposer de vos go\u00fbt pour le character design \u00e0 vous de voir. \u00c7a fait tr\u00e8s \u00ab\u00a0ado en phase rebelle\u00a0\u00bb avec pas mal de 2nd degr\u00e9, qui sauve le design pour moi.\n\nMusique\u00a0:\nDu lourd, Daisuke Ishiwatari (le cr\u00e9ateur du jeu) est un fan de heavy metal et de queen, ses compositions rock sont au poil pour le jeu. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re cependant ses anciennes compos, qui sont d\u00e9blocables dans le jeu\u00a0!\n\nSolo\u00a0:\nLe jeu a un mode arcade, d\u2019excellent didacticiels et d\u00e9fis pour taffer les combos (ces combos sont pas toujours opti cependant), ainsi qu\u2019un mode histoire (se pr\u00e9sentant comme un m\u00e9lange d\u2019anime et de visual novel). \nJe ne m\u2019attarderais pas sur le mode histoire, Daisuke Ishiwatari ne brille pas par son niveau d\u2019\u00e9criture. Le sc\u00e9nar faisant suite \u00e0 l\u2019opus pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent est d\u2019un ex\u00e9cution m\u00e9diocre malgr\u00e9 de bons concepts. Pour moi le lore et l\u2019histoire sont justes des bonus, c\u2019est cool d\u2019avoir du contexte pour l\u2019univers du jeu\nIl y a de nombreux bonus \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer dont le mode figurine pour se faire des diorama avec les persos du jeu pour les compl\u00e9tionistes.\nRien \u00e0 redire sur la quantit\u00e9 du contenu solo.\n\nMulti\u00a0:\nVous trouverez des joueurs europ\u00e9ens au heures pleines (moi s\u00fbr aux heures creuses). La commu est sympa et pour la tr\u00e8s majorit\u00e9 enthousiaste d\u2019avoir du sang neuf pour agrandir la famille.\nL\u2019essentiel des joueurs joue dans les players rooms, le reste des modes (ranked et gros lobby) n\u2019est pas jou\u00e9. Cr\u00e9er une room pour d\u00e9butant si il y en a pas.\nLe netcode est un syst\u00e8me par d\u00e9lai. On peut avoir facilement 2-3f de d\u00e9lai avec des gens de France ou pays voisin. Ne jouer pas en wifi\u00a0: les micro-lags, c\u2019est d\u00e9geux.\nL\u2019astuce \u00e9tant de r\u00e9duire les options graphiques en multi , comme mettre en off les effets de lumi\u00e8res et la v-sync (pas besoin de toucher \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution) pour passer de 3,5f d\u2019input delay de base (=version ps4) \u00e0 1f (on en r\u00eave tous hein) et donc en additionnant l\u2019input delay d\u20191f et un lag de 2-3f, on a un jeu online qui simule le offline. C\u2019est un plaisir \u00e0 jouer.\n\nGameplay\u00a0:\nLe gameplay est riche, profond et rapide, mais propose de se d\u00e9couvrir de mani\u00e8re progressive des m\u00e9caniques les plus simples ou plus avanc\u00e9 (le tuto en anglais guilty grear crash course sur youtube est chouette). Pour les habituez de jeu de combat, les combos se font en tr\u00e8s en grande majorit\u00e9 par des gatlings, vous \u00eates beaucoup plus libre de vos mouvements dont dans les air\u00a0: course pour quasi tous les persos, block a\u00e9rien, dash a\u00e9rien\u2026 Le jeu fait la part belle \u00e0 l\u2019oki et au taff pr\u00e9alable en mode training (je ne peux qu\u2019insister sur second point, il faut taffer pour y arriver sur guilty).\nLa grosse 20\u00e8ne de perso est tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9 avec beaucoup d\u2019originalit\u00e9. Il y a juste de tous, du shoto, du gros choppeur, des persos qui zones avec des projectiles, un perso avec un stand \u00e0 la jojo et en j\u2019en passe. Les persos sont \u00ab\u00a0tr\u00e8s fort\u00a0\u00bb (plus proche marvel que de street). Vous pouvez tout jouer (preuve: les tournois au japon ont beaucoup de diversit\u00e9 dans les persos qui arrive aux phases finales).

The most current one is Rev2, which also has the most users currently. It is an expansion of Revelator. You can get the full package by getting Rev and Rev2 for $45, or get the game with every DLC pack for $60 (you MUST buy Revelator to get Rev2. Sign is a seperate game entirely). Steam sales do not apply.\n\nPositives:\n+AMAZING 3d characters modeled to look like 2d characters.\n+Fantastic Anime artstyle and hard rock soundtrack.\n+25 characters, each with their own completely unique design and gameplay. I GUARANTEE your favorite character will be in this game!\n+BEST TUTORIAL IN ANY FIGHTING GAME! Jack-O teaches you the basics by letting you fight her minions! LEARN AND HAVE FUN PLAYING MINIGAMES WHILE DOING IT!\n+Little FAQ bubbles every time you pause will help you master the basics, among other things!\n+M.O.M. mode makes for a great single player experience collecting power-ups and stat boosters to fight the cpu!\n+Very smooth online experience with frame delay shown at all times!\n+FANTASTIC lobby system! Create your own little avatar and walk around in rooms with up to 8 or sometimes 64 players!\n+One of the most complex 2d fighting games out there with SO MUCH to learn!\n\nNegatives:\n-Confusing presentation at first. Navigating the menus and various other things will take a few tries.\n-Confusing story mode (encyclopedia and other useful things help, but only for so far).\n-Tutorial teaches you the bare basics of how fighting games are played, but not much detail into bursts, faultless defence, blitz shield, and all of the things that make Guilty Gear stand out from other fighting games.\n-Players have fled Ranked and currently stick around in custom lobbies.\n-Worth $45? $60? Probably for online mode or playing with friends, but not much else.\n-Lack of GGPO (although not a big deal for most, since online is pretty smooth)\n-One of the most complex 2d fighting games out there with SO MUCH to learn...\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK?\nThere's so much love put into every little detail like the presentation, the bursts, the defence, the combos however long or short, the character designs, and even little things like making a little square-headed avatar for lobbies and fishing for random cosmetics that it's really hard not to love this game if you're really into fighters. If you're not, it's going to be hard getting into Guilty Gear (especially at it's price range), but the tutorial in this game will get you on the right foot. If you like this game and need some help, now is the time to join. New players are already joining Rev2 in anticipation for Dragonball Fighters Z, ArcSys's newest title. I recommend getting this game on sale at some point, but otherwise is such a good fighter. Get some friends and join us on Discord!

Every single fighter is fun to play, all feel diverse and unique and some have really unique mechanics. Not only they're fun to play but they're also really well designed, both aesthetically and story/character-wise.\n- Great mechanics. Fast paced gameplay, technical with a wide array of possibilities.\n- Beautiful graphics. First time i saw the GG Xrd -Sign- debut trailer, i was floored. I still have trouble believing i'm playing a 3D game, i'm serious. I have no idea what kind of sorcery was used here, but i bet human sarcifice was involved. GG always had the best graphics to be honest, the arenas are always richer, more detailed, more epic, same goes for the characters. It was the best looking 2D fighting game and now it's the best looking 3D (or 2,5D, as they call them) fighting game on the market.\n- Fantastic soundtrack. GG games have always been known for their rock/metal soundtracks. This game raises the bar even higher. There's no better soundtrack for a fighting game. Heavy Day, Break a Spell, Wanna be Crazy, Sky Should be High, Ride the Fire, Big Blast Sonic, Six Black Heaven's Guns, Give Me a Break, Rokumon, OMG so many great tracks!\n- Wide array of gameplay modes. You even get an in-engine several hours long animu which fleshes out the characters and shows them in quite a different light.\n- A crapload of fun unlockables, from concept art to VA interviews.\n- Last but not least, amazing tutorial. It actually taught me a few things.\n\n[strike]Cons:\n\n- No Baiken :([/strike] The waifuiest of waifus is back!\n\nNOW GO BUY IT and support Daisuke-sama, the genius metalhead game designer, so he can rock the fuck on.", "timestamp_created": 1500458865, "timestamp_updated": 1500458865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644499", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33640838": {"recommendationid": "33640838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113794326", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 89, "last_played": 1515774115}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best fighting games out there right now.

Par contre, je le dis: Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator EST le meilleur jeu de combat 2D de tous les temps (le meilleur jeu 3D est Soul Calibur 5 \u00e0 mon humble avis... Et si vous voulez mon avis ^^).\n\nBon bah voil\u00e0, par o\u00f9 commencer maintenant. Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas l'univers Guilty Gear, c'est tout d'abord une ambience Rock / Metal ultra badass ! Avec des musiques super bien \u00e9crites et que je r\u00e9-\u00e9coute depuis mon mp3 comme si c'\u00e9tait du Pantera ou du White Zombie. Guilty Gear c'est aussi un casting de personnages insolites qui se battent avec les armes les plus originales qui soient : une guitare, une queue de billard, une ancre, un lit ! Alors vous imaginez bien qu'avec un tel choix, le gameplay est aussi tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent suivant les persos ! C'est un plaisir incomparable d'apprendre \u00e0 tous les ma\u00eetriser. D'autant qu'ils sont tellement cool qu'il est difficile de n'avoir qu'un seul pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9. Bon... moi c'est May, personnellement. Depuis toujours. Mais bref !\n\nQu'apporte Xrd REVELATOR?\n\nDes graphismes tout nouveaux tout beaux, \u00e7a n'a echapp\u00e9 \u00e0 personne. Attention, \u00e7a veut aussi dire que \u00e7a ne tournera pas parfaitement sur tous les ordis. Mais alors m\u00eame si c'est un peu ralenti... \u00e7a vaut tellement le coup ! On a l'impression de jouer avec un anim\u00e9 !!\n\nEt en l'occurence le mode Histoire EST un anim\u00e9 (sans coupure combat). Tandis qu'un mode \"Episode\" (plus classique) proposera un parcours plus anecdotique pour chaque perso. Entrecoup\u00e9 de combat et de dialogues toujours autant farfelus.\n\nLa grosse surprise est aussi l'attention toute particuli\u00e8re apport\u00e9e aux nouveaux joueurs (qu'ils soient nouveaux dans l'univers Guilty Gear ou tout simplement nouveaux dans les jeux de combat). Un mode Tutoriel est pr\u00e9sent pour bien commencer, puis un mode \"Mission\" immense pour apprendre les avantages et les d\u00e9savantages de chaques coups face \u00e0 chaque type de situation. Ensuite on a un mode \"Combos\" (plus classique) permettant d'experimenter et de ma\u00eetriser des enchainements propres \u00e0 chaque personnage. Ce que je trouve r\u00e9volutionnaire, c'est que le tout est toujours accompagn\u00e9 d'une Foire aux Questions tr\u00e8s bien fichu et extr\u00eamement utile, dans le menu Pause.\n\nAutres gros point appr\u00e9ciable: les goodies !!!\nOn peut collectionner des figurine en jeu et les placer comme on le souhaite sur une table virtuelle ! C'est un d\u00e9tail, mais c'est le genre de d\u00e9tail qui donne le plaisir de revenir souvent sur ce titre impressionnant.\n\nEn conclusion, je dirais que ce jeu a la facult\u00e9 de nous ber\u00e7er. On s'y sent \u00e0 l'aise quelque soit notre niveau, quelque soit notre fa\u00e7on de jouer. On peut y aller pour s'entrainer, apprendre, se surpasser, ou simplement se promener. J'avais presque oubli\u00e9 qu'un jeu puisse avoir autant de contenu et ne vraiment pas nous prendre pour des idiots. Meilleurs de combat 2D au monde.

Later bought Sign in Japan for PS3 then bought it when it came out on Steam. Haven't really liked Street fighter and it's system (GG have so much more freedom I think)\n\nOnly 'problem' I have: been played against A.I mostly and you start to figure out how they worked and how to punish them easy-mode. So my whole slayer game have been turned upside down when I play online hehe.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n [*] Even more layers on top of the old ones when it comes to the combat system.\n [*] Great tutorial/combo-/training modes that I think would work great for new and old players. From having none in XX2  to be learning stuff in-game, instead of visiting numerous forums.\n [*] Fun fishing system (turns earned currency into items). Makes you want to play through all episodes and tutorial/combo training\n [*] Pretty nice community. Too bad the lobby system is always empty. But rooms work.\n [*] Haven't watched the story that much, but the little I've seen is really good CGI. And I've seen a lot of anime.\n [*] REALLY nice to have old songs from the previous games\n [*] Great fun when changing the menu-voices. Smooth neutral Ramhethal or Sol badmouthing almost everyone :) The default english one is kind of bad..\n [*] Good that they added the 'stylish' play style + handicap. So friends who usually don't play fighting games or are more into button-mashing fighting games can play with advance players.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Some cons[/h1]\n[list]\n [*] Was first reluctant to buy Revelator when it came out because 1 year before I'd bought Sign. Very close releases al\u00e1 cash-grab in my eyes.. but bought it + rev2 when Baiken finally came back :)\n [*] Changed voices: for example the new Slayer voice sound awful. From Dandy gentleman to cackling crazy old man. I copied the voice files from Sign so it's ok now.\n [*] Save file corruption if disk is full. It writes an empty file instead of just not writing, so I lost 20h game time and everything I collected.\n [*] Why no Steam cloud sync?\n [*] Why no cross-multiplayer with PS3/PS4? I think lobbies would be more populated then.\n[/list]\n\nPersonal con: Slayer have been nerfed -_-\n\nA thing they should build / outsource to someone to build: A application you can have running when not in-game with chat/chat-rooms, list of players online etc and the ability to start fights easy: It should boot up the game really fast and start the fight immediatly and then close when finished. Maybe recurring tournaments where the winner gets fame badges/W$ or something. Create a unified community of some sort. Maybe have 'guilds' option for already existing ones. Everything using steam login of course. Fights would be recorded and could be played back by others if wanted, \nI can go on...\n", "timestamp_created": 1499424064, "timestamp_updated": 1499424064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33337174": {"recommendationid": "33337174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015293946", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508561802}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc544 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7f4\ub77c\uace0 \uc774\uac9c \ud558\ub294\uac70\uc8e0 . \n\uc194\uc9c1\ud788 \ubb50 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc14\ub00c\uae34\ud587\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\ub9cc ...\n\n\uc800\ub294 \uc5ec\ud0dc\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc774\uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud558\uace0\uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc720\uac00 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \ub54c\ubb38\uc774 \uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\uadf8\uc57c\ub9d0\ub85c \uaca9\ud22c\uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uc138\uacc4\uad00\uc740 \ubcfc\uc218\ub85d \uc7ac\ubbf8\uac00 \uc787\ub354\uad70\uc694 \u314b\u314b", "timestamp_created": 1499418193, "timestamp_updated": 1499418193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504932", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33330294": {"recommendationid": "33330294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098133300", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514976805}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub9cc \ubd10\ub3c4 \ub3c8\uac12\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8\ub798\ub3c4 \uba40\ud2f0\uc5d0 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294\uac74 \uc870\uae08 \uc544\uc26c\uc6b4 \uac8c\uc784\n\ucf58\uc194 \uc2a4\ud300\uac04 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud574\uc900\ub2e4\uba74 \uc9c4\uc9c0\ud558\uac8c \ud30c\uace0 \uc2f6\uc740 \uac9c\uc774\ub2e4\n\uadf8\ub9cc\ud07c \ub108\ubb34 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub294 \uac9c\uc774\uace0 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uac00 \ub108\ubb34 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc774\ub2e4\n\ud2b9\ud788 \ub7a8\ub9ac\uc370 \ub108\ubb34 \uc88b\ub2e4 \ub0a0\uac00\uc838\uc694 \ub7a8\uca29", "timestamp_created": 1499393367, "timestamp_updated": 1499393478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33329743": {"recommendationid": "33329743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099079329", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 12363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 862, "last_played": 1516395203}, "language": "english", "review": "Long time fan of the Guilty Gear franchise and I've been waiting for this to come to PC for the longest, now that it's here, what can I say?

I still played quite a few but none hooked me up like this one.\n\nI only knew Arcsys from previous titles like Blazblue, a game I also liked but despite the huge tutorial with loads of info, I couldn't fully dedicate myself to the game and get good at it.\nThis changed with the recent GG: Revelator title.\nI immediately fell in love with the art style and character design which looks REALLY polished. Each character  has really some \"character\", meaning personality, and all play vastly different, offering various gimmicks and approaches in combat.\nAdditionally GG offers an awesome tutorial which -unlike in BlazBlue- doesn't slam all the info in your face, but instead gives you a mild approach to the very basics. If you want to dive further into the matter you can learn some basic combos for your character and even train for various match-ups you might have problems with.\n\nYou can clearly see that Arcsys really cares about bringing in new players which also include total fighting game newbies and they've done a great job with that. In fact the best one I have seen in my life so far.\n\nI even bought the all-in-one package which is about 55 bucks but is worth every single penny and I don't regret anything about it and never will. \nIt is my most precious purchase I have ever made as a gamer on par with Overwatch (maybe even better). This may sound a bit overwhelmingly positive and you may think: \"Is this guy getting paid for that?...\" or whatever. But trust me when I say that I'm not and I'm not a person who praised any game company until now but the devs did a great job and earned my respect.\n\nSO THANK YOU FOR MAKING SUCH A GREAT GAME!

There's a number of different ways to block and cancel straight through moves and combos to keep pressure high on your opponent and an instant kill incase you feel confident that you're skilled enough to land with it and insult your opponent with a cutscene to end your round immediately.

I've only seen the first few, but as a fan of anime i must say they've kept me interested and i like the characters. And apparently the story is continued from previous games in the guilty gear series.\n\nOnline: I've only had the chance to play with a friend of mine, but we literally sat and played through 48 matches straight. It got quite competative and it felt like we both had a fair chance in every match. I also love the lobbies i think that was a clever idea.\n\nArcade: This has Episode which i havent played yet but supposed to contain your actual story matches i'm assuming similiar to other 2d fighting game standard arcade mode.\n\nVersus: Your standard free battle mode.\n\nM.O.M: I've literally barely delved into this mode but it looks like an rpg character building mode. Where you fight waves of foes and collect gear and treasure, in which you can use the year to make your guy stronger and make it through more waves later. I already started liking it but as i said barely played it.\n\nDojo: This is the training mode which really made me comtorable with the combos not leaving me feeling stranded and confused like alot of other similiar fighting games.\n\nThere's a few things in collection mode which i'll let you checkout yourself but I will say this game literally has tons of neat things available in collection mode to keep you busy for quite sometime.\n\nAlso surprised to see that the game records every replay of every match you do, so you can go back at anytime an see exactly what your thumbsticks and buttons were doing through the entire match, so you can see exactly where your combos are lacking and what ones your opponent was doing.\n\nThis is without a doubt a hidden gem in the fighting game world, I do plan on buying the rest of the games in the series to catchup on all the story. But from what i've played so far I would give this game a 9.2 out of 10.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499031909, "timestamp_updated": 1499031909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1,

Includes single-player modes like Episode which is basically your standard arcade/story mode in other games, what GG calls \"story mode\" is actually a movie and seperate. On top of this it runs pretty well.\n\nThe downside is that you have to hunt a bit for online matches as there's no crossplay. Find discords or ask on the forums, etc. And most people have moved onto Rev2 so if you want to get serious about the game you'll have to get the upgrade as well, but it's reasonably priced I thought and includes enough stuff to warrant it. And if you want to get better and learn more there's a large enough community and sites like dustloop to help you out.", "timestamp_created": 1498846259, "timestamp_updated": 1498846289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33047817": {"recommendationid": "33047817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169833055", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504190134}, "language": "german", "review": "Mit weitem Abstand das beste Fighting Game, dass ich bisher gespielt habe.

There is a lot here for every kind of person and I can't recommend it enough.\n\nThe game is a complete adrenaline rush and requires pure skill and ability to win. I know you can say that about most fighting games, but Guilty Gear feels like it takes it a step further. It's known for being a very fast paced game, which I greatly underestimated before I played it myself. There is never a dull moment and there is so many things to keep up with in a very short time that it can be insane.\n\nEvery single character has a lot of unique mechanics and no two fight identically. This may sound like it would lead to an unbalanced roster since some characters will inevitably have better moves than others. Well here's the thing, the best part is that every single character is very well balanced and viable, so you can pick up whoever you think is the most fun to play as and not have to worry about losing simply because they're not a good character. The entire roster is viable, they're all very unique, and there's bound to be a character who you just click with since the characters are what truly make this game great. Who doesn't love a doctor with a bag on his head who can throw bombs, meteors, and candy, and who can travel through dimensional doors? \n\nIf you're new to fighting games and are afraid of grinding out combos or learning to execute things well, don't worry either! This game has one of the smartest systems I've ever seen implemented in a game before. If you're not good at or are inexperienced with fighting games, choose stylish mode. Stylish mode will allow you to still pull off combos and have fun without worrying about perfecting your execution. If you enjoy the character enough though and want to get more into it, you can always switch to technical mode and learn how to pull of that execution and feel like a badass. \n\nLet's talk netcode now. I have never played a fighting game with better netcode than this. None come even close. When I played MKX I was used to quite frequent stuttering and whatnot. Same with most other fighting games I've played. However, in GG, the online matches are so fluid and have so little delay that you are shocked when you do run into a match that has anything more than 5 frames of delay. This has been my experience at least and YMMV, but I can assure you that you will most likely not have any issues at all with the netcode.\n\nI just woke up an hour ago so this isn't the best I could have written, but it got my point across. The community is the nicest and most welcoming of any I've been in, they'd love to help you out, the game is one of the most fun experiences I've had in years, and I'd love for you to give it a try and join us. The game is amazing and has clearly had a lot of love put into it with and amazing and dedicated community surrounding it, and I can't recommend this game enough.

Regardless of the metric used (technology, graphical horsepower, art design, soundtrack, singleplayer content, netcode, online functionality in general, voice cast...) few would look upon Xrd and claim that trainwrecks like SF5 were even contenders.\n\nRather than resting on their laurels, Arcsys decided that there was room for improvements. For instance, Xrd had a barely noticable input delay, as opposed to SF5, which has 'about' 8 frames of input delay at all times. This simply would not do, said the devs, so Rev has so little input delay that playing against people that incur 4 frames of it makes the steam version about on par with the playstation version, and that's still no less than twice as responsive as SF5 in offline versus. Yes, sirs and madams, that is indeed the honest truth of the matter.\n\nSo a team with limited to no experience working with contemporary game engines and tools, tied down by a very small budget, and a deadline 16 months away, managed to make Capcom, with their 4 year development cycle, and all of Sony's money, look like complete clowns in every conceivable way, and then they made improvements? Twice!? And it's all running on unreal 3, which reached end of life about a year before they decided to start working on the game proper. Surely this must be an elaborate practical joke. \n\nWell, it's good that we have that primer, because it's all true, and none of it's a joke - except the part where supposed top tier fighting game companies can no longer create things people want to play, and were later caught stuffing their games with ring 0 rootkits for some reason or other.\n\nGuilty gear, in case you didn't know, is like all those 80s animes, metal bands, and action movies you used to love. If you weren't around back then, the 80s revival wave that's been sweeping the world for almost a decade now guarantees that you can relate. It's big, it's bright, it's larger than life, and it's set to the soothing tunes of the finest guitar riffs, and narrated by ancient veteran voice actors who in many cases actually starred in those 80s animes. Dispensing with the traditional karate men and big guys without shirts spinning in place and repeatedly mashing crouch short into hadokens on a street corner-formula, guilty gear takes place in a 2180s post-apocalyptic wasteland, everybody who is ANYBODY is a super hero, japanese, a prodigy, a former child soldier, a supernatural monster, a bio-weapon, or a combination.\n\nIt is the popular opinion that story and singleplayer doesn't matter one bit in fighting games, but guilty gear with its 20 years of actually advancing plot disagrees. So much so that Xrd, Rev, and Rev 2 come with feature-length anime movies as their story mode, and don't worry, there's an encyclopedia just a button press away in case you don't know what the outrage is, or you can't wrap your head around the star trek-like technobabble about magical theory. Now far be it from me to rate and review contemporary anime, which is good, because this anime is structured exactly like a mid 80s anime, but with vastly improved visuals. I dare say Daisuke's guitars would blend in effortlessly in Fist of the north star. Which is why Arcsys got to make the Hokuto no Ken fighting game a bunch of years back. And yes, this game does actually have an encyclopedia.\n\nIt also has the tutorial that skullgirls claimed to have, but never actually did. You want to learn how to play the GG? Get to doing the tutorial. Then do the character specific move list tutorial. Then the basic 101 character specific tutorial explaining your gimmicks and gameplan. Now that you're done with that, you must wrap your head around the concepts and ideas expressed in the character specific advanced tutorials, afterwhich it's generally understood that you should attempt some of the 'missions,' which is a funny way to spell 'fundamentals.' At no point does the game screw around, however. To do the advanced training, you must complete basic. If you mess up too many times, the game will go from brief instructions to a sometimes lengthy 'tip.' So if you can't figure out that knockdown state on your face is different to knockdown state on your back, the game will tell you this, and it'll tell you why this matters. It uses actual fighting game terms, and expects you to be smart enough to follow along if you found your way into the tutorial section. So we magically got through the fundies, and now we're ready for fighting, right? Hoho, no, now we're gonna switch to the second fundie tab, which covers match-up specific things that are relevant to your interests. So in case Raven's shutting down your day -200 Ky with his memetic air glide, you'll know how to prevent it, and why it's a problem for Ky, but not for Zato.\n\nNow that you know, you can go online. There's ranked matches, 64 man regional lobbies, and player made rooms. If you can't find a room suitable to hold your radiance, simply make one yourself. Set the maximum lag players are allowed to have, what kind of skill level you're looking for, what kind of room this actually is, if you know what I'm saying, switch conditions, rounds, private VIP slots for people you invite only, passwords, and pretty much whatever else you could desire. Then make sure you hog the P1 side, otherwise the opponent gets to decide the music, and they're too lazy to pick good tracks, so make your R-card default to something excellent, like Conclusion, Still in the dark, March of the wicked king, No mercy... A lot of games are content with having a single good track, like SFA3's Charlie theme (Decisive bout), then there's guilty gear. In rev 2, you have the best versions of the best tracks from 6 games at your disposal, including arranged versions of GG1 tracks.\n\nAs this is a guilty gear game, the gameplay's built like an AK47. It's very simple to pick up and play, but actual prowess takes work and far more precision than you'd think, but the universal mechanics and solid construction organically prohibit degenerative play, like 20 second combos (it's technically not an infinite, so technically the infinite prevention system works!) that go into 50/50 resets, forever. The Xrd series is essentially a continuation of #Reloaded, which means all the system bloat added by the A core series has been discarded, making it that much more accessible. Characters that ended up being very reliant on A core systems now instead have those systems built in. So for instance, not every move in the game has wallsplat powers, but things like Slayer's pilebunker do, because that's your reward for committing to hard reads. Rather than have 7 different projectiles of varying strength and utility, Ky now has merely 3, as he should, but can manipulate them through both his dust and a dedicated 'make my lightning grow'-attack, which doubles as a strong keep-away move, and inflicts dramatic stagger on counter hits. He also benefits extensively from the overhaul done to the roman cancel system, as do most of the traditional not quite so top tier characters. So less moves, less bloat, but more depth, and the game looks, plays, and sounds better than the competition? Pretty great, so surely there must be a disadvantage? The disadvantage is that guilty gear is pretty big in europe, but not so big in the states, and if you're suffering from a case of the american copper wiring, you might need to do some community outreach to get opponents. \n\nBut most of this work was done for you a long time ago, and the community that was there 'back in my day' is still largely around now, even though some of us are probably too old for this. Unlike many other series, GG has a tight knit community, and if you're having problems figuring out a mechanic, or have questions about why you'd ever use 5P when you have a much better 2P, just ask, and your opponent will probably be the first one to lend a hand.\n\nMust have.", "timestamp_created": 1497178556, "timestamp_updated": 1497178556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 412, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.938261", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32337699": {"recommendationid": "32337699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333240520", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514105654}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4eba\u5462\uff0c\u6211\u5c31\u60f3\u627e\u4e2a\u4eba\u6253\u4e00\u76d8\uff0c\u4eba\u5462\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1497171291, "timestamp_updated": 1497171291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32337579": {"recommendationid": "32337579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165704074", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 885, "last_played": 1516398510}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

eyes. Ah, and with lovingly crafted art, music, and the ability to control the action, vidcons are the ultimate combination of the high arts. While I tend to play the stoic, I will be the first to admit that vidcons have driven me to cry, to scream and shout, to feel actual hate; such is the power of this force beyond our wildest reckoning. And here I am, before you, to tempt your tongues with the taint of such a tantalizing topic. And the Japanese, the true geniuses behind the world of video games. Pah, I throw my scorn upon such incompetents of the West who would mock the true art of the Japanese with \"games\" such as Baldur's Gate and Madden. Perhaps the West is not as intelligent as the East, but this is a matter for another day. Japan has given us such masterpieces as the Final Fantasy series, Star Ocean, Wild Arms, and of course, Arc the Lad. Yes, some of the finest vidcons in the world were created by the Japanese. I come to you today to ask you in all earnesty, what is your favorite vidcon?

gameplay, deep mechanics, huge room for creativity.\n- Great variety of characters, all play totally different, still balanced.\n- FANTASTIC netcode. Best I have ever seen in a fighting game so far.\n- Great visuals both in terms of looks and in terms of visual clarity.\n- Nice soundtrack if you like heavy guitars.\n- Great amount of content both online and offline.\n- Quite unique and fun playerlobbies which add nicely to the social aspect of the game.\n- Generally friendly and helpful playerbase.\n\nCons:\n\n- You cannot watch replays of other players from inside the game. Basically you can, but you have to go to a website and download it and manually put it in the right folder. Would have been nice to have it ingame though.\n- Sometimes connecting to a player is kinda quirky, happens to fail sometimes but when connected everything is smooth and stable.\n\nNeutral:\n\n- Still relatively small playerbase. But until now I had no trouble finding games in my region (EU) on my skill level (beginner).\n\nConclusion:\n\nI think this is the best 2D fighting game on the market right now.

Even taking that aside, though (and they definitely have done some rebalancing), there's plenty to talk about.\n\nFrom the beginning, it's obvious just how much care and love has been put into this game.  I talked about the graphics and aesthetics in my -SIGN- review, but that's only part of the story.  They already had a start on making the game more accessible to newbies, but the cute and silly new tutorial as well as the Mission mode offers directed and understandable training for any level of familiarity and skill.  The standard training room's also there to tune combos and strategies, and replays can be saved for either seeing where things went wrong or to relive your best moments.  For newbie vs. veteran matchups or for talking LPers, the Stylish control scheme provides a decent way of just letting someone pick up and play to some level of effectiveness.  No one's gonna win EVO with it, but it's a welcome way to ease newbies in and help them work on their timing and confirms, leaving specific execution for later.\n\nWhat really pushes it over the top for me, though, is all the stuff they didn't need to even put in, let alone polish as much as they did.  The lobby system is the most charming I've ever seen, with tons of things that make it a more relaxed and social experience.  Yes, you can spectate and sit at the virtual cabs and play, but being able to kick a beach ball around, do all sorts of silly gestures/emoticons, and fish for items just adds to how lively the lobby feels.  Speaking of which, there's the Digital Figure mode.  Being able to set up little dioramas is a real treat, and while having to fish for more poses and expressions can be a pain if you had something in mind you just can't do yet, it does give you something to do with the in-game money after the gallery's all filled up and you've logged in 100+ hours.  Again, they didn't have to add stuff like that, just small casual diversions, but it really lends charm to the experience.  Even the most ardent fighter has to relax sometime, so having something to do that has nothing to do with the battles can help the brain relax and brush off any salt buildup.\n\nReally, all that is why I'd recommend this game above any other fighter I've played so far.  It's not just the fighting, which already ranks among the best on the market.  It's not just the graphics and music, which will remain memorable a decade from now while people struggle to recall what the hell the main character from CoD: Black Ops looked like.  It's the little details, the care taken with every pose and frame of animation, every little way the game offers ways for you to not have to alt-tab away if you want to just chill.  This is the most complete and alive fighting game I've ever played, and it can't come with a higher recommendation from me.  Newcomers to and veterans of the genre alike, if anything I've said got your attention, I encourage you to strap in and get ready to rock.", "timestamp_created": 1496566003, "timestamp_updated": 1496566003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32167885": {"recommendationid": "32167885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212432776", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504877270}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u7528\u952e\u76d8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8bdd\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u6211\u624b\u6b8b\u8fd8\u662f\u600e\u4e48\u5730\uff0c\u6309\u4e0d\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u6709\u5927\u795e\u4e5f\u662f\u7528\u952e\u76d8\u7684\u8bdd\u6765\u52a0\u4e2a\u597d\u53cb\u6559\u4e0b\u6211\u5440\uff0c\u8c22\u8c22\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1496551730, "timestamp_updated": 1496551730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452675", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32167788": {"recommendationid": "32167788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101505695", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 102, "last_played": 1516253353}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing fighting game.", "timestamp_created": 1496551292, "timestamp_updated": 1496551292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32165041": {"recommendationid": "32165041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027322302", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497752926}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Esta review n\u00e3o \u00e9 para falar da jogabilidade, dos gr\u00e1ficos ou qualquer outra coisa do tipo dois tudo isto no Guilty Gear \u00e9 master piece e nem precisa reconfirmar, simplesmente o jogo de luta mais foda j\u00e1 feito em quesitos de qualdiade (Chupa esta Street Fighter).\n\nVou falar \u00e9 do modo hist\u00f3ria que \u00e9 o diferencial dele para QUALQUER outro jogo.

N\u00e3o tem lutas no GG, voc\u00ea simplesmente assiste, e gra\u00e7as a isto n\u00e3o tem aquela porra de ser interrompido o tempo todo para fazer um luta que muitas vezes n\u00e3o tem NADA HAVER com a situa\u00e7\u00e3o simplesmente por que cada personagem tem que ter 4 lutas...\n\nEu assisti todo o modo hist\u00f3ria do Injustice 2 no youtobis (afinal a Nether Realm n\u00e3o curte meu dinheiro), e o que mais me irritava era as paradas para as lutas simplesmente por cortar TODO o clima, tem uma parte no Injustice 2 onde o Flash esta lutando contra o Flash Reverso, ai a luta \u00e9 muito foda, toda coreografada, ai ele corta e passa para a luta in-game... Cortada de clima n\u00edvel extreme!\n\nPor\u00e9m isto n\u00e3o acontece no GG! Simplesmente quando rola lutas, \u00e9 toda em anima\u00e7\u00e3o e \u00e9 FODA! A luta entre o [spoiler]Slayer e o Bedman[/spoiler] por exemplo \u00e9 ESPETACULAR!

Deixa eles muito mais interessantes e profundos, voc\u00ea pode at\u00e9 n\u00e3o curtir jogar com eles como \u00e9 o meu caso com o Ki, mas na hist\u00f3ria ele \u00e9 muito maneiro, de um personagem que eu achava que era um chato pelo visual e a forma que fala e etc nas lutas (afinal todo o anime tem seu Sasuke) ele se mostrou muito maneiro!\n\nUma outra coisa foda \u00e9 que o modo hist\u00f3ria do GG, diferente do Injustice ou do MK ou at\u00e9 do Tekken, \u00e9 todo em tempo real, n\u00e3o \u00e9 Cutscenes Pre-Render. O que isto faz? Qualidade infinita de imagem com um jogo pesando s\u00f3 11GB mesmo com um modo hist\u00f3ria que deva dar suas 6 horas pelo que estou contando!\n\nVoltando sobre o assunto carisma dos personagens, cara... Eu quero o Robo-Ki adicionado no jogo PARA ONTEM!

Unrivaled tutorial system - this game thoroughly teaches you how to play it. A huge amount of in-game situations is covered in the missions, where you can replay them over and over again in preparation for the real battle. There is no need for new players to figure out everything on their own or spend huge amounts of time looking for info on the Internet. There are also many beginners playing right now, so you don't have to worry about getting steamrolled all the time.\n\n2. Deep in-game mechanics that feel satisfying to learn and exploit. Just don't expect you will get used to most of them right away. But that is one of the many pleasures of learning a new fighting game - to see that you are able to progress with invested time and effort.\n\n3. Statistics and Replays - for those who want to improve even more.\n\n4. There is no need for you to learn long and execution-heavy combos to be able to start playing online - you can deal a good amount of damage even with basic confirms, so you can play at least on the basic level without hours of grinding in training.\n\n5. Solid and responsive netcode - I can't recall a game that provided me with such a good online experience. Additionally, there was no problem for me to find matches online (at least in EU region).\n\n6. Great visuals and soundtrack - also, I can run the game in 1080p on solid 60 FPS even on my below-average PC.\n\nUnrelated to fighting:\n\n- Tons of unlockables - and not just some stuff you dont give a jack about - there is some damn good content to be unlocked, for example: really interesting and often heart-warming interviews with seiyuu, great BGM from previous installments and so on.\n\n- Digital Figures - oh boy, creating dioramas with the characters is so much fun. I just recently discovered and started having fun with this mode. The stuff you can do there is just hilarious.\n\nTo sum up, GG Xrd is definitely one of the best fighting games you can buy these days. If you are hesitating whether to buy it or not, I can certainly recommend buying the game and falling in love with it - you won't regret it.\n\nP.S.: I was thinking about it for quite some time now. It would be really awesome to be able to create a playlist of BGM from which the game would randomly select songs to play during matches. Most of the tracks are great, but I would really love to be able to have a smaller selection of tracks playing during my matches (changing them in between is just painful).", "timestamp_created": 1496393976, "timestamp_updated": 1496496720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851345", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32117212": {"recommendationid": "32117212", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963580481", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 21685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 823, "last_played": 1516140529}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome characters; big small thick thin\nAwesome music; hope you like guitars\nAwesome mechanics; hands down best meter system etc. etc.\nAwesome singleplayer content; blows it's peers and then some clean out the water  \nAwesome multiplayer features; blows it's peers and then some clean out the water\nAwesome graphics and animation; really went the extra couple miles here\n\nit's one of those games where you are ripping off the developer instead of the other way around :D\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1496358157, "timestamp_updated": 1496358157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507872", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32115720": {"recommendationid": "32115720", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974004598", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 4084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496494878}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best fighting game on the market right now.

It is the absolute latest version of the GG series. The latest installment arc in the GG series is the Xrd versions. \n\nGG is a challenging and highly competitive fighting game series that is in most occasions overlooked by the average fighting game player and really should be the #1 game at tournaments. Maybe because Japan's top players destroy USA's players? IDK\n\nArt:\nThey have the most gorgeous art style when compared to all the modern fighting games. It both pays homage to the original sprites, their keyframes, their color palettes while setting a new standard for the years to come.\n\nGameplay & Modes:\nLocal 1v1 is really where the spotlight shines for GG. They have -very good- Netplay and there is a VN aspect for solo experiences if that is your bag. Xbox/Microsoft joysticks are fully supported and a good idea to use if you want a complete arcade experience. Netplay may quickly introduce you to players that seem completely beyond your fathomable skill but rest assured there are time-tested communities dedicated to helping you learn GG! The pace and complexity of matches feel very well balanced and interesting compared to SF, MVC, BB (and many other less known fighting game titles).\n\nPC version:\nIt is great! You will need a fairly recent mid-line video card to ensure 60FPS which is a must. For netplay, you will want to use a wired network cable to help maintain a stable connection since it is peer to peer and you are responsible for your connection quality.", "timestamp_created": 1496253140, "timestamp_updated": 1496276663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32090754": {"recommendationid": "32090754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040934325", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 456, "last_played": 1516414138}, "language": "english", "review": "GG is the best fighting game right now and it's not even close.", "timestamp_created": 1496252653, "timestamp_updated": 1496252653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32090326": {"recommendationid": "32090326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258008883", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1515836716}, "language": "english", "review": "Revelator 2 is out.

The Guilty Gear series has been a special fighting game to me, being a game that, after countless of hours in other titles, I still come back to and just straight up enjoy playing.  A lot of what I stated in my Guilty Gear XX Accent Core+R review will be restated in this, so I'll start off with what makes this title unique: the artstyle/aesthetic.  This title/subseries of the Guilty Gear series (starting with SIGN) makes the shift from hand drawn 2D sprites to 2.5D/3D-esque sprites, and for someone like me, who enjoys great game art, makes all the difference.  While the hand-drawn sprites bring a sense of nostalgia, the 2.5D art gives the game a new sense of style, allowing for even greater detail to be put into the characters.  The background art follows the same vein, with dynamic action happening in almost every stage in a 2.5D landscape. \n\nGoing on to the more gameplay based opinions, much stays the same from Accent Core, but there are drastic differences from then to Xrd.  For one, the Roman Cancel system has changed dramatically, where players now have several different Roman Cancels that are activated based on certain criteria being performed by either player, which can help in either baiting out bursts, extending combos, and even getting out of situations that went from good to bad.  Moving on to characters, much of the Guilty Gear design formula has stayed the same: no two characters are similar, and the thing about this title is that there's no subclones of other characters (Rest in pasta, Order-Sol and Robo-Ky).  With 20 characters in the base roster, 23 if you include the hidden character and the 2 DLC (1 character, Raven, is both purchasable via in game currency or with real money, the other 2, Kum Haehyun and Dizzy, are strictly DLC), there's bound to be a character that fits one's playstyle.  In terms of learning tools, there are tutorials and challenges that try to teach skills that can be incredibly useful in actual combat, and present these challenges in a variety of ways.  The tutorial itself puts players in an obstacle course of sorts where players have to demonstrate specific inputs that new players should learn, giving a fun little twist to your average fighting game tutorial.  The challenges put players in a scenario in which the player must respond to with the appropriate desired input in order to pass, and each challenge doesnt start till the player actually inputs the first desired command, allowing for breathing room in between each challenge.\n\nThe story mode in the Xrd series is presented much differently than in the previous titles.  Rather than it being a visual novel-esque/fight based story mode, it is much more like an anime in which players simply watch the story to its end.  While that doesn't seem engaging, the game does provide incentive for finishing the story mode.\n\nNow, as of this moment, I don't have any issues with the game so far, in fact, it runs even better than SIGN on my crap-top, but I'll update this review as I continue (highly doubt I will) but Guilty Gear Xrd REVELATOR is definitely one of my top favorite fighting games that I've ever purchased.

This is my first review and I don't even know where to begin with this game, so I am just going to write a somewhat unorganized block of text.\n\nGuilty gear xrd revelator is an \"anime fighting game\" meaning it is in the same sub category of fighting games, as things like blazblue, melty blood, undernight in-birth etc.,. However I personally do not find that guilty gear feels like any of the other games mentioned, or any fighting game I have ever played for that matter. Guilty gear has a unique and positively gorgeous aesthetic. Instead of the typical anime game sprites, guilty gear has extremely well animated and very detailed 3d models. Character models have neat little touches like little bits of writing on their clothing and every one of their animations from their jabs to their supers are smooth, detailed and convincing. I have occaisionally found myself in awe of certain character's expressive facial animations during their attacks. What makes the characters even more visually appealing is just how good their overall designs are. Each character has their own identity design wise and I personally think that every single one of them is appealling in their own way. The stages are gorgeous too, every stage has unique lighting and is very visually interesting in general (there is no training stage), I never get tired of looking at them. \n\nAside from its unique aesthetic the gameplay and mechanics really set the game apart as well. There are a lot of universal mechanics and tools that every character has access to, for example: there are three types of blocking, a metered parry that if held down becomes a focus attack, guard cancels, a burst (combo breaker) which can be used outside of combos to grant full meter, and can be easily baited and punished if used carelessly, roman cancels which come in three forms and allow any attack to be canceled by using meter, instant kills; a stylish way to finish off your oppenent when they have low health but require meter to be comboed into. I probably missed a few, but all these things in addition to the unique way guilty gear handles throws and knockdown / wakeup game (there is no ground teching, throws are nearly instant and extremely hard to break) serves to give guilty gear very unique gameplay that is not all about running up to your opponent and comboing them for thirty seconds, but is more about outmaneuvering your oppent and controling the match. Huge combos are still in the game though, but they are usually not very long time wise and are quite rewarding to pull off.\n\nEach character has a distinct playstyle with many characters being hard to classify into traditional fighting game archetypes, and the ones that do fall into traditional archetypes like: grappler, zoner, shoto etc., are some of the coolest takes on those archetypes I have seen. In addition to having unique tools and playstyles each character also has execution quirks that make them feel unique to control for example: some character make use of a technique called jump installing while other have moves that can be faultless defense cancelled, on a less jargony level some characters make use of links while others can chain all their attacks toghether freely. To top it off this game is quite well balanced and will be getting even more so when the rev 2 update comes out in June. Tournament top 8s often feature 8 different characters which is rare for a fighting game that isn't tekken, and many big tournaments have been won by people using characters that are considered low tier. This means that you can find a character you like and not have to worry about how viable they are ( warning!! you might never be able to decide on a main )\n\nGuilty gear features a heavy metal/rock soundtrack with some chill tracks, there are also some really catchy vocal tracks by Naoki Hashimoto, lead singer of the japanese band Outrage. All voice acting is done in japanese, and the performances are great all around, the cast itself has some pretty famous voice actors like takehito koyasu, junichi suwabe, and hikaru midorikawa. The game features a great tutorial mode, as well as combo mode which teaches you viable character combos, mission mode which teaches basic and advanced techniques as well as how to handle different situations and mathch ups, episode mode which is a series of fights with character specific cutscenes at the beginning and end, versus mode, M.O.M mode aka. arcade mode on steroids, story mode which is basically a movie made in the game's engine, gallery mode where you can buy ( with in-game currency ) additional character colors, music tracks, artwork and more, digital figure mode which allows you to create dioramas, and finally online mode which has great netcode ( as little as one frame delay, usually no more than 4, in my experience) and is pretty active ( since the rev 2 demo is out on ps4 many people are playing that right now so online might be less active than usuall ) when looking for player matches, not many people play ranked. The lobby mode which the console versions have is being added in the rev 2 update. \n\nIf you read my entire review I thank you. If you have any questions feel free to ask. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1494269413, "timestamp_updated": 1494269413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662793", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31629594": {"recommendationid": "31629594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039260355", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496682528}, "language": "russian", "review": "10 \u0443\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10!", "timestamp_created": 1494262045, "timestamp_updated": 1494262045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503319", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31623853": {"recommendationid": "31623853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104829209", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513940908}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u9762\u7cbe\u7ec6\uff0c\u5728\u683c\u6597\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7b97\u662f\u9876\u7ea7\uff1b\u5267\u60c5\u4e30\u6ee1\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u5e9e\u5927\uff1b \u548cBB\u4e00\u6837\u90fd\u662f\u4e70\u756a\u9001\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f5c\u611f\u89c9AI\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f31\u2026\u2026\n\n\u6211\u82e6\u82e6\u5bfb\u627e\u4e86\u534a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u624d\u627e\u51fa\u83dc\u5355BGM\uff1adjango django \u7f51\u6613\u4e91\u97f3\u4e50\u6709", "timestamp_created": 1494244988, "timestamp_updated": 1494244988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31568833": {"recommendationid": "31568833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019162543", "num_games_owned": 534, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 49025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1584, "last_played": 1516260430}, "language": "english", "review": "good stuff", "timestamp_created": 1494024866, "timestamp_updated": 1501723668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513130", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31554016": {"recommendationid": "31554016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035857846", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "last_played": 1516079726}, "language": "english", "review": "at this point i dont think i need to say anything", "timestamp_created": 1493966618, "timestamp_updated": 1493966618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31539609": {"recommendationid": "31539609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023679446", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "last_played": 1516279809}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u5f88\u6709\u8bda\u610f\uff01\u6bd4\u8857\u97385\u597d\u73a9\u591a\u4e86\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7f51\u7edc\u8054\u673a\u65b9\u9762233", "timestamp_created": 1493897335, "timestamp_updated": 1493897335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543487", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31536544": {"recommendationid": "31536544", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993655316", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 2127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500731030}, "language": "english", "review": "ASW is doing what capcom should be doing with street fighter, supplying a complete game with a solid netcode and lots of single player content to keep you busy.", "timestamp_created": 1493878660, "timestamp_updated": 1493878660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508646", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31533955": {"recommendationid": "31533955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078139201", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502955161}, "language": "english", "review": "I think any game that gets me into that \"just one more game\" mode and staying up well into the next morning deserves some credit.

The tutorial is amazing and I highly recommend Revelator as a point of entry for beginners of the series.\n\nFor veterans, there are some aspects of Xrd that are offputting, but none unfamiliar to those who've played Sign previously. Turning RCs into a \"slow-motion\" button creates for some ridiculously easy option selects, and distills some of the series' roots into somewhat more of a \"dial-a-combo\" mentality. Some characters play differently from their XX counterparts. Some for the better (May, Venom, Potemkin, for example), and some arriving to Xrd with some questionable executive decisions applied to them. If you're like me and have spent a lot of time in Accent Core, and for some reason you haven't yet played Xrd, be warned that your \"main\" might not be as good in this game.\n\nThat said, the netcode is superb. The lobbies aren't as active compared to the PS4 version, but it's still a blast to play online.

Well...\n\nPros:\n+Gameplay is smooth as butter and fast-paced as well. Always keeping the adrenaline rushing.\n+The Artwork, It leaves me breathless. It's so beautiful and so well made!\n+Amazing Soundtrack, It fits the gameplay perfectly and each character has it's own theme!\n+The Tutorial, being really different from what it was in -SIGN- and it is MUCH better.\n+The Combos/Missions Mode are more than enough for you to learn everything about the character/the mechanics.\n+Fishing! A small yet entertaining way to unlock a lot of things.\n+Digital Figures..Oh boy, you can spend hours and hours in this mode with the stuff you get exclusively from fishing.\n+The variety of characters in the roster, Each having it's charm and unique playstyle!\n+Daisuke Ishiwatari.\n+The Waifus and Husbandos.\n---\nCons:\n-/+The price is a bit too expensive so it's hard to invite someone to get the game, but it's understandable with the amount of content the game has to offer.\n-/+No English Dub, Yet. It was removed so the English Release would be closer to the Japanese one.\n-/+The Story Mode is a looong cinematic (Of up to +7 hours!), that means. It's not playable like it was on the Arcade mode of -SIGN-. But, it's a continuation and it's beautiful.\n-If you dislike Anime then..this game will literally melt you, that goes for those who also hate Japanese voices, but you can turn them off in the options menu.\n-/+Like every fighting game ever. It's easy to pick up and hard to master. Like it should be.\n-Buying the game now when Revelator 2 is coming out soon (in May)..That means..Even more expensive!\n-Only being able to get stuff for your Lobby avatar via Fishing..\n-You can't play with One Keyboard & One Controller. The game won't recognize the Controller as Player 2..So you are forced to use TWO controllers for Local play.\n---\nThe game is pretty underrated in my opinion. And that may be due to it's price being high.\nI don't blame anyone for that. Since the old GG's are pretty popular from what i've seen, and every single one of them is good, having amazing soundtrack and gameplay. Always.\n\nSo..Do i recommend this game?\nAbsolutely, For me. It's easily the best fighting game of 2017. The only bad thing being the price like i said before.\nAnd if you buy it now. You can buy Revelator 2 later (Unless you are poor like me and you are not gonna do that.)\nBut if you don't want to. You don't have to and just enjoy the game as it is.

The game shines and excels in pretty much every element. It might not be the easiest fighter, but it's definitely the one worth learning. Anyways, let me explain a bit more in detail what makes this game so damn good.\n\nCharacters: Every character in roster feels unique and interesting, be it when it comes to the gameplay itself, their design, or their backgrounds and personalities, which you will see both in story and in gameplay itself. They even have special interactions between each other during combat(while executing certain special moves or instant kills), and things like that really add to the overall experience.\n\nGameplay: Fighting is fun and fast paced, although it isn't the simplest fighter out there, since it has quite a lot of mechanics that you will probably need to learn if you wanna play well. Still, it doesn't feel overwhelming and it's definitely worth learning. When it comes to characters, no character feels the same and they often have some very character-specific mechanics(Sin's food meter, Johnny's coins etc.) which adds to their overall playstyle variety and gives a lot of interesting matchups. \n\nGraphics: Best looking fighting game out there, no contest. Great looking backgrounds, amazing looking characters and animations. -SIGN- already looked damn amazing, -REVELATOR- looks even better with some graphical updates like dynamic lighting that affects characters and backgrounds. \n\nMusic: Guilty Gear always had an amazing soundtrack and this game is no expection. One of the best soundtracks ever made IMO. There are also tons of hard rock and heavy metal references through the whole game, not only in OST, but also in character designs, move names, story etc. etc. which you will probably appreciate if you like that kind of music. You can also unlock most of the BGMs from previous GG games with in-game money. \n\nStory: Revelator has a non-interactive 5 hour story mode, which is essentially a movie, fully voiced and animated. Story is quite fun and enjoyable, although there's a lot of anime bs in second half.\n\nTutorial: They made a brand new tutorial for this game, which tries to explain basic fighting game mechanics through mini games. Then there is and advanced section with missions that try to explain some more advanced mechanics through practical use in combat and also matchup specific stuff. For some reason, some of the mechanics, like danger time, aren't explained in either of those two modes, although they are mentioned and roughly explained in FAQ which you can open in pause screen. Not sure why would they bother making a brand new tutorial mode and then omit stuff like that, even though those were all included in -SIGN- tutorial mode.\n\nOther content: Besides stuff mentioned above, there is M.O.M. mode, Arcade mode, Versus Mode Training mode, Online mode with ranked matchmaking and player lobbies, where, besides usual fighting and spectating, you can show off your avatars, emotes and also play football(kind of).

Aside from having probably the best cell-shaded graphics on the market (where the characters pretty much look like they would in 2-D), and one of the best soundtracks, the game also goes a step further and has a story that...while not the best, is defintely fun enough to watch.\n\nUnlike it's predecessor, -Sign-, -Revelator- Includes the \"stylish\" fighting style. This is very similar to Marvel Vs Capcom's \"Easy\" Controls from dreamcast. When you mash certain buttons, you will perform a combo of attacks, and you also are given a special button to do certain overdrive moves. It does have many downsides, as it will make your character weak than Technical, on top of limiting your combos to only what the game gives you. But if you are completely new to fighting games and just want to jump in to the single player and try to enjoy it before you learn, then this is a very good option to do so. I do not recommend it for multiplayer unless you are against someone else using stylish, however.\n\nThe story mode has a huge fault due to being non-interactive, however it also has the plus of being an unfragmented, fairly decent 3-4 hour story. And on top of this, you still have the typical Arcade mode and M.O.M. (which is basically a replayable single player mode). To add though, unlike -Sign-, -Revelator- does not have dubbed voices, meaning you will have to read everything you see.\n\nWhile I have not personally experienced the multiplayer, I have heard that -Revelator- has some of the best balance. As said though, if you wish to play competitively, you will need to gradually switch off of Stylish and learn all the moves and combos to really enjoy it.\n\nPros: Good Multiplayer, 2 Single Player Modes, Stylish moveset for new players, technical for veteran players, one of best albums in gaming, beautiful looking game, probably the best story as far as fighting games go.\n\nCons: non-interactive story (a con for some), very high learning curve if not using stylish, competitive stylish is impossible, must read all dialogue to appreciate story\n\nI would recommend this game to hardcore fighters who just want a solid fighting game, but can also recommend it to player's wanting a fighting game they can play single player, especially if they haven't yet learned fighting game mechanics.\n\nIf the price goes down, such as a discount, I would even recommend it for the story alone. Though you will also need -Sign- to get the entire story!", "timestamp_created": 1489381374, "timestamp_updated": 1489381374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30480762": {"recommendationid": "30480762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015357009", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 59, "last_played": 1515782721}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, so before I start, let me make one thing unmistakably clear: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE GODLIKE EXECUTION TO BE GOOD AT THIS GAME. Guilty Gear is a game about spacial awareness, about knowing your opponent, about doing the right thing at the right time. None of these things are Combo Video-level execution. GET THIS INTO YOUR HEAD. I play Pot, okay? I can't do 6K loops to save my life. My motor abilities rival those of a trained orangutan. And yet, I still win matches. It can be done, people.\n\nAlright, with that out of the way: This game is the full package. Deep, nucanced, fast-paced, balanced for fun and yet every character is 100% tournament viable. The amount of mechanical freedom you're given can be overwhelming at first, but once everything clicks, the battlefield becomes a canvas that you paint on. If you like you express yourself through your playstyle, look no further. No two Kys play quite the same, no two Slayers play quite the same. Every Millia plays like an asshole, but still, you feel the little differences from player to player. I guarantee you.\n\nAnd Xrd rewards good reads like almost no other fighting game does. Every tool has a clear counter, and every counter can be baited. Hell, you have about five different options from blockstun alone. And nobody expects you to learn all of these from day 1 onwards. But what you have to understand is that playing this game is a learning process pretty much all the way through. There is no shame in burning all your meter on Faultless Defense, just like there are no \"optimal\" ways to play your Character.  There aren't even real optimal combo routes most of the time. Instead, you will find yourself observing your position on the screen and adjusting your punishes accordingly. If you're coming from Street Fighter V, where frame data is everything, this will absolutely blow your mind at first. But again, when you're finally starting to get it, you will wonder how a sterile, mathematical system like the one in SFV can even be considered \"fighting\", really.\n\nFinally, this game is absolutely breathtaking, on both a technical and an artistic level. If you even have a passing interest in 3D-modelling, this is the absolute cream of the crop. Character models morph and smear, with multiple shaders giving the game an impression if having animated 2D-Sprites. Occasionally, the game pans around the action to remind you that, no, these are actually 3D models, and they look fan-fucking-tastic. The same can be said for the soundtrack, with Hard Rock and Metal riffs blasting trhough your speakers. J-Metal might not be everyone's cup of tea and it certainly isn't mine, usually. But Revelator remains one of the few fighting games where I still listen to the soundtrack instead of my own playlist.\n\nI mean, yeah, it's kind of expensive for an impulse buy, I get it. But look at me: I just wrote a 500-word essay on this game. And you read it, apparently (thanks, by the way). Here's the deal: I spent about 200 hours in SFV before I realized I just wasn't enjoying myself like I hoped I would. I am having *fun* in Xrd, more than I ever had in the Street Fighters.

The match making just takes a look on the character level and not an actual player level (it depends on that \"one specific character\" he played and does not state the general status of the player. so they can simply pick another character they didn't play that much and brutally slay beginners).\n\nbut as i said it takes time to get used to the controls and all the \"fighting game knowledge\" it's just the multi-player which should give the beginners fair chance to learn about this game just bites the dust.\n\noh, and yeah the story mode is not actual gameplay but you just sit there and watch an 4 hours and half long anime movie which is quite entertaining when you want to watch some anime. \n\nStill good game has got nice waifus and keeps entertaining you as long as you stay away from that multiplayer mode\n\nVerdict:\nIf you are confident in your skill and familiar with the Guilty Gear Series (OR just want to get some time killing game including an anime movie of 4 hours and half playtime) then a BIG YES\n\nElse if you are looking for a good fighting game to play online then rather NO (except you really don't care about that)", "timestamp_created": 1487291951, "timestamp_updated": 1487291951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29968506": {"recommendationid": "29968506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037610987", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 29776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2069, "last_played": 1516373141}, "language": "english", "review": "LET'S TRIGGER FANBOYS WITH SOME TRUTHS:\n- Lack of player base on PC since there is no cross-play.\n- Bad Ranked matches system, already dead, people still skip it cause its badly done.\n- They say the netcode is better but actually its the same with SIGN and reality is its just ok.

In revelator you need that ''World Dollars'' to unlock the existed same colors.\n- No alternate costumes. Same colors.\n- No English dubs btw. Almost all chars are non-japanese but they are trying to speak Eng.  This is like having Japanese version of Dante only for DMC or Umvc3.\n- If you dont like guitar solos you wont like the music this game has.\n- Really small buffer times will give you cancer.\n- The gameplay itself is attack-only oriented. Very friendly for spammers.\n- Best defensive option is to keep mashing HS so if opponent screws up his combo, you'll get a throw.\n- Punishes are non-existed.

I'll post more on that later when it comes out June 1st, but Rev 2 will have a LOT of new features.\n\nThe training mode, stylish mode (easier control scheme for beginners) and FAQs are still there, so the game will still help newcomers to the series git gud, but not only that, there will be beginner restricted lobbies that'll keep higher leveled players out so beginners and casual players can enjoy playing the game in relative peace.\n\nOther new lobby features include network colors (up or down arrows of various colors to indicate the level of a player's skill in relation to yours), three win cabinets (where players can go best of three matches in the center of the lobby), and treasure chests (which give you random prizes from the gallery, much like fishing, except they can only be opened once daily).\n\nSeriously, every time Guilty Gear Xrd releases a new update, there's more and more reasons to play it.\n\nSource:\nhttp://gematsu.com/2017/04/guilty-gear-xrd-rev-2-pc-launches-june-1-online-lobbies-detailed\n\nOriginal Review:\nGuilty Gear Xrd -REVELATOR- improves on everything -SIGN- brought to the table,  Blitz shields can now be held for a (blockable) stagger attack, which can even be used in some combos.  The game's still pretty high execution, but some chraacters are easier to play than others.  I'm a Chipp main, so the struggle to git gud is real.  Still, I love how much this game pushes its players.  But don't worry if you're new to fighting games, the tutorial's got you covered, mission mode teaches game mechanics and tips the tutorial doesn't, and combo mode teaches you character specific moves and combos.\n\nOnline is more populated than -SIGN- was on Steam because now it's up to date with the console release (until Rev 2 comes out, anyway), and there's people of all skill levels playing at any given time.  There are a lot of people who are REALLY good at the game who you'll probably run into, but there are some beginners as well.\n\nBut if you bought the game, and the tutorials, missions and combo modes aren't enough enough to teach you everything you want to know (and they do kinda leave out a few things), check out the Guilty Gear Crash Course on YouTube, dustloop forums or the Guilty Gear Discord channel.  I'll post those at the end of my review in a resources section.\n\nPros:\nThe game's cast is extremely diverse, every character has a different fighting style.\nThe in-game track selection now includes songs from the vocal collection (as well as vocal versions of songs from previous games in the franchise).\nFishing lets you obtain random unlockables pretty cheap, but you'll get a lot of fish (but every 10 fish you get gives you a new unlockable!).\nThe game gives you so many options at all times.  Once you get a feel for what you can do, situationally, you'll find yourself improving dramatically.  The more time and effort you put into the game, the more it gives back.\nIf you get exhausted from mission, combo or online modes, play the story mode (recommended if you completed -SIGN-'s story mode (the order of events go -SIGN- arcade mode, -SIGN- story mode, -REVELATOR- episode mode (basically just arcade mode again) and -REVELATOR- story mode.  I really CAN'T stress how good the game's story is.  I have friends who haven't watched it yet and I'm all like \"DO IT!\"  Seriously, it's so good.\n\nCons:\nThe execution barrier and skill of high level players can be intimidating to new players who hop online and suddenly get bodied, BUT DON'T GIVE UP!  And remember to have fun.\nThey did nerf reversal timing from -SIGN-, so if you really want to do a reversal, you have to wait longer.  But it's better to just block on your wakeup.

There's plenty of single player content, but this game really shines if you have at least one friend to play with.

Game revolves around okizeme and each character plays vastly different from one another. Matchups matter because each character has such varied normals that you find yourself playing your character in ways you don't normally think you would depending on the matchup and how high a skill level you're playing in.\n\nGame has a lot of options on offense thanks to cancelling anything at any time with meter and provides options on defense and forces you to learn to block and look for opportunities due to how fast the game can be. A good fighter to get into once you have some fundementals down after playing Street Fighter.\n\nArcsys has always done that thing where they balance and add a few new characters to the game with each iteration but charge damn near full price. Not any different here. It's slightly justified in that each iteration always moves the story forward for anyone that cares for that sort of thing. Given that the story mode is done with the game engine and how it's hours long it's slightly justified. You've also got a lot of bonus features in the periphery, such as a slightly adjusted and upgraded graphical engine, inclusion of more music, a new statue mode where you can pose the character models and take pics, which is pretty cool. It's a lot of incremental additions that make me think this game would be fine at the 30 dollar range. \n\nThey've already announced revelator 2 for the spring, and given Arcsys record of delay with releasing games on PC I'd say it'll be here sometime in the summer and/or early fall, given how Arcsys said it'll be a downloadable upgrade to the base game. Don't know how they'll handle it on PC but it's pretty clear Arcsys' old model of game releases is stuck in the past and needs some tuning. \n\nBeyond all of that the game is fantastic and given how matchups matter and how each character plays real different you'll be spending an assload of time trying to get your character down just right. It took me over 100 hours on the first game getting the game down and practicing Axl, and given how my main for Rev (Johnny) is all situational and pressure oriented it'll probably be 100 hours more.\n\nAlso, as of this writing (February 2017) the online is surprisingly alive and well. I never have any issues finding multiple rooms with people to fight.\n\nMy leaving tip of advice is this: don't get discouraged. If you go online you're gonna get raped, and you're gonna be confused at the outset given how this is possibly the most complicated fighter out on the market at the moment. Trust me; we were all shit. Some people are coming in from the old GG's so they have a good foundation, but everyone was shit at one point. Hell I'm ass at Johnny atm, but at the very least I have a good foundation on the game and do well with Axl. \n\nPoint is if you're not a casual (I don't mean that as an insult) and want a good fighter to sink time into this is it. You'll most likely get raped for the first month, but if you commit to it damn is it fun. It's the difference between doing real world street racing and playing mario kart; one is easier and instant gratification cause it's so simple, the other has a hurdle you gotta get over, but once you do you have so much more fun because there's so much more going on.", "timestamp_created": 1485752950, "timestamp_updated": 1485753205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0,

Jogo Guilty Gear desde o Missing Link para PSX e foi o jogo de luta que me inseriu no cenario competitivo.\n\nPonto positivo vai obviamente para a trilha sonora. Gosto muito da OST da serie Accent Core, mas as musicas do Sign e Revelator tambem sao muito boas. Vale ressaltar que o Revelator disponibiliza a OST de todos os jogos da serie, inclusive do Guilty Gear Isuka (uma das melhores trilhas na minha opiniao).\n\nOs personagens sao carismaticos, criativos e unicos. Cada um possui um gameplay muito peculiar e grande potencial de vitoria, o que torna o jogo bastante balanceado e cheio de possibilidades. Acho que isso era mais evidente na serie Accent Core, visto que o Sign e Revelator foram produzidos sob uma otica mais amigavel para atrair novos jogadores.\n\nMeu unico ponto \"negativo\" com relacao a serie eh a dificuldade em se tornar um bom jogador. Eh um jogo complexo e com curva de aprendizado nao muito amigavel. Chegar ao ponto em que o jogo fica divertido por voce dominar a movimentacao frenetica e os combos estilosos, podendo se equiparar competitivamente com outros jogadores relativamente experientes, eh muito motivador. Mas passar disso para entender o jogo a fundo, em que situacoes fazer qual tipo de jogada e tudo isso dentro de intervalos curtos de tempo (pois o jogo eh rapido e agressivo) pode ser frustrante a principio e levar um tempo ate que o jogador se acostume com a ideia.\n\nIsso era bem evidente na serie Accent Core e anteriores. Agora com a serie XRD o jogo esta um pouco mais facilitado, entao nao eh tao dificil se tornar um player destacavel no ranking, em campeonatos ou mesmo em jogatinas casuais. O que pode ser um ponto frustrante para jogadores old school da serie, mas no geral eh bem vantajoso devido a grande playerbase que o jogo tem atraido, alem do proprio destaque do jogo em grandes torneios como a EVO.\n\nResumindo, o jogo eh muito bonito, OST fantastica, personagens legais, criativos e variados. Eh muito satisfatorio dominar as mecanicas e combos, possibilitando fazer jogadas estilosas e bonitas. Apesar da curva de aprendizado ainda ser relativamente elevada, todo jogador de jogos de luta que simpatize com air dashers deveria dar uma espiada em Guilty Gear! =)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1484130480, "timestamp_updated": 1484130480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29156794": {"recommendationid": "29156794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295541254", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 28204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1281, "last_played": 1516121722}, "language": "schinese", "review": "We need Chinese please!", "timestamp_created": 1484030885, "timestamp_updated": 1484030885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29155482": {"recommendationid": "29155482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286239346", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 942, "last_played": 1515673125}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5b98\u65b9\u4e2d\u6587\u51fa\u4e0d\u51fa\uff1f\u7ed9\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u6d88\u606f\u5c31\u884c\u4e86\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1484022749, "timestamp_updated": 1484022749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29155201": {"recommendationid": "29155201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092169304", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 33284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1472, "last_played": 1516104000}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u8ddf\u4f60\u8bb2\uff0c\u5154\u5b50\u7684\u6b27\u6d3e\uff0c\u8d5e\ud83d\udc4d#\n\n\n\u7136\u540e\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u8fa3\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\u7e41\u7b80\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1484021208, "timestamp_updated": 1486023599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29138959": {"recommendationid": "29138959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143869057", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 3071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "last_played": 1515993241}, "language": "english", "review": "pros:\n-Story\n-best Tutorial\n-Elphet boobs\n\nCons:\n-u can't play with one keyboard and 2nd player using Controller\n-Dizzy is a milf :(", "timestamp_created": 1483961211, "timestamp_updated": 1483961211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481393", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29136452": {"recommendationid": "29136452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108182305", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496652346}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good", "timestamp_created": 1483949610, "timestamp_updated": 1483949610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29130718": {"recommendationid": "29130718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176644635", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 9174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1515361810}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not sure how to rate a fighting game, other then how fluid the game is.

system the reason why I recommend this game.\n\nFirst of this is a good pc port from an options perspective (can't compare performance, so not commenting on that). You can rebind all keys and the game acknowledges your changes.\nSay you rebind punch and kick and you start the tutorial. By default the moves will show up as P (punch) or K (kick), but in the options menu you can change that to either xbox controller prompts or keyboard prompts and it will show the keys you bound to the attacks.\n\nThe tutorial is really extensive and goes over the generic basics and also character specific combo's. When starting out with the character specific combo training the game will show 2 fighting sticks in the middle of the screen. One is the example and the other is your input. This helps when trying to figure out what to do and if you don't fully get it that way you can still go to the options menu and watch an example of what you are supposed to do by letting an AI do it for you.\n\nThere is also a lot of style in this game. Some attacks start a really small animation where you for instance smash your opponent into the air and then the camera returns to the regular 2D view. What I first thought was \"This can be annoying when trying to combo.\", but it surprisingly isn't since the animation is short and you instantly get control back after it.\n\nThere are also 2 forms of story mode.\nOne is a sort of prelogue to the actual story. In this story mode you fight opponents and get a bit of story at the start and end of some of the fights. When completing the prelogue of a character you unlock more colours for said character.\nThe \"real\" story mode is an entire movie about the game's story. I haven't viewed it yet since I like a some  action in fighting games, but it is a really cool idea and from the short bit that I saw in the first chapter the art style is up to par with the game itself.\n\nBesides the story modes and tutorials there is also a versus mode where you fight the AI head on like you would a human opponent. I would call the AI good since I have some real difficulty with normal, but it is still do-able. There is of course an only mode, but this is something I also haven't played so I can't comment on that part of the game.\nFinally there is a special mode called M.O.M. where you fight the AI in normal versus matches, but you earn medals every time you beat your opponent. These medals allow you to buy items etc. The fights in this mode are more tense than regular vs matches, because you 1 have a timer and 2 need to beat your opponent 3 times in a single fight if you want to win. This also makes the mode quite hard, so it offers a good challenge.\n\nThe fighters all feel different. When playing something like Jack'O you place spawners on the ground that pop out minions that attack your opponent. When playing Fause you can teleport and smash doors into the face of your opponent. Dizzy uses spells to attack opponents at range with a lot of damage. Venom is a fighter that spread biliard balls and shoots them at his opponent, and the list just goes on.\nThe point is they all feel completely different. This is something I missed in for example Street Fighter where the differences between characters are sometimes really small or they can just be ignored.\n\nA small extra in the game is a diorama mode where you can place fighters you have unlocked in different poses with different colours on one of up to 5 \"plates\" (2 large plates that can fit 2 fighters and 3 smaller ones that fit 1).\n\nWith every fight you get more ingame currency which allows you to go fish. Fishing is something that allows you to unlock things for your player card and diorama mode. This is a really basic thing, but it is something slightly different, presentation-wise, then the graveyard from Mortal Kombat.\n\nWhat would I like to see? Something like the random mutator mode from MK, because playing with friends can be unbalanced if you know how to play and they don't. Besides that it is also fun to play vs AI sometimes where you or they can be randomly buffed or handicapped.\nAnd more fighters of course, but what's there is amazing and they all fight in a different way.", "timestamp_created": 1483451078, "timestamp_updated": 1483451078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539978", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase":

This is a work of art and is a must have for any fighting game fan. I almost delayed my purchase a few months to get it on sale, and boy am I glad I didn't. This game is a blast to play, and if you enjoy fighting games, there is a good chance you'll have fun with this.\n\nNow for the bad news, this game is hard. Like, the most difficult fighting game I've played besides street fighter 4(I'll never be able to get over the combo system in that game, but that's another story). If you are new to fighting games, i'd recommend this game because it's great, but I'd recommend a game like Under Night In-Birth EXE Late more than this. The reason being though this game does have an outstanding tutorial, it's a very high entry barrier compared to UNIEL and UNIEL will make beginners feel like they are having fun and doing well. Guilty Gear will make you feel like you suck and need to stop trying. I have been playing fighting games for several years, and have been playing seriously for about 6-9 months and it is still difficult for me to learn this game. While I feel I will start to get the hang of things within a few weeks of playing, beginners will not have that luxury. If you do not plan to get good or play online, set the bots to easy, play the story, and then decide if you want to get better. You'll probably like the game more that way, and the story alone is probably worth the money. If you to plan to play competitively, please bring a buddy along with you. You will get dominated by Japanese players who have lived most of their lives with guilty gear in the arcade if you do not. \n\nNow for my overall review. The tutorial system is fantastic. The art is top notch. The mechanics are easy to learn, but hard to master. The character design is outstanding. And finally, the soundtrack will melt your ears right off. The game's mix of anime and metal works quite nicely and the game is quite enjoyable. Probably the best fighting game on steam currently. Possibly the best feature of this game though is not having 6 frames of lag or installing rootkits(cough SFV cough). Definitely worth every penny, and your money helps arcsys make even more amazing fighting games.\n\nTLDR: Possibly best fighting game, just be prepared to suck until you put the hours into it. Also, play with friends for the most fun.\n\nEDIT/LONG RANT AFTER THE REVIEW: I have put several more hours into this game, and can safely say it is easier to get used to than I expected. The game feels very much like Blazblue, but different in ways that I actually prefer. Overdrive cancels are done with Roman Cancels(basically no wasting burst) and the the Dust button is always a welcome addition. As one of my friends put it, it is somewhere in between Skullgirls and Blazblue. Even though it doesn't inherently feel anything like Skullgirls at the surface level, there are similarities. Do I still prefer other games for beginners? Absolutely, but still play Guilty Gear. If you are unsure what fighting game to buy, like I said before, Under Night In-Birth EXE Late is half the price of this and is the easiest anime fighter I have played. I would also recommend Skullgirls, which is half the price of UNIEL and while not as simple, is way easier than guilty gear and will at least prepare you for longer combos than Guilty Gear has to offer. I cannot stress enough. Find a friend/sparring partner and practice. Practice is really the only way to \"git gud\" and though the journey is long and the climb is steep, you will see progress and it will drive you to get better. So, if you are up to the task, buy this game. If you are unsure, buy Skullgirls or UNIEL. In the case of Skullgirls, it's single player is fantastic and 2nd encore allows you to learn combos in a similar fasion to the Guilty Gear combo training.", "timestamp_created": 1483161258, "timestamp_updated": 1483585719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28852425": {"recommendationid": "28852425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026678886", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 3899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512717420}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc6a9\uc11c\ud574\uc8fc\uc138\uc694!", "timestamp_created": 1483150758, "timestamp_updated": 1483150758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28836567": {"recommendationid": "28836567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130983790", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498561994}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439 GG \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e \u0443\u043c\u0430, \u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f Unreal E 3 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u043a \u043e\u043f\u0442\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e. \n\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u044e\u0441\u044c \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f.", "timestamp_created": 1483119760, "timestamp_updated": 1483119760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598784", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28834477": {"recommendationid": "28834477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199159418", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513368982}, "language": "english", "review": "Best fighting game ever, for me at least :3", "timestamp_created": 1483116013, "timestamp_updated": 1483116013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489083", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28827815": {"recommendationid": "28827815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067877204", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1515671792}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun.

I'm back again to review a title that I am quite fond of. Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator. This is an update to Guilty Gear Xrd Sign that came out last year, and while it may not add 5,000 metric tons of saucy content that fans might be expecting, the fact is that this game is one of the finest fighting games IN EXISTENCE.\n\nFor newcomers to the fighting game genre, Guilty Gear can be a bit daunting, like going 12 rounds against Godzilla in a Primetime Heavyweight Boxing match for the grand title. But never fear newcomers. Revelator sports one of the finest tutorials in all of fighting games. They teach you all the mechanics from moving your character to even performing basic option selects. Isn't that just wonderful?\n\nAs far as new content in Revelator, there are some worthwhile additions to know about. Most notable are new characters Johnny, Jack-O, Jam, Raven, Haehyun, and Dizzy. All of them look great in action AS TO BE EXPECTED. The entire game has received new shading graphical stuff that makes the game look even more impressive if that's even possible. Needless to say, this is my pick for best looking fighting game of all time. It's like 3d models made to look like 2d sprites and it's just beautiful madness. And the soundtrack? The sound track is jamming. Dozens of delicious rock tracks, new and old from past games, make this OST an exciting barbeque rib platter that always keeps you coming back for more. \n\nOne thing that needs to be mentioned are the lightning fast load times. Compared to games like Street Fighter 5, and even the PS4 version of Revelator, the load times in this are top tier quaility. It takes no time at all to start match after match and, for fighter enthusiasts who will be grinding on this game for days to come, you will appreciate this.\n\nSo let's talk about the core gameplay itself. How would I describe it in one word? Dynamic, Saucetastic, Gratifying, Elegant, Gorilla, Off-the-Backboard Dunk, and Crusher Ball. Any one of those words would suffice. The gameplay is incredibly deep with many, many different universal mechanics to learn. Things like Roman Cancels and Burst keep you invloved at all times and with so many ways to use resources, the depth of this game is like the a deep sea ocean trench covered in an eternal darkness that beckons to swallow any unfortunate soul who wanders too close to its saucy aroma.\n\nThe characters all have great designs and very different playstyles. Most characters have a defining trait or mechanic that makes it quite the endeavor just to learn one character in this game. It rewards practice and creativity, AND I LIKE THAT. Any fighting game fan will appreciate the originality and depth that the gameplay and characters bring to the table.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you are fan of fighters, this is a game that you should literally have in your shopping cart at this very moment. If your wallet isn't in your hand right this minute ready to make a transaction leading to your ownership of this title, than I would suggest you take steps toward that end. It's got sublime music, top of the line graphics and visuals, and a fighting game system that rivals any other. This is one philly cheese steak that deserves some more support.\n\nTo sum things up, If Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator was a beverage, it would most likely be Universe Juice.

an expensive DLC for Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- and you'd be wrong.\nGuilty Gear Xrd -REVELATOR- brings up new characters, new game mechanics, global lighting, a new lobby system, a new story arc and a lot more goodies (extended gallery, diorama figures, fishing...).\n\nDizzy, Johnny, Jam get back to Guilty Gear along with [strike]Crow[/strike] Raven from Guilty Gear 2: Overture and 2 brand-new characters, no need to say that the amount of detail fits Xrd standards (anime like shadows and moves, now even with global lighting)\nNew mechanics are definitely not [b]that[/b] new/exiting but they still add something to the gameplay, the new lobby system on the other hand is amazing: you get your customizable avatar moving around inside a room with actual cabinets (max 4 + 1 for training mode) and you challenge people in line on the room, amazing.\nStory mode feels actually a lot better than Xrd -SIGN- one because the team focused more on \"anime\", with better photography and camera angles and the addition of global lighting.\nFinally goodies section is so huge... a few honorable mentions are: voice actor bonus speech, diorama action figures, usable (during fights) music tracks from all over Guilty Gear history.\n\nOf course [b]everything[/b] from the paragraph above on top of Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN-, probably with a better netplay (lv.3 connections grant you a very good match, lv.4 connections allow totally safe reaction play throughout the game, very enjoyable).\nRight now I cannot recommend any fighting game for PC better than this one and personally I think this is one of the greatest ones I ever played.\n\nStrongly recommended for everyone, a must have for anime and/or fighting games enthusiasts.", "timestamp_created": 1482706597, "timestamp_updated": 1482870855,

can wait for a discount of course, like many are doing. But it is a really good game. I am not regretting the purchase, though the high price made me not buy a second copy. Still, it has by far the best fighting game graphics (if you care), a truly great tutorial, awesome gameplay which mean it is definitely worth buying, but whether or not it is worth buying right now, at this price? That question is one each person must answer individually. I've decided that yes, it is, and so I've played it.\n\nAt least Revelator won't be outdated for at least a year (blame the dev, not me, if it's untrue), so that seems very promising. Since the Engrish trailer mentions \"exciting updates\" and \"more battle actions ahead (???)\" right after listing the entire roster, I bet more characters are on the way, though you never know for sure.

With Revelator, the lobby now includes a customizable cute avatar and a virtual environment.  Multiplayer uses the basic Steam friends features and the netplay is lag-free in my experience.\n\nThe meat of GG Xrd is a cast of diverse, well-balanced characters who ooze personality.  While rushdown and setplay are major themes of the game, every character archetype you'd expect from a complete fighter is represented: grapplers, projectile zoners, \"Dhalsim\" stretchy zoning, rekkas.  There's even a character that fills the screen with minions.\n\nEasy to learn, hard to master mechanics provide a lot of room for creativity, but don't require grinding out perfection in practice mode as much as many games... but if that's your thing, you can construct optimal combos and set-ups in the training room for hours.  The \"Gatling\" (chain combo) system makes the game approachable for new players who are often put off by awkward link comboing.  There's even a \"stylish\" mode where inputs are simplified so you can play with your scrub friends.\n\nDespite being fairly technical, Xrd is a spectacular intro for fighting game and Guilty Gear outsiders.  Newbies can start with a tutorial teaching basic controls, play through missions designed to teach concepts and basic skills, and end with character specific combo challenges that you'll actually use.  There's also a full arcade and story mode, although the story mode is more of a visual novel.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous, but also convey information clearly.  For such a hectic game, you'll never feel that a move's animation failed to convey its heft or reach. The sound track is a high-energy mashup of heavy metal influences.\n\nGreat performance, quick load times. Plug and play controller support for every controller I've tried.\n\n\nThe Bad\n- No English dubs in -Revelator-.  -Sign- had them.\n- It would be nice to see cross platform play with consoles, even though that feature is very rare.\n- Paying full price for -Sign- plus new characters and a couple of new mechanics... on a six month delay.\n\nThe Awkward\n- It's a little bit weeaboo (but not as bad as other ArcSys games).\n- We're hoping -Revelator-'s release on PC isn't immediately followed by a new version announcement for arcade/consoles.  (But none has shown up in arcades yet.)\n- Unlocking character colors you were accustomed to using in -Sign-.  But this might also be something that keeps players coming back.\n\n\nEven if GG isn't your thing, the quality of Xrd is indisputable.\nFinally: here's a neat video about how they achieved the art style: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhGjCzxJV3E", "timestamp_created": 1482242267, "timestamp_updated": 1482294377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28486353": {"recommendationid": "28486353", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963799189", "num_games_owned": 4746, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507572304}, "language": "english", "review": "\"HEAVEN OR HELL, LET'S ROCK!\"\nSince the beginning of the series back on the original Playstation, the announcer in Guilty Gear has been calling out that same line at the beginning of every fight, and it never gets old. The rich heavy metal stylings of Guilty Gear have evolved constantly since the series inception, from the hard hitting sequel Guilty Gear X on the Dreamcast, the much celebrated Guilty Gear XX: The Midnight Carnival on the Playstation 2 (I'd like to pretend that Guilty Gear Isuka never happened), all the way up to Guilty Gear XX Accent Core on modern systems. And now everything has culminated in the release of the latest chapter, Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator-.\n\nIf you've played any game in the Guilty Gear series you know what you're in for with -Revelator-, from the massive combos that the series is know for to the signature all or nothing instant-kill moves that can end a match instantly if you pull them off, but if you miss, you're toast. The controls are tight, the animations smooth, and the Unreal engine provides a perfect canvas for the series creator Daisuke Ishiwatari to strut his stuff. Instead of hand-drawn animated sprites that the earlier games used, the characters are all 3d models now, and are animated in such a way that they still appear to be hand animated, which is important as timing most moves and combos require you to watch for certain frames in the animation cycle. It's the perfect blend of modern technology and oldschool aesthetic.\n\nSo you have the usual Guilty Gear awesomeness in this package, plus a massive sit-back-and-watch cinematic story mode that will take hours to go through, nearly flawless lag-free online fighting, the requisite Master of Medals mode, and then on top of all that, it's got minigames out the wazoo. You also get a figure mode that lets you collect posable action figures of the main cast, and a bigass gallery of art, music and videos. Everything in the gallery has to be unlocked wither through fight money (world dollars) or fishing them up in the minigame mode. The entire game soundtrack is in there, plus alternate songs from other games in the series. All in all, it's pretty robust.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator- is a shining example of how to bring a fighting game to the PC. There's plenty of graphical options, and the engine is superbly optimized (I can get over 200fps on my GTX 970, and my Alienware Steam machine r1 plays the game at 90+ maxed out). The only thing that let me down is the superb english dub that was present in the previous game, Xrd -Sign-, is missing here due to time constraints. Even so, -Revelator- is pretty much the perfect package, and there's enough content here to keep fighting fans entertained for a long time.

The soundtrack is absolutely astonishing with upbeat electric guitar and drums pumping adrenaline through every match, and the graphical style of Revelator is simple a sight to behold.

The gameplay is fast paced with many unique mechanics to help balance the diverse character play styles.\n\nIf you are new to fighting games, GGxrdR also comes with a fun (actually fun) tutorial, covering all of the basics, along with an incredible number of combo tutorials for every character as well as missions to teach you more about the game and how to overcome specific character match-ups.  I really wish more fighting games were as in-depth as this. \n\nThe only big con is that because the game is so niche, and the playerbase is split between the PS4 and now PC, the online can be a little unreliable to find matches.  You will probably have to do some networking on appropriate forums or find friends to play with if you want consistant matches around your skill level.  Even if you never play online, there are tons to do with the large amount of combo tutorials and missions to complete.\n\nIf you're looking for a modern day fighting game, or just an incredibly solid, complex, traditional fighter, look no further than Guilty Gear Xrd -REVELATOR-, because it will completely fill that void.\n\nWhat if you've never played a Guilty Gear before like me?

If only it didn't take them 6 months and a new upgrade for that... but who cares. At least this time we'll get the new version pretty much at the same time as console, so I can only thank them for showing some care for PC.\n\nI can finally recommend the game as it is.

elaborated.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nVastly improved netcode.\n- Connection is actually consistent now. frame delay sticks to a certain value and I've yet to see spikes of any amount.\n\n\nBetter optimization.\n- I could crank up the graphic settings to maximum now & it'd have no performance impact whatsoever. \n\nAlso worth noting that playing on any stage online is now actually viable & a thing. Unlike back then in steam SIGN, where for the most part you can only play at the Japan & Central Organ Tower map to avoid connection desync between players.\n\n\nBattle damage\n- Scratches now appear on character models after they take damage. It's very minor, but a nice addition nonetheless.\n\n\nOnline Match Room & Fishing Spot\n- I heard there aren't lobbies where you can roam around as on consoles yet, however some of these are in & that's already pretty nice. Inside rooms you can still play football & otherwise, fish for stuffs at the fishing spot.\n\nInside rooms, you are free to linger around & play all of the other offline game modes even. This is great for when you're waiting for players and stuff inside the room.\n\nSince fishing costs in-game money, and they unlock things that aren't unlockable otherwise (e.g. diorama mode items), you could practically grind for in-game money so you can keep unlocking things. Making in-game money more of a thing now & gives you incentives to just keep playing the game, fighting or whatever.  \n\n\nStory & Episode Mode\n- SIGN's story took a slow start at the beginning, since it's very well a new story arc in the universe after XX and they were making sure you weren't lost on the big picture. Since that has been covered though, REVELATOR's story is more on point & more engaging from the get go.\n\nFor those who haven't seen SIGN's story, at the beginning of REVELATOR's, you are also shown the entire story of SIGN in a short recap.\n\nTwo gripes about it however, is that the subtitles are kinda too fast. Another thing being, there's still no seek bars for the story, even though you can pause & save at any moment. The story would continue at the exact moment you saved when you load them again.\n\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nAll in all, it's definitely worth the upgrade from SIGN. The price may be steep, but I understand that these things need money for the R&D (which imo has been spent well on). The game is in a great state now even though it's just been released for PC. Have yet to encounter bugs or things needing fixes. It's great to play both offline & online.\n\nBesides, we all had SIGN for goddamned cheap.

If you, like me, are bummed at the mess that Street Fighter V was/is, have I got a game for you...\n\nPros:\nCharacters - 23 characters, all unique and entertaining, with more possibly on the way\nSingle-player content - With \"Episodes\" for each character and a cinematic story mode for those interested in the deep lore, and a Tutorial, Missions, Combos for every character, and a robust Training mode for the lab monsters, as well as MOM for an interesting take on things.\nCompetitive - Arc System Works has consistently had good netcode, and communities to play with are easy enough to find.\nVisuals - Stunning. Probably the best-looking fighting game in terms of aesthetics.\nMusic - Daisuke Ishiwatari strikes again with new songs like \"Juno\" and \"One Dawn\", while it also includes the same old songs SIGN had and adds classics like \"Awe of She\" and \"Irony of Chaste\" from previous games.\nGameplay - Fantastic as usual, and the addition of Throw Breaks and making Danger Time slightly less random have been positive changes.\n\nCons:\nController support - I'm using a DS4, and even though Steam supports it, REVELATOR does some...odd things. Slightly fixable through the config menu, but still visually confusing.\nPricing - Kinda expensive, especially for the deluxe version. Also, two of the characters are Paid DLC, which kinda grates.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic game. If you don't want to buy it just yet, wait for a sale and you won't regret it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1481939957, "timestamp_updated": 1481939957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492845", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28414602": {"recommendationid": "28414602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080513270", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 51127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1224, "last_played": 1516036129}, "language": "russian", "review": "#GIVEPANTSTOAXL\n", "timestamp_created": 1481931598, "timestamp_updated": 1481931598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502140", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28412261": {"recommendationid": "28412261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087297542", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 56074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1884, "last_played": 1516410780}, "language": "french", "review": "Best fighitng game on Steam right know, Period! \n\nAwesome gameplay, amazing graphics, plenty of content and very very solid online and community around it.\n\nJust get it!!!", "timestamp_created": 1481922033, "timestamp_updated": 1481922033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702415", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28411386": {"recommendationid": "28411386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043568241", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 14474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514768668}, "language": "english", "review": "Featuring Johnny from the Guilty Gear\u00ae Series", "timestamp_created": 1481918907, "timestamp_updated": 1481918907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28411153": {"recommendationid": "28411153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289753848", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499511150}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc190\uc544\ud504\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1481917922, "timestamp_updated": 1491074033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28408959": {"recommendationid": "28408959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138304623", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507143506}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud55c\uae00\ub9cc \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba74 \uc9c4\uc9dc \ud589\ubcf5\ud560\ud150\ub370\n\n(\uc218\uc815)\n\ud55c\uae00 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc608\uc815\uc774\ub77c\ub290\ub1e8!! \uc57c\ud638\n\n(\uc218\uc815)\n1\uc6d4 25\uc77c \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!! \uc624\uc608 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc990\uac9c\ud558\uc138\uc694~", "timestamp_created": 1481910153, "timestamp_updated": 1485716090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549070", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28407525": {"recommendationid": "28407525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107370008", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 38220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "last_played": 1515262942}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0427\u0442\u043e\u0436, \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0439 \u044f \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0446\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c :) \u0412 \u043c\u043e\u0451\u043c \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0447\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435 2\u0434 \u0444\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0441 \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 GGX \u0432 2001.

I was a bit worried about REVELATOR before the purchase. The English dub was a treat to see in SIGN for me, and it sucked to hear it was going to be out. I wouldn't have minded as much if it wasn't put into the series, and then taken out. I was excited at the prospect of hearing a few of these characters in English, some of which we got a taste of in the previous story mode. I can only hope one day the devs re-consider. Even as DLC I'd love to have it again. Not a big deal for most potential buyers, I know, it's the gameplay that matters, but for me it was personally a nice touch. Also, the price for the Steam version, even with a discount for owning SIGN was still way higher than I expected. By now I'm sure it's easy to find inexpensive on PS4, however, I don't own one of those. Despite these issues, I felt it'd be good to show support.\n\nI've only dipped my feet in and did the episode for Johnny, but I can tell that it's what I generally wanted. It's Xrd, only bigger and better. The tutorials are improved, and it feels like this will be much easier to immerse myself in and try to fight it out online after some practice. Also, one wonderful surprise is the unlockable music. WAY more classics from previous Guilty Gear games than I expected, even Fatal Duel from GGX which I hoped so hard to see in Xrd.\n\nIf you're hesistant on the price, and have played any form of Xrd, if you're not a big fan, you may want to wait for a sale, but for me I know I'm going to get my moneys worth here.", "timestamp_created": 1481883415, "timestamp_updated": 1481883561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28402041": {"recommendationid": "28402041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009095169", "num_games_owned": 973, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 2467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510402793}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e70\u52a8\u753b\u9001\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n+\u56e0\u5267\u900f\u88ab\u5220\u9664\n+\u8bf7\u53c2\u8003\u5176\u4ed6\u597d\u8bc4\n\n-\uff08\u548c\u524d\u4f5c\u76f8\u6bd4\uff09\u5e76\u4e0d\u89c9\u5f97REVELATOR\u6709\u592a\u591a\u5438\u5f15\u70b9\n-REVELATOR2\u51c6\u5907\n-\u4e0d\u5efa\u8bae\u539f\u4ef7\u5165", "timestamp_created": 1481882548, "timestamp_updated": 1486393262, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28401659": {"recommendationid": "28401659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029942443", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 581, "last_played": 1515973809}, "language": "english", "review": "really good port. this game is crazy!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1481880380, "timestamp_updated": 1481880380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479628", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28400961": {"recommendationid": "28400961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018041032", "num_games_owned": 729, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 26794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1612, "last_played": 1516222024}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a simple man.\nI work hard, I play hard.\nBut when it comes to fighting games, I choose Guilty Gear.\n\nARU~", "timestamp_created": 1481875590, "timestamp_updated": 1481875590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581175", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28400538": {"recommendationid": "28400538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066609390", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500577007}, "language": "english", "review": "Warning: This game is really hard...and also extremely fun.\n\nI'm brand new to the guilty gear franchise but I'm definitely having fun with the newest release of the franchise. I can't say how it compares to the previous iterations but I can say that its definitely well made and well optimized. The load screens in this game are practically non-existent and matchmaking is a breeze. The community is fairly niche from what I can tell so I don't expect it to blow up like street fighter but its much easier to play with friends in comparison to other fighting games.\n\nMy favorite part of the game so far has been the online lobby system. The game features lobbies called \"player rooms\" where you can have up to 8 people join in and play on virtual guilty gear machines. You get to walk around and customize your little avatar and talk to each other while queuing for the machines. I know it sounds silly but it's actually amazing. Most fighting games require you to have a 3rd party application for organizing games with your friends but here you can just hang out in the same lobby and all take turns at your discretion. Its a fantastic feature that makes social interactions between players very easy which is great for a niche fighting game such as this.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, I gotta say, It's really hard. I'm not an expert at fighting games by any means, but I'm having a bit of trouble understanding all the mechanics at hand here. If you're interested in picking this game up, be warned that it has a bit of a learning curve.

This one instance was the only time I've ever seen the Guilty Gear series drop in quality.\n\nLater, GGXX reached its apex build with Accent Core.  Our once recolored Robo-Ky was now his own character with unique animations and even his own overhead system.  Ever since the first Robo-Ky there was never a shoto-clone cop-out.\n\nSure there were some experiments in the GG universe, like Ituska and Guilty Gear 2.  While weird they were still pretty fun.\n\nHowever, the core Guilty Gear fighting game dropped off the face of the world.  Blazblue sudden sprung up as a \"spiritual successor.\"\n\nWhile good, Blazblue was not guilty gear.  There were no gunflames, there were no volcanic vipers, there were no clunch instant kills.\n\nThen one day, the first trailer for XRD: sign comes up.\n\nAlmost like fighting game jesus, Guilty Gear returned to us with the classic Sol vs. Ky rivalry.  Then a miracle happened.  What we thought was a 2d fighter suddenly changed camera angles and blew our minds.\n\nHere we are, the second installment of GG:XRD - the game that opened the PC to fighters and allowed us to downsample it to over 5k resolution to look like a playable Miyazaki movie that rotates in 3-D (yes you can still downsample the crap out of this version by editing the ini files)\n\nWhile some people might complain about the price, the quality, time, and effort put into the 6 new characters and all of the balacing is worth every penny.\n\nYou can see the effort put in, the painstaking quality of making sure that everything looks good and lines up.  While other fighters might have cheaped out, the GG series has always stood at the apex of quality.\n\nI mean look at the tutorial and all the effort put in to support newcomers, its amazing compared to say SF V, which launched with barely any features.\n\nI don't think team RED will ever drop the ball with GG.  This series deserves to be supported because it is loved by its creator and every iteration is pushed out with an outpour of hardwork and painstaking effort to ensure that it's as perfect as they can get it.  You can feel that just by playing and watching it.\n\nSo for the review, it's a Guilty Gear fighting game, of course its going to be good.  It's going to be better than good.\n\nIf you are even a minor fan of fighting games, Guilty Gear is the prime experience.  It blows the street fighter games out of the water and at some point in time, deservers to completely overtake SF as the primary fighting exprience and Esport leader for the genre.\n\nUnlike SF, there is never a point in time where all is lost.  You can always turn around a match, with any character, under the worst conditions.  There are more clutch reversals in guilty gear than any other fighter due to how well the systems are designed.\n\nIf anything, even if you don't play fighters.  The game is worth having just to push into 5k resolution and drool at the polygons that emulate hand drawn art so well you can't tell the difference.", "timestamp_created": 1481871734,

same as what you get on the console versions few months back.  Everything checks out. Even added the figurine mode where you can set up a little table of figurines of the characters, changing poses and all matter of things about them.\n\nThis version currently doesn't have the large lobbies but you can still get into multiplayer rooms, those are still there from what I read on the forums.\n\nThe minimum to run this game is a bit off, though. I could run SIGN with a Radeon HD 6900 series and can run this game as well with it without any problems. Even the anime and cutscenes work without a hitch.

I've been told that Guilty Gear games have a great tutorial that makes everything pale in comparison.\n\nThey weren't joking.\n\nYes, I'm aware that this review for now is going to be me gushing over the tutorial mode, but I wasn't expecting to be that basic and engaging at the same time. For example, you navigate from the left side of the screen to the right as you dodge traps on the ground and floating flames. To learn combos you get monsters that have comic-book style clouds that have a letter inside that corresponds to the button you need to press next (Punch - Kick - Slash - Heavy Slash - Dust). And that's just scratching the surface, because I haven't even read the in-game FAQ to pick a character (the FAQ suggests Sol or Ky if you're new to the game so I'll go with one of them).\n\nCan't believe that I've spent an hour learning the basics of the game in an effective and fun way.\n\nI will be updating my review the more I dive into this game, but rest assured that it's a great fighting game to get into fighting games. My only fear is that Steam's online matchmaking will feel deserted in a week or two, because the game doesn't have cross-platform matchmaking. I hope that finding people through communities and chatrooms (Reddit, Discord) to practice with will suffice.\n\n(And if you're new and from EU feel free to add me).", "timestamp_created": 1481755716,

I absolutely loved the scene but barely played the game because I had never played a fighting game before. I have been playing now for about two years leading into the release of SFV. I expected and hoped for a decent game release and maybe some nice suprises with good content or menus or gameflow or something. It had none of these and continues to have none of these up to the release of season 2.\n\nI bought this game on steam release and I have been on it for 2 hours. So far it has made me question the legitimacy of Capcom(SFV's creator) even being a company. If you have made it this far, I apologize for ranting about a different game, but I think it is important perspective for others looking for perspectives and information.\n\nI will now list all of the things I have seen in 2 hours that have been ridiculously impressive(a lot of this stuff I am basically comparing to SFV).\n1. The menus: extremely concise and impressive layout and organization along with intuitive design.\n2. The flow of menus: going from menu to menu and into games is really fast and smooth.\n3. The characters: very interesting cast with unique designs; this is actually very very impressive and is basically the core of the game.\n4. The TUTORIALS and other single player modes:  THIS IS SO GOOD, WHOEVER MADE THIS STUFF deserves a medal.\n5. LOBBIES: oh my god I actually can't beleive how good this is... the amount of community and growth that can happen in just these lobbies with free chat, controllable little avatars, and cute emotes along with being able to kick a soccer ball around; this is all just so FUN. I never imagined I would say this but... the lobbies are FUN.\n6. Okay I kind of give up maybe I'll come back and finish this later but I can't find one thing SFV even has CLOSE to this game in terms of depth or design...\n\nAt this point I am going to give this game a chance just from the sheer impressive work that has been put into this game.

\n\nGGxRD - Revelator can be seen as a *very important* upgrade of Sign providing a more \"balanced\" meta. \nBut, for me, this is the best fighting game since a while, despite that some players can be reluctant to the \"gatling\" combo style.\n\nFor people wondering its accessibility, GGxRD-R is still loyal to its creed: \"Easy to play, hard to master\". \nYou'll only need a couple of hours to understand and enjoy nearly all the game mechanisms! But the deeper you wanna go, the more time consuming the game becomes. Try it yourself, you will see the overall quality and depth! And now with 23 playable characters with *unique* gameplay, the roster is more than decent. \n\nRegarding online mode, there are really good players on GG licence, and thus, it is hard to come as a \"newbie\". BUT, take a tour to the lab, learn some matchup, and you'll made a lot of progress in few time :)\n\n\nMoreover, the training section bears a special mention. It is just amazing how Arc System revisited the classical training (when fighting games deign to implement one...) to bring a lot of fun and interactivity in it. So far the best training that I've encountered.\n\nPlus the story, the 3D cell-animation anime like, the musics, the diversity of gameplays...

I own this game for PS4, both hard copy and digital, I love the game. I highly recommend it to everyone who hasn't got a PS4 copy of the game.\n\nGetting into Guilty Gear is very, very hard as there are extremely good players out there who's ready to kick your ass 24/7. :D But hit the lab and you'll be seeing improvements, for sure.\n\nThis game has so much great content and is executed really well. You can't go wrong with Guilty Gear, ofc. if you like \"air dashing\", cause that's in here. It's a very combo heavy and fast game and it's done really well and very stylish. You'll get your moneys worth, no doubt.\n\nNow to the negatives, as I own the game already on PS4, I know how it looks on there, I know it has 1080p as max resolution. One of the things that sells a game to me on PC, is the option for higher resolutions, especially a belated release. I have a gfx card that can run this on at least 1440p@60. The game doesn't support an internal render resolution higher than 1080p.\n\nWhat you get in this release is:\nThe option for PS4 resolution, max.\n4 sliders in your graphics settings for some post processing.\n\nThat's it.

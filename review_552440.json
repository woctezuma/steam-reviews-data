A game that actually does smooth turns properly. BRAVO!\n\nSorry, you can read the other in depth reviews, I'm still enjoying this game right now and am not prepared to write a full review. I just wanted to let everyone know this game nails its smooth/incremental turning option. All this means is... when using the touchpad/stick to rotate the perspective, the camera's yaw axis rotates around the HMD's  position (that is, your ACTUAL position) & not the center of the playspace. So, it behaves like every game you've ever played before, which is good... because there are a TON of games that hurl you in circles around the center of your play area & cause motion sickness because they DON'T do smooth turns the way The Talos Principle DOES. So, even though I haven't played it all the way through, I'm still thrilled they did this one. little. thing.\n\nGood job! \n\nIf you could go ahead fill in the rest of the VR development community as to how exactly you're managing to get around the issue preventing everone from doing this... THAT WOULD BE GREAT! I mean, if it's simply a matter of \"we're not using Unreal Engine\"... maybe help make sure Unreal gets the dang memo.\n\nThanks fam \u270c", "timestamp_created": 1515431695, "timestamp_updated":

When I first discovered Talos Principle VR, I purchased it instantly.  Having played and loved the original, I was excited to re-visit the game and experience it from a new perspective.  As It turns out, this is hands down my favorite game of 2017 and one of my most enjoyable VR experiences to date.  Croateam just nailed it.  I have the upmost respect for them.  Some big name devs, I won\u2019t mention names (Bethesda) are making cash grabs-porting out half assed renditions of their popular IPs, knowing good & well that they\u2019ll hit target sales through name recognition alone. Not  Croateam.  Talos Principle VR is the result of what happens when devs actually care about creating the best experience for gamers- and one that clearly understands what makes VR great. It is the best example of a VR port I\u2019ve ever played- so much so that it is actually an improvement to its flat predecessor.  I can not recommend this game enough.  If you like 1st person puzzle games like Portal, chances are you will enjoy this as well.  The story is interesting and has a serious tone- one that will have you reflecting about what it means to be alive- similar to West world.  VR mechanics are implemented in a thoughtful and elegant way so as to enhance the game and improve immersion without getting in the way of the core game.  The amount of control you are given over the settings options should be standard practice for ALL VR games. It is so refreshing and nice to be given the freedom to tailor everything from locomotion and color saturation to resolution and other performance tweaks.  Lastly, the amount of content you get- it took me 33 hours for both endings- and I didn\u2019t even get all the bonus stars -not to mention finish \u2018The Road to Gehenna\u2019 is especially generous for a VR game.  Thank you Croateam for actually caring about gamers and I really hope this game does well for you.", "timestamp_created": 1515220459, "timestamp_updated": 1515221698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39081386": {"recommendationid": "39081386", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970833892", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515196131}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!   \nI spent a long time considering a purchase, due to  wondering if a puzzle game could live up to the hype.

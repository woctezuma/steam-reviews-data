I'm somewhat disappointed that this may be the last game the dev makes, as it was a fantastic game, much akin to Zachtronics' games. Dev, if you make another game as good as this one, I'll buy it for sure!\n\nIn terms of an actual review, the gameplay is phenomenal. It's quite difficult in parts, so patience and ingenuinty is definitely required, but I only found a few of the puzzles so confusing that I had to look up solutions. There's a good wealth of solutions and hints to certain puzzles as well, useful for confirming that your thought process is correct. The graphics are nice and slick, but it would be nice if the blackboard screen could \"blow up\" to a nicer resolution. The music can get a bit repetitive, but it's subtle enough that it doesn't intrude into your thinking.

The game strikes a good balance between being a feast of recognition for those familiar with computer logic while at the same time properly explaining every concept to the player (without being condescending) and introducing everything at a pleasant pace. This allows you to always focus on the puzzle at hand, without feeling overwhelmed by the new tools you've just been handed.\n\nThere are multiple solutions to many of the puzzles and an option to try to achieve a perfect score if you're so inclined. Scores are measured in the number of modules used and in later puzzles also in the time taken to generate the desired output. Sometimes there's a fast solution with few modules, other times however you will need different solutions to achieve fewest modules and best performance separately.\n\nThe only downside is the background music, it's simplistic and on a very short loop, so it gets monotonous almost instantly. Honestly though that is the only flaw I could find with this game.\n\nThe graphics look polished and have a nice retro feel to them. And because it's 'just' a puzzle game, it will run on pretty much any system. I've even tried it on a 10 year old laptop with a 2.0 GHz Core2Duo, 4 GB RAM and GeForce 8600M GT and the game ran just fine.\n\nAfter having played the demo I bought the game during the Halloween sale for \u20ac 13,49 (full price at that time was \u20ac 14,99).

If I were to describe it, I'd say it's more a series of puzzles, tied together by a loose narrative. The puzzles are based on the workings of computer / electronic hardware. If you're interested in computers from that perspective, of course the game will be of value to you.\n\nThe puzzles start out easy (\"Here's how to connect components!\") but then quickly ramp up in difficulty. For me, this has really been a \"Stare at the problem for a while, leave it alone for a day or two, come back and make some progress, leave it alone again for a day or two\" sort of process. It's a nice to have these little puzzles sitting in the back of your mind, something to ponder on the bus ride or on a coffee break. Then, when you finally solve the problem you get that \"Ah ha!\" moment that's so tremendously enjoyable.\n\nNote that you don't have to be a computer genius to enjoy Silicon Zeroes. I've never taken a computer course in my life, and I come from a non-science profession. For me, this game is really a set of logic problems, with the added dimension of time (clicks). Some of the reviews suggest the game helps explain how computer hardware works - if so, fantastic! But rest assured, you can easily approach these problems with a bit of plain old critical thinking and wit.\n\nProbably not for impatient audiences. This is not a game of instant gratification.

So sit straight, don't relax, and silently fume about how you (yet again) fell short of the clock cycle constraint.\n\n\n\n(About the play time: I have completed past the first ending and started on the next chapter focused on parallelism, but boy is it whipping me hard. Reminds me why I didn't major in electrical engineering. ^_^;; \nAlso out of impatience, I piped the game's executable through the strings unix utility and read the rest of the plot in plain text. Consider it \"research\" for the plot discussion in this review. @_@;;)\n\n\nTo add some context to the top rated reviews, it may be helpful to start with the potential turnoffs:\n\nThe game is not about building a CPU from low level components, such as NAND gates. Your parts list starts off at a very high level of abstraction (addition is already solved for you), and you don't need to worry about binary math. To its credit, this game covers entirely different ground from the typical NAND2Tetris recommendation.\n\nI'm cool with the intentions of the author, but the story is easily the weirdest part of the game. I'm just not sure how much of my consternation was from being already familiar with the real history of Silicon Valley, even though there are some creative, playful ideas in how some underrepresented demographics were represented in the characters (minority fab workers, female programmers, etc). But when contrasted to the actual history, the progressive feel-good story of a bunch of underdogs enduring against all odds was ironically and unintentionally sad. The extra history commentary after you beat the first ending helps explain the author's creative choices, but boy was it kind of wierd working for an alt-history, non-eugenicist, nice version of William Shockley without that narrative context.\n\n\n\nThe common invocation of Zach-likes is warranted, but I think it falls short for 2 reasons:\n\n(1) Zachtronics games in my mind are very tolerant of silly and unexpected solutions, while Silicon Zeroes holds you to very strict contraints where the suboptimal solutions are not tolerated. SZ is very puzzlely, and the hand of the designer is felt very heavily for better and worse. For better, the progression of challenges work to test you on insights that you'll need in later levels.  For worse, oh come on, why can't I use parts I know the company has and had let me play with minutes ago???\n\n(2) I find the writing in Zachtronics games to be witty and funny, and an incentive to keep pushing through. SZ's plot didn't quite resonate with me in that way. It think part of it is that Zach-like characters, say in Shenzhen I/O or Infinifactory, get the freedom to be cynical, optimistic, fearful, all-business, gross, cosmopolitan, culturally-ignorant, etc, while the majority of characters in SZ seem like... uh, very positive and politically-correct ideals of their respective minority archtypes? To put in another way, there are \"good\" guys in Shenzhen I/O or Infinifactory or Spacechem who may actually be disagreeable to certain players, while it's pretty obnoxiously clear at each step who you should be rooting for/against in Silicon Zeroes.\n\n\nWith all that said, I highly recommend Silicon Zeroes for its treatment of the topics involving high-speed and parallelized hardware design. The puzzle-like design of the levels is often annoying, but there are many flashing moments of satori when you find that kernel of understanding the designer had in mind. It's actually kind of clever how you rediscover challenges such as pipelining, caching, and data/control hazards, without some long lecture on those same issues. If you somehow find yourself trying to understand the design tradeoffs inherent in computer organization and design,  SZ is a great active learning introduction to the topic.", "timestamp_created": 1508106359, "timestamp_updated": 1508111401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608658", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35644828": {"recommendationid": "35644828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047267591", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507749399}, "language": "english", "review": "Take a Zachtronics game, remove all the fun elements, and add in tons of annoying sexist dialog -- Silicon Zeroes.", "timestamp_created": 1507748619, "timestamp_updated": 1507748619, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.302745", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35610585": {"recommendationid": "35610585", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996377406", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "last_played": 1515470444}, "language": "english", "review": "Game about designing basic CPUs from basic components such as adders, (de)multiplexers, latches...

[mild spoilers?]\n\n...And I've already finished the main storyline. Don't get me wrong, some of the challenge puzzles like Multiply, and the bonus chapter at the end, seem pretty fun and challenging, but I bought the game at midnight and half-idly managed to just finish it off now at 2:30 AM. Granted, I do play a LOT of these types of games and some of the puzzles just naturally clicked with me, but the \"main\" part seemed a tad short.\n\nThe game itself was pretty fun, don't get me wrong! I loved the design and gameplay (Really Shenzhen I/O-esque), and I only really didn't know what I was doing during the start (The input selector was just thrown at you with little to no explanation... and I had no idea what to do at that point. I pretty much guessed my way through it). After that though, the game was a breeze and was an absolute delight to play. I had to get rid of some of my old habits - not being able to connect outputs \"together\" in a T junction was AWFUL, and having some of the modules locked was understandable but a bit... iffy.\n\nOne thing I really didn't like was how it seemed that a lot of the \"levels\" were tutorials (perfectly fine, nothing wrong with getting people to learn by doing things), or repeats of earlier puzzles with a small amount tacked on (Basic CPU -> Arith CPU, Fast Two -> Delay CPU). This can be done brilliantly where there's a tiny little alteration which makes the whole level different - the first 2 levels of the bonus chapter have really grabbed me because of that! However, a lot of the levels seemed... redundant? I liked the little ones that make you think outside of the box or taught you useful facts like FastCount and Dragging, but besides that, it just felt like a lot of the levels were filler.\n\nThe story was neat - it wasn't in-depth enough that it detracted from the gameplay, but it got a laugh or two out of me, and the main story ending was pretty nice! A tad predictable but it was still a nice relief. However, beating the game did leave me with a \"Was that it?!\" feeling; just overstepping the 2 hour Steam refund mark was a bad feeling. Fortunately, the bonus chapter gave me a bit of relief that I'd not just paid \u00a310 for a 2 hour long game.\n\nOverall, this has been a pretty fun and solid game that I'm hopefully going to be enjoying for a while!", "timestamp_created": 1506478122, "timestamp_updated": 1506478122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35230082": {"recommendationid": "35230082", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970800364", "num_games_owned": 765, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506539664}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Zachtronics games, go ahead and buy Silicon Zeroes!\n\nIf you don't then check out the demo, and see if it's interesting to you.

This and a good introduction makes the game very approachable even if you have no clue about computers. The editor works rather nicely and the great sound effects make working in it quiet enjoyable. I have seen far worse visual editors.\n\nWhile the game guides you very well through the beginning, it can become quite complex later on, I fell. The game's theme is to build a CPU, which is accomplished only in the story however. The puzzles contain a lot of concepts used in actual CPU development, however there is never the moment, where you put all the parts together and some parts to building a CPU are missing completely from the game. This is what I mean, when I say \"complex\", because a proper CPU would probably overload the game's interface. If you want to learn about actually building CPUs instead, check out the game MHRD (I am the developer - shameless selfplug) or the NAND2Tetris course. This doesn't make the game any worse as puzzle game however!\n\nDifficulty wise I found the game to be entertaining and just the right amount of challenging. I assume the additional content has some puzzle to grind your teeth on, if that is more your kind of soup. Missions are rated for difficulty (1 to 4? stars), while none of the main missions is highter than 3 stars. Every puzzle ends in an overview of how many components/ticks an ideal solution would have, so there is additional replayability if you didn't solve a puzzle optimaly.\n\nI completed the mainstory in ~3.5 hours and I estimate, that there is at least the same amount of time to be spent on extra content. There is a story surrounding the main game (the puzzles) and giving it a context, however than expect it to be anything awardwinning. Similary I found the background music to be more acceptable, than outstanding, however I really liked the sound effects used in the editor.\n\nTechnically there is not much to talk about. The game ran mostly stable without any quirks on my 8 year old laptop with integrated graphics. Only the borderless window mode seemed useless to me, as it is not a borderless fullscreen, but just a window without topbar (but still a frame). As the game is very new still, I am sure the developer will fix this eventually.\n\nAll in all everyone, who likes a good puzzle game, can check out this game, even if you have no interest in computers whatsover (or dislike Zachlike games in general...

Having just completed story, I hesitate to compare it, obviously, to Shenzen-IO. While it follows the same idea to laying out and interconnecting components to process various inputs into outputs it is a most different take on the idea. With Shenzen, the meat of it was in programming the components with psuedo-assembly; in Silicon Zeroes, theres is no programming, just setting parameters of different chips. Think of it as the one-level-lower: you are making the CPUs that Shenzen would then program. Making registers, reading and writing from memory, etc.\nI would say its a simpler game than Shenzen but it still has few challenges to present. If you enjoyed Shenzen, then this is very much worth checking out.\n\nA small downside in the mechanics I think is [spoiler]the delay mechanic, its introduced part of the way through the story, then you are stuck tweaking the delay for a couple of levels and then the delay start to autotweak itself. I feel like it doesn't add much more complexity of any given level, except as a hard cap on how ineffiecent the design can be before its considered invalid[/spoiler].

How this one differs is that instead of writing a program in assembler, you are building a machine that will execute assembler. So you are given a program, and a set of test data, and you have to wire together components (adders, registers, selectors, readers, writers, ...) so that the program will run and generate the goal state of the test data. \n\nThe puzzles start slow as they introduce you to each component, but quickly move on to be much more challenging. And just when you've built your first general purpose CPU and think you've got the hang of things, a whole new timing concept is introduced for the next set of levels providing all new challenges.\n\nThe drag-drop and plugging together mechanics for building machines is very satisfying. And there's a lot more levels than I originally thought, including a whole set that opens up after you complete the main story.

As an example, register forwarding is an obvious concept for us engineers who've taken an entry-level computer architecture class, but I think most people would have trouble with it. A one or two line \"note\" from Dana for each of the more complex puzzles could help a lot.\n- The story. Every male character is an offensive stereotype: you've got the A-type sexual-assault-waiting-to-happen, the effeminate-and-ineffectual beta and the eccentric space cadet. It's really heavy handed and obnoxious. How is this better than every female character being a damsel in distress?\n\nNeutral:\n* I wish the wire colors had been picked a little more carefully. It would also be great if the wires were spaced out a little more instead of all following the same paths.\n\nOverall:\nIt's an enjoyable puzzle game, though some of the later puzzles dip into the aforementioned why-am-I-wearing-boxing-gloves territory with artificial part constraints.

My bigest complaint of this game is the same complaint I have with most puzzle games, The puzzles are stupid easy then you hit one that blocks your progress because you can't figure it out. This is compounded by the fact that there are no hints (There is a small snipet that you get to help you understand the problem, or things to try but no examples) and no guides / wiki / help doc exists to ease this issue. I think this could be solved by offering a partial solution through the palette system somehow.

But I decided to give this game a try since it looked kinda fun and had a free demo for me to try out. So I gave the demo a go and found it was actually pretty alright once I understood how each module worked. It's all a matter of figuring out how to organize them to satisfy the objective. Demo hooked me so I bought the game and now I'm slowly making my way through each puzzle, some being harder than others and once in a while the game will introduce new modules. I kinda had to play with some of the modules to figure out how they worked, but once you get it you'll be good to go.  It's also nice how most of the time you have a choice between which puzzle you want to tackle first in case you want to take a break from one and try another. There may be some puzzles you'll have to sit through thinking out how to solve for a while (currently I'm stuck on this one normal puzzle that I can't figure out for the life of me for some reason), but once you finally figure it out it feels so satisfying and you actually learn through the process which will help you solve even harder puzzles.

You can shoot only one bullet at a time, and while it does clear enemy fire as well as damage them, relying only on that is going to get you killed fast. Instead, you can shoot the colored shapes that appear throughout the level at a steady pace and try to make them bounce against each other: the block will soon explode and destroy anything in its area of effect. Each time the block you shot bumps into another one of the same shape and color, it will cause the second one to explode too, as well as increasing the power and radius of the blast.\nThat means that rather than squeezing through minuscule openings, you're encouraged to make use of the puzzle-like system to find the perfect moment and angle to hit the blocks and stop the bullets before they even reach you at all. This easy to understand core mechanic remains unchanged for the whole game, but never gets boring as you start to master it and find new ways to save yourself from a difficult spot. The two characters play similarly, with their normal shot being the biggest change: Kairi shoots a bullet that travels to the end of the screen and back, while Satsuki has a short range shot with much higer knockback and creates bigger explosions.\n\nAnother important difference from other shmups is that this one doesn't have extra lives or power-ups. Instead, you have a health bar, that can be occasionally replenished by picking up health items, and there is [b] no mercy invincibility[/b] at all, so you can't just let yourself hit it to pass a pattern. You do however have the traditional smart bombs for emergency situations.\n\nBosses work like Touhou, with the added bonus that some of their attacks are optional and come in the forms of \"duels\": if you play well enough, the boss coughs up a little red blob, and picking it up initiates an additional pattern. These create \ngreat opportunities for high-scorers, while beginners can easily ignore them with no repercussion.\n\nThe game has 5 main stages, which do get progressively more challenging but are easier than what you'd find in most \"pure\" STGs, and an extra 6th stage which ramps the difficulty up to eleven. If you're going for completion, be ready to have your patience tested. There is also a survival mode where you can try to endure the enemy assault for as long as you can, and a absurdly difficult \"hard mode\", that is thankfull not required for anything.\nBeating the game should take from 2 to 6 hours depending on your skill level and dedication, while clearing it 100% will extend the longevity quite a bit (took me more than 20 hours to manage everything, just to give you an idea, although to be fair I'm not a master player).\n\nInterestingly, despite being a shoot-em-up, a visible amount of care went into the backstory, which you can unlock little by little by collecting the achievements. It's not the main focus of the game, but it's nice to have a sembiance of plot that is not just a complete excuse to shoot things down, and it's a nice rewards for those willing to go the extra mile.\n\nAs for the technical side: enemy mobs are pretty much all variations of the same design, sadly, but the character and bosses' portraits are much more detailed and good-looking. The soundtrack is also easy on the ears and goes perfectly with the flow of the game, especially during the later levels.\nI didn't encounter any notable bug, and can confirm PS3 and PS4 controllers both work fine.\n\n[b]Summary[/b]:\n+ Unique gameplay concept\n+ Interesting lore and backstory\n+ Good OST\n+/-  Challenging.\n-  Slightly lazy mobs design and behaviour. Visual effects could also be a bit better.\n-  Relatively short if you don't care about completion.\nA breath of fresh air in the genre, and a completely unique shoot 'em up that any fan of the genre should be able to enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1514302092, "timestamp_updated": 1514302092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38647612": {"recommendationid": "38647612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169757717", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1515841348}, "language": "english", "review": "The game isn't as difficult as most danmaku games but the puzzle aspect in the mix makes the game feel so fun and rewarding.

The mechanic for clearing bullets off of the screen is simple - you shoot one of the colored blocks and it explodes, clearing bullets. If the colored block hits a similarly colored block, then the explosion is larger, in proportion to how many blocks you hit.\n\nUsually, there's two different colors. The fact that you can choose which colored block to hit opens up a lot of very good mixed strategies for the veteran, which makes the game mechanic significantly more fun than it would be with just one color. There's harder stages with three colors, which has the effect of making things easier if you are very good, and harder if you are not.\n\nThe artistic style is incredibly good. First, the bullet patterns are fresh. Most bullet patterns in most games have the effect of pushing the cautious player down, but the cautious player in this game will sometimes feel himself pushed upwards, which is interesting. You really feel like you're using the entire screen to play very often, which is really good. Second, the art itself, though unpolished a little, is quite beautiful. Last, however, the music is absurdly good - \"bringing you to tears and making you serously consider buying the OST\" good. Perhaps the first thing I thought with respect to the style was that this is the game most US indie gamers wish they could make - a game that is undeniably a piece of art, but without any of the pretentiousness that typically burdens such games.\n\nI must admit that I take issue with three things: first, the second stage is notably harder than most of the rest of the game. This feels incredibly unbalanced. For someone who is good, this will not matter much, but it is not a good thing. I can imagine this being a significant hurdle for someone new. I would have put that particular opening sequence in a later stage, but the burstiness of it definitely fits the character of the second boss.\n\nSecond (spoiler), there does not appear to be indication in-game that you should not destroy the last stage midbosses in order to get the good ending. This is very counterintutive.\n\nThird, there is not a middle difficulty. The unprotected mode feels like \"Hard\" or \"Extra Hard\" mode, while the protected mode feels like \"Easy\" mode.\n\nThe third flaw makes me hesitant to categorically recommend this game - I thus conditionally recommend it. If you're starting out and trying to branch out, the protected mode of this game is a good way to do this. If you're mildly skilled (using Touhou as a yardstick, 1cc'ing most Touhou games on normal being no challenge, but 1cc'ing most Touhou games on hard being a bit beyond you) and you want a sort of challenge, the unprotected mode of this game is definitely a way to go. If you're very skilled, then perhaps spending 8 or so hours admiring the art and bullet patterns is worthwhile.\n\nThe only group of people I must say who should avoid this game are people who have a low, but not very low, level of skill.

At first it may seem the puzzle element overshadows the shooting game but that's only when the game is teaching you the mechanics in the beginning. Later on it gets demanding and expects you to master both strategic shooting and bullet dodging.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game is sort of a block puzzle. By shooting colored blocks on the backround layer you can push them around. Knock blocks of the same colour into eachother and they explode dealing damage to enemies and bullets. Larger chains deal more damage. If you cancel bullets this way on bosses they take damage. This may sound confusing but the game really shows you through it and in the end the core mechanic is quite simple. The challenge to the player is figuring out how to deal with various situations on the fly. Often times you'll find yourself thinking out when to shoot and figure out a plan while managing your way through bullet curtains. Murasaki encourages you to be smart about your shooting sort of like Ikaruga or old school 80's shmups.\n\nA bullet health system is the other half of the puzzle mechanic. A bullets color matches its health and they are damaged by block explosions or the players shot. It's implemented quite well and makes you choose between shots or the size of block chains to go for. The default character is far better at cancelling bullets (ie. defense) while the other can land bigger attacks off the puzzle blocks. The latter also has to be careful going to the top of its screen as she has little range to shoot downwards. However dont expect to be able to always rely on bullet cancels, on higher health patterns this wont work. Often to get larger block chains for tricky sections you will end up not shooting for extended periods and having to dodge much more.\n\nMurasaki's soundtrack is really amazing, top notch and there's a lot of competition in this genre. The chill music on stages goes well with the puzzle element and boss themes match their intensity. A fair bit of music syncing, especially with the true route of stage 5. Even if you're not a fan of the gameplay itself the music might surprise you.\n\nAfter getting the ending you unlock the 6th extra stage which is far more challenging than anything preceding it. The boss of this stage truly demands some dodging skills and figuring out the tricks of its patterns. If you're not a shmup veteran this stage will likely be a wall, but smart play is still always rewarded so it can be enjoyable to learn shmups in this way.\n\nThe game includes a hard mode for the first 5 stages which makes their difficulty curve match more with the extra stage. The bosses get significantly harder and you need to approach some stage sections more as a puzzle. Stage 6 on normal is still tougher than anything in hard mode. There's also an endless stage that really tests your skill in the puzzle element as you cannot memorize and it keeps on getting tougher.\n\nDefinitely one of the best value for money for STG/shmups on Steam unless you have an aversion to bullet cancelling gimmicks. Murasaki implements its idea well and is a joy to play. Should be refreshing to anyone who thinks shmups are out of innovative ideas. It's worth noting this was first released as a free game, and for that it is quite amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1491661128, "timestamp_updated": 1491661550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736533", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30960904": {"recommendationid": "30960904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046268101", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511585685}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u4e00\u898b\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306a\u304c\u3089\u81ea\u6a5f\u306e\u5f3e\u306f\u5358\u767a\u3002\u5b9f\u969b\u306f\u6575\u306e\u5f3e\u5e55\u3092\u907f\u3051\u306a\u304c\u3089\u7206\u5f3e\u3067\u30d3\u30ea\u30e4\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u3059\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002\nBGM\u304c\u3068\u3066\u3082\u72ec\u7279\u3067\u826f\u3044\u3002\u305f\u3060\u52b9\u679c\u97f3\u3084\u30e1\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u306a\u3069\u306f\u5c11\u3057\u5bc2\u3057\u3044\u3002\n\u30dc\u30b9\u6226\u306b\u7279\u6b8a\u6761\u4ef6\u304c\u4ed8\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u591a\u3044\u304c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5185\u3067\u306f\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u89e3\u8aac\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002\u30dc\u30b9\u6226\u304c\u7570\u5e38\u306b\u77ed\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u3089\u8272\u3005\u8a66\u3059\u304b\u30b0\u30b0\u308d\u3046\u3002\n\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7248\u3068\u5185\u5bb9\u306f\u5909\u308f\u3089\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u308b\u5834\u5408\u306fSteam\u3067\u8cfc\u5165\u3059\u308b\u610f\u5473\u306f\u3042\u307e\u308a\u306a\u3044\u3002\u30bb\u30fc\u30eb\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u30b5\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u3092\u8cb7\u3046\u3068\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u3082\u308c\u306a\u304f\u4ed8\u3044\u3066\u304f\u308b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1491398957, "timestamp_updated": 1511585774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687843", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 53, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 55}}

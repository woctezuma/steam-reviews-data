6198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 161, "last_played": 1514347102}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll admit, despite my amount of playtime with this game, I didn't think much of it. I would just play it because I thought I either had nothing better to do or just wanted something to do while watching or listening to something else. But after all of my playtime, I eventually realized why I kept coming back to this particular game and why it's one of my most-played games on Steam. That reason: It's legitimately one of the best third-person shooters out there.\n\nWhich doesn't seem to be the case on the surface, as the environments, though randomized for each playthrough, are mundane and generally constant. That can deceive the average viewer into thinking the gameplay itself is just as mundane as the environment, and it's anything but. Through my time playing in very Early Access to now (still in Early Access, but after many updates), I've witnessed a variety of both major and minor changes, and each update has generally improved the gameplay, and even if more problems are introduced they're typically solved fairly quickly, and some aren't really problems anyway. I've seen even people who otherwise really like the game harp on the most minor, nothing bull crap, and though there were times I've disagreed, it has led to the game only improving as time goes on anyway since the developer does actually listen to players.\n\nTo be exact, it's not just the randomized map layouts and bosses which provide the fun, nor is it the variety of weapons and add-ons you can apply, all of which actually perform vastly different functions and thus provide to each player's tastes (and new items have been added every so often to boot). It's the balance this game has with its leveling system compared to the enemies and rooms you encounter. It's how you encounter so many enemies in a room without feeling overwhelmed by everything at once, and even when you're overwhelmed it feels challenging rather than frustrating or ridiculous. It's the satisfaction you get when you slowly discover more items and what you can do with them along the way, as it's rare you get much of anything at once. There's even a level of strategy with how and what you want to level up and when as often you can only do one thing or the other. Should one buy a health upgrade before the boss, or buy the probe sensor so your probe weapons can fire on it as well? Or at least that's something you can contemplate if you happen to have purchased the map and know where the boss is, which means you can seek out the other rooms available beforehand and find more chances at obtaining items or experience points. Otherwise, you'd have to rely on your instinct and sometimes just pick something to upgrade or purchase before moving to the next room, boss or no boss (but especially for just in case there is a boss), and it's easy enough to do considering you can teleport from anywhere you are to anywhere you've been already.\n\nEssentially, there's a serious polish to this game to the point where a lot of what many players can take for granted nowadays is thoroughly exemplified here. It's not big, it's not extravagant, it's not epic, it doesn't need to be any of those things. Even if other games within this same mold have more customization options or better graphics or even better level degisn or aesthetic touches, they have those merits but they don't have all of the solid fundamentals this game has. A game like Tetris is extremely popular and well-loved by virtue of just being simple and well-made, and that's what this is, and thus shows that sometimes that's all you need. I'm not saying this game should be considered an all-time great game like Tetris, but I still wouldn't have any qualms about saying it's the best isometric third-person roguelike shooter out there, and it's only getting better.", "timestamp_created": 1508920085, "timestamp_updated": 1508920311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36186948": {"recommendationid": "36186948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096587851", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509528845}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9999\u83c7\u84dd\u53d7\n\u9ed1\u5c4f\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u58f0\u97f3\u3002\n\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u663e\u5361 \u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u542f\u7535\u8111\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b89\u88c5\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4f9d\u7136\u9ed1\u5c4f\u3002\n\u6c42\u89e3\u51b3", "timestamp_created": 1509528956, "timestamp_updated": 1509528956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36305154": {"recommendationid": "36305154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009112210", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 84, "last_played": 1514222386}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple but addictive twin stick shooter.

There are about 5 different types of utility slots: main weapon, sub-weapon, drone, boost and enhancement modules. Its a little daunting at first, but if you stick with it the game does a good job of telling you what everything does.\n\nI've been enjoying it a lot, even in its unfinished state and despite a few crashes.

It is solid where it counts (shooting feels impactful and satisfying), but a couple of the weapon sounds are rather annoying to hear all game.  Music could use more variety too.  But on the flip side, it IS a 5 dollar game.\n\nLocalization can be spotty, some of the english is broken and some descriptions seem to be missing.  But noting that will really hurt your gameplay, you'll figure it all out easily.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but it IS a perfect way to kill some time in an enjoyable manner.  \n\nTL;DR: Great

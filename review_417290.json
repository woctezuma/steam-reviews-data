Le plus notable est la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 du framerate, il ne s'envole pas, mais ne tombe pas non plus, il reste constant tout le long, ce qui est vraiment appr\u00e9ciable quand on est vers la limite faible (30/35 FPS)\n\nL'un des autres plus gros plus dans ce jeu, c'est la capacit\u00e9 de notre personnage \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer. \nIl n'est pas frustrant ! Je m'explique : dans d'autres jeux avec un h\u00e9ro super efficace on peux grimper \u00e0 des endroits compl\u00e8tement ahurissants, mais arriv\u00e9s devant de petites corniches ou un mur pas pr\u00e9vu pour, le h\u00e9ro ne peux rien faire alors que juste avant on a gravis une montagne sans difficult\u00e9. Ca c'est frustrant ! \n\nDans Ghost of a tale, notre personnage est limit\u00e9 en capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 grimper, mais cette limite est partout la m\u00eame, donc on connais la limite de celui-ci, mais elle s'applique partout aussi bien ! il est alors possible avec un peu d'ing\u00e9niosit\u00e9 de grimper partout. C'est une vrai lib\u00e9ration pour le gameplay, un d\u00e9placement ultra fluide dans toutes les conditions. \nUne m\u00e9canique toute simple est aussi mise en place pour palier \u00e0 sa petite taille. C'est juste excellent !\n\nPour ce qui est du moins ? Parfois le jeu demande un peu trop d'aller/retour, les rats qui ne sont pas vraiment forts, on les craint plus pour les d\u00e9gats que pour la poursuite, ou d'autres fois, ils ne peuvent physiquement pas nous voir mais savent exactement ou nous sommes.

This shere amount of time I had to invest for the game is pretty impressive, especially for an Early Access Title. The devs, in particular Mr. Seith, did a great job creating the world, the charme and the all round flow for this 7 hours. I felt entertained all the time, the lore of the world is nicely detailed, the NPCs are cunning (I love the pirate frog, he's my favourite) and the graphics are just stunningly beautiful. The only two nitpicks are the missing quest rewards (Why should I do a item collecting for nothing?) and the fact, that I could not open that one door. But these are just little nitpicks, all in all I reallly enjoyed the journey of the little mouse so far, and I am more than curious about what comes next. I recommend everyone to give this title a shot. I really feel like playing Cuphead back in the days at the convention, no one else knew about it, nobody played it there.

On seeing it pop up on Steam\u2019s new releases last year it immediately reminded me of those books and I instantly added it to my wish list. \n\nHaving now played the title it really did recapture the feeling of reading the books as the setting and characters are so similar to how I pictured Redwall and its inhabitants. Praise has to be given to the lone developer for creating a game that looks this gorgeous and for creating a cast of characters with so much personality. The titular hero of this tale is one of the most adorable and endearing video game characters I\u2019ve experienced and he doesn\u2019t even talk.\n\nSpeaking of talking I\u2019d love to see some voice acting in the finished game but I understand that the budget might not allow for it. Audible emotes might be a good compromise as the enemies and npcs are all fairly silent (as a mouse). There also appears to be some problems with the ai which on one occasion made sneaking past a guard impossible and the stealth overall seemed a little unfair. I also ran into another bug which you can see in my video but overall the game ran pretty smoothly without too many hiccups. \n\nThat\u2019s quite some feat for a tiny indie studio especially when the game looks so lovely. I haven\u2019t really talked about the gameplay much but it\u2019s a semi open action adventure game with stealth elements and this is all elevated due to some wonderful attention to detail and creative design work. The story is interesting and there is lots of lore to sink your teeth into. Honestly, it was like discovering Redwall abbey once again. Combine this with Tooth and Tail and you\u2019d probably have the ultimate Redwall video game. \n\nAll that said I\u2019m not going to continue playing the early access version as I don\u2019t want to spoil the full release, which I\u2019m greatly anticipating.", "timestamp_created": 1513446285, "timestamp_updated": 1513657521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602888", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38335204": {"recommendationid": "38335204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294028048", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 57, "last_played": 1514252904}, "language": "english", "review": "The atmospheric feel of this game is what drew me into purchasing, and is definitely one of the main reasons why Ive racked up so many hours in game.

I bought this on Humble Bundle when I saw it was on sale for slightly cheaper than sticker price, so I decided to pick it up.

When walking, sneaking, sprinting, jumping, or falling everthing was extremely smooth as if it has a proper weight to it. The gameplay is fun as a stealth game, it accomplishes the stealth well with several tools/places to hide which can give you the flexibility to play how you want. The quests amount to collectathons, this is fine as you can accomplish these as you move along the main story. This segways into the next point, the story, it's good and is relatively intriguing and makes you concerned for Tilo and his family. My only gripe with the game is probably the lack of voice acting, this is probably an intentional design choice and either way I am fine with or without it as it does not detract from the story or gameplay.

So in hope of adding in a new unique perspective to this game, I shall begin. \n\nLet me simply TL;DR my main points right now:\nAlthough the game, mechanically, isn't very groundbreaking or really even interesting in it's stealth/hiding gameplay, the setting, characters, themes, visuals, and plot of it (from what I've seen so far) all together easily tips the balance into a positive experience. \nAnd simply put, if ya like mice/rats, you'll love this. \n\nSo with the gameplay, from what I can tell not much of it is really unique. The whole stealth mechanics work pretty much exactly as you'd expect them to. If you're looking for some kind of stealth/sneaking oriented game with a unique twist or catch or something like that, this probably won't do it for you. That all being said though, even though it's not anything [i]new,[/i] it is all very well crafted. Nothing really feels broken or twitchy, play it the way you should and it'll work the way it should. \n\nNow as for pretty much every other aspect of the game, well to start off it just [i]looks[/i] very beautiful. The lighting is rather well done, the enviroments are designed very well and appropriately, and the characters, guards and Tilo himself all have wonderful models. It all looks so good in fact that you might wanna double check your specs if you're hoping to play at a decent setting and/or framerate. My GPU isn't all that spectacular so I need to downgrade the visuals a little and still get some frame drops in certain instances, but none of that stops me from appreciating it.\n\nThere are only a handfull of characters you get to talk to at first but each has a use in one way or another, either tying into quests later on or giving vague tips to help you find things.

Stealth mechanics work great, but if you just want to quickly backtrack from point A to point B the game won't punish you too hard for alerting one or multiple guards to your presence, as you can easily find a hiding place to wait them out. Yes, there is some backtracking, but is made far less irritating than in most titles through game's single, continuous environment and multiple paths you can take from one location to another. Speaking of that environment, it feels truly filled, lush, alive and immersive. Being underground feels like you really are underground and in contrast forest really looks and feels like a forest, which is something I find a lot of game struggle with and tend to feel unfinished. Ghost of a Tale actually IS unfinished, but it already feels incredibly rich.\n\nGameplay is very straight-forward for a stealth game. You can sneak, hide, knock your opponents out or distract them. All of these work well, are fun to do and I've not run into any issues with them during my playthrough. Minor bugs aside, I've not ran into anything game-breaking or quest-breaking, or really any kind of bug or glitch that interferred with my gameplay. If these were present in earlier versions, they have been fixed.\n\nThe main character, Tilo, is quite compelling with his adorable appearance, poignant backstory and clear motivations. You are also given some, admittedly very limited, choice with his personality when picking dialogue options during NPC conversations.\n\nAlthough the story has been described by the developer as linear, there are a few choices to make during the game, most of which unfortunately we do not yet get to see the result of (like what you decided to do with the spyglass). Some quests also give you multiple options on how to complete them and some quests are not all that easily discovered, thus giving you a reason to thoroughly explore this wonderfully crafted world. Expositional text is simple and yet effective in conveying the world of the game to the player. It is sometimes serious and sad, and other times funny, even occasionally dipping into black comedy. Besides telling you about the world, it might also reveal things about Tilo and other NPCs.\n\nOn the more biased note; this game will most definitely appeal to the fans of Redwall, Mouse Guard, Beyond the Western Deep and similar works. I thoroughly recommend Ghost of a Tale to those whose stylistic predilections are already aligned with the game, those who enjoy stelath games and those who just enjoy a colorful and well defined fantasy worlds.

I hope that does not become an issue in my review. \n\nThe game, so far (nearly six hours played) is one of the most charming and fun games I've ever played. IT IS NOT a small game. Takes hours to solve some quests, lot's of dialogues -all of them very good written, by the way- and not just a bit of persistence. I don't think I expected that much of this game, but it is one of the greatest promises of the game-world this days. If they don't make it a small game, as it shouldn't be, and make use of the potential of this game to became a medium or large game experience, I do not doubt it'll become so good as the biggest names of the RPG catalogue.\n\nTo talk about the developing situation, I must say game is enjoyable so far. I've played quite a long time now and I'm not done with it. There are, nevertheless, some things I'd say could be better. The greatest one is difficulty. I think the trick and joy of the game is in exploring, stealth and solving puzzles. That's an undeniable truth, and difficulty is fine BY ME. But I don't ignore that there could be some players that expect quite more of a challenge, regarding the enemys, I mean. It comes a point where it's just running, knowing that none of them will be able to catch you. I'd put a mark on this point.\n\nGraphics are just fine; beautiful designs on every place of the game, also. Sometimes the change that is produced on the brightness of the screen when passing from a dark area to a clear one -from the jail to the courtyard, lets say- it's to abrupt. Sounds like a silly thing, but it kills me sometimes. Just a minor detail.\n\nI thought I had a problem with finding a key. I saw in a forum discussion that the key of certain door was not yet introduced, and that, therefore, didn't exist. That was sad, since it was relevant to complete a quite important quest, and I thought the quest was impossible to complete then. Took me a day checking the whole world for the key, seeing tutorials and discussions, until I opened my own discussion on the forum. Didn't take more than a night for one of the developers itself awnser kindly my questions, and solve my problems. That's just great, knowing the developers are aware of our issues and there to help us when the time comes. After all the stress of not finding this annoying key, I ended up even more happy with the game, knowing that neither the players nor the game itself are overlooked by the developers.\n\nAnyway, excellent, beautiful and almost perfect game so far! I'm looking forward to the final release; worth every penny. I think it could be one of the prettier games I've played, and it's not like I've played just a few. Thank you!

Yes granted it is a series of \"Steal X\" or \"collect X of Y\", but boiling something down to \"Kill X of Y\" or \"Collect X of Y\" pretty much covers most video games. The key is how well you hide that and how interesting you make the characters. And that seems to be something Ghost of a Tale does very well even without voice acting. No paragraphs of obtuse exposition, just short snippets that give just enough insight into the characters and world to make you sort of want to know more.\n\nI'm looking forward to updates or future games in this universe.", "timestamp_created": 1497931257, "timestamp_updated": 1497931257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 176, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.937380", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32548295": {"recommendationid": "32548295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024329605", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509554106}, "language": "english", "review": "SO FAR!!!\n\nIncredible good animations!\nIncredible good graphiqs!\nIncredicle good butter smoth cameras\nIncredible well optimized\nincredible good story plot\nincredible good stealth that really works!\nIncredible....\n\nwell you know what i mean!\nit was baked on kickstarter for a good reason!\n\nim giving thumbs up! if i had more hands i would give more, il try with my feet XD", "timestamp_created": 1497816519, "timestamp_updated": 1497816519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32489421": {"recommendationid": "32489421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002562103", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508654912}, "language": "english", "review": "Totally amazing game.

Ghost Of A Tale est un Action-RPG sortit le 25 Juin 2016 mais toujours en d\u00e9veloppement, une Early Acces quoi. Le jeu ON PEUT se le dire est vraiment tr\u00e8s beau. Le jeu est d'un style m\u00e9di\u00e9val-fantastique et o\u00f9 nous incarnerons une souris qui c'est faite jet\u00e9e en prison dont nous ne connaissons pas son histoire a cet instant.\n\nSynopsis :\n\nLe jeu comme, dit pr\u00e9c\u00e9dement, se d\u00e9roule dans une \u00e9poque m\u00e9di\u00e9val, nous y incarnons Tilo, une souris m\u00e9nestrel, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jet\u00e9 en prison.

It looks great, not just in terms of graphically fidelity which is of a quality I would expect from a larger studio, but with design.  How could anyone look a Tilo and not think that is adorable? The animations are also very well done. Not surprising given the devs background. \n\n- Writing. The story so far is intriguing, the characters are distinct and the dialogue is humorous. \n\n-World building. A lot of effort seems to have gone into fleshing out the wider world, in particular the culture of the mice. I highly recommend taking the time to read the item descriptions and the additional information on specific terms that appear in dialogue. It really helps bring the world to life. \n\n-Good level design. The level loops around on itself with plenty of shortcuts to open. This is particularly important as there is a fair amount of toing and froing.\n\nCons (bearing in mind this early access):\n\n-Stealth is a little simple for my taste, especially since this is the bread and butter of the game. The rats are so much slower than Tilo so you can pretty much just sprint past everything and healing items are all over the place. \n\n-No voiceovers. I don\u2019t usually mind this but you are playing a bard and he sings to other characters. It would be great to hear him sing (even if the rest of the dialouge isn't voiced).\n\n-Glitches, sometimes the rats get stuck and you have to exit to the main menu to fix this. \n\n-The quest at this point in time are almost entirely \u201cgo find some things scattered around the map\u201d.

Since its in Early Access, you get kind of blue balled once the content is cut off, but enough was there to get me interested in the main characters.\n+Limitless potential if further development continues at a steady pace\n\nCons:\n-Mediocre optimization. Motion blur significantly reduces framerate, and certain areas my framerate was halved. Random huge frame drops for 1-2 seconds on occasion as well. I have a GTX 1060, which is by no means a weak card.\n-Barebones main stealth mechanic. For a game designed purely on stealth, the stealth mechanic is a little bland. It uses a simple system where line of sight and your movement near enemies increases their awareness of you, and once the awareness bar reaches full, you're caught. Only, not really, because you can just outrun the guards and hide as soon as you break line of sight, and they make no attempt to search the hiding spots.\n-Currently, not enough content. I don't think the amount of game justifies its price. I'm writing this immediately after I beat it (not 100%, but pretty close, 24/26 quests completed) so my time played (4-5 hours) is accurate to around how long it'll take you to finish. If you do decide to purchase it consider it a donation to help move development along, not as a purchase of a full game. Which you should be doing for every EA title, honestly.\n\nThings of Note:\n=As of this review, there is absolutely no combat. Purely stealth. There are outfits that provide various bonuses, but they don't affect gameplay significantly enough to really make a huge difference other than aesthetics. This is not the Dark Souls: Prepare to Mice Edition you're looking for.\n=Controller STRONGLY recommended. Despite not being DS:PtME, it still needs a controller about as badly. Keyboard controls are pretty wonky, and don't allow to walk, which affects your ability to sneak.\n=No voiceovers. It'd be really nice if they could find some really good VA's, but I'd rather them stick to text than get someone to phone it in.\n=Occasional bugginess, as should be expected with early access titles.\n\nOverall, I think this game is well worth supporting. The setting is something we really don't see in action games too often, and while the story is rather simple, it's still interesting and well written enough to keep players invested. Keep in mind my main gripes about this game are on the technical side, and will likely be remedied as it is developed.", "timestamp_created": 1479600151, "timestamp_updated": 1479600872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614363", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26669254": {"recommendationid": "26669254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029752486", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479837133}, "language": "danish", "review": "Nice little game :o)", "timestamp_created": 1479464434, "timestamp_updated": 1479464434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26544791": {"recommendationid": "26544791", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999908078", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1513735932}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hac\u00eda mucho tiempo desde la \u00faltima vez que un juego me manten\u00eda completamente enganchado a \u00e9l gracias, sobretodo, a su gui\u00f3n y argumento. \u00c9ste tiene muchos misterios y secretos, y estoy deseando que lancen la versi\u00f3n final para poder desvelarlos.\n\nEl apartado gr\u00e1fico es exquisito, as\u00ed como la m\u00fasica y los efectos de sonido. \u00c9sto le confiere una ambientaci\u00f3n profundamente inmersiva, que te hace sentir verdaderamente como un peque\u00f1o rat\u00f3n en un mundo donde todo es muy grande.\n\nLas mec\u00e1nicas del juego pueden parercer repetitivas, pero siguen siendo divertidas y desafiantes porque creo que el punto es resolver rompecabezas a trav\u00e9s de las mismas.\n\nEn fin, seg\u00fan lo visto hasta ahora y sin m\u00e1s elementos de juicio, para m\u00ed es un 10/10 y lo recomiendo a todos los amantes de los videojuegos.

I only watched for five minutes before I exclaimed \"I love it already\" upon seeing a small mouse with his little hat running around a rat infested jail. And that's always a good sign. I closed the video after that to not spoil myself further. I wanted to experience it myself.\n\nThe game is a stealthy action game with RPG elements in it. You have food to raise your health after being hurt, tools like candles and sticks to help progress, and articles of clothing that you can find scattered across the world that improve your stats or help disguise you if you find a full set.\n\nYou can hide in the same barrels and chests you loot, providing safe places where you can save your game. This is a dynamic I really enjoy.\n\nThere's something special about Ghost of a Tale that really struck the right notes for me. I found myself getting immersed in my character and the world that slowly revealed itself around him. I was a small mouse, thrown in a jail that was guarded by patrolling rats that were twice the size of me. This helped cement the fact that I wouldn't be defending myself anytime soon. I was a tiny mouse, so the best thing I had was to hide and run away.\n\nAs I journeyed through the sewers and halls of the jail I slowly uncovered little factoids and lore about this fantasy world. A world of a rat based kingdom who were at war with the ferrets, a world with sea fairing frogs and all these words and items that don't exist in our world. All of this world building helps my personal experience significantly!\n\nHowever, like all early access games, Ghost of a Tale is not without its share of glitches. Mostly gameplay related, these glitches would usually prevent me from enjoying the game to its fullest potential.\n\nMy character would frequently become frozen in place, usually after reloading a save and exiting a hiding spot. This glitch could only be fixed by closing the game completely and reloading and this only pulled me out of the experience.\n\nSometimes the effects of clothing remain even when the item is removed. This usually happened after quickly dipping into my inventory screen, removing a hat, and quickly closing it. I often remained slowed because of the heavy armor I wasn't wearing anymore or had my screen darkened by a mask I was no longer wearing. This was easily fixed by a quick unequip/reequip, but its worth mentioning.\n\nMap markers had a habit of remaining on the screen even if I got the item it was directing me to. This worried me because now I was dead set and searching every nook and cranny, even inch of the area to make absolutely sure that I got the item it was point to. Compared to the map markers that disappeared like they were suppose to, the ones that remained happened about 35% of the time.\n\nTalking to NPCs continued to be a worrisome task for me. Sometimes the game would glitch out when I talked to other characters. I even had a character's dialogue screen remain on the screen, forcing me to quit the game. Anytime I selected an option in the dialogue tree that require me to scroll down a bit in the options, the game would remember the scrolling down and transmit that data to the next dialogue prompt, resulting in a worrisome blank screen with no options until I scrolled up. For most of it, it ran smooth enough and worked, but its very rough around the edges and could use a good working on.\n\nI finished the game in about five hours and I feel like I moved rather quickly through it. I was thirsty for a new area, I wanted to get out of this jail as soon as possible. I wanted to save my wife! I want to see more content and hope there's much much more to come!\n\nWhat worries me is that this game might become neglected like many early access games before it. I worry that the company will lose interest, take what money they earned and move on, leaving the game by the wayside. But I really REALLY don't want that to happen!\n\nIf you enjoy sneaking around in a world of anthropomorphic animals with a medieval theme, I would definitely recommend this game!", "timestamp_created": 1473630073, "timestamp_updated": 1473630073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25445526": {"recommendationid": "25445526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062813911", "num_games_owned": 586, "num_reviews": 575, "playtime_forever": 633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499036099}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine [/h1]\n\n[quote] PLEASE NOTE: This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access.

The character designs are fantastic and have a really unique feel to them\n\nThe writing is fantastically (although still in Early Access) is well done and really compelling, this is one of the very few games that I actually wouldn't mind doing the side quests for, even though this game is still in Early Access, it certainly doesn't feel like an Early Access game (apart from the odd graphical or gameplay glitch but that's understandable)\n\nThe animations are incredible, things such as climbing and the way Tilo (the cute little mouse :3) interacts with small ledges and stairs as well as Tilo's movement feels fantastic, and looks realistic in the meantime being absolutely adorable as well. There is the few animation glitches here and there but I am sure that they will be ironed out in upcoming updates\n\nI am totally in love with the level of detail in the environments, the quality of textures on pretty much everything I've seen from Tilo's fur to the grains of barrels and such, it all looks really good and I can't wait to see a whole world come to life in this depth and style as the game develops further. And surprisingly enough, this was all made on the Unity engine! UNBELIEVABLE!?!\n\nGhost of a Tale in its current state is a must buy and there is already hours of content readily available to you even though it is in Early Access, I cannot wait to see what this game has to offer as it progresses down the development path and I hope it will become one of the greatest indie stealth RPG gamnes thus far!\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]\n[i] THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

What a game! I played this throughout the night and morning.\nI can't add much to this review that hasn't already been said before by others, but I'll break down some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Looks incredible\n- Ambiance - Despite being a very cute, the jails and sewers were very off-putting (in a good way!). Chains rattling, the music, the lighting... It made me expect something bad to happen even in places I'd been through a few times. Kept me on my feet.\n- Interesting lore and world building - There has been a lot of effort in world building, and I really feel like a small mouse in a big world so far.\n- Witty and funny writing - I didn't expect the writing to be as funny as it is. Had quite a few laugh out loud moments.\n- Great characters - This goes along with the above point\n- Fun gameplay mechanics/puzzles - Utilizing the environment to reach keys and other objects was fun, and the stealth mechanics were good (albeit a bit buggy, more on that below). The jail really reminded me of the prison from Wind Waker (Except fun).\n- Level design - The areas remind me of Dark Souls. Very beautiful scenery, even in the dankest parts of the jail. There are plenty of shortcuts you can unlock through the game to help access past areas faster.\n\nCons (Mostly bugs):\n- Platforming - This may be just me, but I  found it very hard to perform some platforming jumps in the later area of the game to reach some of the side-quest items. Tilo seemed really stiff and never wanted to face in the exact direction I pointed him in. I'm sure these will be matted out in the final release.\n- Enemy AI - The enemies would sometimes bug out, they'd get alerted to me and stay still, or remain stuck for the rest of the game, etc. These should ironed out in the final release.\n- Sometimes my game wouldn't let me pick up an item on the ground unless I was looking at it at a very specific angle, especially on tables and keys knocked onto the floor from hooks.\n- Poorly optimized - This will improve with the final release I'm sure.\n\nAnd finally...\n- Left me wanting to play more! This game is fun! I can not wait for the rest of the game to be released, as well as more of the world.\nSeith and his team should really be proud of themselves.

I played it straight through the end of the demo no stopping. There are still some bugs here and there, obvioulsy because it's still in early access. But the fact this IS an early access and you can get 10 hours out of the game if you try to finish all the quests is ridiculous. \n\nEvery character you meet has a well indepth story or personality. Even when you talk to the rats they have something interesting to say at different times. The night and day cycle really brings out a sense of world building. Nothing breaks the immersive feeling, besides the couple of bugs, but everything feels like it generally belongs in the world. One or two puzzles are very tricky, and you will learn to make sure to check every place you have been to comb over for finishing all of the quests. \n\nThe dialouge throughout the game has nothing but witty retorts or puns. It brings the feeling of immsersion even more to life. Also, all of the items you collect are used for something, not just \"Oh hey. Cool. WTF am I going to use this for?\".

TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION[/h1]\n\nGhost of a Tale is an action RPG adventure, with a strong focus on stealth and exploration.\n\nYou play as a mouse named Tilo, in a world full of animals. You have been separated from your wife, and you must use your wits, and the help of others to make your way back to her.\n\nThe game has a heavy focus on exploration, and there are a lot of collectibles to find. Many of which will be required for different quests, but some others are optional. I especially like the different clothing items, and once you obtain the full set, you can disguise yourself to trick those around you.\n\nStealth makes up a large portion of the game as well. It\u2019s nice that there is a very clear indication of how close you are to being seen or heard, and to tell whether or not you\u2019re hidden. Stealthing around is enjoyable, but when you get found, you are still be able to escape and hide without too much difficulty. If you do happen to get hit by an enemy, there is plenty of food around to consume and heal back up.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list][*]exploration is enjoyable, and there are lots of collectibles to find\n[*]the stealth mechanics are simple to understand, yet effective at the same time, and those who love exploring and finding all the collectibles to enjoy themselves without stressing too much about being discovered\n[*]environments are absolutely gorgeous; the world is so beautiful, and extremely immersive\n[*]character design is fantastic - excellent attention to detail (Tilo is so adorable with his little tail and whiskers)\n[*]music and sound effects are done very well (part of me wishes there was some voice acting, but it makes more sense that there isn\u2019t)\n[*]the text dialog between characters is written well, and the characters feel like they have their own personalities; the dialog is believable, and the conversations feel genuine\n[*]inventory management is minimal, and items are easy to swap out (the game would benefit from the addition of inventory hotkeys or quickslots though)[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list][*]only 25-30% of the content compared to what is expected for full release is available, so the content is a bit lacking for the full price (as expected)\n[*]the more hard-core stealth fans will find the game too easy, and too forgiving - the game would definitely benefit from having more challenging difficulty settings available\n[*]some minor bugs that you can easily avoid, and a couple other more severe bugs that require reloading a save or restarting the game (which is a minor inconvenience)[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nI have played about 4.5 hours so far, and I have completed nearly all of the available quests, and found almost all of the collectible items. The game is fairly polished, but as expected in early access, there are some bugs that still need to be addressed. Some bugs are very minor, but there were a couple bugs where I needed to reload a save or restart the game. I\u2019ve really enjoyed the game so far though, and I\u2019m definitely looking forward to the full release of the game. Admittedly, the content is a bit lacking for the full price right now, but Ghost of a Tale is off to a fantastic start. If you\u2019re interested in an adorable RPG adventure with stealth and exploration, and you\u2019re interested in supporting the game as it develops, this is  certainly a game worth checking out.\n\nIf you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curations [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AzralynnReviews#curation]here.[/url]\nYou can also view this review on my website [url=http://www.azralynn.com/ghost-of-a-tale-early-access/]here.[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1473301673, "timestamp_updated": 1491778757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671272", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25404814": {"recommendationid": "25404814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249111592", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474191672}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to love this game and i have to say the graphics are certainly sumptuous with a fantastic premise.\nHowever the whole thing is let down by a control system that is (at least on the PC) totally unmanageable.

Well not review, but just my view of this game.  I will begin by saying when they spoke of drawing inspiration from Redwall, suddenly my nostalgic heart strings were tugged on.  I immediately started recalling the stories that I read and am going to have to find the books to read them again.  I always wanted to know what that world would look like if it were fully realized in either a movie or a video game.  Holy hell they pulled it off perfectly!  This game looks incredible from an art style.  The entire purpose is that you are a little mouse but the world is tailored for small creatures.  Some call it animorphic, its simply the little creatures can speak and act as though they are living in a human world. \n\nI wanted to stay in the game world forever.  After you play the game for a couple hours, you begin to notice the detail that went in to creating this environment.  Another thing I am a huge fan of, is rather than focusing on how BIG they can make the game world, they create a small area with lots of stuff to do and find.  It is your standard fetch quest, occassional puzzle, and exploration driven gameplay, but I found it enjoyable because I was in an intresting game world that evolved the longer I played.  Mice in this world wear hats that show what their job is.  It means that you will be wearing a lot of differnet outfits, and each one will be useful in some way such as speaking with NPC's who react differently depending on what you are wearing.  \n\nI didn't even mind having to go back to places I had been before, there are little short cuts you can find, you master sneaking past all the guards while being efficient.  I really felt like I was that mouse trying to survive this crazy prison.  I cannot wait for them to finish this game, I got to the Early Access ending and immediately wanted more.  I look forward to seeing how this story evolves, I hope there are a lot of friendly NPC's in a small nearby village, I just want to get to know more about this world.  \n\nPlease.  Give.  Me.

Character designs are novel and have a really unique kind of feel to them stylistically. \n\n~ The writing is fantastically well done and really compelling, I'm going to try and do every quest in this early build just because this game, unlike many others, makes me want to do the little side quests - in particular the rose collecting quest, which I have 8/9 of currently (can't find the one near Rolo's smithy), and the story told from this quest is not only really neatly woven into what seems to be a main story thread, but it is also charming, endearing, and saddening all at once.\n\n~ The animation is very nice, it feels like there's a lot of Inverse Kinematics going on with things like climbing and the way Tilo interacts with small ledges and stairs (to a point). Moreover Tilo's movement feels fantastic, and looks really well considered as well as being absolutely adorable as well. There are naturally hiccups, but I'm impressed so far with him and the rats as well, with how they move so... Stalking and menacing, I really did feel their steely gazes and imposing frames at every turn.\n\n~ Graphical fidelity has never been something I've valued above all else, and I'm used to sacrificing that for a consistent, smoother experience. I am however totally in love with the detail in the environments, the quality of textures on pretty much everything I've seen from Tilo's fur to the grains of barrels and such, it all looks really good and I can't wait to see a whole world come to life in this depth and style as the game develops further.\n\n~ Technically speaking... I need a better machine to truly appreciate what this game can do. Certainly optimization and engine management comes into it but it performs very nicely for me at this point - though the AI in certain places can bug out significantly. Definitely heed the words, \"Save early, save often.\" That having been said my opinions echo those of Jim Sterling here: if this is the worst the game can show me, I really am not going to complain about the AI occasionally (only happened once in 3 hours of play) wigging out.\n\n~ I nearly lost it when I read \"Curled Tails\" - I forget the actual book name but it's close at least. Being that I've done a lot of writing in my time, I thought that was a particularly poignant and smart jab at erotic (and especially erotic furry) fiction. Yes, a LOT of such stories are exactly like that.\n\nSo much for keeping it short... but those are my thoughts so far.

There are apparently a few quests I didn\u2019t complete yet, so I might go back and do those at some point.\n\nThis game is not only beautiful to look at, but really immersive. The only music that happens is on menu/dialogue screens (it\u2019s all text dialogue, which I\u2019m actually fine with) and during chase sequences when you need to get away and hide. This means that 90% of the time, you\u2019re listening to ambiance and action noises. Fire crackling, cicadas chirping, guard footsteps, etc. This is actually very good sound design, since you wouldn\u2019t want music all the time when you\u2019re trying to listen for things in the game world.\n\nThe game also DEMANDS exploration, as there are some things that are really hidden away. Hell, I actually had to look up something at one point (very hard to do on an obscure early-access game) because it involved going into a dangerous area, hopping a wall to a rooftop, and finding a way into the rafters. The game is a stealth-based RPG, which normally isn\u2019t my thing, but I love the world they\u2019ve created, and the characters are really interesting. One character you meet is a big bag of mystery that I really hope is explored more in the final release. There\u2019s one thing about him I\u2019m extremely curious about now.\n\nIt\u2019s really interesting that this game was put together by just five people, the studio head being a former DreamWorks animator, and it shows. The animations are fluid and feel natural. When Tilo is looking at someone or something he can interact with, he\u2019ll actually look up/down at it, and tilt his head curiously. If you walk into a wall, he\u2019ll turn either right or left instead of just standing with his face buried in a stone. If you need to get onto something, he\u2019ll actually crawl onto it instead of just jumping high enough to get onto it. When you interact with an item, he\u2019ll actually reach out to grab the item.\n\nSubtle little details like this just make all the difference in pulling you into the world. The lighting effects for the day/night cycle are just amazing, and affects how well you can see things. Not just the darkness, either. The bright dawn light can obscure your vision at certain angles. The game does have its glitches here and there, but it\u2019s early-access alpha still, so I can forgive them.\n\nIt won\u2019t be for everyone, and it is pretty demanding on system requirements (my GTX 670 barely makes the minimum specs, and I get frame rate tanks in certain spots, primarily when transitioning between certain areas), but I definitely recommend it to any fans of the genre. If you want to help support them in building the final release and have a strong enough PC (or plan to buy/build one in the near future), consider buying into the Steam early-access.

It is VERY hard not to squeal just by looking at it.\n\nWhat this game presents in order of emphasis:\n- Exploration: many corners hide collectibles, cloth pieces or lore tidbits\n- Costumes: alters your stats. Use different clothing according to the situation\n- Stealth: the enemies are Rats, big and clumsy, can be outrun if you are quick\n- Lore and Story: There's a story behind it and you'll discover as you play\n- Day and Night cycle: Some stuff only happen at night, while others happen during the day\n\nWhat can be improved:\n- Enemy AI: needs more improvement as the rats have predictable movements and static speed\n- Voiceover: there are some parts that would shine if a voiceover was used, when Tilo sings for example. Even Banjo-Kazooie sounds or Okami sounds would be awesome.\n\n\nOverall it's a solid game if you like exploration based games!\n\nYour first playthough of this should take you anywhere between 8h to 16h depending on if you use the hint system or not, and if you choose to collect everything.", "timestamp_created": 1470574903, "timestamp_updated": 1470581381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629151", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24751760": {"recommendationid": "24751760", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998830902", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484006421}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game recamend trackball mouse\n", "timestamp_created": 1470532225, "timestamp_updated": 1470532225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24749110": {"recommendationid": "24749110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040361102", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470956283}, "language": "english", "review": "absolutely fantastic game.

Really it's a beautiful work of wit, writing, and imagination, which is serious in tone, but simple, light-hearted, and enjoyable in execution. It is a game with a heart, which is rare in today's world. It's a game that you could find yourself coming back to looking for the small things that you may have missed and the stories that have yet to be told. The land of rats, mice, frogs, and spiders tells a medievil tale of a mouse attempting to reunite with a lost loved one, and it tells it in a thought out world where everything has a past and a reason for existing. \n\nThe gameplay is simplistic, but varied, and hopefully with the introduction of combat and greater amounts of items and functions, something that could make a mark on how games should be made. Stealth is tough, but never impossible, but also never too easy, puzzles are not always explained, clues are not always obvious, and the density of a dialog between two rodents is never too dull. When you must find a key, you never have to look to far, but you may just as well miss it completely. The rats feel imposing and vigilant with their size and strength, but are never above being tricked, or eluded.  Fetch quests are never too dull with \"go here, get that,\" but are instead hunts and puzzles, and expect wit. Sometimes you may talk yourself into getting an item from another character, and sometimes you may talk yourself out of getting one. Even tedious backtracking is still found to be exciting, allowing you to go to those unknown places that are teased before you that then eventually open to contain more world and treasure. \n\nMy criticisms that should be addressed though are few but key if I do say so myself. Since it is in early access and isn't completely finished, I would like to share some of these and see if anyone else could agree with it, and take the opportunity to get them changed. First, jumping, and platforming, should deffinitely recieve some more testing, as you are just as likely to land or grab onto a ledge as you are to fall or not grab it, and this should definitely be tightend up or at least made more forgiving. Also, a minor irritance to relate, maybe make the roofs and other surfaces less bumpy or prone to being slid on, in order to give a greater sense of control and dexterity. The second to address, is speed. While nobody would expect a small mouse in a full suit of platemail armor to be speedy, climbing ladders, and ledges could use some speeding up, or an optional sprinting version of these two activites, that otherwise seem slightly teadious when running around the levels which are deep in detail and vertical in design. \n\nOverall, as it is in it's current state, I would definitely say that it is worth the price of admision, and the game is excellent for its depth, detail, character, charm, gameplay, and RPG, stealth, and action elements, but certainly isn't a very good platformer or the next Mirror's Edge or Dying Light. Regardless, if you are a fan of Fable, Dark Souls, The Elder Scrolls, Thief or non-RPG games like Banjo-Kazooie, Jak and Daxter, or Assassin's Creed, I'm sure you could find something you'll love, in this big ambitious world compressed into a small package that is [u] Ghost of a Tale [/u]", "timestamp_created": 1470384953, "timestamp_updated": 1470385032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24720948": {"recommendationid": "24720948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051629681", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470381064}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent!

changed alot XD\n\nit's maybe a little too expensive for such a yet buggy title but come on Even the big name teams wont produce something less buggy but still as wonderfull to watch as the artdesign

Stealth works, game is not crazy-hard and violent and sutable for a child. \n\n- Interface is a bit messy, but manageable. Game has a strong stealth epmhasis that suits the setting very well, you're a little mouse after all.\n\n- Also like in Hitman you have suits that can disguise you, but like in Zelda you have to explore the world to obtain them first.\n\n- Level design is a bit broken (Sewers), but very logical and very connected. Once again - like Zelda.\n\nBut this is all poetry, let's tell the tale!\n\n- For Unity 5-game GoT looks and feels amazing. Animations are smooth and the main character movements is something like a Cute Drug. Idle animations is the best i ever saw in RPGs. Believe me, this game is beyound cute. If you have a wife (or waifu, hehe) or a girlfriend who loves rodents - this is your NO 1 purchase.\n\n- FPS is steady on my rig and I haven't  encountered any game-breaking bugs so far (few collision problems is fine, it's an Early Access game after all)\n\n- Plays nicely with mouse (no pun intended) and keyboard. But works better with XO controller.\n\nSo far this is the most \"game-ready\" project that i ever had in my Early Access library. Unlike DayZ or We Happy Few, right now Ghost of a Tale plays, feels and looks like a fully-fledged AAA-title (on a slight budget). Yup, the game is short on RPG-lenght content and voiceover would definitely be a nice touch, but even for now you can buy this game and complete it from start to finish without any regrets.\n\nYes, some elments like stealth-meter and inventory management are in dire need of tweaking, but nothing horrible. Hopefully they will be patched.\n\nMy only problem with tha game right now: it ends. I hope our money from Early Access will go to expand the title and bring the voice actors who will gift a Green Fire of Life to this very exciting setting.\n\nAlso the game right now is more plot-ready and playable than Fallout 4 was on release, which is very-very funny.\n\nMouses 1: Rad-rats 0.

You have been sent here for one reason or another (wish to keep the story somewhat spoiler free), and will find our prison to be most comfortable. While you are here, you will be expected to behave and listen to the commands of the guards patrolling outside your cell. If you refuse, I can assure the guards can see to your swift passage into the afterlife. Should you wish to press forward, you might discover a beautiful adventure that will either see you taking center stage in a quest to find a missing love or merely a forgotten whimper in the wind.\" Now with that out of the way, we are here to answer one simple question: is Ghost of a Tale worth the price of admission?\n\nThe visual aesthetic is gorgeous. Texture detail in the walls and floors really stands out in the form of cracks and moss. Character models for the mice are adorable with great attention to the clothing features. Rats look outright menacing and garner dented armor. Lighting effects are still a work in progress (way to dark at night), but the sunny atmosphere and proper shadow features in the jail reflect the level of care this developer seems to be taking with the overall look. Animation quality is high grade the times it is used, but it still needs refinement for certain actions (such as level operation). Sound plays a big role in the game and something as simple as armor clanking adds special detail to the ambiance. Music is very soothing outside of encounters, which sees the volume ramped up in the form of the horn section. The hit of the anvil, the scurrying of hasty feet and something simple as climbing furniture is satisfying to hear, but there is a lack of sounds for other actions. If anything though, the visual quality is the best attribute for this game.\n\nThe story is unfinished, but the characters and backstory available offer a humbling experience. The main character, Tilo, must find the help of a couple of rats, a few mice and a rather rude frog. Each character is somewhat fleshed out during dialog, which is cleverly written. Certain key information mentioned in dialog can be further explored in foot notes and helps with the world building. Quests are also present in the game and completing them opens up new quests and also fleshes out the characters more. Outfit pieces are also scattered around the keep that, if worn in front of certain characters, open up more dialog options that further expand on the lore and just look adorable on Tilo. The content available was pleasant to read (especially some optional ballads), but I was able to finish everything in a few hours (includes finding the roses, beetles, quests). It left me wanting more, which is a point in favor of the game's writing, but not for the discussion of cost vs value. \n\nThere is no combat, period. Every encounter must be dealt with in a stealthy manner. Rats will patrol in a choreographed paths and you will need to get past them using hiding spots and timing. If you are seen, you must sprint your way to a hiding spot (barrel, chests, cupboards) to escape the view of these pesky rodents. If you are hit, you can be knocked out unconscious to and choked by the rat (prompting a quick time event to escape the grip). Bottles can be used to get a rat's attention and make them move to a spot outside of the path. Other enemies exist in the form of insects and need to be out run to avoid damage. It is barebones in terms of strategy and it falls back to a glaring issue I noticed: the AI is lackluster.\n\nRat patrols have been a mixed bag in terms of functionality. I have seen rats get stuck into doorways (the actual doorframe, not stuck in the space) and seen rats get stuck in alert mode outside hiding spots when they should be de initializing. I even had three rats looking at me in a room and managed to still hide in a cupboard. More shockingly enough, I just hopped onto the bed in the room just inside the entrance of the jail and managed to appear hidden. The AI really needs some work if it hopes to present a challenge in an environment that seems to be easily manipulated by running past guards and makes sneaking relatively useless.\n\nControlling the game with a mouse and keyboard was helped with the patch released earlier today, but it is still preferable to play using a controller. The camera is rotated using the motion of the mouse and can become a real nuisance, especially during chase sequences. Frame rate drops do happen in certain areas of the game and the inventory has a chance to become unresponsive. The guard armor set also fails to traverse through certain doorways and stairways, making it rather inconvenient for both movement and losing full health to change out of the set. It is, after all, in development, but it is still good to address what you might expect.\n\nIf there had to be one word to describe Ghost of a Tale, it would have to be ambitious. The presentation values are very high quality for something in early access and doesn't have as many optimization issues. That being said, the overbearing issue is with the lack of content currently present in the game. I wish I could say otherwise, but the price of the game just isn't worth twos X a half hours of exploration. I will come back in six months to see how the game has evolved and eagerly await to see more of the story.\n\nPros\n- Gorgeous, gorgeous scenery\n- Characters and world building are great thus far\n\nCons\n- Controls are finicky on mouse and keyboard, best suited for a controller\n- AI is pathetic, making stealth pointless\n- Overall content is relatively short", "timestamp_created": 1470200016, "timestamp_updated": 1470200131, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487372", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24681420": {"recommendationid": "24681420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101867598", "num_games_owned": 1310, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470016705}, "language": "english", "review": "I have enjoyed my time so far.

Tilo may be escaping from jail, but the world he inhabits is unbelievably rich. Each character has their own motivations, personalities, and quirks. You are never quite sure who to trust, or if you should even trust at all. The gameplay is challenging, the puzzles are unique and test observational skills. But perhaps the greatest draw is that you can go through this adventure as you see fit.\n\nYou choose who to be nice to, you choose who you can scam. The consequences of your actions are merely moral - and not shoved down on you. One quick example, I revisited the frog early in the game dressed as his captain. I could have told him the truth that his captain, and friend, was dead. But instead I lied and continued the farce. I was then able to retrieve the item I was looking for from him, and was also able to get five florences in the process through the scam. I don't know if this is the inevitable outcome, but it felt as though I made the decisions leading there. And the game didn't punish me for it. I had to live with knowing that I lied to an old frog who never truly got to say goodbye to his friend - and the only consequence was one that I put on myself. This type of moral choice is only capable via this medium, and it is done with artistic grace. Other games that offer choices typically hold your feet to the fire in a black and white situation of good vs evil. 'Ghost of a Tale' does not paint morality for you - it makes you discover it for yourself. And that is just ONE example of the countless choices I had to make with the NPCs.\n\nGameplay is satisfying, and honestly well done. The UI is fantastic for this, and limiting the stamina on current health pool is ingenious. The stealth mechanic is intuitive, and works better than the majority of stealth games I have ever seen. All of this \u2013 and no combat. Yes, you can knock some guards out \u2013 but it is often wasteful and more strategic to play it safe.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say the game doesn\u2019t have room for improvement. There were a few times where I truly got stuck. The Sewer Key, for example, was particularly infuriating. I searched everywhere for that key. To find that it was in a second drawer early on in the game almost made me want to stop. A big part of what makes this game fun is the discovery and collection of things. But when they are hidden too well then things become taxing. Keys are the typical example here, but there are others. An improvement I would make would be to have important items slightly glow, or shimmer, in order to draw the players eye. Or, have the Blacksmith make them glow and show you exact locations if you do pay him. This is a major problem that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe other problem with the game is in fact with the Blacksmith. It is too easy to save, spend your money to hear what he has to say, then reload. I was able to hear everything he needed to say in a few minutes and never having to spend money. There is one quest that requires you to pay him, but figuring that out was resolved through more of trial and error than by game design.\n\nDespite these few qualms I am in love with this game. I am more than satisfied with spending $20 for the 7 hours I have put into it \u2013 if this was all there was to the game I would be immensely satisfied. I want to know more about this world, its characters, history, and Tilo\u2019s story.

Aber warum? Ein Impulskauf? Ein Versehen? Aus Mitleid? Mitnichten!\nIn diesem Fall haben mich tats\u00e4chlich alleine schon die unbewegten wie bewegten Bilder der zugeh\u00f6rigen Produktseite im Steam Store v\u00f6llig in ihren Bann geschlagen. Nun z\u00e4hle ich mich beileibe nicht zu den Personen, welche mit einem h\u00fcbschen \u00c4u\u00dferen allein zufriedenzustellen sind. Gelogen w\u00e4re es allerdings, wenn mir eine h\u00fcbsche H\u00fclle nicht zusagen w\u00fcrde. Schlie\u00dflich ist es genau das, was einem zuerst ins Auge f\u00e4llt.\n\nObwohl ein Indie-Titel, sind die Spielwelt und ihre tierischen Bewohner unglaublich detailliert und liebevoll gestaltet. Sie w\u00e4ren eines AAA-Titels w\u00fcrdig. Hinter der sch\u00f6nen Fassade verbirgt sich aber auch noch ein ganz formidables Action-Adventure alter Schule, ganz in der Machart eines The Legend of Zelda. Ihr verk\u00f6rpert den kleinen M\u00e4userich Tilo, ein Barde, welcher durch einen Fauxpas einen Baron ver\u00e4rgert, welcher daraufhin seine Frau entf\u00fchrt. Tilo hingegen zog \u00fcber Los und direkt ins Gef\u00e4ngnis, wo er dann auch zu Beginn des Spiels aufwacht. Nun gilt es nat\u00fcrlich, seine holde Maid zu befreien! Na, hoffentlich hei\u00dft es am Ende des fertigen Spiels nicht: \"Thank you, Tilo! But your princess is in another castle!\".\n\nAus allen Ecken und Enden str\u00f6mt diese warme, gem\u00fctliche und lauschige Atmosph\u00e4re, welche mich an all die sch\u00f6ne Kinder- und Jugend-Fantasy der 1980er und fr\u00fchen 1990er erinnert. Ich sehe in Ghost of a Tale nicht nur die erwachsene Version von Feivel der Mauswanderer, eine Prise Die unendliche Geschichte, sondern erkenne auch Parallelen zu Brian Jaques Redwall-Romanreihe. Die sehr realistisch anmutende Darstellung der Tiere weckt bei mir unweigerlich Gedanken an Filme wie Hexen, Hexen und deren handgearbeitete Masken und Puppen.\n\nEinerseits kaum zu glauben, da Ghost of a Tale in der Hauptsache von nur einer Person, Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat, erschaffen wurde wird, andererseits hat genau diese Person lange Zeit als K\u00fcnstler und Animator bei Filmen von Dreamworks mitgewirkt, doch sp\u00e4ter auch an Ich, einfach unverbesserlich sowie Der Lorax.\n\nBereits in dieser fr\u00fchen Early Access-Fassung erwarten dich rund acht bis zehn Stunden Spielzeit, welche mit 26 Quests, zahlreichen sammelbaren Gegenst\u00e4nden sowie f\u00fcnf NPCs gef\u00fcllt ist. Letztere dienen zur Interaktion, nat\u00fcrlich vornehmlich um dir besagte Quests zuzuschustern. Dabei gilt es ein recht weitl\u00e4ufiges Gef\u00e4ngnis zu erkunden, wobei es zun\u00e4chst einmal aus der eigenen Zelle zu fl\u00fcchten gilt. Dein Pfad f\u00fchrt dich durch Katakomben, die Kanalisation bis hinauf in den Hof. Neben den NPCs bev\u00f6lkern Wachen das Gebiet, dessen Konfrontation du stets vermeiden solltest. K\u00e4mpfen ist keine Option, daf\u00fcr umso mehr das Schleichen, Verstecken sowie Fl\u00fcchten.\n\nIch liebe die Kombination aus Schleichen, Rollenspiel sowie Action-Adventure. Rollenspiel? Ja, doch das manifestiert sich bis dato haupts\u00e4chlich im trainieren einiger, weniger Fertigkeiten sowie der M\u00f6glichkeit, unterschiedliche Kleidungs- und R\u00fcstungsteile zu tragen. Letztere dienen nicht nur euren Attributen, sondern sie sind zudem unglaublich s\u00fc\u00df anzusehen (u.a. Dieb, Pirat, Ritter). Das Spiel erinnert optisch und vom Spielgef\u00fchl an einen Mix aus Zelda und Metal Gear Solid, wobei erstere Inspiration klar dominiert. Tats\u00e4chlich entspricht der visuelle Stil dem, was ich mir seit der Ver\u00f6ffentlichung von Twilight Princess schon so viele Jahre f\u00fcr die Zelda-Reihe erhofft hatte...\n\nDie Quests bestehen derzeit zwar haupts\u00e4chlich aus Sammeln von und dem Liefern der Gegenst\u00e4nde an NPCs, dennoch haben sie mir sehr viel Spa\u00df bereitet. Vielleicht liegt es aber auch daran, dass es f\u00fcr die knappe Zeit am Feierabend auch einfach nur eine gute Besch\u00e4ftigungstherapie war ;) Daf\u00fcr entsch\u00e4digt jedoch das fein ausgearbeitete Szenario, denn der Entwickler hat rund um Tilo auch seiner Welt, deren Charakteren und Gegenst\u00e4nden eine Bedeutung gegeben. Im spielinternen Journal kannst du interessante, belanglose oder auch einfach nur am\u00fcsante Beschreibungstexte zu Gegenst\u00e4nden, Charakteren und Lokationen nachlesen, w\u00e4hrend sich parallel dazu nach und nach die Geschichte entfaltet.\n\nDa st\u00f6rt es weniger, das du h\u00e4ufiger mal \u00fcber den ein oder anderen Bug stolpern wirst, in der von mir gespielten Version v1.49 gab es sogar einen Showstopper in Form eines Glitch. Da es sich hierbei um einen Early Access-Titel handelt, liegt das aber freilich in der Natur der Sache. Der Entwickler ist zudem sehr kommunikationsfreudig und reagiert schnell. In der aktuellen v1.93 sind die meisten Fehler bereits behoben und neue Features fanden ihren Weg ins Spiel.", "timestamp_created": 1470120154, "timestamp_updated": 1475761753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24664992": {"recommendationid": "24664992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162410567", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470110352}, "language": "english", "review": "*You could neglect this review if you're in for an adventure game, rather than looking for a challenge of any sort. To me personally games aren't enjoyable if I don't need to think before advancing.*\n\nThis game is very, very hard to judge and regardless of my ultimate opinion I like most of what it offers. It's made by a really small team and it honestly is very impressive for what it is thus far. The game looks pretty decent/good, has superior animations, runs better than mediocre and plays well(despite essentially forcing a controller on you as it's clumsy without).\n\nThe setting is absolutely fantastic, the characters likeable. The concept superb. The game has a very \"cozy\" feeling to it as the environment is kind of cramped - with positive connotation. The writing, as far as I've seen thus far, is well done.\n\nNow the reasons I do not recommend this game: I completed all there's to it in a little over 2 hours(steam went down for maintenance neglecting roughly a hour of playtime) and the developers stated that this would approximately be one fourth of the final product. I would be sorely disappointed if so, for it just isn't much. It's really very little(unironically, seeing you play as a rodent, for that matter) and the roadmap, judging by the previous statement, isn't impressive either. That leaves us at my biggest concern:\n\nThe stealth aspect is very poor. It's very, very superficial and very, very uninteresting. About EVERYTHING BUT the stealth is compelling, which is sour as it's the main selling point of the game. The AI is mind bogglingly stupid and can be cheesed(pun intended) simply by running. All guards are significantly slower than you are, and due to their slow and clumsy attack animations are incredibly easy to avoid. You can essentially rush past almost every single guard in the game(with the exception of a few in the very beginning) which results in them grouping up and proneblocking their way to a doorway where they'll all get stuck by humping into one another. It's a pathetic sight, and perhaps even more sad that it's easily the most efficient way to win the game. Furthermore guard are stupidly unaware and their \"alarmed\" mode is no more than walking to the place you created noise. Without looking around, just plain looking at the source of the noise. This means if you stand DIRECTLY next to them they won't see you. Guard don't react to ANYTHING in the environment other than noise; leaving doors open, or hauling stuff they're all apathic towards.\n\nLastly the sound design is generally poor, the music is decent but alot of actions lack \"sound\" still. That's understandable seeing it's still in development though.\n\nOverall it's good, but the main selling point is very poorly executed. So it really boils down to what you're looking for: story and \"adventuring\"? This game might be for you. Any form of challenge or use of wits?

This may be a matter of taste, but I get zero enjoyment and nothing but fustration from trying and failing over and over again to jump from one skinny rafter to another to retrieve the 6th of 7 identical items for yet another fetch quest.\n\nThe story and characters are great, however, and have kept me playing despite the shortcomings in gameplay, and the one saving grace of all the fetch quests is they require you to explore every nook and cranny of the truly beautiful environment.\n\nA really impressive effort from a one-man studio, and I look forward to the next.", "timestamp_created": 1470106517, "timestamp_updated": 1470106517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24662788": {"recommendationid": "24662788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050007110", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505349602}, "language": "french", "review": "20$ ?

Nostalgia is definitely one of the reasons I love it so much, but that aside, the gameplay is fantastic and the graphics/art-style is flawless.\n\nNow, the game has its fair share of flaws that I expect to see gone on the final release, for starters, the stealth mechanic is very exploitable in its current state, and by that I mean you can literally just run past all the guards and hide in pretty much plain sight as the guard just wanders back to his post. I would definitely love to see all that patched up, and the difficulty either in different levels or just more of a challenge overall.\n \nIn addition to that, the game could do with some more music, I found myself playing all sorts of musical playlists to liven up the silence a little when wandering around the fantastic level design. It would also be nice to see a better graphics settings menu, as the current one is very basic and lacking in options.\n\nIt took me roughly 5 hours to complete all that this early version of the game has to offer, which is not that bad considering it\u2019s only a small portion of what the game will be on release, I am craving more already though.\n\nAnd let me just say, if you were on the fence on whether or not to get it, I would highly recommend you pick it up and support these amazing people creating it as they have such a fantastic idea as to what makes a great game, and I imagine it will cost more on the final release.\n\nThank you developers for creating such a fun experience, and thank you backers that raised the initial funds for the game on Indiegogo. I\u2019m extremely excited to see what this game becomes and I will be coming back regularly to see what they add/change.\n\nI\u2019m not going to rate it out of 10, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary as the game will not be out until sometime in 2017 if all goes well, but I will say that if the full release is an expanded version of what we have here?

The world and events are filled in through finding hidden items like the roses and reading the footnotes in conversations giving this world a lot of depth without all the narration. Right now there isn't any voice acting besides sound effects.\nYour goal is to find your loved one and free yourself to do such you need to sneak, hide, and disguise yourself to achieve your objectives. The game has a sneak meter showing you how alert the enemies are to your location you can often reset the meter by hiding in a barrel/ chest/ cupboard. Guards are not too bright but can see pretty well in the dark. I ran into some issues with some guard stuck in location instead of patrolling or they would chase me and then get stuck in doorways. At the moment there isn't any combat, some guards you can throw objects like bottle on their head and knock them out temporarily. Not thing stays locked out or unconscienced for long.  There are food items just about everywhere for healing which your health is more tied to item sets than anything else.

It's a bit odd to have the enemy swinging at me when I'm knocked out, but not take any damage; feels like it would make more sense to either not get knocked out or be able to be damaged during that time.

On a gameplay note, it plays like a stealth game, with a condensed version of Dark Souls life and stamina as your gauge.  You read that right, gauge.  This game gets VERY clever in it's gameplay, as your ability to sprint is DIRECTLY tied to your health bar.  The game is initially over-saturated with food to replinish it, though I've yet to determine if this remains the case, and if you don't have the chance to heal, it doesn't matter how much food you have.  A fundumentally changing aspect of the game at least in my playtrhough though is the lack of map.  You, as the player, are supposed to be able to find maps to areas, and open them with the LB button.  However, I for some reason, consistently cannot, reminding me (As little does in this game) that it IS unfinished.  There is also the unexcusable fallacy of save points in this game.  To save the game, you must be hiding in any number of the containers you can hide in within the game.  This creates the potential to not save for excessive amounts of time, and forgetting to save properly has lead to game failure in the past for many games with the same limitation.  The game SHOULD let you save if you are not in the awareness cone or radius of the enemies, I.E. safe.  Not JUST when you're hiding.  The last problem is in the weird focus of the appearance of the game, which has heavy art but little optimization, with graphical glitchs being common, such as seeing through the walls to out of bounds and your beloved hats going nuts and your clothes clipping through you like air.  None of these glitches are potent or long-lasting, but with the game looking the way it does, it's VERY immersion breaking... BUT as I said before at the start of this rant, the game's pretty good so far despite these shortcomings.  If you get it though, remember that it is a W.I.P and any or all of these problems may not be fixed.", "timestamp_created": 1469833805, "timestamp_updated": 1469833805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24604491": {"recommendationid": "24604491", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993949590", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475275816}, "language": "english", "review": "An Absolute Gem.", "timestamp_created": 1469832970, "timestamp_updated": 1469832970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.990025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24603407": {"recommendationid": "24603407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003670246", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488066504}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed Ghost of a Tale.

As far as stealth goes its pretty forgiving which is fine by me because that means I get to get imersed in the world.

Trotz \"Early Access\" ist kommt einem das Spiel, bis auf ein paar wenige Bugs, ziemlich komplett vor und bleibt durchgehend spannend und knackig.\nF\u00fcr den Preis von 19,99\u20ac (Aktion -10%: 17,99\u20ac) bekommt man ein stealthlastiges Game, welches mit einem frischen atmosph\u00e4rischen Setting bzw. Flair arbeitet. \n\nZur Grafik: 9/10 Pkt.\n\nGrafikeinstellungen sind bis auf Chromatische Abberation, DOF, Motionblur nicht ver\u00e4nderbar, was aber kein Nachteil sein muss.\nGrafisch kommt man aber auch trotzdem nicht zu kurz und dies trotz meiner etwas \u00e4lteren Nvidia Geforce GTX 670 (2Gb). Es sind bei mir so durchschnittlich 50-60 Fps drin (FPS-Counter \u00fcber Debugmenu einstellbar).\n\nZur Performance: 10/10 Pkt.\n\nEs gibt keine Ladescreens mit Ausnahme des Startbildschirms, es gibt gewisse Bereiche im Spiel wo man merkt, dass etwas nachgeladen wird! Aber nur durch einen einzigen Mikroruckler (Fps-drop) bei mir bemerkbar!\n\nZum Gameplay: 8/10 Pkt.\n\nDas was zuweilen im Spiel enthalten ist ansich ganz wunderbar. Es kann sich sehen lassen. Jeder Gegenstand/R\u00fcstungsteil (gilt als Verkleidung bei einem kompletten Set) dient seinem Zwecke und funktioniert einwandfrei. \nBei der Steuerung m\u00f6chte ich aber jedem den Tipp geben das Spiel mit einem Gamepad zu spielen da\ndie Keyboard/Maus -Steuerung, im Bezug auf die Mausf\u00fchrung nicht ganz optimal ist.

It's also ADORABLE. The main character is a mouse jailed for sedition, in a jail full of rat guards, most of which do not have any interest in leaving you alive.\n\nThe game plays really well, for looking like something where all the focus is on the art... And I mean that in the best way possible. The art in this game is -incredible-. The character models look fantastic, the animations are beautiful, and the atmosphere and lighting are awesome. There are still some quirks to be worked out -- lighting in some areas seems a bit jumpy -- but this is part of the Early Access process.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly classic and intuitive for a Stealth style game. Don't get in combat unless it's absolutely forced, because as a tiny mouse in a jail full of armored rat guards, your ability to defend yourself ranks among the same levels as a loaf of damp bread. Instead, you'll spend your time watching patterns, dashing from hiding place to hiding place, and outwitting the guards at every turn as you jump from one place to the next.\n\nSounds are a bit sparse right now, but the game doesn't need a ton of them. The pitter patter of your own feet, the heavy clanking of guards moving around, and the musical strikes when you are spotted and running for your life are effective. Character dialog would be interesting to see vocalized, but I can imagine finding a good voice actor to play a male mouse would be a trick at best.\n\nThere are still issues, certainly, but it's a matter of ironing out kinks, definitely a process. There is still some bugfixing to be done, options to tweak and tailor (for example, at the time of writing this, PS4/Dualshock controllers are not supported, but Xbox controllers are), and other little issues. I felt a little overwhelmed with quests at one point, where I had so many active at once, and picking through to determine which ones are active and how to complete certain objectives was daunting. But none of these have taken away from the main gaming experience, which is the most important matter.\n\nGhost of a Tale is an excellent game already, and by the time it's fully finished, it is absolutely worth checking out.

My opinion is 100% unaltered and honest, drawn entirely from the experiences I have had with the game. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nAll in all, this game manages to pull off what I feel a lot of AAA games simply cannot, with their intense scope and budget - utilizing almost every aspect of its appearance in a way that actually counts, whether just for simply building atmosphere or truly blending the realms of graphics and gameplay. Turning a corner, unsure if you\u2019re going to find an enemy, only to spot the light reflecting off the cold red eyes of a rat is an amazing feat of design. Sure I could just walk around and find out, or hide and listen out for footsteps or snoring, but that\u2019s also where this game shines out. Time and time again, you see or hear stories of early access games doing the bare minimum or not even that! - there\u2019s one path, with only one way to get on it and that\u2019s your game - gg wp \u00a315, here\u2019s 0 updates.\n\nAll in all, at a time where the low budgets of indie games crush the game under stylised graphics, we see a game that not only manages to achieve a unique style for itself, but one that also refuses to sacrifice that fairly gritty sense of realism that it sets out to deliver. An absolute 10/10 from me, in this regard.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n very minimal focus on combat puts you into a position in which you have to take care. Being sure of where you\u2019re throwing an item to distract an enemy or working out which hiding spots you can run to as  you make your way down a hall all highlight the strongest virtue of them all - patience. Learning walk cycles, figuring out blind spots and altogether using your environment, transforming what was a dark hand around your neck as a tool, and turning it around against those out to catch you.\nThe puzzles in the game present themselves very well - a guard standing in front of a door that\u2019s locked, and only he has the key. What do you do? Well, you can make some noise and draw him out, sneaking up and stealing it as he walks back to his post. Or how about throwing a glass of grease, which he\u2019ll then slip on as he comes to investigate? Or what if you snuck past him, up the stairs and knocked him unconscious by pushing down a barrel.\nI think this - the options - are one of the cooler parts of the gameplay in Ghost of a Tale. There are definitely a lot in which there\u2019s one clear way, but the open-ended aspect of this game almost give each hall you walk down a sandbox-y vibe, and it\u2019s great.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nNow, I\u2019m a huge fan of story in games - where people hate the idea of cinematicism and 3 hour long movie-games, I do enjoy them. I\u2019ve been an avid reader all my life, and there\u2019s nothing I love more than to jump into a world and learn everything about it. However, given the nature of this game and the sense of urgency and suspense it often puts on you, I feel that this stripped back approach was the best way to deliver it. Not only can sneaking into a guarded room feel scary as hell, it\u2019s also rewarding as fuck to find a prize that will then enrich your experience and understanding of the setting, instead of just finding another damn pile of coins like most other games would do.\n\nThis style of delivery is fantastic and while it might not be my personal favourite for every game, it was the best choice of delivery for [i]this[/i] game.\n\nIt was the level of detail that really sunk it all in - a lot of the NPC interaction here isn\u2019t just simply there to force feed you context to the gameplay, but to be there in addition. These aren\u2019t just two pillars of game design leaning on each other to hold up a price tag; this is the evidence of a lot of love and hard work going into both the game\u2019s world and how you play within it.\n\nThese system of storytelling fits the design and gameplay of the game perfectly. The option to focus more on the thrill and excitement of gameplay is never abandoned, but the depth and intrigue of the world is also always there, should you choose to look for it and I think no matter what you prefer - intense and detailed stories or a heavy focus on that clever puzzle based gameplay, you\u2019ll have a good time with Ghost of a Tale.\n\nThe game also features a questing system, with optional dialogue alongside them and no steps have been skipped here. For example, I actually got annoyed at myself. I\u2019d just hunted back through the jail to find a hidden stash for these two mice in a cell up on the surface. I\u2019d managed to retrieve it and get back to them, but the day cycle was shifting and one of them was already asleep. In talking to the other, I had the option to hand in the quest, but I ended up exploring the dialogue options and performed him a song (or two) to help him fall asleep. This played a nice animation of the lyrics appearing, as the lute backing track played and after which, the mouse had fallen asleep. There I was, with the clock nearing midnight with a quest I had to hand in in the day time. \n\nIt was the level of detail that really sunk it all in - a lot of the NPC interaction here isn\u2019t just simply there to force feed you context to the gameplay, but to be there in addition. These aren\u2019t just two pillars of game design leaning on each other to hold up a price tag; this is the evidence of a lot of love and hard work going into both the game\u2019s world and how you play within it.\n\n\n[b]Overview[/b]\nOverall, I can\u2019t believe how positive this has come out. A few words to remember: I have only played this game for a few hours and while this \u201cearly access\u201d opens a lot up to you as a player, it\u2019s worth remembering that only about 25%-a third of the game is currently playable, as it goes further into development. Despite this, is this game worth picking up? Yes. Outside of the very few and acceptable bugs I\u2019ve seen - considering this is early access - I honestly don\u2019t have many complaints at all. \n\nIf this sounds good to, I urge you to pick it up. If even just the graphics or setting tickle your fancy, I would also recommend it.

The gentle rocking of the ivy, the bending of gras as you pass through it. The way Tilo's (and the rats) extremeties are flooded with sunlight when they are between the camera and the sun. It makes them look so soft and also small and alive. It is such a clever use of visuals! The smooth, transitionless and always perfectly in character movement of Tilo as you speed up and slow down. Controlling Tilo and seeing his animations almost makes me feel like I am a mouse (not just the shadow of a mouse ;)). They are both true to life and anthropomorphized. They are just perfect! \n\nThe dialogue (written text, there won't be voice overs in the foreseeable future) is witty and engaging. The dialogue options you get to choose from seem very varied, although I haven't tested different routes. It is remarkable though for a game of such small scope that characters will react to the way you are clothed sometimes. One guy for example notices if you wear the thiefs mask and addresses this during your conversation. The game is very \"efficient\" with its lore. You won't find volume after volume of walls of text like in the Witcher games or TES, but what you get to read is bursting with character, vividness and charm that totally makes up for a seeming lack of content.\n\nThe music deserves a special mention too! The theme track is brilliant in the way it is complex yet feels all of a piece and hopeful and moody. I love it! The music nicely supports gamemechanics (raised alarms) or sets the right mood for conversations. All in all it mingles perfectly with the games visual art and thematic setting and still is enjoyable just by itself.\n\nThis game does so many things I haven't seen in any AAA production it is just incredible!

Had my share of bad experiences, but reading up on this little indie title made me feel like these guys deserve the support.\n\nNow, 7 hours into the game and I've just finished the early access part. Didn't 100% it, but I did explore and mess around with the game quite a bit. They say this is roughly 25 to 30% of the game, so I'm expecting the final version to be roughly 15 to 30 hours long, depending on how much of a completionist you are. Speedrunners will probably manage to finish this game within 5 or 10, considering the current stealth mechanics.\n\n[h1]My opinion and experience[/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImwB2fNGtsI\nThis brings me to my main concern about this game. The stealth mechanics aren't really all there, it seems. The game feels a lot like Styx: Master of Shadows, and I really loved that game. I enjoy Ghosting missions in Far Cry, Metal Gear Solid, Assassin's Creed, Payday 2 and pretty much all games that let me. I want to be the silent assassin, or thief, that nobody noticed until they went looking for that item that I already extracted. So, this game is kind of an oddball. It says 'action RPG' in the store, but this Early Access part was void of any real action (combat) and RPG elements. The RPG could be the costumes, but then again, these costumes are required for certain events, so they're not really RPG, they're more like story mechanics. They are fun though, I like the Ranger outfit a lot, but as far as RPG goes, there's nothing really there so far.\nSo, I'd say this game is a story-driven stealth-based adventure game. But again, the stealth mechanics aren't quite there. The guards spot you, they chase you, you run around a corner, hide and they'll just stand there: \"Er, what?\" Combine this with the guard outfit, and you don't even have to wait for them to go away. You hide, open inventory, switch outfits with a button press and you can just exit and they won't even question your pressence. I do like the humour in this specific situation, but as far as stealth-based gameplay, this isn't all that great.\n\nAside from the lack of stealth-specific gameplay elements, this game actually has quite a lot going for it though. The graphics are gorgeous. The environment is very detailed. The sound effects and music are spot on. The story telling isn't bad and the dialogue options are fun, although I didn't get the feeling different options had different outcomes (which I think are required when giving the player the option to pick a response).\nAnother enjoyable aspect is the fact that you get objectives and sometimes mild hints to where to find said objective, but it's not all that concrete. I would appreciate some hints to be a little vaguer, or even hidden behind certain dialogue choices (pick wrong, don't get a hint, no do-overs), but there is definitely quite a bit for the player to find out for themselves.\n\nAnd of course, there are still a bunch of annoyances caused by bugs as well. Sometimes the mouse has trouble raising his foot high enough. Sometimes the camera gets sorta stuck - when going too fast down a small hole. And sometimes you lose progress because an enemy gets stuck in 'agro' and you can't save during combat, meaning you have to reload and retrace your step. Some optimization issues as well, where the framerate tanks to <15 when just walking around a corner (because it's loading another area). \nAnd then there are the major bugs that I haven't experienced myself, but that people have been talking about on the forums. Not all controllers work well. There are inconsistencies between reboots, as in: restart the game, and both the environment and enemies might behave slightly differently.\nBut all that is easily forgiven, considering this is Early Access. These issues all need to be resolved before release though, obviously.\n\n[h1]Summary and verdict[/h1]\nWe'll do a nice little pros(+) and cons(-) list then:\n+ Graphically amazing\n+ Detailed environments\n+ Story telling and deep lore for fans\n+ Sound and music is perfect (movie quality)\n\n- Stealth-gameplay needs a major upgrade\n- No action or RPG in this Early Access (could be in the rest of the game, but don't count on it for now)\n- Some controls (especially when it comes to platforming) are annoying (mouse just slides off of a square wooden beam)\n- Minor and major bugs (it is E.A. after all)\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Well, I do, but only for this simple reason: this very small team are doing something that hasn't been overdone yet. The stealth-genre can do with some good new titles. The story-driven genre, especially in the indie world, are usually lacking gameplay. So yeah, this title might actually up the ante for indie developers.\n\nIf you want to see this product succeed, back the developers.

In most cases even if you are spotted by guards you can usually escape backtracking or evading long enough to try again when the guards lose sight of you...\n\nThe menu design and inventory is simple..uncluttered and works perfectly ..although I did encounter an occasional gliche on the map gui..I'm certain this and other minor bugs can be easily patched out..\nhaving only played a few hours so far and suddenly becoming aware of how much this game has to offer so far..I am really looking forward to finding every secret and completing every objective...The main character is quite cute and his animations are smooth..fluid and rarely glichy...\n\nControls are intuitive (I've only used Keyboard and mouse so far but they respond perfectly but I did need to invert the mouse vertical axis  ...a personal preference)\nThe Character moves about the world with style and grace for the most part and transitioning from a full run to hiding in a chest or under a table is a simple straighforward action for the most part ...\n\nMusic and sound effects are atmospheric and emotional...The music that plays if you are spotted isnt annoying by any means and heightens the tension ...You can usually hear guards on patrol quite easily which helps with sneaking about...\n\n\nOverall gameplay is engaging,,,even if you are slightly bored by modern Stealth games...This one has a uniqueness all of its own and a testament to quality Indie Developement ...\n\nHuge thumbs up...if you like stealth games...I am sure you will find something really special and magical about this game....well done all round excellent title that I'm sure will become a classic as time goes by....Top effort and its basically made entirely by one guy!!!\n\nEasily scores 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1469638502, "timestamp_updated": 1469639470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583910", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24558816": {"recommendationid": "24558816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025261917", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469639849}, "language": "english", "review": "beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1469637855, "timestamp_updated": 1469638409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24557934": {"recommendationid": "24557934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050707140", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469746938}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is wonderful.

Gameplay-wise, you take control of minstrel Tilo and navigate him through rat-ridden corridors (the \"enemies\" aren't stereotypical bad guys, which I appreciate a lot), while always trying to remain unseen: if a fight breaks loose, the only means of defense are to throw stuff at the aggressor or, better yet, run away and hide. \n\nOnly two hours in, I already feel fatigue regarding this mechanic, since the enemies so far are easy to see through and not very clever: having to backtrack certain parts of the castle through the exact same setup of guards (or rather \"moving obstacles\") doesn't help the cause too much. Right now, my \"thumbs up\" rating is to be seen with a grain of salt: the game - considering its early access state - is too good to be punished with a mean, old, red thumb.

It looked more to be Dark Souls with mice back at the time. I suppose I'm a little happy they changed direction since we've been flooded with souls-esque games as of late. Still, it is a bit disappointing since the game showed so much promise.\n\nRegardless, the game we have now is very good. A stealth adventure game VERY reminiscent of the PS2 era (gameplay wise) which some brilliant art design and fantastic dialogue. The game isn't nearly complete yet and it just oozes with an interesting world and story.  I love the little personal touches with the species and stereotypes/racism. Lots of personality. \n\nObviously the game is still early on in its development, but what we have right now is very promising and a fairly enjoyable experience. It's perhaps a little repetitive gameplay wise, not sure how to fix that when the direction of the game is avoiding combat now, but it's still very early on. \n\nMy biggest complaint is that the game's performance is somewhat poor. I'm hoping it'll be touched up a bit more towards release, as right now the framerate dips are killing my enjoyment a bit.

What you get however is a charming and little game that's fun to play and runs well for an early access title all the while looking very good indeed. There's definitely a few bugs here and there, but the game doesn't look bad or run poorly like the majority of early access titles out there which is a huge positive given it's only just been released. It's worth mentioning that there's no fighting in this game - as a small mouse, your tools in a combat situation are mostly just running and hiding. \n\nThe game has simple stealth elements based on sound (proximity) and line of sight. Currently the stealth mechanics are perhaps a little basic and could use some embellishment via improving the enemy AI and adding more stealth mechanics, but as is it functions fairly well and is simple enough for just about anybody to get the hang of very quickly.\n\nDespite that though, the rest of the game really doesn't hold your hand. You'll be spending a lot of time searching for things - and there's no minimaps, on screen quest trackers or even arrows pointing you to where you need to go - with often very limited assistance from your quest menu and a basic map of the area (once you've found it!) you're mostly on your own. This will appeal to a lot of older generaton gamers, but perhaps new gamers will find it quite frustrating. \n\nOne area the game shines in so far is the NPCs. There's only 5 NPC's in the game right now, but each of them is well written with distinctive personalities and great dialog. \n\nOverall, the game is well worth playing in it's current state, but perhaps not worth the asking price as-is - however, once the game is complete, it will be a bargain for it's price, and if Ghost of a Tale seems like a game that would appeal to you, I implore you to

should I buy the game now instead of waiting for the final version?] \t\nThat\u2019s a fair question and the answer revolves around money: there\u2019s none left.\n\nSuccessful games\u2019 crowdfunding campaigns can reach a few hundred thousand dollars, sometimes even close to a million. The campaign for GoaT brought roughly $40K of effective budget.\n\nAs some of you know I\u2019ve been working on Ghost of a Tale each and every day of my life for the last three years and I\u2019ve paid myself $500 per month. The rest of the money went to buy hardware, licenses and of course to compensate my collaborators.\n\nNote that I\u2019m not complaining at all; no-one is forcing me to create Ghost of a Tale!\n\nNow we could very well start a new crowdfunding campaign but it would require quite a lot of time and energy and it would push back the game by as much. I prefer to put that effort into development. And given the advanced state of Ghost of a Tale I think the early access route is the best for everyone.\n\nThat being said I totally respect players who would rather play the game when it\u2019s finished and prefer to wait for the final version to be released.\n\nIf however you choose to buy the pre-release version, know that you are actually making the development of Ghost of a Tale possible. Plus you get a better price while the game is still in early access since the final version will likely be more expensive when it\u2019s out.\n[/quote]\n\n\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6982\u62ec\u4e00\u4e0b\u5c31\u662f\uff1a\n[olist]\n[*]\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u82b1\u4e863\u5e74\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6ca1\u65e5\u6ca1\u591c\u5730\u5168\u60c5\u6295\u5165\u5230\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u671f\u95f4\u4ed6\u4f9d\u9760\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u79ef\u84c4\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u6708\u6295\u5165500\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u6574\u65743\u5e74\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\n\n[*]\u4ed6\u539f\u672c\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u878d\u8d44\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u90a3\u6837\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4ed6\u6ca1\u6cd5\u5c06\u5168\u90e8\u7cbe\u529b\u90fd\u653e\u5230\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u94b1\u548c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6e38\u620f\u54c1\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4ed6\u653e\u5f03\u4e86\u90a3\u4e2a\u878d\u8d44\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\n\n[*]\u4e4b\u6240\u4ee5\u73b0\u5728\u628a\u65e9\u671f\u7248\u672c\u4e0a\u67b6\u51fa\u552e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5f88\u660e\u786e\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u63d0\u95ee\u7684\u4eba\uff1a\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u5df2\u7ecf\u6ca1\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u94b1\u5728\u652f\u6491\u4e0b\u53bb\u4e86\u3002\u4ed6\u5c06\u65e9\u671f\u7248\u672c\u53d1\u552e\u662f\u60f3\u901a\u8fc7STEAM\u548cGOG\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u6765\u5438\u6536\u540e\u7eed\u5f00\u53d1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\uff0c\u8fd9\u90e8\u5206\u8d44\u91d1\u7528\u6765\u8d2d\u4e70\u8bbe\u5907\u7ee7\u7eed\u5b8c\u6210\u8fd9\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002\n\n[*]\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u878d\u8d44\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u5c06\u65e9\u671f\u7248\u672c\u9884\u5148\u53d1\u552e\u6362\u53d6\u540e\u7eed\u5f00\u53d1\u8d44\u91d1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u7136\u8981\u201c\u8f7b\u677e\u201d\u7684\u591a\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u8f7b\u677e\u6307\u7684\u662f\u4ed6\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5206\u6563\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u7cbe\u529b\u5230\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bd2\u6684\u3001\u8c08\u5224\u3002\u4ed6\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ee7\u7eed\u5168\u60c5\u6295\u5165\u5230\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u3002[/olist]\n\n\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u975e\u5e38\u8ba4\u53ef\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u771f\u8bda\u548c\u76f4\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u5f88\u94a6\u4f69\u4ed6\u5bf9\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\u548c\u6267\u8457\u3002\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u70ed\u7231\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7528\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u52a8\u6765\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd9\u4f4d\u6709\u201c\u68a6\u60f3\u201d\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u770b\u4e0a\u53bb\u4e5f\u975e\u5e38\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u3002\n\n================================================================\n[h1][7.30 \u66f4\u65b0]\u8c08\u8c08\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c[/h1]\n\u5fc5\u987b\u5f97\u627f\u8ba4\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u6574\u4f53\u70d8\u6258\u51fa\u6765\u7684\u7d27\u5f20\u523a\u6fc0\u6c1b\u56f4\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u8ba9\u4eba\u6c89\u6d78\u5176\u4e2d\u3002\u968f\u7740\u4e0d\u65ad\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u6211\u610f\u5916\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u65f6\u4e0b\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\uff1a\n[list]\n[*]\u4e3b\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u652f\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u8ba9\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u4e86\u70b9RPG\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5473\u9053\n[*]\u641c\u96c6\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u5957\u88c5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u53c8\u8ba9\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u4e86\u70b9\u6c99\u76d2\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5473\u9053\n[*]\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u89e3\u8c1c\u73af\u8282\u96be\u5ea6\u9002\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u5927\u4e50\u8da3\u5728\u4e8e\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u201c\u9002\u5408\u201d\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u8fbe\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u3002\n[*]\u4e0d\u4f1a\u770b\u5230\u8840\u8165\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u66b4\u529b\u7684\u6740\u622e\uff0c\u53d6\u800c\u4ee3\u4e4b\u5f97\u662f\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5f00\u52a8\u8111\u7b4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b83\u5f88\u9002\u5408\u62ff\u6765\u548c\u5b69\u5b50\u6216\u5973\u670b\u53cb\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\u3002\n[*]\u636e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u900f\u9732\u76ee\u524dEA\u7248\u672c\u53ea\u5448\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7248\u768425% -

Story wise you basically wake up as a mouse in a prison and though travelling though the world you find out a bit more about the world around him...i'm mostly being vague about this because I want other people to discover the world though fresh eyes as I did and was pleasently suprised. Little things like having to use a light or a lantern to see dark areas, a day and night cycle, and beautiful visuals go a long way here.\n\n Story wise, the game is up there as I stated before I don't want to give too much away but the writing is actually pretty well done, with a good amount of lore for the world and I love how there's little notes anytime something is mentioned and should you want to know more about it, you push a button and a small bit of information on whatever it is comes up to help you understand. But that's not all, there's also the characters who for the most part fit their molds pretty well, keep in mind i've only played for about 4 hours and met a handful of the characters but all of them played their parts well enough ranging from mysterious, stoic, and even funny when it comes to two certain characters.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is pretty smooth, the controller set up is easy enough to get used to...i'm playing with a X1 controller so maybe you may have a different experince but for me personally I loved it, I love how you FEEL like a mouse as you play, the way your mouse stands, crawls around, and even weaves between enemies, small cracks, and more only serves to immerse you more in the world. Hell you literally have to use a little foot stool to get to open up taller cabinets and what not due to your miniture size, I'm sure for some people this may be a bit annoying but for me personally it only serves to hammer the fact that you're basically just a small ordinary (but adorable) mouse.\n\nTHATS NOT ALL FOR GAMEPLAY! There's alot little bit of somewhat light RPG elements where you can find little parts of costumes like a pirate, theif, or armor suits and if should you find all the pieces it gives you a lovely major stat bonus, even though using the costumes' individual parts do give you points...oh yeah...also....characters literally comment on what you're wearing or what time of the day it is, once again to some people that may be lame but for me that shows a lot of care and effort put into this game, espcially considering most RPG's or something where you can be dressed like a dork and basically still be taken serious, or go into someone's house at 3AM and still have a normal conversation...NOPE not in this game, I was told to take off my hat before talking to a character because it represented something he didn't respect, I was also told to come back in the morning due to one of the  quest givers being alseep.\n\nLook, we both know how Early Access goes, you buy it early, then you hope the devs update it often, but ultimately you know you're going to be getting some kind of junky product and still play with the raw state of the game....but let me tell you this game feel so good, i've been playing for 4 hours and I still find myself running all around the same places discovering little costume pieces I didn't find, or just juking guards until i decide to do some more quest.\n\n(Nothing funner than running around in circles around a guard and locking him in a room)\n\nAs you can tell, I really like this game, I'm glad it turned out good for an early access game, what the devs have here is something magical and meaningful, I can only hope th at the devs listen to fan feedback when it comes to bugs, but give as much love, care, and detail to every bit of the game that i've experienced so far, and are unshaking in their commitment to releasing a quality game.", "timestamp_created": 1469505995, "timestamp_updated": 1469506128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823034", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24529752": {"recommendationid": "24529752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079099879", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505065562}, "language": "english", "review": "Ghost of a Tale is an absolutely stunning piece of art; the aesthetic is breathtaking, the gameplay is tight and intuitive, and the storytelling is magical.

It as not, in fact it was far better. After six and a half hours, I've a few thoughts.\n\nWhat I expected was a pretty and gorgeous looking game and indeed it is that (my graphics card cried, but they are tears of happiness!). The motion blur feels well at home the animations of characters are smooth, expressive and in Tilo's case often adorable, and the surroundings are a breath of fresh air. In some ways I'm reminded of the painting-quality graphics you saw in point and click games or yore, yet fully rendered and animated wonderfully in 3D\n\nWhat I did not expect was the depth of the game itself. Each character feels different and you can understand them easily, in short they make sense (sometimes in their very quirky way, you fellow players know who I'm talking about~!). Throwaway comments often turn out to be interesting and important lore issues that thread into other characters and the storyline itself. I've heard mentions of several other places, with background and information attached, which makes me feel like I may actually end up playing there someday (If I ever stop skittering around this jail!). You can clearly feel the differences in personality in the species, and within each species the range of people there also. It can be subtle, and it can be noticeable, but it feels right. Some friendly characters I'd trust with, some I'd like to trust and some I'm a bit weary of. Then there's the one or two I'd not trust as far as Tilo can't throw them!\n\nwhen I first started playing this game, I was almost expecting a skyrim-level attention to detail with dungeons, specifically where you start. One small pass through, find interesting elements, move on. Boy was I wrong!  I've gone through the Jail nearly forty times, and each time I've spotted something I've missed, something obvious that I simply didn't expect or think about. Often times it's something plot-important that, as you would expect considering what it is, I simply overlooked. And when I find it, either my chance or by being told, it feels natural. \n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game enough. I've seen a lot of people say it makes them think of Dark Souls with a mouse. I can see where they care coming from, but I'd like to counter. With the details of the game down even to statistics Tilo has with different items equipped, I would say this is more the perfect mix of point and click, Tabletop RPG, and then yes, Dark Souls. It throws you into the game, is forbidding and tricky, but Ghost of a Tale is forgiving when you mess up, as long as you think like a mouse!\n\nI think I may be addicted, really can't wait to see what's beyond the walls of this jail!", "timestamp_created": 1469488716, "timestamp_updated": 1469488716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24527195": {"recommendationid": "24527195", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987664334", "num_games_owned": 570, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470086359}, "language": "english", "review": "Just saw this game in the Store, and fell instantly in love with it. Couldn't play too much, since it's almost midnight and I have to work tomorrow, but I want to leave a mark on the rating of the game, so here's a glimpse at what I saw in one hour spent with the game.\n\nIn short, the game is cute as f*** without being childish. I'm not too far in, so currently I can't say for sure if it was worth the price, but I recon that it was. So far it looks like a \"Thief light\" game without fighting; the protagonist mouse must sneak his way past enemies to find and rescue his wife, while completing various other quests, and then - judging from the \"intro\", a few words about a world changing event - he saves the world. Or not, that remains to be seen.\n\nThe graphics are solid; the screenshots tell the truth so if you find them appealing then you won't be disappointed. The characters are well done, the hero is maybe the cutest looking one this side of a children's game, the rat guards are cartoonishly menacing in their steel armor, and the frog pirate prisoner is... well, also cute as an antropomorph frog can be. Since this is also an XBox game there are not too many graphic options, but there are more than your average console port tends to have; you can toggle on/off a few effects and set the draw distance for shadows and lights. The framerate is solid for me on everything set to max, but I play on an R9 290X, so I assume I could provide relevant info about this if I have experienced slowdowns. Well, I haven't, so there's that. One thing to note: I have a 16:10 monitor and the resolution can not be set to 1680x1050, but there is an 1600x900 option, which will leave a thin black border on the top and bottom of the screen which does not refresh, so elements of the Steam overlay for example will \"freeze\" there. I don't mind it too much, but who knows what others will think.\n\nMusic is only in the main menu so far - a pleasant tune, starting out a bit sad, but getting more adventurous later -, but our mouse is a minstrel so that may change further in the game. As for the sound effects, they seem alright and fitting; the game starts in a prison and I haven't escaped yet, so I wouldn't give a final verdict on this either.\n\nThe controls are good, perfectly playable so far with mouse and keyboard, with invertable X and Y axis, and the game supports controllers. What a surprise, it's also on XBox. I must note that at some point in the beginning a tutorial pop-up tells you how to un/equip stuff and it shows the buttons on a controller, not the keyboard, but you can do this from the inventory too, so not a big deal. Other controls are configurable from the menu.\n\nThere are bugs, but it's still in EA, and in one hour I couldn't find anything gamebreaking. Once I was stuck for a few moments in an open doorway while sneaking, but that resolved itself without reloading. The list of things to say in a conversation can not be scrolled with the wheel on the mouse (other windows can be), but there's the slider on the side, so it's not a biggie either. Ah, scrolling. During conversation the footnotes (you'll know it when you see it) can turn up empty, but trying to scroll or click inside them should reveal the text. And just to be a jerk, I have to mention that I saw spelling errors/missing words here and there.\n\nAnother thing I think worth mentioning. Nowadays it is a custom in games where you have to pick up stuff to make these items glow, or stand out in some other way. Here you only get the item's name pop up when you're close enough and facing the item. I'm an older gamer so I'm used to no hand-holding, but maybe it would bother others. And before I forget: looting chests can be dangerous because I found one with a hornet's nest inside. Interestingly enough the hornets were kind enough to hurt me only when I looked into the chest, but left me alone when I actually hid in it from a rat guard...\n\nAll in all this seems to be a superb game with a great atmosphere, cute characters, quests to do and stuff to find.

The only flaws I can pick from this game are bugs, some minor like ui's laying over eachother wrong, but one I ran into was game breaking(recent update fixed this bug). All in all I say this is a good buy, but if you are worried about bugs ruining your experience wait a day or so, even then it seems the dev is working hard fixing problems that arise. Video review below: https://youtu.be/UJaANBV-Qx0\nLike the description of the game says, this is an action rpg game where you rely on stealth to get by. You're a little mouse dwarfed by rats. The game has 26 quest, involving multiple steps to complete. There are also some collectables in the form of costumes to find as well. The story is intriguing, and the characters you meet are fun as well. There is also controller support as well, but I have not used it so I cant review how well it works for controller, but keyboard and mouse work fine, although the game starts with the vertical axis of the mouse inverted which is a bit bizarre. You can tell alot of work has been put into this game, not only visually but in the little things. One of these things I enjoyed is the statistics tab which keeps track of things like playtime, times you've spooked a guard, and deaths.", "timestamp_created": 1469476900, "timestamp_updated": 1469476900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554054", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24524303": {"recommendationid": "24524303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126636269", "num_games_owned": 809, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469645265}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5c0f\u8001\u9f20\u597d\u53ef\u7231\u5c0f\u8001\u9f20\u597d\u53ef\u7231\u5c0f\u8001\u9f20\u597d\u53ef\u7231\n\u8fd9\u662f\u4e2a\u753b\u98ce\u7a0d\u5fae\u9ed1\u6697\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e3b\u89d2\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u56e0\u4e3a\u5565\u88ab\u6293\u8fdb\u4e86\u76d1\u72f1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6709\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u670b\u53cb\uff1f\uff08\u5927\u6982\u5427\uff09\uff0c\u7ed9\u4e86\u4f60\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u4f1a\u9003\u51fa\u76d1\u72f1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e3b\u89d2\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86\u5192\u9669\u4e4b\u8def\u3002\n\u597d\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8bf4\u4e0b\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u753b\u9762\u6bd4\u8f83\u7cbe\u7f8e\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u89e3\u5bc6\u4ee5\u53ca\u6f5c\u884c\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u53cb\u5584\u7684\u4e0d\u662f\u90a3\u79cd\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u5c31\u5b8c\u86cb\u7684\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f60\u98ce\u9a9a\u7684\u8d70\u4f4d\u6765\u7ed5\u8fc7\u8b66\u536b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5b58\u5728\u4e9b\u5c0f\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5f53\u4e3b\u89d2\u722c\u4e00\u4e9b\u9ad8\u53f0\u65f6\u4f1a\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u722c\u4e0a\u53bb\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5730\u4e0a\u7684\u5c0f\u866b\u4f1a\u88ab\u4f60\u60ca\u6270\u5230\u8fdc\u79bb\u4f60\uff0c\u5b88\u536b\u6293\u4f4f\u4f60\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4f1a\u628a\u4f60\u9ad8\u9ad8\u4e3e\u8d77\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u88ab\u70e7\u6b7b\u3002\u3002\u7136\u540e\u88ab\u70e7\u6b7b\u3002\u3002\u7136\u540e\u88ab\u70e7\u6b7b\u3002\u3002\u522b\u95ee\u6211\u4e3a\u5565\u8bf4\u4e86\u4e09\u904d\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u4e5f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u6536\u96c6\u8981\u7d20\u3002\n\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u4e0a\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u624b\u611f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u52fe\u9f20\u6807\u4e0a\u4e0b\u89c6\u89c9\u63a7\u5236\u98a0\u5012\u7684\u8bdd\u53ef\u80fd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8fd9\u4e48\u5bb9\u6613\u9002\u5e94\u5411\u4e0a\u79fb\u9f20\u6807\u5411\u4e0b\u770b\u8fd9\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u5c11\u8bb8\u7684\u89e3\u5bc6\u5143\u7d20\u4e0d\u592a\u96be\uff0c\u8b66\u536b\u4eec\u90fd\u662f\u5c0f\u804b\u778e\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u9664\u4e86\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u6309\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b58\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u8eb2\u8fdb\u53ef\u4ee5\u8eb2\u85cf\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u91cc\u9762\u4fdd\u5b58\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u662f\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u4fdd\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u610f\u5916\u7ffb\u8f66\u3002\n\u56e0\u4e3a\u53ea\u662f\u7a0d\u5fae\u7684\u73a9\u4e86\u4f1a\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5f88\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u4ecb\u7ecd\u3002\n\u8bc4\u5206 9/10  \u4e3a\u5565\u8981\u63a8\u8350\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5462\uff1f\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u503c\u5f97\u63a8\u8350\u3002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n7\u670826\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7a0d\u5fae\u52a0\u591a\u51e0\u53e5\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u8c8c\u4f3c\u662f\u6709\u7740\u4e9b\u804c\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5427\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u573a\u666f\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e5f\u53ef\u89c2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u62ff\u74f6\u5b50\u8d34\u8138\u7838\u5b88\u536b\u771f\u523a\u6fc0\uff01\n\u9644\u4e0a\u521d\u4f53\u9a8c\u5b9e\u51b5\nhttp://www.bilibili.com/video/av5495374/", "timestamp_created": 1469475977, "timestamp_updated": 1469537610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704229", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24523839": {"recommendationid": "24523839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007432032", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472516708}, "language": "english", "review": "After just over an hour with the early access, I am completely enchanted by this game, right from the moment \"\"Save Early, Save Often\" - An Old Mouse Proverb\" came up during a loading screen.\n\nAnd that's one of the major things that really stood out to me so far is just how well written it is, full of wit, charm and genuine laughs.

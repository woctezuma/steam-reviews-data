I constantly bump into customers. I have maybe a 40% chance of beating more than one level at a time. Probably less. \n\nSecond: I could not care less because literally everything about this game is just so freaking charming. The art, the gameplay, the music, the characters, the voice acting, all of it. Even when I'm failing my worst this game still makes me smile. Carrie is so cute, Calcia always cracks me up, the controls seem to work pretty well, the music is lively and lovely, the options menu is quite comprehensive. I love it all.\n\nMy only, and I do mean ONLY, problem is that a lot of the time when I minimize the game the sidebar icon disappears. The game is still going though, I can hear the music, so steam won't reopen it and I have to break out task manager.

You can either keep out of their way or you can spin past them. Spinning lets you pass through moving customers without being hit. Plates can be stacked together so you can serve multiple customers without having to go back to the counter after each one. There's powerups and hazards to keep aware of as well, plus dirty plates can be picked up and brought to the sink which improve your score but you can't carry food with them.\n\nThe graphics are great to look at, they are retro styled but you can tell what things are supposed to be and they have a smooth animation to them. Sounds let you know whats going on and are nice as well. The music is something I can listen to multiple times and still enjoy hearing it.\n\nHere's a list of positives I would like to mention.\n\n+The story is nice to have and although short and simple its entertaining for what it is.\n+A good amount of unlockables such as different outfits for Carrie and Calcia, one of which activates holiday mode making the restaurant have a christmas theme.\n+Endless mode lets you see how far you can go as the difficulty ramps up.\n+The addition of voice acting is a nice touch which I didn't expect (I consider this a positive, but I do admit that a few more voice lines would of been great).\n+A variety of settings available if needed to be changed.\n+Statistics to see your overall progress, like how many times you bumped into customers for example.\n+Leaderboards and Steam Achievements plus challenges offer many more hours of gameplay if you dare to take them on.\n\nIn my opinion the biggest plus in bonus content is that you can unlock and play as Calcia (the lobster girl behind the counter). I understand if this doesn't sound like such a big deal but the fact that they took the time and effort to make her even playable in the first place makes this a really cool feature. She plays similarly to Carrie but she is different enough that she gives a new experience to the game.\n\nOverall I think this game is well worth a try, especially for the content you're getting for the price.

There's also challenges for you to complete on each stage as well as a par time, which gives players a nice little additional challenge aside from the main gameplay.\n\nThe game has a pretty decent audio & visual style, which is somewhat reminiscent of classic NeoGeo arcade games, but with perhaps not the same level of quality in the pixel art. Still, for the price the art is better than expected, and the overall charm of the game's style is pretty nice, even though the voice clips wear out their welcome fairly quick.\n\nOverall, the game mechanics are nicely done and there's enough included here to be worth the purchase price.

To break it down in the simplest terms, you're in constant motion a la Pac-Man and have to serve customers their food without running into various obstacles.  The game has a three strikes and you're out set-up, though you can continue your progress from the most recent stage.  There's 20 stages in all and some endless mode levels.  The main 20 stages will likely take you 2-3 hours to beat.\n\nThe production values in this are surprisingly nice and much better than I'd would have expected for such a cheap game.  Visuals are very charming and detailed and probably the best aspect of CUO.  There's a lot of character in the spritework.  Music and sound effects are good, too.  The picking up of plates and serving food sound effects have a very satisfying [i]clank[/i].  The only noticeable flaw production-wise is the minor amount of voice acting is kind of pitchy, and the lobster character's voice isn't too good.\n\nAs for the gameplay, my biggest complaint would be that levels where you have to deal with more verticality over horizontality can be annoying since you end up running into customers in near blind-sided situations.  I preferred the levels where you could see most of the map and had more side to side action than up and down.  One other thing I would have like to seen would be a couple more power-ups.  There's only two (I think) and the speed boost is honestly more harmful than helpful.  The general gameplay loop is fine but a couple of extra boosts would of been appreciated, especially since the difficulty ramps up in the last handful of stages.\n\nIf you're interested in some casual and fun arcade gameplay, Carrie's Order Up! serves up some impressive production values for a 2.99 title and I'd be interested in future games by the developer.", "timestamp_created": 1490503589, "timestamp_updated": 1490503780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30230779": {"recommendationid": "30230779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368115520", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488263469}, "language": "english", "review": "A super sweet game!

It never quite felt frustrating and even when things get frantic in the dining floor, it keeps its fun feel and seeing all of the unique customers pour in makes you think on the fly. Some customers are too big to spin past, some are faster than others, some are more impatient for their food, and when they all start pouring in at once, it all leads up to a pretty challenging yet fun run. It even has extra costumes and an extra character you can unlock! I won't spoil too much, but definitely pick this game up!

It\u2019s cute and cheery, but sometimes unnecessarily challenging due to some game mechanics that may break the game for those who aren\u2019t hard core fans of this genre.[/h1]\n\n.Story.\n\nThe campaign features the story of Carrie, a pink humanoid crab (I had to look at the Steam page because this isn\u2019t immediately obvious) who runs a humble little diner alongside her red humanoid lobster friend, Calcia. The place is going under\u2014no pun intended despite the aquatic theme\u2014and it\u2019s up to you to rake in enough funds to stop that from happening. You\u2019ll have a week (and 20 stages) to do so. To complete a stage, all you have to do is make an assigned amount of money and avoid getting three warnings (more on this later).\n\n.Gameplay.\n\nThe name of the game is speed and quick reflexes. You control Carrie via the arrow keys, making your way down the narrow aisles between tables and trying not to knock into your patrons while you serve food and collect dirty dishes. The little crab lass never loses forward momentum, so you\u2019ll really only be making turns and twirling. You can tap spacebar to spin, which will allow you to move past diner patrons without knocking them over, or hold it to dash.\n\nYour guests are nautical in nature and adorable to boot. They\u2019ll walk, hop, and slither around, getting in your way at every chance before finally taking a seat and demanding food in the form of a word bubble with a picture of the desired menu item. It\u2019s your job to speed your way over to the counter, where Calcia will place completed orders, still avoiding other diners who have yet to seat themselves, pick up the food, and bring it to the correct person. You do so simply by walking past them and you\u2019ll deliver the dishes in the same way.  There\u2019s no possible way to bring orders to the wrong patrons, either, because Carrie will only place it down in front of the diner who wants it.\n\nAfter your diner has eaten, they\u2019ll get up to exit and leave a dirty dish behind. This is your chance to make a little bonus cash as you can zip by, pick them up, and deposit them into a sink for washing.\n\nI found this to be more irritating than anything because you can only carry dirty dishes [i]or[/i] orders. If you happen to pick up a dirty dish, you are committed to carrying it back to the sink whether or not your patrons are getting impatient. \n\nA lot of the times my guest ran out were a direct result of my having to run over to the sink because I had accidentally run past a cleared plate.\n\nWhile this may not seem like a big deal, it swiftly becomes one once you take into account the fact that a patron leaving results in a warning. You know the old saying \u201cthree strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d? The same is true here: if you get three warnings, your run ends and you gather up whatever cash you\u2019ve earned. This will prove problematic for those trying to get a high score.\n\nIf you run into three guests, that results in a single warning.\n\nIf you\u2019re clumsy and slip on some of the obstacles that are introduced later in the game, you get a warning.\n\nThe game could have done without some of these elements as they hinder the speed and fluidity of a game that\u2019s meant to have a frantic pace.\n\nThere are two difficulties of campaign: arcade and friendly.\n\nArcade keeps track of your score and allows you to complete challenges like \u201cno warnings,\u201d \u201ccollect all coins,\u201d and \u201cfinish in x amount of time.\u201d This version is for those who want to challenge themselves to the true arcade experience. There\u2019s no room for errors because a warning will clear out your diner instantly and you\u2019ll have to wait for more hungry patrons to file in. You\u2019ll also be able to complete challenges for bonus score. Aside from that, it\u2019s your typical three strike deal, after which your score is recorded and can be labeled in the classic arcade style\u2014with your initials.\nKeep in mind that there are no online leaderboards so you\u2019ll only be seeing your scores listed under \u201chigh scores\u201d in the menu.\n\nFriendly is a little more forgiving, as getting a warning allows the business day to progress as usual. All of the other aspects are present in both modes, with one being a little kinder about mistakes and lacking challenges. This mode also does not record your score.  \n\nFinally, you have endless mode\u2026 Which is exactly as it sounds: you keep playing until you\u2019ve had enough. There\u2019s nothing more to it. You do get to choose a location, which is a nice way to mix up the appearance of your diner. More locations can be unlocked.\n\n.Pros.\n[list][*]Cutesy graphics.\n[*]Unlockables that come naturally by collecting money in any game mode on either difficulty.\n[*]Choosing a dress for Carrie results in a whole new look for the diner. If you choose the Holiday dress, for example, the menu changes to hot chocolate, gingerbread men, and the like and your patrons will sport spiffy winter gear.\n[*]An easy mode option.\n[*]Challenging despite simplistic gameplay.\n[*]An endless mode. This will only be a good thing for some.[/list]\n\n.Cons.\n[list][*]The ability to bump into diners is annoying. It slows down an otherwise fast-paced game and sometimes makes it impossible to deliver orders in a timely manner to a more impatient diner.\n[*]Gameplay is not very engaging, requiring only that you turn and spin.\n[*]The campaign doesn\u2019t tell much of a story. It\u2019s just a collection of random events.\n[*]No online leaderboard.[/list]\n\n.Bottom line.\nIf you\u2019re into arcade games and/or Diner Dash, this game is worth a shot. If you weren\u2019t already a fan of like titles, this game probably won\u2019t change your mind. It\u2019s cute and charming and the cosmetic changes activated by the way you dress Carrie are a nice touch, but there are little things gameplay-wise that are more frustrating than challenging.", "timestamp_created": 1479108743, "timestamp_updated": 1479108755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26521630": {"recommendationid": "26521630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040884867", "num_games_owned": 1268, "num_reviews": 663, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478126924}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][i]Carrie's Order Up![/i] is a fun little mashup of [i]Diner Dash[/i] and something akin to [i]Pac-Man[/i].[/b] There is enough complexity to keep you going for a couple of hours, if you really get into it.

Absolutely worth the $2.99 price-tag; maybe even more.\n\nWhile the game may seem simple on the surface, there are actually a little bit of strategy in delivering food to hungry customers. Not only do the variety of colorful customers add to the game's charm, they also have different properties. There are standard customers, fast customers (will walk down aisles VERY quickly and demand their food be served quicker, too), impatient customers (walk at a normal pace, but wil quickly leave if not promptly served their food), and large customers (walk very slowly down aisles and will deplete more of your spin). Having to deal with all of these customer types at once makes the game challenging, but never too frustrating.\n\nThere are only a couple things I don't like about this game: First, there seem to be a few minor bugs. Alternate costume unlocks were given to be before I had legitimately earned them, and on very rare occasions I can phase through tables (I think this has to do with taking corners while spinning past customers, but I'm unsure). At the time of writing, fullscreen mode looks a bit ugly on widescreen monitors, too; the big black bars along the sides of the game could've been replaced by simple wallpaper or tile textures.

While treading through the wave of filth, I stumbled upon this little diamond in the rough. I'll be honest, it was solely the game's art style that brought me over.  I was intrigued by the game's concept, it reminded me of Diner Dash, a Ds game I used to play a lot.  I decided to give this game my support, something this game was the first to receive from me, and currently the only game I've supported on the workshop.  After a few days, I completely forgot about this game.  A couple of days ago, I received an email from Steam telling me that this game was released, and you bet that I went and bought it...                                A few days later. What!? I'm a busy guy.  Carrie's Order up is visual porn, every little aspect of the game looks beautiful, from the retro-like cutscenes, to the little idle dance Carrie does, to the illustrations shown on the main menu.  It's obvious the artist behind this game has a large amount of talent and creativity.  The gameplay is similar to Pac-Man, with the player movie Carrie through a maze-like area while avoiding customers (ghosts).  What separates this game from Pac-Man is the fact that Carrie never stops moving, forcing the player to constantly paying full attention. Unlike Pac-man, however, Carrie can go past customers by spinning, but don't think you can get away with spinning past every enemy, as Carrie will get dizzy and eventually fall if you spin too much. The music in this game is also very well done, almost never getting too repetitive, and even if it does get repetitive, you can always change the music in the pause menu.  Despite all the positives this game has, there are a few negatives, but when I say few, I mean the very VERY little nitpicks I have. The voice acting in this game feels a bit unnatural and can sound a little strange at times, a few more takes could have helped a bit.  While the characters in this game are very charming, dialog between them can be awkwardly worded and feel a bit odd, but that will probably be a problem only I will have.\nAll in all I feel that this game is very addictive, fun and perfect for people who don't have time to play any major releases.", "timestamp_created": 1473897526, "timestamp_updated": 1473989383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661345", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25500665": {"recommendationid": "25500665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009802063", "num_games_owned": 2527, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498653500}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic little arcade-style game. Simple, fast, challenging, colourful play. If you're looking at this game and thinking this is yet another Diner Dash type game, you would be wrong. It's not a time management style game at all. \n\nIt's a challenging old school maze game that's suited for twitchy play. You need to avoid the path of the customers in the shop as you serve them, and must serve them the food they ordered before they get angry. \n\nSo think more like... Pacman's maze and enemy-avoiding gameplay (but executed much better imo)... crossed with the fast-paced grabbing-orders-from-wherever-to-serve-quick-to-anger-customers of Midway's Tapper, then crossed with the matching orders to customers and collecting dirty dishes from games like Diner Dash. I also find myself thinking of an old LCD game I used to own, called \"Coffee House\" by Sunwing.\n\nBeautifully detailed cute retro art style, reminiscent of Taito arcade games of the late 1990s (think Puzzle Bobble 4). Your score when you get game over contributes towards unlockables, so that's a neat touch too.

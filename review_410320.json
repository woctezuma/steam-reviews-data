The graphics look like they're from the PS3 era (they technically are, since this is a port) and the UI looks weird. What may have attracted the users attention is the large spawns of bugs and aliens.  But once i finally found the will to buy the game the first level wasn't really surprising, as it did what most people said. You shot alot of giant ants until they were dead. Not necessarily underwhelming, but not the most fun ever. I decided to bear through the first couple of levels, But somehow, i was hooked and kept on coming back for more of the hectic shooter that i at first thought was a little boring. \n\nAfter a few levels it introduces a new enemy type, and even though i am not too far into the game, each new unit was different from the last and was fun to fight against. They are all unique in their own way and the best way it introduces it to you is pretty much the only way it does it, by shoving alot of them into your face. It was also fun to play a game where it seemed like the odds were stacked against you tenfold, but you somehow scrape it through while looking cool at the same time. \n\nMost of the game you will spend playing as 4 different characters. The Ranger, The Air Raider, the Wing Diver, and the Lancer. I won't explain these to you myself, as it is fun to experiment and play is different characters depending on what mission you're playing (or what you're comfortable playing with.) They are all unique in their own way and have cool designs. \n\nShooting any enemy units is a blast and is very satisfiying to do (which is good, since its the only thing you do). Using any explosives is in my opinion the most satisfiying as shooting them into a group of units turns them into dust. Even shooting the tougher units is fun as it is satisfying to  see them being destroyed after all the firepower they've taken.\n\nWhat most people like to talk about is the multiplayer, which in my opinion is the greatest aspect of this game. Although its hard to convince your friends to get a 60 dollar game about shooting ants, playing with more than one player is a blast as it is fun to kick ass with your friends. Sometimes its fun to have someone having your back as you're able to be trapped and caught by some of the enemy units, and they're able to save you.\n\nThe final thing i would like to talk about is the dialogue and plot. This game doesn't take itself seriously, so their plot is usually over the top and i enjoy that. I think that the voice actors were really bad, but somehow that added to the charm of the game. The lines they read with the voices they were making, it sounded like they were just having a good time making every aspect of this game. The lines were very cheesy and sometimes they were so bad that they gave me a good chuckle and some times. The voices sound exactly as what the voices of a dubbed anime would sound like, and i think that its fitting because this game seems to scream Japanese.\n\nSo for the final verdict, i would give this an 8/10. (a 7/10 if you buy it for 60$) as it has very fun gameplay, is repetitive (in a good way), has fun and cheesy dialogue and story which all fit into a fun timewaster which can, if you play it enough, get you absolutely hooked for possibly hours on end. I'd say to definitely get this on sale, as it seems like it isn't really worth it for 60$. It's very fun on its own, but is more fun if you play it with a friend.

behaviour\" in the compatibility settings of the executable), super weird controlling scheme (it'll take a while to get used to using WASD for moving through menus) and all that.\n\nIt feels like

That's the flexibility of EDF 4.1\n\nMany people have said that this is one of those \"So bad it's good\" games, but I couldn't disagree more. Sure the dialogue is absolutely abysmal at points, but when it comes to how the game plays, it hardly matters, and more feels like watching a poorly dubbed anime (with the whole translation thing basically making it exactly that). EDF's trick is throwing you in with a load of nonsensical enemies to shoot. The graphics, plotline, and previously mentioned dialogue aren't anything revolutionary, but gunning down 100s of giant insects in one of the 89 available missions is an amazing feeling. EDF is all about scale. Those giant transport ships dropping in more enemies, they're not in the skybox, they're tangible, you can hit them, you can land on them. Having something that isn't just scenery and is actually interactable is an amazing relief from what most games of the like do nowadays with ships and the like.\n\ntl;dr: the shit is big and you can blow it up, buy it", "timestamp_created": 1515178176, "timestamp_updated": 1515178176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39087280": {"recommendationid": "39087280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100456147", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 915, "last_played": 1515866479}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u571f\u732b\u6536\u5175", "timestamp_created": 1515166589, "timestamp_updated": 1515166589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39081245": {"recommendationid": "39081245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175000315", "num_games_owned": 4824, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 204, "last_played": 1515249738}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e01\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e36\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e34\u0e07 \u0e22\u0e34\u0e07 \u0e22\u0e34\u0e07 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e47\u0e22\u0e34\u0e07 \u0e2a\u0e32\u0e14\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e34\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e44\u0e23\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e01\u0e47\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e22\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e27\u0e07\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e01\u0e47\u0e42\u0e04\u0e15\u0e23\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e4c\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e01\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e19\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e22\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e42\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e14 \"Inferno\" \u0e19\u0e30 \u0e1e\u0e35\u0e48\u0e01\u0e30\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e04\u0e19\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e42\u0e0b\u0e42\u0e25\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e14\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e21 5555555\n\n\u0e04\u0e30\u0e41\u0e19\u0e19\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e01\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22 8/10\n\u0e15\u0e31\u0e14\u0e40\u0e01\u0e23\u0e14\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e04\u0e40\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e43\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21 \u0e1a\u0e27\u0e01\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e22\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e30\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e02\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e46\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e40\u0e09\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e30\u0e40\u0e2e\u0e25\u0e34\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e40\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c 5555", "timestamp_created": 1515153353, "timestamp_updated": 1515153353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39078469": {"recommendationid": "39078469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378008738", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1737, "last_played": 1515917791}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome, the trailers and the game are so funny.\nSo glad they made this series available on PC! :D\nJapan is great <3", "timestamp_created": 1515145453, "timestamp_updated": 1515145453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39072907": {"recommendationid": "39072907", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992054913", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 270, "last_played": 1515914428}, "language": "english", "review": "I SO much wanted to give a postive review, because initially (both in single and multi player) the game seems awesome enough to overlook the ridiculous menu system and many glitches and bugs. But I quickly found that there are just SO many problems with this game that I have to write something to try to offset the wildly, ridiculously positive reviews it gets. Do NOT be sucked in by the \"overwhelmingly positive\" reviews unless you have carefully read the following. Then, if you're still enthusiastic to buy it, more power to you. Meanwhile, you fanbois who will bash on me for this review, well, that rolls off my back, because this opinion is carefully thought out after approaching 100 hours of game-play.\n\n1) The ridiculous clipping issues are completely untenable. As just one example, there are multiple levels in which you fight giant spiders that fire web strands. If they catch you in these strands, they drag you toward them, doing lots of damage to you as you are dragged. You can shoot these stands to break them, but it takes a lot of firepower to do it. But the spiders can somehow \"sense\" where you are, through buildings and even through entire MOUNTAINS. So, you repeatedly find yourself in a situation where you cannot even SEE the spiders, much less fire on them. Yet, they are able to web you and start dragging you... THROUGH a mountain or building that can't be destroyed. So, you will die because you can't even get one shot at these things, yet they can pin you against the side of a building or mountain, just tearing you up, and you're helpless. Worse is when two  or more work on you together, which often happens. So, as you're trying to get free of one web, you're just caught in another, dragging you two directions and doing tremendous damage to you. Die, and die again. Restart the map, and restart again. RIDICULOUS!!! YOU can't see through a mountain, so they shouldn't be able either. YOU can't fire through a mountain, so they shouldn't be able to either. And this is just one example of clipping issues that will kill you countless times.\n\n2) This is worse than Starship Troopers, where you're perpetually asking the question, \"WHY am I forced to take on waves of giant insects while armed with a peashooter? Ohhh... but you can gain better weapons as you win missions. Except that very quickly you start seeing the exact same drops again and again. There are dozens of weapons for your class that you'll never see, but you'll see the same lame-azz weapons mission after mission.\n\nOhhh... the \"fix\" is that you're supposed to \"farm\" for better weapons by playing missions on \"hard\" or \"hardest\" or \"inferno,\" so that you get better and better weapons that drop on those levels of difficulty.\n\nExcept that you have the same problem as before: The SAME weapons keep dropping, so you have, like, one barely-decent rocket launcher and one barely-decent shotgun, with all the rest of your weapon possibilities being garbage. And all the really awesome weapons you read about never drop. You are ALWAYS and ridiculously underpowered!\n\nDo NOT believe the fanbois that will claim that you just have to keep \"farming.\" What they are really saying is: \"I endured the GRIND, so YOU should have to also.\" So, be aware, this game has GRIND like you'll rarely see! If you have countless hours of your life to devote to just this game, and you enjoy, I mean ENJOY, playing the SAME mission again and again and again and again and again and....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nagain and again and again and.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nagain and again....\n\njust to try to get some decent weapons, then, by all means, you'll LOVE this game!\n\nNormal people, however, and those who also live a real life outside of mommy's basement, quickly find the absurdity of the weapons progression to be, well, absurd!\n\n3) Everything I've said thus far concerns single-player. A whole new level of absurdity is achieved in multiplayer. There, you have both armor and weapon-level limits for each mission. These limits ALWAYS put you at a radical disadvantage! For two-player, the mobs get 1.8 times harder to kill. Yet, now, you are weapons-level limited, so it's even harder to kill them. Furthermore, the number of mobs doesn't scale reasonably, so it feels exponentially harder in multiplayer!\n\nOhhh, you want to uncheck the two checkboxes that would allow you to NOT have armor and weapons-level limits? Sure you do, but you can't. Those are LOCKED. How do you unlock them? Well.... Brace yourself....\n\nALL you have to do is complete a net-total of 70% of the game including all four character classes. That's it. Just play about (no kidding) 1200 hours of (mostly repetitive) multiplayer (much of which is to farm weapons), about 350 completed missions, with all of the character classes, and you can finally \"earn\" the privilege of unlocking those checkboxes and thereby finally be able to bring your best weapons into the fights.\n\nOhhh, but you'll still have the problem you had from single-player: You CAN'T get those better weapons without farming in the harder modes.\n\nYou thought that \"normal\" was hard? Ha! Silly you! Normal ain't anything! You want to just enjoy some casual play, thinking that \"hard\" means hard, and \"inferno\" is for the hard-core fanbois that have nothing better to do with their lives than feel like \"winners\" because they can beat \"inferno\" levels? Sorry, there really IS NO NORMAL! \"Normal\" is very hard!\n\nEven \"normal\" is FAR from reasonable. The higher missions (85+) are just INSANELY, STUPIDLY hard, even on \"normal.\" And why? Well, because, see above. YOU didn't invest 500+ hours into farming weapons on the off chance that you'd get one of the rare drops that gives you a semi-decent weapon. So, you'll wade into battle with your peashooters and have to hit the mobs 2 to 100 times (no kidding) to kill them. Meanwhile, hundreds of them are swarming you, and you're overwhelmed.\n\nThis is worse that Serious Sam, because you don't just respawn and keep going. In THIS game, you die and you must restart the whole mission.\n\nAgain and again and again and again....\n\nWell, I did that \"again\" bit to you once for effect, but, seriously, I cannot BEGIN to do justice to how RELENTLESS the \"again\" in this game is! You have never seen grind like this before; I sure haven't!\n\nSo, here's the deal. The game is a rip-off at $30! It's an insane rip-off at full price. At, maybe, $5, the average gamer is going to get enough value out of it. But you have to ask yourself ONE question....\n\nAre you a HARD-CORE shooter who lives in mommy's basement and has nothing better to do with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours to just TRY to get decent enough weapons to progress, or are you a more casual gamer who likes to play other games and has a REAL life?\n\nPut another way: Is your entire identity wrapped up in beating games like this, or is your identity wrapped up in REAL-world accomplishments and relationships?\n\nIf you answer \"yes\" to the former half of those two questions, then this game is for YOU, and you will derive great personal satisfaction out of knowing that you are just WAY more bad-azz (as a gamer) than people like me who complain about the weapons-progression system and grind. If you answer \"yes\" to the latter half of those questions, then STAY AWAY, because this game is soul-sucking in its relentlessly overwhelming difficulty and grind. It is NOT fun to die continually on the \"harder\" missions, all the while being absurdly underpowered, and where the ONLY \"answer\" you'll hear is \"farm for better weapons.\" And you'll just \"love\" almost beating one of the harder missions (after trying dozens of times) and find that the game glitches, one or more of your partners are disconnected, and you're left alone.\n\nI really could go on and on. There are multiple other things about the bugs, the glitches, the HORRENDOUS menu system, and much more. But you have been warned. There is one primary sort of gamer that this game will appeal to.

Deine Aufgabe: Mit allen zur Verf\u00fcgung stehenden Mitteln die Invasoren abwehren.\n\nSo gibt es vier Klassen. Der normale Soldat (Ranger), der Unterst\u00fctzer (Air Raider), der Tank (Fencer) und die Fliegerin (Wing Diver).\n\nAm Anfang ist dein Arsenal ziemlich sperrlich. Lediglich hat man nur ein Sturmgewehr und einen Raketenwerfer zur verf\u00fcgung. Jedoch mit jedem Level werden neue Waffen Freigeschaltet. Der Unterst\u00fctzer kann sp\u00e4ter riesige Mechs und Panzer als Unterst\u00fctzung aufs Feld anfordern. Die Fliegerin heizt mit ihrem Jetpack durch die L\u00fcfte und schie\u00dft Blitze. Der Tank hat eine dicke R\u00fcstung an und benutzt Schwere Waffen wie eine Gatling um den Feind einzuheizen. Der Soldat ist die Ausgewogenste Klasse zwischen Feuerkraft und Schnelligkeit.\n\nDer Clue an diesem Spiel ist das es herrlich am\u00fcsant ist mit allen Mitteln den Feind aufzuhalten. So werden ganze St\u00e4te in Schutt und Asche gelegt um die Insekten zu vernichten. Wer fordet nicht gerne einen Satiletenschlag al la C&C auf eine Einfamilienhaus gro\u00dfe Spinne an? Oder Boxt mit einem riesen Mecha auf den kleinen Bruder von Godzilla?\n\nLangzeitspa\u00df ist auch gegeben. So gibt es ca. 100 Missionen in denen man den Invarsoren zusetzen kann. Durch die verschiedenen Schwirigkeitsstufen, die Vielen Waffen, die vier Klassen und die vielfalt der Feinde, bringt es immer Spa\u00df eine Mission nochmal zu spielen.\n\nEin Manko ist die Steuerung. W\u00e4hrend man zwar \u00fcber die Einstellung in der Exe Datei die Steuerung wieder auf normal stellen kann, ist das Helikopter fliegen eine Qual. Ich habe noch nie so eine schlecht implementierte Steuerung erlebt wie hier beim Helikopter.\n\nIch kann dieses Spiel nur empfehlen. Es bringt Spa\u00df und ist sehr humorvoll gestaltet. Jedem Frischling kann ich nur empfehlen den Multiplayer Modus zu spielen. Es wird einem nicht nur sehr geholfen, der Loot wird auch fair geteilt, darum lohnt sich egoistisches Spielen nicht. Man wird eher nur aufgefressen und stirbt,\n\n\nAbschlie\u00dfend bleibt mir nur eines zu sagen:\n\nEDF!! EDF!!

If the game can be bought for $35 or less than I'd say go for it. The gameplay is fun, although sometimes monotonous. The game's single player 'career mode' progresses through a series of missions, and you pick the one of four classes and their respective weapons loadouts to complete the missions. However, the game is best played with others, be it online multiplayer or split-screen. Unfortunately, many weapons and even one of the four classes is useless when playing alone, because they require multiple people to operate. The game's mini map is a little inadequate, so when progressing through a level it becomes easy to backtrack or lose sense of direction. All in all, a good game to kick back and play with your buddys, and a decent game to burn some time when playing alone.", "timestamp_created": 1514522522, "timestamp_updated": 1514522522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38802968": {"recommendationid": "38802968", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996052806", "num_games_owned": 713, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514180850}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u904a\u6232\u7d50\u69cb\u76f8\u7576\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\u904a\u6232\n\u9078\u89d2 \u9078\u6b66\u5668 \u9078\u4efb\u52d9 \u9032\u5834 \u9032\u5165\u6df7\u6c8c\n\u7c21\u55ae \u66b4\u529b\n\u62ef\u6551\u5e02\u6c11 \u62b5\u6297\u5916\u661f\u751f\u7269 \n\u5c31\u662fEDF \n\u5c31\u662f\u5730\u7403\u9632\u885b\u8ecd \nEDF\uff01 EDF\uff01 EDF \uff01", "timestamp_created": 1514513974, "timestamp_updated": 1514513974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38801762": {"recommendationid": "38801762", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966045726", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 107, "last_played": 1516250939}, "language": "english", "review": "Large Variety of Weaponry: check.  \nDifferent Classes: check.  \nScreen full of bugs: check.  \nLoads o' Fun: check.\n\n10/10 - Would check all the boxes again.", "timestamp_created": 1514510886, "timestamp_updated": 1514510886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38771579": {"recommendationid": "38771579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066167123", "num_games_owned": 454, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509773730}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1514449489, "timestamp_updated": 1514449489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.398791", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38767902": {"recommendationid": "38767902", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995452258", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1515809740}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, my friends all got this from the winter sale and sang its praises to me. I said \"looks fun, but I dunno if I'll spend 30 bucks on it.\" So one of my friends got it for me. Would I have spent 30 bucks? Kinda? In terms of Fun\u2122 it's definitely worth it, but if you want a polished game experience, look elsewhere.\n\nGameplay is sorta like Serious Sam in that it's a shooter based around taking on huge mobs of enemies. Each mission's objective (at least 40 missions in) is to exterminate all GIANT INSECTS/Robots/Monsters/whatever on the map. You have 3 fun classes and the Ranger, who is effective but isn't as exciting due to a lack of gimmicks.\n-Ranger has consistent ground mobility and pretty standard weapons like rifles and grenade launchers. Still decently fun, if a bit... unimaginitive I guess?\n-Wing Diver gets a jetpack as well as a host of laser/plasma weapons. Really cool to float around the combat area while exterminating bugs with her ridiculous weapons\n-Air Raider is a support class who can call in air strikes and vehicles. He also has stuff like laser guiding kits and mines but who would use that stuff when you can just nuke the enemy or call in a Gundam?\n-Fencer is essentially a Warhammer 40k Terminator. You choose 4 weapons which are wielded in pairs. These include shields, greatswords, gatling guns, high caliber cannons, shoulder mounted mortars, and more. While slow, a skilled player can make the Fencer dance around the battlefield with dashes and animation cancelling. My personal favorite class, with Air Raider at a close second.\n\nThis game is so jank that it loops back around to being charming. Story is laughably bad, probably on purpose. Dialogue is the exact same - nobody can accidentally write something this awful. Graphics look like something out of 2006, probably so the game doesn't implode when you have to fight 200 ants at the same time. The only ACTUAL flaw is the underground missions due to the darkness and close quarters.\n\nAnd the game isn't just piss easy. You play through the game on normal, and then the REAL game begins. The enemies are tougher, but your arsenal just gets better and better. Tactics and teamwork actually matter.\n\nOverall, EDF is an exceptional game. Definitely buy it if you love having Fun\u2122, but if you want a serious game with cutting edge graphics, emergent AI, all the bells and whistles, stay away. You'll probably like this game anyway, though.", "timestamp_created": 1514439127, "timestamp_updated": 1514439127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474954", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38759586": {"recommendationid": "38759586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031675374", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514935160}, "language": "english", "review": "There was some...

How this slipped under the radar until now is beyond me, but you owe it to yourself to get this game, find a friend, and slog through it. It's wonderful.\n\nI can't believe how good this game is. I laughed at them asking for $50 for about a year, given the dated visuals and lack of presentation...but I finally bit on the $30 sale, and the sheer gameplay depth here is astonshing. Don't be fooled, the game does look like it's straight out of the early X360 days (because it is), the story and voice acting is B-movie at best, and playing this with anything other than a gamepad is essentially lunacy.\n\nBut the sheer variety in classes and their loadouts is what kept me in this game. I've never seen another game like this diversify gameplay across four classes so well - you've got a mix of bullet hell and tactical shooter in the Ranger, the Wing Diver is essentially half resource management and half Mercy, the Fencer gets to act like he's either in Armored Core or he's Reinhardt, and the Air Raider gets to call in tactical nukes, mechs, bombing runs, and file paperwork.\n\nCo-op play is a must for this game. Find another person to bring along with you at a minimum - this game is nothing but a disappointment alone. The classes were built to work with each other, and most of them aren't as effective without support in some fashion.\n\nIt's not a perfect game by any means - for every great gameplay decision they seem to make a terrible one, and the console port isn't without its flaws. It's a game not meant to be taken wholly seriously, although there is plenty of room for tactical play if you're into it. (Most of my complaints actually stem from the in-game menus and matchmaking - stuff easily overlooked once you're in the thick of it.)\n\nOverall? It's highly worth it if you like the sound of a co-op shooter with depth, lots of explosions, and hilarity. If you're on the edge, get it on sale, but I honestly think the $50 they ask for it isn't out of the question.

Due to the 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews, I was expecting EDF:IA with better graphics and more fun.  That's clearly not the case. If you liked any aspect of EDF:IA, do NOT buy this game.\n\nThis game is clearly a console port.  From the intro game screens, it detects that you're playing with a kb/m but it doesn't show a mouse cursor. You're expected to scroll the mouse up & down & sideways like you would a joystick controller. That control method extends to all of the game dialog boxes.  For someone used to a real kb/m game, it is disconcerting.\n\nOn the surface, the graphics are amazing. However, after playing a bit, you see the shearing & insides of ants/buildings as you're bounced around.\n\nThe real dealbreaker is the movement speed.  The chars move extremely SLOWLY compared to the rest of the environment. For a game that gives every appearance of being a fast paced, arcade style shooter, this is very disappointing. The only char with any decent movement speed is the Flyer and, as expected, you can only use that in limited bursts.\n", "timestamp_created": 1513995167, "timestamp_updated": 1513995167, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.392162", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38555030": {"recommendationid": "38555030", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999922709", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514352906}, "language": "english", "review": "Best in coop mode!", "timestamp_created": 1513988354, "timestamp_updated": 1513988354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38554651": {"recommendationid": "38554651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353175307", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514436610}, "language": "english", "review": "Giant Bugs, Godzilla like Monsters and Mechs.", "timestamp_created": 1513987387, "timestamp_updated": 1513987387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38539365": {"recommendationid": "38539365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027636755", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2994, "last_played": 1516440495}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u9019\u500b\u904a\u6232\u975e\u5e38\u9069\u5408\u5bb9\u6613\u4e0a\u624b\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6 \u88e1\u9762\u904a\u6232\u7684\u5167\u5bb9+\u53ef\u4ee5\u7dda\u4e0a\u9023\u7dda\u5408\u4f5c\u904a\u6232\u4e5f\u7d66\u5927\u5bb6\u6709\u6a02\u8da3\n\n\u9084\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u6234\u5177+\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u4f86\u73a9\u60f3\u5fc5\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f88\u4e0d\u932f \n\n\u4e5f\u80fd\u5e0c\u671b\u8a72\u904a\u6232\u958b\u767c\u516c\u53f8\u80fd\u7d66\u73a9\u5bb6\u5011\u7b49\u5f855\u4ee3STEAM\u7248\u672c\u7684\u5230\u4f86", "timestamp_created": 1513958628, "timestamp_updated": 1513958628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38530716": {"recommendationid": "38530716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002509325", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 14083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1398, "last_played": 1516404551}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\uff25\uff24\uff26\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1513947028, "timestamp_updated": 1513947028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492308", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38528223": {"recommendationid": "38528223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194067053", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515088356}, "language": "english", "review": "it's like One-Punch Man but without Saitama Himself\nGameplay is Awesome and looks like Lost Planet Series\nPlayer Animations are awesome i think they motion captured them\nMaps are awesome and shows Japan cities and lands like Japan Simulator or Google Earth\nU can sing songs while killing monsters\nu can summon gundams OwO\nCons-\nMonsters Are WAY TOO MUCH HUGE\n", "timestamp_created": 1513943158, "timestamp_updated": 1513943158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649826", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38527226": {"recommendationid": "38527226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082629280", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514115868}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing this game for quite a while, I would say you should definitely get it if you have friends willing to get it as well. Beyond that, it's worth many, many hours of gameplay. There'e just a few problems with the game. \n\nFirst, the game has a sort of infinite scaling thing for your health. you have to pick up 'armor' drops from fights that drop from enemies. It doesn't even explain how exactly this works, as you can collect 30 armor crates and it will increase your armor by like, 3, which is your max health. Now you're talking about a game where you start with like 200 hp. \n\nSecond, that brings me to another issue, which is the difficulty. You could try to use the 'git gud' argument but that doesn't work here. Many enemies either use overwhelming numbers where you simply can't kill them fast enough, or they have 100% accuracy on their weapons, like lasers, where you are always going to be hit if they can see you. \n\nThird, as far as difficulties go, the rewards you get scale up pretty normally, while the difficulty on the settings is just absurd. Typically you can play up to hard pretty well. You might have a bit of trouble, but if you play well and play smart you'll be able to play through the game on hard. But if you DARE set the game to hardest? The fourth of 5 difficulties (The hardest is Inferno) then all of a sudden, pretty much every attack will one shot you. The only way to get around this? Grind the same levels over, and over, and over again farming armor crates. And as I said, you get like, +1 maximum health for every 5 crates you pick up... and you're going to need thousands of hp if you want to get into inferno difficulty. \n\nFourth, weapon and class issues. The problem with this is simply that some things just don't scale well. For example the Wing Diver. You would think getting a higher level weapon is a good thing right? Well the Wing Diver uses energy to fly, and that same energy is used to either reload, or if the weapon doesn't have a 'clip', then simply fire a weapon. You end up getting weapons that have incredible power, but take up like 300% energy, so you have to recharge your energy 4 times over just to fire this weapon once. Meanwhile, for that whole time, you are stuck defenseless, unable to fly, on the most immobile class on foot. They do this for other things as well, such as the Ranger where if a weapon has incredible power, it's always offset by something such as a very small clip, an extremely long reload, or just not being able to reload the weapon at all. They like doing that one. \n\nSo all in all, great game, can't recommend it enough with friends.

Seriously, that's the entire point. Go out and have a blast. If you're looking for a game with a deep plot and story, you could look between the lines and probably overanalyze something into existence, but otherwise this game might not be for you.\n\nGameplay-wise, there's a number of things to get used to. Rangers play differently than Air Raiders, which play differently than Wing Divers, which are a totally different playstyle than Fencers. Each class is their own game to learn, with little tricks to figuring out each. \n\nIf you don't want to pay too much attention to the finer details and sally forth to kill something, Ranger is a good starting point. You have your basic infantry weapons, and some really interesting things (bouncing shots, ridiculous missiles and grenades, healguns). Their Buffalo shotguns are also hilarious for sending dead friends into the depths of the world or to outer space. Just try it, you'll understand~\n\nAir Raiders are their own special cup of tea, but if you think they're just a \"support class,\" you're dead wrong. Sure, they can be used as that, and in cave missions a lot of the times that's where they can really shine. You can pack your deployable thingies and heal your team back to perfection. Or, y'know, use that spider mech thing and crawl on some walls with really awkward controls or something. You can even put your deployables ON the awkward spider mech, and help your team that way! Outside, however, is where air strikes rain supreme! If you want to toss out a beacon and watch the fireworks, this is a class for you.\n\nWing Divers also have that unique kind of gameplay that you'll only find with EDF. Instead of normal infantry, they only use plasma-based weapons. Whether that's in the form of a laser chainsaw, explosive light balls, lightning machine guns, or pinpoint (or not-so-pinpoint) lasers, you'll be using your jetpack fuel for everything. That's right, jetpacks! You're like a portable charger that grew wings and electrified stingers. You're going to get into the fray quick and obliterate it just as quickly. Very high-risk-high-reward style though, for if you run out of your energy, you can't do anything other than hop around and pray that red bar fills faster (except for weapons that store a charge on their own. If they don't empty, you can still use those~). For those that like that all-in kind of style. Some sniping options are viable, but not as fun.\n\nFencers are a strange mixed bag of \"fixed artillery\" and \"close air support craft.\" You'll start out with this class not knowing exactly what you're trying to do with it. You might think you know, but you know NOTHING. Don't worry, it happened to me too~. They can be played a number of different ways, their namesake being the slow-moving-but-tanky defensive lineman, that also happens to have 105mm howitzers strapped to its back. That's only really if you don't know how to do a dash-cancel. Look up guides for that. Once you get that down, you'll have one kit that gets you places and lets you stab bugs with beams of light, spears, axes, giant hammers, and whatever other nonsensical this-should-be-on-a-mech-stabby-thing. And you'll have a kit that deals with everything else (I do like me some howitzers). That's the way I do it at least, but mileage will vary between players. For players that like adaptable, technical styles of play, where positioning is almost as important as the shooting.\n\nIf I had to choose one thing about this game that's annoying, it's the online progress bar. You have to apply SO MANY hours just to see 1% increases at times. For those that haven't experienced it, you earn progression by both:\nA) Beating the mission with 1 of 4 classes.\nB) Beating the mission at 1 of 5 difficulties.\n\nFor the less math-inclined, you replay the same mission at minimum for 20 times to obtain full progression for that mission. Why would you do this to yourself? Well, once you can get 70% completion of the online mode, you can uncap weapon and armor level limits when you make a lobby. By that point, honestly, you won't need the uncapped stats. It's just there to make you feel like a goddamn superhero for putting in the work, and frankly that's amazing to me.\n\nNow, that's probably my only real issue with the game. Progression for HP increasing and weapon pickups seems fair. Just pick up the boxes and you're good!\n\nI've spent a ton of time just working my way through online progression, working with friends and unknowns online, and in general enjoying the pure PvE experience. You can play it however you really want, though blowing up friendlies isn't so recommended. The community, in my experience, is there for you, and as for those local to the Japan-side, the in-game chat works wonders. You can communicate nearly everything using them.\n\nHighly recommended to play with controller. Choking hazard for those under the age of two. If you find yourself chanting the various songs in the game, don't bother consulting your doctor. That just means it's working.\n\nThe EDF deploys~", "timestamp_created": 1513468035, "timestamp_updated": 1513546069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38363153": {"recommendationid": "38363153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035618967", "num_games_owned": 1271, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513466844}, "language": "english", "review": "Giant Enemy Crab.", "timestamp_created": 1513467141, "timestamp_updated": 1513467141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38329809": {"recommendationid": "38329809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014791863", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 8169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500203322}, "language": "english", "review": "To save our mother Earth from any alien attack\n\nFrom vicious giant insects who have once again come back\n\nWe'll unleash all our forces we won't cut them any slack\n\nThe E.D.F deploys!", "timestamp_created": 1513359484, "timestamp_updated": 1513359484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38304457": {"recommendationid": "38304457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135812151", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513960101}, "language": "swedish", "review": "de e najs", "timestamp_created": 1513269073, "timestamp_updated": 1513269073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38301306": {"recommendationid": "38301306", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997998523", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 13599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512233151}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3055\u3042\u3001\u4eca\u3059\u3050\u9283\u3092\u3068\u308c\u3002\u62bc\u3057\u5bc4\u305b\u308b\u5186\u76e4\u6483\u3061\u843d\u3068\u305b\u3002\n\u6211\u3089\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u306f\u3084\u3064\u3089\u3092\u5165\u308c\u306f\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513258906, "timestamp_updated": 1513258906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38284802": {"recommendationid": "38284802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006405937", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513533017}, "language": "japanese", "review": "Everybody say!!!!\n\nEDF!!!

Just finished it. At only normal mode. I am crying. I am very moved.\n\nLittle bit about my gaming choices, I am a super fan of RPG gameplay, making choices in story mode, etc etc.\n\nI was recommended by a friend to play this game, and I was quite skeptical about mission based action games. There wasn't any hardcore roleplay, or any detailed customization options, or was there choices to make in the story, and yet...I am utterly IMPRESSED.\n\nI have never felt this level of satisfaction of completing a game, even in most RPG games, at most, I would be ah, what a good story that was.\n\nThe moment I finished the last boss mission, while watching the last scene, I had tears swelling up in my eyes, and when the credits rolled and the EDF song started playing, I just couldn't stop the tears.\n\nTo the yet-to-buy friends from any part of the world, if you're reading this review:\n\n- When I first started the game, I was doubtful on whether this game will be fun at all or not.\n\n- First Mission: The feeling of shooting giant bugs, and seeing them die in odd blood-spraying animation, seems oddly awesome.\n\nNow don't just rush and buy the game yet, cos the best part not here yet.\n\n- Next few missions, when you first hear the citizens screaming for help, and when you hit the trigger button and defeat the bug, and you save them while thinking \"meh, they probably don't even know what's going on.\", and suddenly you hear their shout of thanks, the feeling of \"oh...I am a hero to them. huh\" will come rushing into your head.\n\n- Another few more missions, getting called \"Sir\" really feel awesome, and these people salute me while they offer to help me in the mission...I should salute you not the other way around! I thank you NPCs for actually fighting at all!\n\n- Some more misisons, oh no don't kill the Wing Divers, no no no don't you dare you little pesky spider! No! Alice-chan! Lisa-chan! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! *stares at dead Wing Diver* AHHHHHH DAMN IT! *cries for a bit* That's it...Die YOU STUPID TOO MANY EYES!!!!!\n\n- Later Missions, EDF! EDF! EDF! WHOOOOOAAAAAA!!!!! CHARRRRGEEEEE!!!!! RANGERS!!!!!\n\n- AWESOME Missions, Whew. That was hard. Wait what? What are you guys talking ab...WHHHOOOAAAAA! Giant LIZARD!!!! GODZILLAAAA?????? WHY?! WAHHH????\n\n- EVEN MORE AWESOME Missions, OOOOOOOoooooOOOOOOOOooooooYEAAAAAAAHHHHH I AM A ROBOT!!!!!!!! COME AT PAPA DUMB LIZZZZYYY!\n\n- Almost towards the end..., EDF! EDF! EDF! WHOOOOOAAAAAA!!!!!

All of the above is true:  The graphics, sound, voice acting, plot and gameplay are all pretty meh across the board.  That said, this is perhaps one of the most amusing games third person shooters I've played in many many years.\n\nIt helps that the game doesn't take itself too seriously.  While not going full Goat Simulator and relying on 'lol random' to make up for effort on their part, the game designers instead have made almost every level* a sandbox for you to fight giant bugs using progressively more ludicrously overpowered weaponry.  You will go from rocket launchers that take several shots to level a single building to multi-launch missile systems that can level an entire city block with a single squeeze of the trigger.\n\nIt's that progression of power in your weaponry that is part of what makes this game so compelling.  The power progression combined with a menace largely composed of big creepy crawlies makes for a video game equivalent of going after an ant hill with a magnifying glass on a sunny day.  Each city level with the bugs has them crawling all over the sky scrapers like they own the place.  And it's oddly satisfying to level said sky scrapers while happily scouring the city of the infestation.  Sure you probably caused more property damage and loss of life than the aliens ever would but /dammit/ if you didn't show those jerks what for!!\n\nWe've not even gotten onto the vehicles yet either!  While they're largely limited to a single class (Air Raider), they are pretty cool and include the relatively mundane in helicopters and tanks before going to railgun platforms, mini-mechas, multi-pilot regular mechas, and finally a Jaeger.  Also provided:  A giant Godzilla-alike with the serial numbers filed off for you to punch around in said Jaeger.  Sadly the Jaegers are multi-pilot so no drifting for you but as mentioned above several of the vehicles are multi-pilot and it's pretty cool if you have some buddies to work together with to pilot a tank that is wider across than a four lane highway.\n\nSo the Air Raiders have some pretty cool stuff, so maybe you think they're the only class you really need.  But wait!  Why summon in a giant mecha when you can basically be a human-sized mecha as a Fencer?  Sure you're slow as molasses but with the right skill and weaponry you can put out as much if not more damage than anyone else.\n\nWant more mobility?  Try a Wing Diver!  Fragile but with a jetpack that allows unparalleled mobility and a selection of unique laser and plasma based weaponry you can happily glass your foes from above!  At least until the bees arrive.  OH GOD THE BEES.\n\nWant to be boring?  Pick a Ranger!  OK OK I kid.  The Ranger actually is a good balance of mobility and power when compared to the Fencer and Wing Diver.  Sure they can't fly but they have the fastest on foot speed, and their weaponry is simple and effective unlike the unwieldy battleship cannons the Fencer uses or the also-uses-your-jetpack-fuel plasma weaponry of the Wing Diver.\n\nSo you have four different ways to fight, but what about things to fight?  Well I've mentioned some examples above but there are many more.  Your enemy will not just employ giant bugs but also various mechanical foes like mechas and flying drones.  Thought the bees were bad?  Try dragons!  You also have huge ships that act as spawners and interlocking plates that will cover the sky overhead.  All of this adds to the challenge as the game goes on and gives you new ways to try and use that arsenal you are trying to stockpile.  Go ahead, call in a nuke on a beach full of giant angry red ants.  It's great fun!\n\nSo in conclusion, Earth Defense Force 4.1: The Shadow of New Despair is a great game.  It's not perfect.  It has a ton of flaws thanks to the fact it is a low budget game designed for consoles.  That said I'm excited about the idea of there being a sequel to this game in ways I would never be for other shooters with multi-million dollar budgets.  It's simple, it's enjoyable, and I think it reminds us that that is all you need in the end.  This, to me, is the blueprint that other looter shooters should follow.  Where instead of incremental upgrades of rifle you're waiting to pick up the next ridiculous multi-grenade launcher that can blow up everything around you (and you) in a satisfyingly hilarious way.\n\nIf I can make one small suggestion though ... the fact weapon pickups can be duplicates which you get no benefit for it annoying.

I can't recommend this game enough as a fun arcade-ish shooting title.", "timestamp_created": 1511678352, "timestamp_updated": 1511678352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37625185": {"recommendationid": "37625185", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971952481", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511506742}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 - An outstanding horde shooter for fans of Borderlands, Left for Dead, Serious Sam and the like. Perfect for playing splitscreen on the couch with friends or online.  It's a fine blend of Starship Troopers, Anime and a Sunday afternoon picnic gone awry in the worst kind of way (yup giant ants). \n\nI piloted a giant mech, punched Godzilla in the face, leveled entire city blocks and carried a tune with my squaddies all a the same time. I can't remember the last time I did that...  It's just one of many epic and insane encounters one can experience. \n\nSometimes you'll feel like the guy who has to open the door at Walmart on Black Friday, but that's okay too... at least you can bring a shield ...or bazooka or choose whatever you want from the hundreds and hundreds of weapons and gadgets available.\n\nThe visuals are a feast for the eye. Granted you won't see anatomically correct nosehair or butt sway animations as the rendering horsepower was directed to give you more on screen enemies, more explosions and other eye candy. I mean that's what we're here for right?\n\nThe campaign goes on and on - even longer in multiplay coop with additional missions, which is a good thing. There's a good mix of mission types as almost every one feels unique. The ending takes an unexpected turn where you have to blow up a big floaty thing  and stuff - who would've imaged that in a shooter game!\n\nThis game has comedy value, both intentional and not. Along with the utterly cheezy dialogue, you'll encounter wonky animations, insane physics and poor Japanese translations. Note to the devs, its perfectly broken please don't fix it. \u3069\u3046\u3082\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068!", "timestamp_created": 1511676704, "timestamp_updated": 1511718854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37622700": {"recommendationid": "37622700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042234071", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 332, "last_played": 1516404940}, "language": "english", "review": "EDF!

No, wait. You end up LOVING it.\n\nSomehow none of the downsides matter.\n\nSo the graphics are awful. It doesn't matter because when there are literally a hundred giant ants swarming across a city towards you while ridiculous giant robots stalk the horizon behind them... you really don't care that none of it is that well rendered. The spectacle, the sheer joy of being in the middle of something so ridiculous just stomps flat any piffling concerns you might have about the blockiness of the UFOs or the way the ants animate when they go over corners. Not to mention the advantage that it basically runs at 60fps on a potato.\n\nThe grating sound? Your friendly troops drown it out by singing the stupidest, most glorious anthem ever voiced by any pretend-videogame-military ever. It's so utterly terrible that I could barely see through the tears of laughter as I listened to my dying allies singing it full-throated as they were slaughtered by B-movie monstrosities from beyond the stars.\n\nThe horribly unbalanced weapons? Welp, there are nearly 1000 of them. Don't like one you got? Just keep playing and pick up more green weapon crates. You don't really lose anything by failing a mission - you can just play it again. Seriously, it's that half-assed. It's like they said, ehhhh, we could spend months trying to balance these weapons and vehicles... or just throw so many at the player they'll feel like kids in a candy shop run by a psychotic sugar-addict.

Probably the most fun I had with a game in 2016(i'm writing this near the end of 2017). \n\nI'm too lasy to write a comprehensive review so I'll keep it short. There's a lot of stages(almost 100 without dlc), and a large amount of enemy variety(from ants to giant robots). Missions can take place in cities with destructible buildings, large open barren wastelands, underground tunnels, etc... You have all the difficulties unlocked from the start but progression is more like Diablo. Weapons have a level attached to them and you permanently increase your max hp by picking up armor during missions.Higher level weapons tend to be more over the top and effect your playstyle more than lower level weapons. Harder difficulties change the types of enemies that spawn, with variations of some enemies being exclusive to the harder difficulties. \n\n4 different classes, each with different playstyles. Ranger is like playing a standard 3rd person shooter, though you have an evasive roll. Weapons are mostly standard stuff like assault rifles, snipers, and rocket launchers. Wing divers get a jetpack and use energy weapons that focus on high melee damage or high ranged AoE damage. They have an energy meter that is used for both the jetpack and reloading, so they are big on meter management as depleting your meter leaves you mostly defenseless. Air raiders are lacking in ways to do damage to enemies directly. They can summon vehicles such as tanks, helicopters, missile launchers, and mechs. They can call airstrikes, deploy automated turrets, boost ally damage, heal allies, etc.... Fencers can wield 2 weapons at once, allowing a total of 4 weapons in your loadout. Their movement is unconventional. By default they move painfully slow and have no defensive measures, but they can become the fastest class in the game with the right setup.

The game is pure distilled action as each stage is just you, the bugs and maybe a few NPC distractions. While there IS a story, it's nothing to really write home about and in the end it's all just set dressing for the game's action. With four different classes each with their own selection of weapons (and seperate completion percentage), there's a LOT of content if you really sink your teeth into this game. The game itself has a feel of camaraderie that I think is sorely missing in games, even the NPC chatter makes them feel like they're people fighting beside you - even if the dialouge is disjointed at times.

My god, they have A SCREEN SHIELD! That explains everything!\" or \"They have survived for the last 8 years. How? Oh, they were living underground right under our biggest cities. We didn't know about it. We are shocked.\" A delightful humor in parodying the staples of the genre.\n\nBut god damn me if it is not the game I think about when I say \"Quality coop action experience\".\nBuy it.

Listening to the AI soldiers adds a bit more depth to the story. Kinda cheesy voice acting, but still enjoyable. 7/10\nEnemy and Ally AI: Bugs a mindless drones (pun unintended) that continuously swarm at you opnce you're in sight. Allies are pretty much just cannon fodder unless playing multi player. 7/10\nReplay value: 80+ missions per character, fun gameplay, collectable items, multi player mode, and achievments as well as downloadable content mean you will be this game for a long time. 9/10\n\nIn general, play EDF as soon as possible and make sure to enjoy it with friends.", "timestamp_created": 1508387555, "timestamp_updated": 1511374613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35822855": {"recommendationid": "35822855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074293383", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1515330486}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c11\u5e74\u5e7b\u60f3\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5175\u79cd\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u7279\u8272\uff0c\u6b66\u5668\u4e5f\u662f\u4e30\u5bcc\u591a\u6837\u3002\n\n\u6700\u6700\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u6ca1\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u7279\u522b\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u5e72\u5e72\u5e72\u3002\u867d\u7136\u591a\u4eba\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u914d\u5408\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5355\u5355\u662f\u602a\u7269\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u529b\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u7ed9\u5c0f\u670b\u53cb\u73a9\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1508347317, "timestamp_updated": 1508347317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35790306": {"recommendationid": "35790306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000365424", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500356519}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun, hectic, and downright stupid at times in the best way.

The dialog is hammy. But ham and cheese has never tasted this good![/h1]\n\n[h1]Before we continue, let's get the negatives out of the way so we can focus on talking about how awesome EDF is.[/h1]\nThe base price can seem a bit steep given the game's age, and the highest discount you'll ever find is 40% off. Yes, it's a console port. That means enduring some things such as a clunky menu interface and unmappable, hardcoded keybinds. Increasing your arsenal and max health isn't just tedious, it's a requirement for the higher difficulties. There's talk of a cheater problem in public lobbies, and creating a private online game requires you to invite your friends through the [i]chat shortcuts window[/i], of all things. I don't believe you can invite anyone mid-mission, either. Sometimes there will be so many enemies or explosions on-screen that your framerate will take a very noticeable hit even on a good computer. I don't think there's a borderless windowed mode, if that matters to you. Oh, and the game can't even be launched if you're on a version of Windows older than 7.\n\nNow then, if you can get past all of that, you may very well find yourself putting countless hours into this game.\n\n[h1]What is EDF?[/h1]\nIt's a game where you save the world (even if that means leveling a city block) from hordes of giant insects, alien robots and spacecrafts, and several other deadly foes. It's like Starship Troopers but without the gritty satire, leaving it more goofy and colorful. You have to hope that the bad voice acting is intentional. Some levels are reminiscent of the finale of every early Power Rangers episode, fighting gargantuan monsters with robots included. If you enjoy watching corny movies from the 70's and 80's because you feel that's part of their charm, you might enjoy EDF. The game doesn't take itself seriously, so why should you? And how many games can you name that let you sing inspiring military marching music alongside your comrades?\n\nOn the surface EDF looks like some weird homage to the somewhat obscure N64 title [i]Body Harvest[/i]. You utilize a variety of weapons and vehicles to fight off large alien bugs, saving screaming citizens from being eaten. That's about where the similarities end, however. The game is mission-based and consists of 89 levels (+9 more online) distributed over only 16 maps, but the developers did a good job at spreading them out in ways that you don't grow tired of the same maps quickly. The weapon variety is huge and each of the four classes plays quite differently. Even if you're not a fan of relatively silly games, EDF still offers plenty of gunplay for those who simply enjoy blowing stuff up. The multiplayer especially is an absolute blast with friends. At first I disliked that online play limited your max health and weapon level based on difficulty and mission progress, but later I began to appreciate the forced challenge that makes multiplayer so special.\n\n[h1]Finally, I'd like to talk about the story.[/h1]\nYou might be thinking that the story of a game which takes a B-movie approach wouldn't be particularly good. And... you'd be right. The story itself isn't anything special. But it's because of that that it's so easy to overlook the [b]way[/b] they tell the story, the little things almost behind the scenes. That, I feel, is something worth discussing. Don't worry; I'll try to keep this relatively spoiler-free regardless.\n\nFirst off there's a couple of things pointed out to me by the [url=https://www.youtube.com/SoberDwarfShow]SoberDwarf[/url]. During a couple of different missions, the navy, artillery crews, and air support have to retreat for one reason or another. Players of the Air Raider class might take issue with these parts of the game, because it means that they are temporarily unable to call in air strikes or request vehicles, making the class quite handicapped for a while. The support teams eventually return to help, but for that duration, the story of the war has a direct impact on the player, which isn't something all that common in video games, let alone ones of similar tone to EDF.\n\nAnother bit of storytelling is found within the game's inventory screen. Never would have guessed that one, huh? Every weapon has a description below its stats, usually detailing not only its usage to the player but also its role to the military as well. Yes, someone had to type up stuff for over 800 weapons. Gag weapons notwithstanding, you may come across weapons that are useless or otherwise outright terrible. In most cases, these are prototypes, some failures and some early in development. It is here that you see a bit of behind-the-scenes details involving the EDF's Research & Development, which gives the game's military a bit of authenticity. That authenticity lends toward immersion, which is something I always approve of in a game.\n\nLastly, I want to address something else quite unique to EDF's story. Initially the game starts off as a sort of power fantasy. You get to destroy bugs and other aliens and be the hero. About halfway through the game, however, the game undergoes a shift in theme. Everything still plays the same, but it's like its genre or sub-genre has changed. I would argue that the game later becomes a sort of horror game. I'm not talking about your typical horror of gore or jump scares, but one of an older style more akin to early 1900's radio drama. Don't get me wrong, the Genocide Guns witnessed fairly early in the game would be legitimately terrifying in real life. But what the game does closer to the end is instill a grim reality. No matter how hard you try, no matter the valiant struggle, humanity itself may very well be coming to an end. That feeling of powerlessness portrayed through the story's climax is a direct contradiction to the power fantasy established in the beginning. I believe you'll be hard-pressed to find another game that sort of changes its genre the more you play it. Whether or not this a deliberate portrayal, I think it was worth pointing out.", "timestamp_created": 1505273310, "timestamp_updated": 1505273310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34892918": {"recommendationid": "34892918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090507393", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 5966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511845496}, "language": "english", "review": "I usually don't care for extreme Japanese stereotypes, or really just anything Japanese.

When you complete a leven with the crates you collected they will give you a random selction of weapons, but the problem is when you start to build up the armory, you will start getting duplicates, so you will have to go back and get them over again and pray that you don't get more dupes. Another problem is the fact of in multiplayer, weapons get levels, and you can only use certain guns on a certain difficulty, which isn't fun when you want to use a minigun but don't want to get murdered by a swarm.

This game is possibly my top pick for best coop game of all time simply because its got everything a fun coop game should have and then some\n\n*PROS*\n\n-4 Playable Classes: theyre completely different playstyles with their own different gear and gimmicks. They even vary when everyone is the same class\n\n-Weapons: literally hundreds of weapons, ive put countless hours into this game and im not even at 10% collected. Some are great and some are jokes\n\n-Scale: seriously the game is gigantic, huge swarms of hundreds of enemies and colossal monsters and machines that reach the sky in size. You fight across entire cities with destructible buildings and structures\n\n-Mission based fun: the whole game is split into individual encounters that, even if some are the same objective, the game is always introducing new enemies and challenges as you progress to keep it fresh\n\n-Replayability. There's so much content that itll take forever just to beat the game on Normal, but theres also 3 difficulties higher that increase the HP and damage of enemies as well as new varients that dont appear in lower difficulties. With 90+ missions NOT including the 2 DLC mission packs, you will be playing for a long time (Vanilla game +DLC is about 150 missions!)\n\n-English Dub/Script: its just beyond entertaining. The whole game has this B-movie Starship Troopers dialogue and the script is just laughably dumb on purpose. The original japanese sounds good, but i think its conveyed better in english because the corny aspect is on point\n\n*CONS*\n\n-Menu Controls: At first, the menu will confuse you if you use a gamepad (which i think is the best way to play) because the joystick controls the selected menu buttons (new game, load, options, etc) and the d-pad pulls up new windows (invite friends and view invites is in here) It isnt so bad once you learn it but early on i had no idea what was up with the menu\n\n-Performance: if you dont have a good graphics card or play on a laptop this game is going to drop in frame rate or even crash.

Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Rockets, Missiles, Grenades.  Some special weapons like acid guns and flamethrowers, as well as a heal gun.  Tough, decent damage, can roll through a lot of things.  Can also drive vehicles that are called in by the Air Raider.  Very 'average' playstayle.\n\nWing Diver - All weapons use energy, which also is used by the jetpack.  Fastest unit if you get the hang of it's movement, but lightest armored.  Weapons all do decent damage, which types include: Rapiers (short ranged beam spam), Lances (Short Range, high damage laser blast), Lasers Rifles (Mid Range, continual damage.  Comes in various types, including a chainsaw), Thunder Bows (Lighting Gun.  Mid Range, decent damage.  Penetrates through enemies), Energy Snipers (Comes in Thunder Snipers and Laser Snipers.  Thunder shoots a long range blast of lightning.  Lasers emit a constant beam, but are a lot less damaging 'per hit'), Energy Projectiles (Affected by Gravity, decent damage... honestly never used em), Plasma Launchers and Grenades (High Energy drain, big boom), Mind Guided projectiles (From the small, fast Mirage, to the slower Geist and up.  Lock on and keep firing).  Also a collection of special weapons, dealing odd effects.\n\nAir Raider - Take the Ranger, but can't roll through things as well.  A support class.  Uses Limpet Guns (Attaches to what it hits, secondary sets em off.  Comes in regular HE and 'Frag' Splendor, with various types of launchers), various bombs, turrets, buffing stations, defensive walls, ect.   Biggest things are 1: he also can use a Guide Kit, either Laser or Beacon that the Fencer needs for locking onto with some of his biggest missiles.  2: Air Raids.  In the form of bombing runs, artillery, satelite lasers, cruise missiles, ect.  He also gets to choose a vehicle he can call in, from tanks to mechs to helicopters.  The vehicles and Air Raids require 'points' to recharge (or some big ones, charge first) before you can use them again.  Gain points by defeating enemies.\n\nFencer - Slowest unit (unless you get Dash Canceling down), but the highest armor and has some of the biggest guns.  From giant swords and shields to miniguns and light tank cannons.  Even various missiles (with the biggest requiring a helping Air Raider taking a Guide Kit).  Harder entry than the Air Raider or Ranger, but worth the effort if you keep it up.\n\nThen it's simple, you follow the song.\n\nTo Save our Mother Earth from any Alien Attack.\nFrom Vicious Giant Insects who have once again come back.\nWe'll Unleash all our Forces, we won't cut them any Slack.\nThe EDF Deploys!\n\nEDF!", "timestamp_created": 1502913154, "timestamp_updated": 1502913154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34248724": {"recommendationid": "34248724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121191447", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514863387}, "language": "english", "review": "Solo is awsome.

you invite some friends over for some couch co-op. Don\u2019t purchase this game if you expect something that falls into normal game categories, unless those categories have a entry for shooting buick sized spiders with a mecha. Honestly after completing the entire game and the DLC missions and I\u2019m still trying to figure out if the game designers wanted you to take the game seriously, or just laugh at the comical noises a character makes while being eaten by a giant ant. Either way, I enjoyed every second of the game. Now the game does have an online 4 player co-op option for those who are interested though I personally cannot comment on it because like I mentioned before I just invited some friends over to play. \n\nIn summary this is a third person shooter with 4 classes to choose from each with specific loadouts and you fight giant bugs and robots. Sound ridiculous? It really is, but it\u2019s a lot of fun. Go in with no expectation and you will leave entertained. \n\nThe only real con in my opinion is the current steam sale price for the main game ($50). Personally I found it was money well spent, however to others the current sales price is pretty much the purchase of AAA title.

Everyone that i've played it with can pick it up and understand it within moments and have a blast. \n\nPros:\n- Great two player couch co-op. \n-Destructable, large, open, and great-looking enviornments\n- Mindless kill-large-swarms-with-crazy-weapons gameplay reminescent of serious sam but with more giant insects. \n- Simple to learn\n- Has a charming B-movie feel that doesnt take itself too seriously.\n- Lots of fun guns LAZER CHAINSAW!!! Full auto rocket launchers! Mechs! \n- Tons of levels with a wide variety of difficulty levels\n\nCons:\n- Can only take two guns into battle. With having so many guns this makes it not only a pain to figure out what each one does but also makes you constantly exiting and restarting levels trying to find the one for the task at hand. \n-The armor pickups (basically health) only apply to the class that picked them up. This makes farming necessary if you want to bring other classes to be able to survive harder difficulties & levels.

Most AAA developers would probably focus their efforts on general polish, idiot-proofing everything, and crafting a balanced, finely engineered, and extremely bland experience. These guys have their priorities straight: hundreds of weapons, swarms of enemies, and complete mayhem.

Some levels you may have no issues with then others will crash a few seconds into the mission. While others it may be well into the mission before it crashes for no apperent reason.\n\nOverall there was only two levels (out of 89) which I couldn't beat because of crashes and had to play it on a lower end extra computer (which seemed to play it better but yay cloud saves). I am enjoying it but semi regular crashes are irritating.\n\nIf you enjoy this series then it may be worth it for you if you're willing to risk not being able to refund it if the crashes happen after playing for 2 hours, which is likely, then go for it. Otherwise be cautious and know that you are taking a risk.\n\nPros-\nAmazing and fun game and the best version of series.\n\nCons-\nPoorly optimized and will likely crash often if you lose the dice roll of it not liking your computer\n\nShit for graphics options", "timestamp_created": 1499233590, "timestamp_updated": 1499709005, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487115", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33252091": {"recommendationid": "33252091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168067789", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504083695}, "language": "english", "review": "Nuking all the ants only for a corpse to fall in front of me and result in me nuking myself.

It's a terrible port that makes the UI terrible. You change settings by sliding mouse left and right and you scroll through options by moving mouse up and down. The UI is frankly really ugly and the game is only okay looking. \n\nWith all that said though, it's amazing to play. It really is fun. I assume I enjoy it for similar reasons to enjoying terribly made movies. There is always something absurd happening. Overall, it is enjoyable and rewarding to play. The difficult modes are actually engaging. If you like games like helldivers, you'll like this style of gameplay, despite this being a third person shooter. \n\nFlight mechanics are really satisfying and the ability to access high points without hitting a skybox is really enjoyable.

massen.Am Anfang hat man kleine Waffen,sp\u00e4ter im Spiel kann man ganze Stadtviertel zu Asche verwandeln was manchmal auch n\u00f6tig ist um nicht von Horden \u00fcberrannt zu werden wenn sie zwischen den H\u00e4usern hervorkommen.\nWer die K\u00e4mpfe in den Kinos gesehen hat mit Superhelden die eine Stadt zerlegen wird bei EDF genau das finden.EDF kleckert nicht sondern Klotzt.Wie bei Independence Day haben auch die Aliens in EDF ein Mutterschiff mit Prim\u00e4rwaffe.Wenn diese feuert bleibt kein Augen trocken.Das Spiel gibt einen das Gef\u00fchl die letzte Rettung zu sein denn nur diese Vier Kommandoeinheiten haben soviel Feuerkraft das sie eine Alienarmee aufhalten k\u00f6nnen.\n\nWas einem ganz schnell in der ersten Mission schon klar wird.Die Story ist abwechslungsreich.Mal muss man ein Insektennest samt K\u00f6nigin ausheben mal eine Invasion mit Mutterschiff aufhalten.In Landgebiete eine Verbreitung der Insekten stoppen.Und da war noch etwas.......Wenn man auf einmal den himmel nicht mehr sehen kann,aber seht es Euch selber an.Auf youtube k\u00f6nnt Ihr Euch vor den Kauf ein Bild davon machen.Bei diesem Spiel tritt der Effekt ein \"nur noch eine Mission dann ist aber Schluss\"\n\nIch bin normalerweise kein Fan von solchen simplen Spielen,aber dieses Spiel ist einfach der Hammer\n\nEDF!", "timestamp_created": 1499080421, "timestamp_updated": 1499081079,

as pure, distilled GAME, Earth Defense Force 4.1 would be it. There's no deep narrative, no unskippable, poorly animated cutscenes from wannabe Hollywood producers, no extended tutorial that assumes you're a 80-year old grandmother who's never played a game in their life, not even a hamfisted political message. Just you, the rest of the Earth Defense Force, any friends you bring along, and a giant arsenal of weapons and vehicles against the alien menace. The story is barebones and the NPC chatter is a hilarious B-movie homage, what more do you need? You launch the game, load your save file, pick your loadout, and are in a mission shooting bugs all within 30 seconds.\n\nBoy, are there missions. Over 100 (in multiplayer, a select few are skipped in singleplayer due to the way they were designed) missions to choose from, with even more available from the mission packs. Starting from the humble beginnings of mission 1 where you fight swarms of nothing but giant ants all the way to the depths of hell itself known as Mission Pack 2 where no amount of anime girls painted on the side of your tank will save you from a gruesome death, the game operates on a very steady difficulty curve. New enemies are introduced every few missions, just frequently enough to perpetually keep you on your toes. Thankfully, new weapons are also introduced at a similar pace, making sure that both your playstyle and the enemies to engage you always stay fresh. Unlocks are tied to the mission and difficulty level, so the further you progress the more cool toys you get to play with (and use to get that sweet, sweet revenge when you go back to an earlier mission that gave you trouble).\n\nSpeaking of difficulty settings, there are several. Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, and Inferno, to be exact. Difficulty setting is more than just \"challenge\", it also serves as a psuedo-new game plus. Increasing the difficulty setting not only increases the raw power of the enemies, it also makes them more intelligent, more aggressive, and grants them access to more dangerous attacks. However, it also increases the armor limit and weapon level limit, allowing you to bring more firepower to match. Said limits also line up nicely for cyclical playthroughs of the game, so finishing on Normal will leave you equipped to immediately transition into Hard mode, and so on. Since the difficulty setting also influences weapon drops, this means that you'll continue to aquire more and more powerful weapons as you make the transition to higher difficulties, giving the game quite a bit of replay value.\n\nAs for the progression system, it's been the mainstay since the original Earth Defense Force on PS2, and is arguably one of the game's weaker points. Killing enemies can drop weapon boxes, armor boxes, and health boxes. Weapon boxes give you a random weapon of the appropriate strength for the mission for your current class, armor boxes permanently increase the maximum armor of your current class, and health boxes instantly heal a set percentage of your armor. This means you will spend quite a bit of time running around picking up the spoils of battle, and if that sounds annoying, it's because it can be. Some people enjoy it, some don't, it's really up to personal opinion. The weapons you recieve are also purely random, so you can spend many, many attempts at the same mission trying to get a weapon that just won't drop. This can either mean more replay value or more frustration, depending on your viewpoint.\n\nThere are four classes to choose from, each with completely different playstyles and weaponry. Rangers are the standard footsoldier. You get conventional weaponry ranging from assault rifles to rocket launchers, and a nifty dodge roll to boot. Ranger's biggest strength is their versatility; they always have a tool for the job, and can comfortably handle any situation. Wing Divers are a high mobility class armed with energy weapons, from beam rifles to laser javelins, they're all about moving fast and high with their jetpacks. Energy management is a must, because your weapons draw from the same power supply as your weapons. Wing Divers, in the hands of a skilled player, can zip around the battlefield at lightning speed, obliterating everything in their path, but one false move can leave you with empty weapons and no power to fly away, leading to an embearassing death. Air Raiders are the masters of support, and bring vehicles into the fray. Your only real offense (if you even bring one) is a sticky grenade launcher, but you have the power to call in bombing runs from the air force or artillery, call in pilotable vehicles (anything from a motorcycle to a giant mech and everything inbetween), and even support your teammates with healing, buffs, and deployable cover. Airstrikes and vehicle call-ins \"reload\" by earning points (generated by any enemy dying) however, so careless usage of your tools can leave you helpless. Finally, Fencers are heavy power-armored soldiers that bring weapons to match, and have the unique gimmick of being able to equip four weapons at once, two for each hand. Gatling guns, naval cannons, rocket pods, pilebunkers, giant axes, you name it they've got it. Typically lacking in mobility, certain weapons (mainly melee) allow you to do a boost dash; learning to cancel this dash (with melee attacks, shield parries, or even certain launchers later on) and chain them together allows you to move at breakneck speeds, dashing around like an angry hornet and blasting actual hornets. These four classes are so radically different that you basically have four different games to play, and in multiplayer they can work together in many interesting ways, (an Air Raider giving laser guidance to a Fencer with a long range artillery cannon, for example) which allows for a large variety of team combinations.\n\nWhether you're looking for a simple game to blow off some steam in once in a while or something to really sink your teeth into and rack up a massive playtime, EDF 4.1 delivers. Tight, responsive controls (except for low-level Air Raider vehicles, they do get way better as you get stronger variants at least), the choice of KB/M or controller (unless you want to drive that damn minibike, holy hell) and very good optimization make a quality port. Only major quirks include a lack of mouse support for menus (instead you navigate with WASD, left click confirm, right click cancel) and a baffling design for the invite menu (you have to use the arrow keys to pull up the friend invite panel), as well with a very disappointing open mic (you can disable voice chat, but this also disables text chat, I recommend using an external VoIP program for communication). Overall, the port is extremely solid, which is something I don't get to say often. Special mention to the game's netcode which is the best I've ever seen. As a co-operative game, the devs made everything client-sided with a stellar focus on syncing to the host as much as possible. When a bug or two falls out of sync due to a ping spike or what have you, they quickly get back into position and due to the clientsided, well, everything, you'll never experience phantom damage or screwy hit detection. I frequently play with people on the other side of the planet and experience zero noticable lag whatsoever.\n\nIf jumping into a giant mech and punching a kaiju in the face is your idea of a good time, then Earth Defense Force 4.1 is definitely worth a try. Don't forget to spam the fight songs, the NPC soldiers will sing along with you.\n[i]1-4 THE EDF DEPLOYS![/I]", "timestamp_created": 1498874570, "timestamp_updated": 1506057386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33041571": {"recommendationid": "33041571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122971890", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501078563}, "language": "english", "review": "Insect simulator", "timestamp_created": 1498833930, "timestamp_updated": 1498833930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33039704": {"recommendationid": "33039704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010737305", "num_games_owned": 1153, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499753354}, "language": "english", "review": "Not only does this have sweet mindless action with tons of enemy variety and a gigantic arsenal of deadly weapons to unlock, the online multiplayer is going pretty strong as far as I've seen so you don't need to worry about that.

"Complete and total titanic insect genocide brought to you by those weirdos who made Robot Alchemic Drive.\n\nPROS:\n- You kill bugs.\n- You kill bugs with four different classes.\n- You kill bugs with a smorgasbord of weapons, from simple rifles to WMDs.\n- You kill bugs with a myriad of deployable vehicles, from simple tanks to vertical fortresses.\n- You kill bugs across god-knows-where in over one hundred levels.\n- You kill bugs in english or in japanese because people are picky like that.\n- You kill bugs with random people online in a hundred more levels.\n- You kill bugs with your friends.\n- You kill bugs with your friends friends.\n- You kill bugs with your friends enemies.\n- You kill bugs with your enemies.\n- You kill bugs.\n\nCONS:\n- Much like this blatent joke of a review, this game is very repetitive with only new enemies being the differences between levels.\n- Very much an opinion but the loot collection system could be better, you have to scour the level for armor and weapons in the midst of the action because you have zero time after finishing a mission to do so.\n- In regards to the last con, armor is artificially scaled to further push the tedious grind. Details below.\n- Very apperent flaws with collision IE enemy spiders freely web you through several city blocks worth of scenery.\n- A very very [i] very [/i] long term con, theres little to do after 100%ing the game aside from beating levels with all four classes on all five difficulties.\n- All cosmetic dlc is locked onto a very low level vehicle/gun and is inevitably abandoned once better gear is obtained, this all should be a skin of some kind that can be carried forward IMHO.\n\nIt has come to my attention that this game is throttling armor collection in favor of a tedious, not enjoyable, and trainer teasing grind. What i mean is that one armor box does not equate to one armor point and the percentage gained differs from class.\n\nRanger 0.47\nWing Diver 0.23\nAir Raider 0.46\nFencer 0.58\n\nFencers will have the easiest time bulking up while Wing Diver will have to collect 5 or 6 armor boxes to gain a single health point. It may be based off of movement speed because wing diver can fly and collect faster but it all sounds like a bunch of bull.\n\nDoesn't really detract from my reccomendation, it's still a fun game to screw around in. The thing is always a decent price around the steam sales and its worth every penny if you got some pals to play it with you.\n\n8/10, would squash bugs again.", "timestamp_created": 1498726488, "timestamp_updated": 1513061767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32978431": {"recommendationid": "32978431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048426302", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499061503}, "language": "english", "review": "EARTH DEFENSE FORCE 4.1 The Shadow of New Despair", "timestamp_created": 1498722859, "timestamp_updated": 1498722859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442260", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32971918": {"recommendationid": "32971918", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964690473", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505624623}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like every other EDF, exterminate over-sized bugs and aliens.

Definitely! Is it a good port to PC from console? Nope!\n\nThe game functions perfectly well but there has been no care taken to adapt the interface or even flow of the game menus to use on a computer.\n\nWhen you launch the game, it says to press a button to start. Depending on the button you press, it'll decide that you're using controller or mouse and keyboard. Naturally I clicked my mouse button and was told I was using mouse and keyboard.\n\nAfter that I was temporarily at a loss of what to do next. I wasn't given a mouse cursor and my scroll wheel didn't change menu options. Instead it mapped my mouse movements of up and down to changing menu options. The rest of the game interface works the same way: left and right to change quantities in an option setting, left mouse button to select, right mouse button to go back.\n\nIn the actual game, things get better. Scroll wheel changes between active weapons, you can change key bindings for controls, etc. One criticism of the gameplay is that there's little visual or audio feedback for when a weapon is ready to fire again. I'm not talking about reloading, that's clear. Instead, I'm talking about the time between shots.\n\nAn aspect of the poor adaptation to PC does show up while playing. Say you're in the middle of playing single player and a friend comes online and wants to play multi-player. They can send you a Steam invite, which is great. When you accept the invitation is when things get funny. It exits you out of the single player game and takes you back to the start screen after preparing you for multiplayer. You then enter the game again through the starting procedure: press a key, choose profile, etc. Then it sends you to the multiplayer room.\n\nAnyway, the game is fantastic fun, especially with friends (either 2 player local or 4 player online). There's stuff to unlock, the loot boxes are for the entire team.

It captures the \"holy hell I'm a god of destruction made out of pure fuck\" pretty well. Sadly, most of the good, extremely fun big boy toys need you to grind on the hardest difficulties, which is only possibly if you spend roughly half of your life collecting a ton of red armor boxes. You get a pathetic amount of armor per box, but there's a ton of them.\n\nI don't want to focus on collecting boxes when I have insects to be killing, and nobody should. Going through the story mode without playing on the higher levels, which lets you get the better weapons, is really boring since you use very few weapons that are unique. It wasn't until my second playthrough of the story that I decided \"fuck it\" and used Cheat Engine so I could survive on the hardest difficulty on the toughest levels to finally get some decent loot. And, suddenly, the game was a lot more fun.\n\nEDF, EDF, EDF.", "timestamp_created": 1497814233, "timestamp_updated": 1497814233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32545036": {"recommendationid": "32545036", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972672549", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514498882}, "language": "english", "review": "Ask yourself have Japan gone too far? then throw youself out of the window!

Alien Shooter 1 and 2 being my favorite, horde shooters are the ultimate boredom-killer for me. I love the mindless joy of slaughtering hundreds and hundreds of enemies, gunning them down like an 80's action hero on a caffine drip. I always thought AS would be the pinnacle of this rare genre for me. And then I discovered EDF.\n\nLittle old you, a soldier among many, are plopped in a massive destructable city crawling with the nightmare of all nightmares: giant freakin bugs! Spiders weaving deadly webs between buildings, swarms of house-sized ants crawling over the roads, massive wasps buzzing about... welcome to hell on Earth.\n\nThere's something incredibly satisfying about this game. Maybe it's the chance to squash the sum of all insectaphobic and arachnifobic fears. Maybe it's the insane array of weapons. Maybe it's the choice between being able to fly around and dispense high-tech death as the Wing Diver class, drive a huge array of vehicles and call in crazy supports as an Air Raider, become a walking tank yourself as a Fencer, or just be a brass-balled badass as a Ranger. Perhaps it's the way the game excells at making the player feel tiny and insignificant among the hordes of oversized creepy-crawlies. Or maybe it's the feeling of being a ruthless war god as you wreck buildings and slaughter alien menaces over decent-sized maps despite being the aformentioned itty-bitty human. \n\nThere are, of course, downsides. The voice acting is hilariously bad. The missions feel roughly the same after a while (although the game does a decent job of throwing new things at you here and there to break that monotony). The level design is a bit limited but does the best it can with its limited resources.

I enlisted in the Earth Defense Force as a Fencer out of four possible choices (and I'll never change). Each class has their own unique philosophy in approaching the extermination of giant insects and it's up to you to find what fits you best. Rangers are reasonably quick and well equipped to battle anything on even terms. Air Raiders deploy vehicles, equipment, and airstrikes to support the combat action. Wing Divers take flight and strike with devastating energy weapons. And finally the Fencer, heavily armored and heavily armed, looks to deal heavy blows with meaningful shots.\n\nWith there being four classes in mind this is where a bit of grinding slog comes into play. All four classes have a massive arsenal of weapons to unlock. Not all of these weapons are immediately useful direct upgrades but the variety, if you're willing to experiment at the cost of possibly being knocked unconscious, is a welcome change of pace from games where everything shoots the same bullets just at a slightly different rate.\n\nThe enemy ranges from basic ants trying to drown you in acid to horrifying alien machines razing the landscape. Ants, spiders, hornets, alien walkers, drones, drop ships, motherships, kaiju, there's quite a line up of enemies that is only doubled by more deadly variants them on higher difficulties. Whilst individually these things are easy to dispatch there's a slightly complicating twist: they'll come at you in furious marauding armies and mobs. It's here that the game can mean two things to you, either its repetitive, or it's a challenge. I've embraced it as a repetitive challenge, one that I'll faithfully meet until I've cleared all the missions on each of the harder difficulties. (But seriously someone please remove spiders)\n\nIf you bring friends (I would recommend bringing friends) or take your game online the difficulty scales with the number of participants. To make this repetitive challenge more interesting, I would strongly encourage playing the multiplayer. Whilst the multiplayer component isn't perfect, the occasional game lobby crash for example, it is well worth it to fight and struggle alongside fellow members of the EDF to save the planet. Some enemies will test your patience. Some missions will test your skill.

Up to hundreds of hours of content if you enjoy the basic premise and gameplay on offer.\n\n[h1]Who is this game for?[/h1]\n\nAnyone who doesn't mind repetitive, mindless third person shooting action.\nAnyone who loves tons of weapon unlockables.\nAnyone who loves poorly translated, B-movie-esque (think the original Resident Evil's, \"Wait!

Do you enjoy shooting giant spiders? Do you enjoy shooting giant ants AND giant spiders? What about huge hordes of them? Do you enjoy shooting enormous hordes, hundreds at a time, of giant ants and giant spiders? What about doing that in completely destructible cities, where every single building can be demolished by your rockets?\n\nDo you enjoy games that allow you to unlock weapons?

What if some of the insects could also fly? What if they were bees, or wasps, or godzilla? Giant hordes of hundreds of wasps, godzillas, flying saucers, robots, ants, spiders, and more, in tons of levels set in destructible cities?\n\nWhat if there was super cheesy, poorly translated dialogue, too? What if your NPC allies kept saying things like, \"It's YOUR turn... bro!\" or, \"If only you freaks had never come here!\" or, \"EDF! EDF! EDF!\" while you were fighting the giant hordes? With the hundreds of weapons. In the fully destructible cities. Possibly in your own giant mech, sometimes.\n\nWould that be fun? \n\nThat's Earth Defense Force in a nut shell. 4.1 is the latest iteration of the series, and the first (from original developer Sandlot, at least,) available on PC. \n\nIf the above scenarios sound at all enjoyable to you, my recommendation is: buy the game. Buy all of its DLC. Buy any future DLC that comes out for it. Then play alone or hop online with your friends, start on the lowest difficulty, and work your way up to more health and better weapons, until you can survive on the harder difficulties. Do it now. The Earth needs Defending. EDF! EDF! EDF! \n\nEr...\n\nAhem. Where was I?\n\n[h1]No, but seriously... WHAT IS IT?[/h1]\n\nEDF is a third person shooter in which you choose one of several character classes, and battle against waves of progressively more challenging alien invaders consisting primarily of insects and machines... with some surprises thrown in.\n\nGenerally, you will begin the game at the lowest possible difficulty, and then play through an enormous number of somewhat repetitive but increasingly difficult levels, while farming for armor (HP) and weapons. You can replay levels as many times as you like, finding those best suited for farming, to better prepare for future levels. \n\nYou can then play through the levels on higher difficulty settings, which will result in new and better weapon drops. This continues until you reach a point where you are capable of beating the game on the hardest difficulty, where enemies move faster, do (and soak up) more damage, and kill you more quickly.\n\nThe first few levels are nothing to write home about in terms of the number of enemies on screen. Eventually though, you'll be facing huge waves of spiders and ants, backed by flying saucers that drop yet more enemies, flying drones, huge mechanized walking fortresses, giant robots taller than buildings juggling you through the air with lasers... you get the idea.\n\nTrust me... it gets I N S A N E...\n\nVisuals are very \"meh\" by design. This is part of a simple, low budget series in Japan, intended to provide the most content possible at the lowest price. And in that regard, provided you enjoy the game, it definitely delivers. You can spend hundreds of hours in this game, and the quantity of enemies, weapons, and the sheer levels of insane, at times overwhelming action, are a lot of fun. \n\nIt's an incredibly simple premise, but the result in practice is a very challenging, enjoyable shooter that will keep you busy for a long, long time... possibly for years.\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\nExtreme amount of content\nExtreme challenge in later levels, at high difficulties, demanding practice, patience, and grinding/farming to survive\nHUGE numbers of enemies on screen at a time\nRidiculous assortment of weapons\nRuns great on fairly low-end to mid-tier hardware\nFull controller support\nActive online playerbase, albeit somewhat small\nFully functional online AND offline co-op. \n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\nSimplistic graphics\nCan be extremely repetitive\nNo real storyline to speak of, apart from brief level introductions and radio chatter\nCan be VERY challenging, and VERY time consuming if you plan to 100% the game\nFrame rate dips may become common on lower end hardware during the largest enemy wave spawns (this has become a staple of the series though, so for some this is a good thing...)\n\nAll in all, the ultimate B-movie third person shooter. I love it. I've been playing the series since 2017 on Xbox 360, but it goes back further than that.\n\nNOTE: If you'd like a game with the same basic premise, but more of a \"Western\" feel, and some more polish, check out Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon, made by a different developer, in consulation with Sandlot. Sandlot are the developers of the originals, including 4.1, however. Personally, I prefer Sandlot's games - including 4.1 - but I did find IA enjoyable for what it was, too.

Going down the easy normal or hard ski courses will be fun for the first few times, but eventually it will start to feel like the same thing over and over again. The missions are always very similar to one another with minor and major changes to shake up the experience. Going on the lower difficulties will sometimes offer a challenge though, basically they lodged fucking rocks in the ski hills that you have to overcome. \n\nThese missions are sometimes extremely difficult and will be almost incompletable without the help of another  player in up to 4-player coop. When you play on hardest or inferno however, they will lodge a whole lot more fucking rocks in the hill and it will feel like you aren't making any progress, but I feel like this is where the game shines the most on an enjoyment level. You will have to plan out each action you or your friends take, and learn from each failure while trying different weapons to complete different challenges. You will have to all work together and coordinate yourselves to overcome some of the huge boulders that will impede your progress. Sadly, if these take too long it will feel like you won't be making any progress, but if you are looking to not mindlessly shoot bugs and actually think and plan out your actions, then the harder difficulties are for you. \n\nNot to say that the lower difficulties aren't fun and can't be hard because they will kick you in the teeth every now and then, and I think if you like making constant progress and trying newer and cooler weapons, the lower difficulties are for you. It can feel like a crawl when you try very hard to complete a mission on hardest, only to find out you still have a 1% completion rate. Overall the game will make you very angry but also will bring you some of the greatest times I've ever had in a video game. The difficulty spikes are rediculous and most of the time after completing that hard mission you will go back to it being incredibly easy, but it is still fun nonetheless.

I put about the same amount of time in this game on PS4 before buying it on steam just to play with my steam friends. There's not much to say about this game that hasn't been said in other reviews. It's pure mindless fun. \n\nDisclaimer: The game is kind of boring on single player. Get a friend for local co-op or go online for up to 4p co-op (you cannot local-cop + online co-op, unfortunately).\n\nIt's a tongue-in-cheek killfest with over-the-top weapons, ridiculous plot (if you want to call it that), and cheesy voice acting. This game is the epitome of how gameplay can be so much fun that you don't need professional actors, hi-res graphics, or deep story. It's like an homage to games of ye olden days when you just needed a controller (or m/k) and something to shoot. No regenerating lifebars (pick up your health drops on the field like a real soldier!) Infinite ammo (on most weapons, but you still have to reload). \n\nThe only thing I can think of to make this game batter would be a level editor.

Almost 200 of them, in the base game. This is split between multiplayer exclusive missions, and singleplayer missions, roughly 50/50 but I believe MP has slightly more. \nThere's 4 playable classes, ranging in their complexity, but all of them have pretty much the same effectiveness so it's all about how you feel like playing. You can be the typical grunt armed to the teeth with grenades, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, machine guns, shotguns, pretty much anything. You can call in support vehicles in another class, like tanks or air strikes, or even deploy turrets. You can play an [spoiler]anime waifu[/spoiler] air mech suit, with high damage weapons but low health, or be a hulking walking suit of armor that's the equivalent to about 5 tanks.\nThere's an absolute ton of weapons, each of them pretty distinct. Few weapons are direct upgrades of previous ones, having small tweaks, making them more of a sidegrade. E.G. More ammo, faster firerate but slightly longer reload times and less damage. Or grenade launchers will either be timed or explode on impact, and some missle launchers have shorter lock on range, some lack lock on, and some burst fire.\nThe missions themselves get stupidly insane the further you go in, it starts out almost boring for the first 5 or so, but soon you're knee deep in bugs and mechs, and you'll be crying for more allies to assist you. They aren't exremely long, either. Most will take 10-15 minutes each, making them short and sweet. \nMultiplayer seems fine for the few hours I've played, runs well and despite my awful net there's not too much rubber banding going on. Best played with friends, obviously, but randoms will do fine. \n\nThere's a few bugs (hah) here and there, I blew myself out the map once when I shot myself with a rocket accidentally, and the AI is absolutely braindead at times. (They'll try to shoot enemies through walls and buildings, or in the underground missions they'll leap off and be unable to walk back up. Though the game compensates these sections by adding fresh units at the end, so no biggie.) \nAlso, some missions require explosives or some other means capable of killing large ships that spawn enemies, if you bring guns that don't reach high enough to destroy these, you can't win the mission. It's a little annoying, but it does state in the briefing what you'll be fighting, so it can be put down to your own fault. (Though at one point I brought a lock-on rocket launcher that couldn't hit a ship that was placed unusally high, that one annoyed me a bit.)\n\nAll things considered, the game's fantastic, and if you enjoy senseless murder of bugs with a huge and stupidly fun arsenal of weapons and classes, then you'll get a great kick out of this.

I joke alot about this game, it's hard not to but I'm completely honest when I say that this is probably one of the most entertaining games I've ever played. I'm a hundred hours in and I still play it from time to time.\n\nI would say EDF 4.1 is perhaps one of the purest examples of videogame entertainment. There's no original story or fancy graphics like most of the AAA titles. In fact, it's the complete opposite. The story is like your typical B-Action Movie, the graphics are like playing an outdated PS2 game and the voice acting is absolutely terrible. And these are exactly the reasons why I love it and what gives the game it's charm. It's a japanese game so playing EDF is like listening to a terrible english dub from your typical anime, it's absolutely hilarious. And let's not forget about the EDF songs, that you can happily sing together with all of your troops on the battlefield.\n\nThere's also a surprising amount of replayability. The 4 classes you can pick from all play diffirently and have a ridiclous amount of weapons you can unlock, you could play all the missions over and over again with these classes and it would never be the same. You can mow down waves of insects with ridiculous weapons and feel like a demi-god or get your ass handed to to on the Inferno difficulty (seriously, Dark Souls is a stroll through the park compared to Inferno.)\n\nWhat I like is that not every mission is just: shoot down enemies, wait for next wave, repeat. No. In fact, most missions actually require some careful choices about which weapons you pick and an actual strategy. \n\nOh, and if you can convince a friend to buy it (despite it's high price, which is the only downside) like I did, play co-op! Playing the co-op missions with a friend was some of the most fun I've ever had, probably on the same level of enjoyment as Borderlands 2.\n\nI cannot recommend this game more, seriously.

The production values, graphics, sound design (okay actually the sound design is pretty great, never mind), level design, story, and dialogue are all pretty mediocre.\n\nHowever, the game takes all these mediocre parts and cobbles them together in such a way that it accidentally turns out fantastic, which blows me away every time I load the game. It's not that it's \"so bad it's good,\" because it's not. No part of this game is \"bad.\" It's just *average*, which really doesn't matter because performing guage managment and blasting ants to smithereens with Wing Diver is the most pure and childlike fun I've had in a video game since Twisted Metal 2.\n\nThat said, there are some legitimately great points to this game, which are namely the things that a game of this genre *must* get right in order for it to be a cohesive experience, and those are the music and the weapon variety. The OST is well-made and, while a bit campy, is exactly what needs to be playing in the background of some of the more ridiculous missions.\n\nThe weapon variety is what makes this game, though. Where the dialogue and story fail to get you wrapped up in this world of hope, despair, and lasers, the driving force of \"oh gosh I wonder what batshit insane weapon I'll unlock this time\" will suck you in and strap you down for the wildest ride this side of the Pacific.\n\nHighly recommended.

the game for you.\n\nEDF4.1 is a game in which increasingly over-the-top waves of monsters attack and need to be defeated by you and your team of up to 3 other players, doing so will grant you with more powerful weapons and increased health to be used in future missions. As such the game follows a Diablo-esque progression of completing the game on one difficulty to get better gear and max health in order to do it all over again in the next difficulty.\n\nThere are 4 classes each with enough variety of gear to fit almost any play style, each one has to be levelled independently though so you are expected to pick a class and stick with it (similar to an RPG).\n\nThe game isn't without slight annoyances though like how the first few levels are incredibly boring before things really start to pick up in terms of intensity. The most major complaint by far though is the loot system. In this game every monster has a chance to drop crates which signify either an upgrade in weaponary or in armour. Not picking up these chests sufficiently will render your weapons and armour ineffective for later levels but due to the low movement speed of the characters, combined with the \"move to next checkpoint\"-nature of some missions, this breaks the flow of the game considerably.\n\nOn the technical side of things it's important for some of you to know that the game is a console port and as such is locked to 60FPS, there's also no LAN and disconnecting from the internet or Steam at any point during a mission will instantly kick you out without any rewards or chance at reconnecting.\n\nThat being said, the sheer carnage and ludricrousness of it all, combined with excellent class and loadout differentiation makes this truly one of the great co-op games.", "timestamp_created": 1490442907, "timestamp_updated": 1490442907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30724832": {"recommendationid": "30724832", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998257448", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 13998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502887805}, "language": "english", "review": "This is essentially a science-fiction Just Cause, sans open world, but with all the senseless destruction you could possibly wish for.

and their dream to become the greatest exterminators known to man.\n\nAn actual serious review(?) below. More of a like, overview, but, whatever. I've mostly played 2025 on ps3 and 4.1 on Ps4. Only recently bought 4.1 on steam.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEDF 4.1 is a remastered version of 2025 with additional content such as a few extra missions, few new weapons, some new enemies, and the first and second dlcs from 2025 are bundled together as the first dlc of 4.1.\nGame runs well, haven't had any crash problems despite the rediculous about of shit you can blow up at the same time. locked at 60fps, idk how to change it if it's possible, personally don't care with a game like this.\nIf you're expecting a game with an enriching story, this is probably not the game for you. EDF 4.1 is just a game about killing bugs from the aliens and how much damage you can inflict on the city over the insects.\nOver the top weapons that start of fairly basic such as gatling guns, rocket launches, rifle, beam rapiers, etc and begin to become more and more insane as you progress at obtaining higher leveled equipment throughout the 5 difficulties.\n\n[h1]4 classes to choose from:[/h1]\n[b]-Ranger:[/b] Typical soldier with basic shit. Spine of steel that can now roll through cars and other small obstacles. Easiest to play imo. Easy to pick up and pew pew the insects away. Uses your typical soldier weapons that advance into things such as hand held gatling gun assault rifles and multishot plasma rocket launches that can level a quarter of the city on their own\n\n[b]-Wing Diver:[/b] Aka: Waifu Diver. Flies. Uses energy to reload weapons and to fly. Personally I find them the hardest to start (note: I always play on hard+, hard if i'm starting to get gear for a class or if I'm not very geared with them) cause of them being the weakest armor wise and don't enjoy playing them. Using laser and beam weapons. Amazing if you have an Air Raider to keep you charged up for your high costing, high damaging weapons.\n\n[b]-Air Raider:[/b] Support class. rains air strikes, artillery strikes, satellite lasers, as well as calling in vehicles that he and, 99% of the time, the Ranger can only drive (not including side guns to vehicles). Has healing pods, armor pods, energy walls that seem to always kill me rather than protect me, sticky grenade gun thing that you usually detonate manually. Kinda annoying to start off with if you're solo cause of how their weapons work. Strikes and weapons typically run on a \"credit\" system which you get by killing enemies. Basically you usually don't reload, you, or your allies, have to kill in order to reload your equipment most of the time. Amazing with other players, love having one seeing as I have a habit of blowing myself up by accident with Fencer.\n\n-[b]Fencer:[/b] Big dude with big guns. Slow. starts with most armor. Slow. Motars, gatling guns, hand held artillery, melee and shields, and lamp post sized cruise missles that 9/10 times ends up causing us to lose because the Air Raider thought it was funny to guide the missle into a bulding and killing all of us. My personal favorite to use since i just find it satisfying to use their weapons. Easy to start off with but harder (i guess? harder than the rest imo due to your typical slowness and the damage ramp up on enemies. As well as the Fencer's weapons don't get as buffed up stat wise as other classes do) to use later on higher difficulties. Slow. Boost canceling makes you move fast, but, you are still slow.\n\n[b]tldr: nonsensical story that doesn't take itself seriously, pick a class you like, blow up most of the city and kill insects while you do it.[/b]\n\nRemember, the aliens can't take over the city if there's no city left standing for them to take.", "timestamp_created": 1490007905, "timestamp_updated": 1490008280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660627", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30627182": {"recommendationid": "30627182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257108554", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489969531}, "language": "english", "review": "Really does a number on the computer and seems to freeze or glitch out the graphics with no real way to see the mouse", "timestamp_created": 1489970130, "timestamp_updated": 1489970130, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.176858", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30579233": {"recommendationid": "30579233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041768246", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510094766}, "language": "english", "review": "You aren't a real man until you have summoned in a gigantic robot to squash ants, punch cyborgs, clobber spiders, and way more enemies. \n\nESF 4.1 is a Third Person Loot Based shooter, that has a quite a bit of guns, good classes, vehicles, and plenty of missions to keep you entertained for quite awhile, squashing bugs with nuclear devices, and overpowered weapons has never been more enjoyable for me. \n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1489792947, "timestamp_updated": 1489792947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30569801": {"recommendationid": "30569801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122887140", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514951279}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh Boy where to start with this game.

You can play 4 different classes on 89 different missions with 5 different difficulties with 800 weapons. You fight everything from bugs to giant death robots to fricken Godzillas. You go doing missions in different enviroments with a suprisingly amount of variety. I first thought this game would just get repetitive but it doesn't, it keeps a great amount of variety in every mission with new enemies, new places and new objectives. Oh and also practically every building is destructable. Level the city with giant mortars, Call in a giant pacific Rim mech and punch buildings and crushing homes WHILE FIGHTING GODZILLA. This game is also pretty challenging and not a walk in the park game, later missions require strategy especially if you are playing solo. I highly recommend picking this game up with friends though because Co op is way more fun than solo. If you wanna spend countless hours in a game with co op friends and have a insane amount of fun, buy this game.

Its just a absolute carnage fest. \nIf you are a type of person who wants to be engaged in the story, this is not for you. But if you are the type of person who just wants to have downright fun. This is for you. This game is really satisfying to play by just the over the top carnage and destruction it holds, like fighting millions of ants charging at you while you just spray dual wielded miniguns at them, or soaring across the sky and causing death from above. Maybe you instead throw in a smoke grenade that causes the entire area to be a killzone of bombardment. Or step into a Pacific Rim Jaeger and just smash smaller alien mechs to pieces and duke it out with Godzilla like dinosaurs.

I can however see this being offputting for some people who don't really enjoy such straight forward and ignoring story aspects. The game price might also dent some people's wallets as they are not rich, so i do not blame you for not getting this just for that. \n\nThis game may or may not be for you.

all sides, only to get batted down as you boost straife away firing flak and piercing the sky with a pneumatic spear doding all their lasers , pausing briefly to leap 100 feet in the air and mow them down from within with duel miniguns, is some of the most fun I have ever had. And things only get crazier from here.\n\nUgly graphics are quickly forgotten as you choose the weapons perfect for each level, before jumping into the frey and having a blast. Do anything from playing on easy just to relax, enjoy some chaos, and feel like a god, to playing on inferno for some of the most difficult challenges of your life. Coop only enhances things that much more.\n\nNot necessarily perfect, but I'm not understating anything when I say that it doesn't have to be. This game is just a blast. Have a friend over and play some split screen, play alone and go through the campaign, with each difficulty level adding something new so that replayability is 100%, try all the different classes, each one offering a unique, and awesome experience. \n\nJust get this game.

Ever since then I've had an obsession with this series that has made me yearn for it to have both online multiplayer and a version on the PC. This was an instant day-1 purchase from me.\n\nWell 4.1 finally delivers! A Sandlot developed version of EDF on steam with freakin 4 player co-op! There's something really special about this game that makes it more than just mindless ant slaying. On higher difficulties and especially with friends, the game suddenly reveals that even as dumb as it appears on the surface, it can be a real challenge sometimes. Working together with friends to come up with plans and strategies to beat that inferno level you've died 10 times on can be insanely rewarding when you finally refine your approach and strategy to the point where you stand victorious over a mountian of giant bug corpses, with a post mission success screen filled with new and powerful weapons you can use in your next battle.\n\nIt truly is something special.\n\nAnd THAT'S just the successful missions!

So ridiculously repetitive.\n-The audio. Do the developers not know of the low end of the audio spectrum?\n\nPros:\n+It is perfect <3\n\n   No, seriously. This carries with it that same phenonmenon that Dynasty Warriors does: so bad it is good, except this does it way better. I just do not know how to describe it. This is one of those games that was built around the Gameplay pillar of a game and threw everything else out(story, graphics, quality), so what you get is a game that focuses on only the gameplay, and it all the more fun because of it. It is cheesey. It is repetitive. It is ugly. It is a blast to play.\nLet me repeat that last part:\nIt is a blast to play.\n\n   On top of having 80+ missions to play, 4 character classes to experience, and 5 difficulties to try it all out on, there is also an included online and splitscreen co-op feature that has you playing through the same amazing game together with your buddies. A great component that pushes the replayability is that you only unlock certain weapons at certain difficulty levels. Want a tri-shot plasma cannon that can wipe out a whole city block in one shot? Play on \"Hardest\" Difficulty, level 53-61. Want an airstrike that will destroy every badguy on screen, every building, your friends, and you? Play on \"Inferno\" difficulty, level 74. Yes, weapons like that do really exist.\n\n   The classes are also all fun to play as. You have the standard Ranger that has access to standard military gear (minus the vehicles) and access to drive vehicles. You have the Air Raider that has access to auto weapons, remote weapons, team buff utilities, vehicles, and airstrikes. You have the Fencer that has access to powerful swords, shields, gatling guns, shoulder mounted rockets, and gets to hold 4 weapons at once. Lastly, there is the WingDiver that flies and had a bunch of energy based weapons.\n\nThis game is not a diamond in the rough, but more like the less valuable oxygen that everyone can appreciate for what it is. I can see how this won't be for everyone.

This? Its epic.\n\nEDF 4.1 is a MASSIVE array of levels (100+) in which you shoot hordes and hordes and hordes of enemies both bug and alien, in ultra-destructible environments, with up to 3 friends assisting. There are 4 classes of character to pick from, each with hundreds of weapons. Think Pacific Rim and Independence Day wrapped inside a solid Starship Troopers case. Literally. The scale is often unbelievable.\n\nYour equipment may be unlocked by collecting weapon crates dropped by enemies, as with armour. You reap these rewards *if* you successfully complete a mission. Once unlocked, the assets are permanently available for that class. Armour collection improves your class`s maximum hit points.

The game is very very simple. You shoot bugs, get loot from them (weapons and armor) then do this repeatedly. Sounds boring right? Not at all.\n\nMe and a friend have played 2017, Insect Armageddon and 2025. This one is the premier of the bunch. If Insect Armageddon was your first I am sorry because that's just a mediocre experience compared to these.\n\nGameplay:\nThere are 4 separate classes with all unique attributes and weapons. \n\n-Fencer is a slow moving armored soldier (if he's too slow look of dash canceling)\n-Air Raider which is a supportive type character that can lay down healing beacons, vehicles and call down airstrikes and orbital beams\n-Wing Diver is a jump jet trooper that uses the sky to assault. Has laser and plasma based weaponry. Has an interesting functionality where if you shoot your gun or reload it it drains jet pack fuel. So it's something you have to manage well.\n-Ranger is a bread and butter basic soldier. Just solid in firepower and movement.\n\nAmmo is infinite for almost every gun and it's balanced by reload times. (Some weapons specify how much you can use it)\nGuns range from hilariously bad and niche to wicked godly and just plain cool.\n\nMovement for every character is unique and takes time to master.\n\nStory\nYeah, story is interesting. From playing all the titles on the console at least the most I can tell is that Aliens have sent giant bugs to exterminate humans back in 2017 and they buried themselves underground and have now came back. Something like that. You can tell the series seriously borrows from old B movie type plots especially in the tear inducing dialog that will make you laugh so damn hard. It's fantastic if you love cheesyness and ham levels to the max.\n\nGame engine\nThis is what makes this game great. The maps are huge, sometimes cycled through its vast amount of levels (80+) and every building is destructible. If something is in the way blow it up. The way the enemies react to explosives are also great. Shoot a rocket or throw a grenade and bugs will go sky high or fly out in bits in a different direction. Just makes it so much more fun.\n\nGraphics are lack luster, however they gotta be. You are fighting sometimes an upwards of 100 units plus firing weapons that sometimes have 100+ projectiles AND your partners if you are playing with them in a vast environment. Settings from the menu as I understand are hardly tweakable. Bout the most you can do is change Anti Aliasing. This game ran fine on a GTX 1070 with an i7 6700k.\n\nThere are hundreds of weapons to collect, hundreds of hours to sink in, and hundreds of memories to make with friends.\n\nWell?

Especially in Coop.\n\nYou choose one out of 4 classes that have their own way of playing kinda and do missions in various difficulties. You get new weapons and more max HP as you progress, unlocking more powerful weapons or hilarious prototypes..or both :3 The game also has many different enemies and enemy types, also really big ones which is alot of fun and reminds me of the one or other monster movie :D\n\nAlso just about anything is destructible, its all not too fancy and the game is quite glitchy but its nice. Even though the glitches are more annoying overall...Its incredible annoying of how unpolished the game feels, it can be fun at times but usually you got rather gamebreaking bugs like being in a tunnel and they attack through walls for example. Or through buildings /=\n\nHowever, the game has some issues...As above, the gameplay is great but the grinding is retarded.\n\nI dont mind the grind in itself but some \"additions\" are making it dumb and annoying, making you feel frustrated.\n\n- You gain armor way too slow as the game progresses or as you play higher difficulties while difficulty has no impact on the armor you get\n\n- R N G / Its all random! its a general problem if you ask me. You can do a mission and dont get much armor or more worse, weapons. Despite that the mission just now was on a higher difficulty and hard.\n\n- Difficulty -> Problem is that if you watch the ranges of the difficulties about the weapon they drop is that you\u00b4ll realize the pool is far too big, you often will have lvl 1-30 weapons you dont need, or often weapons you already have while anything that is useful is like lvl 50+ in combination with the RNG you at times barely get something..\n\nSo yeah I recommend it because the game is fun but be aware that the grind is tedious and has a pretty retarded system. The game is also rather glitchy/buggy so enjoy dying from that a few times at least. Certain enemies tend to shoot through buildings/walls.

I honestly can not remember the last time a game was able to put such an immovable shit eating grin on my face. EDF is just a pure joy, instantly playable (The telling hallmark of all would be classics), instantly impressive and constantly [b]FUN[/b].\n\nNot sure what [b]Sandlot[/b] were thinking when they dreamt this masterpiece into existence, but I for one am sure glad that they did. In a world of proper naff games that take themselves way too seriously, with awesome graphics but drab mechanics and forced plotlines. Along comes this little sparkling gem to remind everyone how it is done. And also to remind everyone that gamers are supposed to be thoroughly entertained and to be getting some level of enjoyment.\n\nEDF delivers this by the bucket load, with a plot so ridiculous and as over the top as the action that is thrown at you, full force from the screen. You take the roll of one of four classes of soldier, determined to thwart the onslaught of an alien invasion. These invaders, although many in variety, really come in just two simple variations. The ones that are many in number and the ones that are massive in size. The size of the enemy waves and the size of their largest units can only be seen to be believed. They are many and simply HUGE. It's unreal the scale of some of these things and the numbers in which they attack. It is literally that impressive.\n\nLuckily you have a huge arsenal of over the top, quite inventive weapons to choose from. [b]800[/b] in all, if [b]Sandlots[/b] spiel is to be believed. You start with a set of basic stuff, but you then unlock various random items after completing each mission. The harder the difficulty you play that mission, will depend on the quality of the rewards at the end. I at the time of writing this, haven't even unlocked a fraction of what's potentially available. And Some of the stuff I have managed to equip is so damn ludicrous, but all necessary for what awaits you in each successive battlefield.\n\nI did read in the review section on here from a fellow Steam user, that EDF was a game where you \"[i]level cities to save cities from insects trying to level cities[/i]\" (and the rest heh). And that is about as accurate as a description of the general ins and outs of the game as you're going to get. The scale of the destruction that you rain down upon the invading alien army is phenomenal. Watch gobsmacked as entire city blocks from small holdings, homes, to huge towering skyscrapers get utterly demolished in the wake of your defensive measures, as you try to save planet Earth from the onslaught.\n\nOf course such incredible amounts of pixels, bouncing around the screen does come at the cost of graphical quality, at least compared to most games these days. But they are functional enough and despite whatever is lacking, it still looks great. You won't have time to be worried about the lack of polish here and there, when there is so much polish in every other aspect of the game. And with that said, the graphics are very clean cut, bright and cheerful. Setting a real wild contrast against the doom laden scenerios that you will have to face.\n\nEDF also features something of a very rare occurance for PC games, in the form of [b]SPLIT SCREEN CO-OP[/b]. As well as a four player online Co-Op mode and of course, the usual Single Player campaign. All levels are interchangable between each mode and there are plenty in the base game alone to be getting your teeth into (Around 80 I believe). Then there's some great value DLC to go with that. One offering a massive 50 level extention.\n\nIn terms of the Multiplayer aspect, it seems a shame that EDF 4.1 does not boast a very large community (or so it seems). With the playerbase split between who has what gear. It does appear that high end veteran players, seem a little reluctant to backtrack and give aid to the noobs, more than likely because of the reward / loot system that's in place. Which does feel like this could be a bit of let down. Especially if you're just starting out in this incredible title. So having a few friends on board to Co-Op with may be a bit of a necessity (to begin with at least).\n\nAs with all games that feature some sort ot rudimentary levelling system. The starting gear isn't really all that great for any of the classes. And the first few levels aren't really all that much of an introduction to the fiery Heck that awaits. Giving you just a hint of the shear insanity that's around the corner. Hanging in there will reward you with one \"[b]WTF[/b]\" moment after another. As you'll stare in wonder and amazement at just how on Earth you are going to win the day through all the bullets, giant insects, giant robots, spiders and all the other mental creations that will inevitabley end up in your crosshairs.\n\nTo go along with the scale of the battles that are occuring, this also means that you're going to need a lot of space to move around in. And some of the maps are of quite a decent size in order to incorporate all the action. And the missions themselves will take a decent amount of time to complete, for the most part. \n\nBesides the possibility of a splitscreen partner or Full Co-Op team, you will never have to fight alone. Not even in Single player, as there will be other EDF soldiers on each level to fight along side you. When prompted by a simple arrow pointer above an individual unit or squad, you can take charge of them. Using a very simple point and click mechanic to issue simple \"go there\" or \"attack that\" commands. You can also communicate with your fellow troops through a basic chat wheel. In which your squad mates will more than likely respond. As well as constantly chatting amongst themselves with some brilliantly witty and instantly quotable one liners. Such as :\n\n\"[b][i]If you want to eat tonight, you'd better win ![/i][/b]\"\n\nAs well as the constant shouting of \"[b]E D F[/b]\" and the hearty singing of the EDF anthem. Which is so cheery and uplifting in the warzones that it just doesn't ever get old. This basic chat wheel, along with a few other options, can also be used to send basic messages, instructions, greetings and warnings to your fellow Co-Op players too. \n\n[h1][b]So finally ![/b][/h1]\nYou can just take my word for it, watch some videos on Youtube or ignore this completely. But if you even consider yourself to be a gamer in any respect. You really should not miss out on this wonderful, crazy, beautiful game. Get your hand in your wallet and get this diamond title purchased. Sales are always good (always). But even at full fare, this is one of those rare occasions where it might actually be worth every single penny spent. And will be more than worth every minute wasted on this brash, bright, noisey fun soaked game.\n\nJust get it ! I can't think of any other game of late, that is more deserving of a [b]perfect 10 / 10[/b] than this.\n\nIt is quite simply, that fucking great.\n\nThat \"[b][i]Overwhelmingly Positive[/i][/b]\" Steam review score is there for a reason...\n[h1][b]\nEDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF EDF [/b][/h1]\n\nThe EDF Deploys...\nF**k YEAH !", "timestamp_created": 1484224682, "timestamp_updated": 1488904761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644159", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29199444": {"recommendationid": "29199444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070863903", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 17049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 77, "last_played": 1516426971}, "language": "english", "review": "Im almost dissapointed that on my new computer,  EDF doesnt lag everytime i blow up a huge ship.\nAlmost.", "timestamp_created": 1484210539, "timestamp_updated": 1484210539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29197609": {"recommendationid": "29197609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068295675", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "last_played": 1515957881}, "language": "english", "review": "A video game that perfectly emulates 80's b-movies.

You come to find out the earth has been invaded and these aliens are using huge bugs to take down the world. You start off with 4 classes Wing Diver, Ranger, Fencer, and Air Raider. Oh and its 4 player CO OP ONLINE!\n\nThis game does something that many games cannot do correctly and that is SCALE! The game makes big fights feel big and big enemies feel tough and sometimes you feel like you are in \"OH SHIII\" moments. There are a huge amount of bugs and robots and everything. The levels range from Different parts of a City which anything can be destroyed. ANY BUILDING CAN BE BLOWN INTO PIECES! It feels good when you see a bunch of baddies on the radar but there are a huge amount of buildings blocking you. You decide to pull out the Signal for the Airstrike to nuke the area and it does exactly that with a flat battle ground to enjoy. Even underground caverns that are seriously dark and hard to navigate sometimes. You have some levels out in the country which is a nice change of pace. There are vehicles, mechs, airstrikes, missile summons, tanks, Starlight cannons, ect, ect ect, The list can keep going on for ages as there are over 700 weapons to enjoy in this game.\n\nThe Ranger is the best starting class as he has a good selection of weapons and can pretty much get any level done with his starting weapons. He has decent speed but to make him go faster you must run and jump at an angle in order to run faster. His weapons range from Machine guns, Sniper Rifles, Rocket Launchers, Grenades, and a bunch of other things. There are different levels of weapons with different affects. They are not random everything is set in stone. \n\nWing Diver can FLY! and hey its a woman neat. She uses weapons based on her plasma and she has to balance her plasma for flying and her weapons which can be difficult but satisfying. She has beautiful weapons that light up the area. Electric sniper rifles that blow up into bolts of electricity everywhere once they hit anything. Sniper Rifles that are just lasers. Plasma Launchers that are huge explosive Dragonball z like energy balls that blow up anything in its path.\n\nAir Raider is my personal favorite. He is a support class but he can summon some serious stuff. He can summon some of the strongest weapons in the game and he has the ability to summon vehicles even giant mechs that can beat the crap out of anything. He has totems he can set down to boost damage or defense. He can give the wing diver little boosts to give her more plasma energy. He can make vehicles come down that are medic vans that heal if your teammates get into it. He has not very many close range weapons alone but he makes up with his interest limpet gun that shoots these little light darts and  you can detonate them anytime you wish.\n\nFencer at first glance Fencer might seem like a horrible class that has a horribly slow speed and is pointless as a character. Well that is okay to think that but you are completely wrong. The Fencer is one of the neatest characters and second fastest to the Wing Diver. He can dash and shield cancel and dash again to go super fast. Now there are other ways to go even faster like the Javelin cannon which any one of you can look up. He can also equip 2 sets of weapons meaning 4 weapons in all! Meaning you can do a quick move setup to move around the map fast and then the second set can be a heavy loadout with cannons and rockets. He is very underused but once people start to realize his true power he will become one of the heaviest used.\n\nThe voice acting is on point and the lines will have you rolling sometimes, the explosions are sexy as hell. All in all I think this is one of the best games on steam and I am so happy it made it. The game also has a lot of replayablity as it has a interesting system that makes you collect red boxes that make your max health rise. The Green boxes are loot which are like gold. \n\nIf anyone is curious to see my gameplay here is a video\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jiDK8RU5kU", "timestamp_created": 1484194330, "timestamp_updated": 1484194330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586737", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29196441": {"recommendationid": "29196441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000025966", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499485687}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just really, really good.

If you answered yes to any of those, then you'll love EDF.\n\nYou take control of a member of the storm team, a group of Soldiers in the Earth Defense Force tasked with protecting the human race from a malevolent alien race known as the ravagers. They have giant ants, spiders, wasps, walkers,  giant spaceships, robots, and even giant spaceships that turn into robots!\n\nOverall it's a really challenging and fun game to play and amazing to play with friends. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]Compared to EDF 2025[/h1]\n\nAs someone who has played every one of the EDF games on Xbox, I can say witout a doubt this one is my favorite. I like this so much more than EDF 2025 (The original Xbox 360 game is was ported from), and for many reasons.\n\n1. In the xbox version, your framerate would go to hell as soon as you got anymore than 200 enemies in your immediate vicinity. I have a pretty average PC and I have yet to have any framerate or lag problems in this game.\n\n2. The modified the levels to male it feel like you're actually in a war. Before, there fould only be ground soldiers, and despite the fact that the EDF had access to a wide array of vehicles, only storm team would ever use them. Now, the NPC EDF soldiers have vehicles, which actually makes it feel like the human race is really giving everything they've got to save Earth.\n\n3. NEW WEAPONS!

Though some compare it to Dynasty Warriors, the only real resemblance there is that you are up against a large number of enemies and it is a Japanese-made console port.   I would say this game is something quite unique - what other games are third person shooters involving blowing away giant ants being dropped by UFOs?\n\nFar and away the most unique feature of this game is the satirical flavor.  It is a game where everything is only [i]pretending[/i] to be serious.  And I mean everything.  The dialogue is a neverending calvalcade of perfectly delivered grade-A B-movie shtick.  At first, you might think it is just bad engrish.  No, it's [i]deliberately[/i] running the fine line between just serious enough to pretend they mean it and then obviously not as the show goes on.  The design of the four classes make sense until you realize it does not.  Giant insects and floaty UFOs seem like a great threat until you realize there's no way they could be.  The soldiers can [i]sing and dance[/i]... [b]sing and dance[/b]!  It's all one big work of satire.\n\nHowever, just because the setting is a joke does not mean the gameplay is worthless.  Actually, the gameplay is more along the lines of Serious Sam in a way: the hordes of enemies exist for you to have fun just blowing them away.  Blow them away you shall.  At times, the sheer amount of things being blown away generates feelings of awe.  The game has bullet hell moments, such as when trying to bring down a mothership or being pursued by dozens of giant hornets firing steel stingers at you.  Something about the way they utilized this engine is just too rarely done: don't overthink it, stop worrying that the polygon count looks over a decade old, it's just plain fun!\n\nThere's over 90 fixed scenarios to play, and a lot of replay value because you could try to beat them all with all four classes (a grunt, a vehicle user, a flying suit user, and a heavy suit user) at four different difficulty levels (as easy difficulty does not grant an achievement) and end up with hundreds of hours of play.  Each class has different sets of equipment, and doing missions at higher difficulty unlocks chances to unlock those pieces when collecting weapon crates, so there's more incentive to replay than just achievements.\n\nThe PC port of the interface seems to work rather well, both on mouse/keyboard and on gamepad.  It includes two multiplayer modes.  Local split-screen for up to two players and online on the Internet for up to four players, but the two multiplayer modes cannot be activated simultaneousy.  Though standard resolutions are supported, ultrawide is not natively supported, but a hex hack exists to get it to play well at that aspect ratio with minimal artifacts, and the UI scales well to it.\n\nThe main downside is that there are some incompatibilities with AMD systems.  I had to turn my NVIDIA settings to \"performance\" mode to stop it from causing major hitching on my AMD FX-8120 processor, but my Intel-based laptop did not have that problem.  The AMD Phenom reputably suffered the most incompatibilities at release, I do not know if later patches have fixed that.  \n\nOverall, EDF 4.1 just plain fun.  Not the deepest game, but the breadth of content, over-the-top explosions, and constant tongue-in-cheekery more than make up for it.", "timestamp_created": 1483504205, "timestamp_updated": 1483587284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28995798": {"recommendationid": "28995798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319656177", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507042823}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u624d\u525b\u7528\u5973\u5175\u6253\u5b8cnormal \n\u597d\u7d2f\u554a\n\u5f8c\u9762\u9084\u6709\u96e3 \u8d85\u96e3 \u5730\u7344 \u600e\u9ebc\u8fa6\u963f", "timestamp_created": 1483500837, "timestamp_updated": 1483500837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28993226": {"recommendationid": "28993226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115059918", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503926772}, "language": "english", "review": "EDF!!

As you'd think you start out weak with low armor and shitty guns, but as you collect weapon and armor crate drops from the enemies you get more health and better guns in a varitey of types, those allow you can handle more hardcore fights.\n\n The best part is when you get your friends involved and play through the hectic battles as a squad leveling entire cities for the sake of humanity. Unfortunatly online mode seems to have connection issues that are a pain but a game restart seems to fix it, albeit temporarily. \n\n The main issue this game has, aside from the connection issues online, is the price point. As 3 year old game 49.99$ plus the 24$ for the 2 mission packs (49 new missions together) is just way too steep so I recommend getting it on sale. \n\nP.S Listen to the game when It says beat Normal

Fighting for scraps?[/i]\"\n\nI just wanna say that I tried. I really did.\n\nI tried to like EDF. 96% positive user review score. Steam likes it. Twitch likes it. Mainstream critics like it. Unconventional critics like it. This is going to be my last review of 2016, and I really wish it wasn't. I really wish that I could just ignore what I've seen, and brush off that I didn't like EDF. Just buy another game and move on without saying a word.\n\nBut EDF--EDF is an unfathomably pointless, outright [i]dumb[/i] experience. There's no dimension to it, no depth, no purpose. You [i]just[/i] shoot things. The [i]entire[/i] game is shooting things. There's not many enemies, and the game is massively padded to the point where several missions are virtually identical. Most of the time you'll be shooting things from very long distances unless you play the Fencer class, which is the only way the game can get in anyway involving. The gunplay isn't even GOOD. The enemies are utterly massive which gives a great sense of scale, but at the same time it means that you'll [i]never[/i] miss. Some of the soldiers even say \"You can close your eyes and still hit em'.\" Hit indication is limited to a very hard to see tracer effect on the bullets which can barely be seen because of the foliage that constantly covers the maps. In any other game, this would make the gunfights nonfunctional, but because the enemies are so big and so dumb that you will [i]always[/i] hit them, it merely becomes a matter of lacking precision, rather than not knowing where to shoot. The game is so [i]dumb[/i] that even the lack of basic features like this don't even hurt it. \n\nBecause again, you do [i]nothing[/i]. You complete each mission when the enemies die. There's no score. You don't get bonuses for having saved people. There's not even a timer. You're not even guaranteed a reward, you can complete missions and get absolutely nothing because of how the timesink functions. The *point*, to use that word lightly, of EDF, is to obtain better weapons so you can fight stronger enemies to get even better weapons. That is nothing new, there are hundreds of games like that. But where games like Diablo, Warframe, Borderlands, Path of Exile etc. at least have the common decency to [i]disguise[/i] the grating minutiae of what you're doing, EDF provides nothing. This is the game about nothing. Buying a game titled \"Timesink\" where you continuously scrub dishes to get better cleaning equipment would be even less transparent than what EDF does. You kill insects and robots. The end. \n\nIt's baffling to me. Videogames have existed in recognizable form since 1962, putting this new year as the 55th year that this medium's existed. We've got games where you can feel like Indiana Jones. We've got games where you can make your own story. We've got games that people question if they're even games because they're that arcane. But EDF makes it's mark, because what we [i]don't[/i] have yet is...a game where you kill ants. Is this it? Is this a $50 game? Is this something people buy and think \"Oh, wow, I can call an air strike on spiders!\" and that's a marvel? That is the accepted emblem of an \"overwhemlingly\" good game, that acceptance of the most unbelievably banal? This is exactly the type of game that these obnoxious PC elitists would bash as being infantile console trash in the early 2000s, but here we are on the edge of 2017, and this is the Hot New Thing. The first [i]Borderlands[/i] was more daring than EDF. Fucking [i]Borderlands[/i] of all games.\n\nBut I get it. It's got four classes. It's got arcady sound effects. It doesn't try to be homogynous and overly balanced. The (intentionally?) terrible voice acting brings to mind the arcade hits of the early 2000s. There are times, brief moments, where you are surrounded by what seems like infinite enemies, and you feel that sense of scale, that primal sense of danger, that the rest of the game so painfully fails to invoke because you can shoot blindfolded and still win each mission. It's like Starship Troopers! Everyone like Starship Troopers right?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGe6017JwPw", "timestamp_created": 1483326535, "timestamp_updated": 1483334216, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457898", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28923341": {"recommendationid": "28923341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047744187", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487722573}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is beautiful. it brought me to tears.", "timestamp_created": 1483320107, "timestamp_updated": 1483320107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28922969": {"recommendationid": "28922969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089546329", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512052658}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u771f\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u6dfb\u52a0\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587", "timestamp_created": 1483319081, "timestamp_updated": 1483319081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28918852": {"recommendationid": "28918852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066676985", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 722, "last_played": 1516410511}, "language": "english", "review": "EDF!

I first got into EDF with Insect Armageddon, notoriously a poor game in comparison but given that I was able to enjoy it, it meant that when EDF 4.1 came to PC I was blown away. The game is easiest to compare to musous just due to the sheer number of enemies on screen, but they play much differently. For one, the enemies on screen don't just go one at a time, it is a complete and utter cluster of pain.\n\nThe campaign took me around 36 hours to complete on hard with the Ranger class, and with the sheer combination of classes and difficulty that stacks up to hundreds of hours of gameplay, granted it will get grindy at points due to the nature of the game and it's mission types. The pain of the grind will easily be alleviated by going through on multiplayer if your able to play with your mates, or are fine with playing with pubs with either no chat or just not chatting with your mates while you play.", "timestamp_created": 1483277673, "timestamp_updated": 1483277673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28899402": {"recommendationid": "28899402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062118422", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496129010}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this for the lulz, ended up playing this all night long during new year :D", "timestamp_created": 1483270598, "timestamp_updated": 1483270598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28895284": {"recommendationid": "28895284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057259276", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 4137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499353510}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430. \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e \u0432 Serious Sam, \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e \u0432 Alien Shooter, \u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0435 \u0434\u0443\u0440\u044c\u044e, \u0441\u043b\u0435\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0448\u0443\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u0443 -

I didn't buy this game for a while because the steam videos looked like they had ruined it much like Armageddon (In my opionon). But I thought. Its on sale, lets give it a go.\n\nIs it faithful to the original? Yeap. I boot the game up and instantly notice the menu sound. It made me smile, that noise from so long ago. The bugs/robots? Yeap. The same enemies with some new inclusions and improvements. The missions? Yeap. I remember going through the ant caves in the old game and this game has that too with mission based changes and twists.\n\nSo. If you are a fan of EDF 2017. Pick this up, 100% pick this up. This review isnt going over the mechanics or the game itself. Just to inform players of the old game that, this game if you enjoyed the original, will feel pretty much the same and then some.\n\nThe weapon names and styles are also back, I found myself remebering weapon names and what they did but then again there is apparently 800+ weapons in this game which I do not doubt as 2017 had a SHIT ton of weapons aswell for a game back then.\n\nPerformance: Great, running a GTX 750 Ti on a AMD A10 with 6gb of ram, 50+ fps constant on highest possible settings.\n\nThe one bad thing so far. This game was made for Japan first, and others second.

The first hour of playing was by far the hardest part, as I got used to all four character play styles, the map icons, and that sort of thing. There are roughly 100 missions, with four difficulties. All the missions are relatively straight forward: kill all enemies or do enough damage to unkillable enemy. Tons of fun, especially when played with others.\n\nThere are a few issues, of which I will highlight the two most frustrating for me, just as a word of warning.\n\nMultiplayer system: It is far from seamless. Regardless of where you are in the game, if you accept an invite, before joining, you have to return to the main menu. Setting a game as private doesn't exactly work as intended. Instead of reserving all spots, you need to leave spots open to the public that will then be filled by your friends that you invite. If you buy the game (and you should), you will see what I am talking about.\n\nCollision detection: Collision detection for the player is pretty good. However, the enemies have zero collection detection at all. They can shoot you through enemy bodies, but it doesn't work the other way around.

Bugs might be one of them. and boy does EDF have them. stay away if you hate giant insects.\n\nokay, cheesy joke aside, EDF is a blast if you can play it co-op in some form. like, for real. the game is a bit buggy at times in the more proper sense of the term, but nothing game breaking unless your computer isn't up to the sheer amount of things EDF will toss at it. i do reccomend the use of a controller if you have a buddy who likes to come over.\n\nthe game's arsenal is... surprisingly diverse. ARs that shoot bouncing bullets, homing rocket launchers that clearly take a page off Macross Missle Massacre, shotguns that shoot in a flat cone rather than a circular one, Limpet Guns which act a lot like stickybomb launchers except reloading disarms the bombs, deployables of all kinds, vehichles from tanks to mechs to helicopters, air strikes of all sorts, a bunch of weapons that if i didn't know better i would say were lifted off Monster Hunter, and even laser targeting sights, allowing those with homing launchers to lock onto bugs and other foes too far or are otherwise incapable of locking onto, and so on and so forth. seriously, other game devs need to play EDF before they can think about \"weapon diversity\". and you'll want the finest arsenal to fight back the giant insects and the ravagers.\n\nmission wise it'll be the same thing for the most part: kill all enemies. to thier credit they do mix it up by not using bugs all the time. there's some mechanized troops, theres flying units with seemingly generic AI, but one thing unifies the enemies. they are all big, and they all outnumber you when you start the mission.\n\nVoice acting is endearingly both good at times and others just bad enough that you have to chuckle, and it has a \"Starship Troopers\" vibe to the games story. like, it's cheesy at best, but it's ironically \"so bad it's good\" at other times. most of the time the story plays absolutely 0 role in the gameplay and is just there to set up the background of the missions or to preface what is happening in said missions.\n\noverall, if you just want an excuse to kill big bugs and lots of them... you really can't go wrong with EDF. unless you don't have friends. in which case you might want to look elsewhere.

I may have only put in about 16 hours so far, but those 16 hours have been over like, a day and a half, to two days. That's how engagingly fun the gameplay is. Another point in favor of the game (at least to my eyes) is the fact that there's an actual text chat supported. It has a hilariously small character limit, but the fact that you can type your own message in and send it is more than you'll see in most console ported games. What shines (at least it has for me so far) is the mic support. That is to say that it actually works just fine in game. Now, you'll have to turn down the back ground music and sound effects to hear people over the gunfire, explosions, and giant monsters you're fighting, but the voice chat itself works properly. Unlike a number of games I've played, it doesn't drop your voice, cut out, or have issues transmitting that seems to plague most in game voice options that I've utilized. And being able to yell about hectors on the horizon and where is incredibly useful when your hands are busy keeping your guy moving and shooting. \n\nThe game is not without faults. Some of the dlc is patently ridiculous (human decoy blow up dolls?) the graphics are kind of old looking, and sometimes the equipment menu will lag for mysterious and unknown reasons. But the trade off on those graphics is that you'll be fighting actual armies of giant insects, robots, and flying menaces. It isn't a game where you are sent to fight an army and there's like 4 guys on screen at once for you to do battle with. Swarms look like swarms because they Are and having a full team of four mixed units can really turn the tide of battles, as each class has a different point at which it can shine in missions. Even if you don't get this game on sale, it's worth the price. When it comes to the DLC, however, your milage may vary. The weapon dlcs are very handy for getting a head start with low level weaponry for each of the classes. As a Fencer, I've found the Bloodstorm to be particularly handy even in higher weapon level missions just because of the way that it target locks, tracks targets, and drops a cluster of explosions nearby (or even in mid air against flying units). The vast majority of the weapons in the game, however, drop from missions and none of the dlc weapons are above maybe level 3? (for reference, 50 missions in the cap on weapons you can use in those mission is like, 13? 14?). \n\nAlso, there's an entire EDF song that you can sing through the chat menu (with the arrow keys under shout> Sing) set to the tune of Glory, Glory, Hallelujah. The best part about it is that when you have npcs following you, they will sing the next verse back to you. So you sing 1-1, and they sing back 1-2, sing 1-3, and they go to 1-4.

You definitely should buy it if you are into: fight with a whole alien army, along hordes of fully dissectible giant insects, slaying the dragons, bringing an AT-AT style quadruped fortress to its knees, blowing up a Death Star inspired alien mothership out of the sky, punching \u201cGodzilla\u201d in the face, stir up the 50-story hornet nest and then evaporate it with a satellite blaster strike, performing a regicide of Queen of the Ants right in her chambers, challenging King of Spiders, Death Queen, and Dragon King, sometimes all at the same time.\n \n \nEDF is one of the best games for co-op play out there, it shines the most with 4 friends playing and coordinating their actions. You definitely should buy it, if you are into killing thousands of giant insects (solo or with friends) that want to conquer the Earth and destroy humanity. \n \nYou can de describe this game as \"Destroy the Earth to stop aliens from destroying the Earth!\"\nGameplay has a very simple formula: you're a soldier (solo or part of co-op squad) and your task is to kill every alien invader on the map.\n\nBut with fully destructible city environment, fully dissectible insects (given enough firepower) and means of destruction like plasma cannons, laser lances and laser chainsaws, thunderbolt shotguns, bazookas, rotary grenade launchers, high-caliber sniper rifles, powerful shoguns, rocket turrets, landmines, carpet bombings, artillery strikes, ballistic missiles, self-propelled railguns, mechs of various sizes, and a possibility to call an orbital blaster strike, you can't help yourself but smile with each new gib flying around and each piece of city\u2019s' architectural heritage tumbling down. And if you like to get close and  personal, put on the power frame and double-wield Gatling guns, or arm cannons, put a martyr or a guided missile launchers on your shoulders,  slide through hordes of your enemies on the wave from your vibro-hammer, slice them expertly with a force-field blade and deflect their attacks right into their faces with a trusty shield, all while dashing on your rocket boosters like crazy (dash cancelling technique required).\n \nThere are four available classes in the game:\nWing diver \u2014 very low armor, fast speed, high damage, can fly, but dies fast. She is swift and deadly glass cannon, emergency support, that can fly from one side of a map to another in a moment or die in a second if you don't know what you're doing;\nRanger \u2014 medium armor, medium speed, medium damage, can't fly, but can drive vehicles. Effective in almost any battle situation;\nAir raider \u2014 medium armor, medium speed. It's difficult for him to fight regular enemies due to lack of proper equipment, but he gives hell to powerful ones. Can call for devastating support strikes and order vehicles for delivery to battlefield. Can drive. Dies fast if you don't know what to do or if your teammates don't care about you;\nFencer \u2014 heavy armor, either fast as bullet (with dash cancelling) or slow as a sloth taking a shit (without dash cancelling). Also heavy damage. His main purpose is to get really close and personal with an overwhelming / overpowering enemy, he also usually has enough armor capacity to recover fallen team members over and over (not from the start of the game, though). The only class capable of melee combat;\n \nThe game also has a story, which takes it's inspiration from classic alien invasion / monster rampage movies. It's delivered properly, without taking you off of gameplay and doesn't overstay it's welcome. This story mainly supports quick pacing escalation: from small packs of your regular giant enemy ants, to the alien long-range artillery robots covering overwhelming swarms of whatever alien genetic and technical engineers came up with this time. They can get really creative at times.\n \nEDF offers 98 online (or 89 offline) missions in main campaign, and 22 + 23 missions via DLCs, so you'll have plenty of gameplay to experience most part of alien invasion situations you have imagined.\n\nForget the zombie apocalypse; it\u2019s time to repel an alien invasion!\n \nP.S.

Plenty of levels which allow you to mow through various bugs and different difficulties which become absolutely insane! This game is quite silly when it comes to the combat in the game. You are basically blowing through an entire city to kill big bugs. The game gives you many different weapons to accomplish this from simple machine guns to a robot taller than any of the buildings... that punches things... with giant robot fists. I would highly recommend this game to others but one this I would say is that the game is way better with friends. The main reason I say this is because when you get into the harder levels/difficulties certain classes can have a hard time at winning.\n\nSome other minor details that make this game a great buy.\n- It runs on a lot of machines.

Those series are [i]Monster Hunter[/i] and [i]EDF[/i]\n\nNow I know what you must be thinking:\n\"This game is $50 and it's how old? What a rip off! I could get so many tendies with that kind of money!\"\n\nI know, I thought the same thing. But a few hours of gameplay in and a few nights without tendies taught me that an old game can actually still be worth $50.\n\n[h1]Performance [/h1]\nWith most PC games you can usually run a game with minimal issues even if you don't meet the minimum requirements.\n[b]Not with this game you can't[/b]\nEDF isn't famous for destroying consoles for no good reason, the horizon will be [b]blanketed[/b] with enemies, and explosions will [b]crush[/b] weaker machines. I tried to play this game on my laptop and if I was lucky I could get into a game, only for it to crash when shit really hit the fan.\n[b]MAKE SURE YOU CAN RUN THE GAME AND YOU'LL BE FINE[/b]\nI have a GTX780 with 16GB of RAM and consistantly run it at 60FPS.\nMy buddies who have weaker PCs than me also have consistant frame rates.\n\n[h1]Gameplay (multiplayer)[/h1]\nAmazing.\nIf you have friends willing to play this with you It's pretty much a [b]must buy.[/b]\nThe weapon variety and synergy between the 4 classes bring about a lot of amazing moments in the multiplayer, and even if everyone wants to play the same class, you can make that work too. The scale is huge, the destructability is reminiscent of Mercenaries 2, and every aspect is just over the top. Ever want to drive a baneblade that gets sent backwards through buildings everytime it fires? Well this game has that and a whole bunch more crazy stuff.\nAlso the voice acting is hilarious. Every time an NPC says something me and my friends always can't help but snicker.\nI should probably also mention that the game is done in \"missions\" that each can take anywhere from a few minutes to roughly a half hour, giving both plenty of missions for drop in quickplay or long hardfought battles.\n\n[h1]Gameplay (singleplayer)[/h1]\nIt depends how much you value the style of the game.\nIf you love crazy B-movie story/voice acting/fights a lot then I would say this game is still worth, even if one of the classes aren't very good for singleplayer (Air Raider). \nHowever if you're looking for an in-depth third-person shooter with gripping singleplayer then this isn't the game for you, at least not at full price. This game is best played with other people, and there are plenty of pubs.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nHow much you enjoy the story depends on how much you can appreciate the cheesey style of an alien invasion. The game mixes a lot of cheesey comedy with actual dark themes, such as [spoiler] having everyone die.[/spoiler] Which is a perfect mix for me. However if you want a very dark and edgy story of doom and gloom then this isn't really for you.\n\n[h1]Japanese menus[/h1]\nHoly shit the menus are bad.\nI'm not kidding, they are by far the only downside to this game. It's very clear the developers are new to PC ports.\nYou will have to get used to using the arrow keys a fair bit, as they are really the easiest way to navigate the menu screens without considering taking a 9mm asprin.\n\n[h1]Conclusion/TL;DR[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Great multiplayer gameplay\n    [*]Alright singleplayer\n    [*]Charming character and theme that may or may not be for you.

That was one my favorite co-op games to play with my little brother and have since beat that game on all difficulty modes and got the Genocide Gun to top off messing around with literally the most powerful weapon in the game.\n\nI only played Insect Armageddon on the 360 for so long before despising it for a number of reasons while admittedly it having good segments and enemies to fight and concepts, overally it proved far too short, shoddy in grind, boring, and even with somewhat a unique take on EDF in a lot of ways was instead just feeling too much of a rushed project with difficulty in landing the EDF mark and feelings I was expecting to get from this game.\n\nFocusing back onto this now, EDF 4.1, I'd have to say it massively improves the lot of its replayability in the usual large amounts of missions, 5 difficulty modes, now with 4 classes to try and master with additionally leveling in the form of better gear and grinding for armour, but overall a fun time to be had! (EDF, EDF, EDF!)\n\nWhile I do love the game very much, let alone the additional mission packs (avoid the DLC guns and such, that stuff is crap and useful for only Easy/Normal really) add a layer of more to be done, sadly I feel the game lacks in playing alone simply because it can feel very sluggish to get going when on your own and not as much of an experience to me honestly. I mean, it is a wonderful game, even for the lot of its simplicity and cheesy humourous cliche nature, but it is not as noticed when alone when you survive the Ravager Alien Invasion.\n\nLets try to break this down to make it easier to digest:\n\nSingleplayer and its Classes - While fun at first, it is sluggish and not as fun I guess one might say, particularly if solo-ing as a Ranger or Air Raider class since these two don't get going until later on when they get better gear while Wing Divers and Fencers get to enjoy the additional features that are spectacular to their class earlier and are also more effective in a number of ways solo.\n\nOf course, this can be obviously overlooked when working with allies, one in each class, but this is for singleplayer play and their things will be noticeably taking time to accomplish. If anything, one will have to play in bursts to avoid getting burnt out, but if one can keep themselves entertained between beating missions and the rediculous and hilarious story and character dialogue then all power to you.\n\nMissions and Difficulty - One thing I loved EDF 2017 as I do here is the fact of 5 difficulty modes and nearly 100 missions to play through (over 100 if you count DLC missions that, again, add to the game a lot). My memories of 2017 may be hazy and full of nostalgia but if anything Easy was still its own difficulty with enough weapons to be found to keep things interesting and keep you on a powerful spree of destruction against the Ravager alien threat.\n\nHowever, Easy Mode in this game should NEVER be played in all reality, Normal gives you the exact same progression only with the Ravagers being somewhat more difficult to fight against but even then it is still relatively easy and capable of one's self to get through it without a sweat.\n\nFor achievement hunters/completionists/etc., avoid doing it as well as the only thing this mode gives is a Medal towards beating the missions on Easy but no Achievement (do it still if you desire but I fell in thinking it to be like 2017 but didn't and am dissappointed when I got to Normal and saw nearly no difference between the two modes for weapon drops, enemy difficulty, and so forth).\n\nCo-op, Multiplayer, and the Community - Fair to say that this game is MEANT for co-op/multiplayer play, otherwise it will get more stale then you and I would believe (being said from someone who enjoyed, again, the hell out of 2017). It is a fun time, you will feel that EDF HYPE when you get to mowing with your buds together, coordinating attacks, yelling out \"FOR THE PRIDE OF EDF!\" or even singing out the lyrics of the EDF song that will just get you going even more!\n\nAdditionally, with that, playing again through the game makes it all the more fun, and immersive I guess one might say, and always will be one of the definitive features of playing an EDF game. Just be careful though, unless you don't mind this for whatever your reasons, there are those that will tamper forcefully with your savefile in such a way to make you gain everything in the game and whatever else.\n\nIf you want to avoid this sad drawback from the online gaming experience, be sure to keep and update a backup save of your progress somewhere so if you need to, you can restore it before it happened, and continue playing. You will have to do this manually and I recommend searching into it.\n\nThe playerbase is small, no doubt for its rather niche nature and the likes, but if you can get some personal friends of yours in on this then it can be very much negligible a problem as co-op offline or online is nonetheless a way to play this game.\n\nThe DLC Content - Coming back to a lot of mention of DLC, there is such, thankfully to a degree the first mission pack funny enough is made up of the DLC 1 and 2 Packs from the console version, a free 2-in-1 deal sort with Pack 3 made then into Pack 2, and making it somewhat cheaper to get it all. I feel it is definitely worth getting it if you have money to spare and want more challenges and awesome unexpected fights to go through, solo or with friends/online co-op!\n\nJust, please, avoid any and all DLC gear/weapons/vehicles/etc, it is NOT worth whatever it offers and is simply cash grabs, even if minor in price, it is useless these items past Easy/Normal and will make you loathe about spending that money on such rather than say the cards to get yourself maybe a nice Award Medal thing for your Steam Page to show your EDF Pride!\n\nAtmosphere, Music, Locations, and All Else - Needless to say, the game, like earlier, is cliche, very much, but it does it with great pride and enjoyment in the easy-going nature of it and makes it more fun and kick-ass than serious and moody (as perhaps a real invasion of such an alien threat might as well be). Of course it is given by the characters of such but it is so cliche you can't help but just go along with it for the sake of hilariousness and act along with the rediculous way it is like.\n\nThe music of the soundtrack will be repeated in missions throughout, no way of avoiding it, but doubt there is much to really say against it since the game is very simple in design and such to where perhaps it is hard to complain of it (or that I don't bother too much with it since a lot of the time the music is used to give idea of cliche moments/missions/locations that will fit to what is going on). I don't know really, guess I didn't pay attention enough, or just went with what it had to offer in this regard.\n\nLocations, damn man, yes, you may complain how there is but a small, small handful of areas that are used in the game, and are HEAVILY reused over and over again except in different starting positions of each mission. One may fairly gripe about this but it gave what it had to offer and did somewhat improve in how destructible some buildings are versus others. A lot of these negatives could perhaps be attributed to its maybe small budget as a small series of games and instead it focusing more on the player having a good time with the variety of ever-newly-gained weapons throughout missions and difficulty modes and spend it with other people too even.\n\nConclusion - Take what I said as you will, research it too as while I might enjoy the simple EDF career of what I got and its minor improvements and drawbacks, it is still what I wanted in the end to be honest but can always be better.

Defend the earth from invading robot aliens and their armies of giant insects. Almost every level will pit you up against hundreds of enemies in fully destructible cities or dark underground caves.\n\nThe game is very accessible, with 5 vastly different difficulty levels.

There are hundreds of weapons to unlock, with increasingly ridiculous firepower. Later levels and higher difficulty levels award bigger weapons, which is a great incentive to challenge yourself.\n\nThere are many types of enemies you'll encounter in this game, both on land and in the air. Each enemy having it's own unique behaviours and attacks. Considering you can only take 2-4 weapons with you to each level, it can be quite a challenge to figure out what will be most effective to deal with all the different enemies you'll encounter in a single level.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAll in all this game displays incredible variety on all fronts, whilst maintaining very basic core gameplay. Although single player makes for a decent experience, the game really shines in its multiplayer modes.

For the most occidental among you, think Starship Troopers.\n\nYou choose among 4 classes, a loadout of 2 to 4 weapons, and embark on a mission to kill any alien that move or doesn't in a glorious fury of destruction. Buildings explode and crumble, giant insects explode and body parts are flying everywhere, giant robots fire plasma while tanks answer in kind with all sorts of ordonances, bombers strike the field, and to put here the words of a fellow player \"This game is therapeutic as f...\"\n\nAlmost 100 missions, some exclusive to coop mode, 5 difficulties levels, lots and lots of different weapons ranging from comical joke weapons to absolutely devastating ones, lot of vehicules from motorbikes to giant walking robots firing lasers, all you get as rewards from battlefield drops, 4 players coop...\n\nIt's probably the only serie where you will find the game being full of bugs is a good thing.\n\nIt's sheer unadultered fun, and on higher difficulties, the game takes a strategic depth that also offers quite a lot of challenge. It's wonderfully over the top. You get to fight Godzilla in a giant robot. You get to have an army of giants robots facing an army of Godzillas in honorable melee fight.\n\nThe only reproaches I could have is the fact movement is a bit slow, helicopter controls are pretty terrible, and you need to pick up the drops falling around to reap the reward, which is a bit time consuming and tend to break the flow. But still, you WILL have fun. You will have moment where you will think and shout it's the best game ever. You will scream \"NOT THE BEES!\". Even the bugs of the glitch variety of the game will amuse you and make you laugh. You will see breakdancing spiders. You will see said spiders going into space after explosions. \n\nBottom line, like I said in the forum, you need to be an alien to hate that game. Get it. You need to. You know you want to. Soon you will know the EDF song by heart and shout along with your fellow soldiers.", "timestamp_created": 1480170895, "timestamp_updated": 1482764884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627226", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27668783": {"recommendationid": "27668783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050128098", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469891269}, "language": "english", "review": "This game may have a lot of bugs, but that's exactly what makes it so great.", "timestamp_created": 1480169607, "timestamp_updated": 1511563006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27666658": {"recommendationid": "27666658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099975389", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480425279}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u771f\u5fc3\u597d\u73a9\u6c92\u8a71\u8aaa\n\n\u96d6\u7136\u4f5c\u696d\u611f\u5f88\u5f37\n\n\u73a9\u8d77\u4f86\u5c31\u662f\u5f88\u723d \u7206\u7834\u5927\u5834\u9762\n\n\u559c\u6b61\u985e\u4f3cL4D\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e0d\u8981\u932f\u904e (\u4e0d\u904e\u662f\u6253\u5de8\u5927\u5916\u661f\u751f\u7269QQ)", "timestamp_created": 1480168862, "timestamp_updated": 1480168862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27663604": {"recommendationid": "27663604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109613997", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 50050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "last_played": 1515299975}, "language": "english", "review": "Its good I guess.", "timestamp_created": 1480167786, "timestamp_updated": 1498194592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27650111": {"recommendationid": "27650111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085220453", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514763028}, "language": "english", "review": "level a city with rockets that go off like nukes in order to save it, if anyone asks say the bugs did it works like a charm.", "timestamp_created": 1480162671, "timestamp_updated": 1480162671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27642016": {"recommendationid": "27642016", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976827905", "num_games_owned": 664, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515200753}, "language": "english", "review": "Insects.

EDF !! EDF !!! Et non, il ne s'agit pas des viva d'un fan club japonais de notre bonne \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France. On pourrait y voir de braves employ\u00e9s venus exterminer les rejetons mutants d'un Tchernobyl fran\u00e7ais, o\u00f9 nos v\u00e9tustes centrales nucl\u00e9aires auraient lib\u00e9r\u00e9 une radioactivit\u00e9 d\u00e9r\u00e9glant dangereusement certaines hormones de croissance. Toutes ces fourmis g\u00e9antes nous renvoient imm\u00e9diatement au film am\u00e9ricain Them de 1954. Elles sont alors de simples dommages collat\u00e9raux d'essais nucl\u00e9aires, tout comme un certain Godzilla, lui aussi de 1954, dont on retrouve les traces depuis le premier opus de la s\u00e9rie. La boucle serait-elle boucl\u00e9e dans une joyeuse r\u00e9conciliation d'apr\u00e8s-guerre ? Et bien non. Ici, il s'agit d'extraterrestres et de leurs OGM \u00e0 6 ou 8 pattes. A la pointe de la technologie, de myst\u00e9rieux extraterrestres cherchent \u00e0 nous exterminer par tous les moyens, et pourquoi pas avec des fourmis g\u00e9antes ?\n\nCes aliens arrivent \u00e0 bord de soucoupes volantes g\u00e9antes pour un grand d\u00e9barquement d\u00e9cennal, ou presque (edf 2017, edf 2025, cqfd). Vont-ils nous pulv\u00e9riser avec leur armes dignes d'une Etoile de la Mort ? Non, pas tout de suite. Pour respecter leur tradition ancestrale, ils expulseront en premier des fourmis g\u00e9antes \u00e0 la surface de notre douce plan\u00e8te. Le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 semble issu d'une technologie avanc\u00e9e de lyophilisation, de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration spontan\u00e9e ou de t\u00e9l\u00e9portation. Sinon comment expliquer l'apparition soudaine de hordes de fourmis g\u00e9antes \u00e0 la base de ces vaisseaux \u00e0 la taille certes g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse, mais insuffisante pour accueillir de telles colonies ? Mais EDF ne s'encombre pas de ce genre de d\u00e9tails. Aucun joueur d'EDF ne se pose ce genre de question. Il s'en suivra alors l'arriv\u00e9e d'abominables araign\u00e9es et divers autres nuisibles aux proportions proprement monstrueuses, qu'on aura plaisir \u00e0 \u00e9clater dans des gerbes de sang improbables. Des robots inspir\u00e9s de la Guerre des Mondes seront aussi \u00e0 la f\u00eate, en compagnie d'autres surprises que je vous laisserai le soin de d\u00e9couvrir.\n\nLe folklore d'EDF fait partie du mythe, mais son gameplay n'est pas en reste. Les forces d'EDF ont du r\u00e9pondant. Quatre classes distinctes se partagent un arsenal de plus de 700 armes. Beaucoup ne seront pas tr\u00e8s utiles, ou seront seulement des updates des premi\u00e8res, mais il y a du choix dans les moyens d'extermination. Le fantassin de base, le Ranger, ne peut compter que sur deux armes interchangeables dans ses combats. Son armement se compose notamment des classiques fusils d'assaut, fusils \u00e0 pompe, snipers, lance-roquettes, lance-grenades, grenades. Classique et efficace. Son comp\u00e8re, le Air Raider, ne dispose pas de la m\u00eame puissance de feu directe. Il doit anticiper les vagues d'aliens avec des v\u00e9hicules, des robots, des chars aussi utilisables par le Ranger, des balises de support, des tourelles, des demandes d'airstrike. Quelques armes d'appoint lui sont fournis, mais son point faible reste sa vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 en combat rapproch\u00e9, compens\u00e9e par sa surpuissance en appui. Pour ce qui est du combat rapproch\u00e9, le Fencer a \u00e0 sa disposition des armes au corps \u00e0 corps redoutables, la capacit\u00e9 de porter deux armes \u00e0 la fois en deux sets interchangeables, des canons, de grosses gatlings, et du mortier. Mais ses d\u00e9placements sont lents, tr\u00e8s lents, sauf si l'on prend la peine de l'\u00e9quiper d'un bouclier qui lui permet de dasher \u00e0 la vitesse de l'\u00e9clair, en combinaison avec une arme rapide. Puis vient enfin le Wing Diver, l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment f\u00e9minin et non n\u00e9gligeable de l'\u00e9quipe. Capable de voler librement, elle compte sur un arsenal apparent\u00e9 au Ranger, mais sauce laser color\u00e9 et autres sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s \u00e9lectrisantes. La gestion de la recharge de son \u00e9nergie  est la cl\u00e9 du succ\u00e8s pour cette virtuose du massacre a\u00e9rien, \u00e0 la mobilit\u00e9 cheat\u00e9e.\n\nLes niveaux s'encha\u00eenent dans des zones urbaines ou champ\u00eatres. La chasse aux insectes est ouverte, avec la permission de raser la ville si besoin est... ou pas. Fa\u00eetes \u00e0 votre convenance. Personne ne vous reprochera de prendre plaisir \u00e0 exploser un p\u00e2t\u00e9 d'immeubles, ou deux, dans l'attente d'une nouvelle vague d'ennemis ou de simplement d\u00e9gager la vue. Le principal est de survivre et de les exterminer, le reste est accessoire. Les graphismes n'ont rien de formidable, et ce ne sera pas la jubilation esth\u00e9tique qui retiendra la manette dans vos mains. La joie de cette exp\u00e9rience hors norme vient de l'action survolt\u00e9e qui se d\u00e9roule sous nos yeux. Quoi de plus enivrant que d'\u00eatre un h\u00e9ros surarm\u00e9 face \u00e0 des hordes d'insectes g\u00e9ants, dont les corps et les membres s'envolent dans les cieux sous une avalanches de projectiles divers et vari\u00e9s ? Pensez au plaisir instantan\u00e9 de Doom, mettez-y des niveaux ouverts, un d\u00e9cor destructible, et remplacez les d\u00e9mons par des araign\u00e9es \u00e9normes. Avec 5 niveaux de difficult\u00e9, plus de 90 missions, un coop en ligne \u00e0 4 joueurs, et un local splitt\u00e9 \u00e0 2 aussi convivial que captivant, il y a de quoi faire durer le plaisir un long moment. En multijoueur, le jeu prend des proportions encore plus \u00e9piques. Dans les modes de jeu les plus avanc\u00e9s il faudra prendre le temps de calculer son approche et \u00e9radiquer les nids dans le meilleur ordre, de bien choisir ses armes, d'\u00eatre compl\u00e9mentaire avec ses partenaires. Le jeu est accessible et simple, mais pourra se montrer exigeant face \u00e0 des hordes dont chaque cr\u00e9ature se montrera potentiellement mortelle. Anticipation, r\u00e9activit\u00e9 et strat\u00e9gie seront vos meilleurs alli\u00e9s. Chaque partie, chaque approche, sera diff\u00e9rente et la lassitude mettra du temps \u00e0 venir, en bonne compagnie, sauf lors de s\u00e9ances r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es \u00e0 la cha\u00eene pour d\u00e9bloquer les meilleures armes.\n\nEt c'est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 EDF tr\u00e9buche, sur son farming intensif en fin de jeu pour accro\u00eetre sa barre de vie, et obtenir des armes adapt\u00e9es aux derniers niveaux de difficult\u00e9. Chaque cr\u00e9ature a une chance de laisser choir au sol soit une caisse d'armement \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer al\u00e9atoirement en fin de mission, soit des soins, soit une caisse d'armure. En solo, avec le Ranger, chaque caisse d'armure augmente sa vie d'un point, et il faudra prendre bien soin de les ramasser une \u00e0 une avant la fin de mission, parfois sur des distances et un temps consid\u00e9rables, surtout si l'option vol n'est pas d'actualit\u00e9. En partant d'une base de 200 points, les derniers niveaux peuvent demander des milliers de point pour ne pas mourir en deux coups de mandibule. Pourquoi imposer cette r\u00e9colte laborieuse au joueur au lieu de les valider directement en fin de mission ? C'est un choix de conception, un h\u00e9ritage des \u00e2ges farouches, des premiers EDF, tout comme les obstacles qui g\u00eaneront vos roulades salvatrices. Ah, ces fameuses ruines bloquantes sous les nu\u00e9es de fils d'araign\u00e9es couvrant l'\u00e9cran... Nos braves camarades chantant leur amour d'EDF sur le champ de bataille sauront esquisser sur nos visages un sourire r\u00e9confortant, avant qu'on les maudisse pour leur IA d\u00e9bile, alors qu'ils bondissent devant la ligne de mire de notre lance-roquette de la mort qui tue, et surtout la n\u00f4tre dans ce cas pr\u00e9cis. \n\nCe Earth Defense Force 4.1 est un jeu unique, \u00e0 l'ancienne, allant \u00e0 l'essentiel, simple mais pas simpliste. Il fut un temps un plaisir coupable, un jeu \u00e0 petit budget mais au grand coeur, un nanard risible pour les esth\u00e8tes du progr\u00e8s ludonum\u00e9rique. On l'adore pour sa folie, sa d\u00e9mesure, comme on le hait pour des d\u00e9tails irritants \u00e0 jamais grav\u00e9s dans son ADN. Sans pr\u00e9tention mais avec l'ambition de proposer une exp\u00e9rience m\u00e9morable. Pour peu qu'on accroche \u00e0 son univers, qu'on ne soit pas trop exigeant sur l'aspect graphique et ses m\u00e9caniques de jeu parfois flottantes, Sandlot nous emm\u00e8ne dans un voyage jusqu'au bout de l'enfer, qu'on aura plaisir \u00e0 nettoyer de fond en comble pour sauver ce qui restera de la Terre. Pour les habitu\u00e9s de la s\u00e9rie, on pourrait en attendre davantage, mais on ne peut refuser cet appel du devoir nippon, lanc\u00e9 avec ferveur et passion. EDF ! EDF !! EDF !!!

Definitely one of the best values all year. Now that that's been said, let's move on to the actual review.\n\n[b][u]What is EARTH DEFENSE FORCE 4.1 The Shadow of New Despair?[/u][/b]\nA title that's way too long, that's what. We're going to refer to it as \"EDF\" or \"EDF 4.1\" here, if that's okay. Anyway, EDF pits you (and up to 3 associates) against a seemingly endless tide of giant insects, alien robots, and giant insects made by alien robots. Choosing between 4 roles that each have a massive amount of gear to select from, the goal is simple: Eliminate everything that isn't human. That's often easier said than done, however...\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=742736697\n[b][u]How does it look/play?[/u][/b]\nGraphically speaking, EDF 4.1 makes no attempt to hide the limitations of the console it originated on, and it also didn't look all that impressive even for a PS3 title. The biggest draw of getting this game on a PC (aside from the playerbase being slightly less dead) is that it runs at 60 FPS with some drops based on hardware rather than 30 FPS approaching 10 during action. Don't get me wrong: Everything looks adequate, but EDF won't blow you away with stunning graphics or impressive post-processing effects.\n\nWhere it [i]should[/i] blow you away is in the gameplay. Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses, from the danger-close Air Raider to the Starship-Troopers-esque Ranger, but all four are insanely entertaining to play, forcing you to adapt to how missions are approached based on your weapons and allies. It's not without some control issues (good luck figuring out how the Air Raider handles, or doesn't, for some vehicles, especially Depth Crawlers and helicopters), but for the most part things feel tight and polished, complete with easily-inferred mechanics like \"shout HUP and jump right before you throw a grenade or lob a mortar so it goes farther\".\n\nWhether it's online or splitscreen, EDF 4.1 is a ton of fun with others, a perfect mix of \"things are going okay\" and \"we're all going to die\" that forges bonds tighter than steel after several missions, especially when you're tackling them on higher difficulties and need to work out the optimal compositions for your group. I will warn you right now, though: Don't try to \"main\" a single archetype if you play with friends, or whoever draws the Air Raider is going to complain almost every time an underground level has to be played. He can certainly still fight alongside you through them, but it's (in my opinion) not very fun and mostly relegates him to managing insanely long cooldowns rather than blowing up massive hordes.\n\nThe game has a massive grinding curve, however, and this is something I can't sugar-coat. Level and difficulty play the biggest part in dictating which random weapon drops you'll see from enemies, and while the majority of online play will be locked to \"appropriately leveled\" weapons and armor levels (based on what the game dictates is appropriate), all offline play is \"anything goes\" in terms of what you can bring to the table. If you'd like to challenge yourself, you can limit your armor manually, or bring lower-leveled weapons, but for the most part there's no reason to when you could just raise the difficulty to compensate. No matter what you do, however, be prepared to suffer somewhat until you get useful weapons for some categories; The Fencer's guided missiles come to mind, with most of the early ones either doing mediocre damage or not locking on fast enough.\n\nEDF 4.1 also lets you pilot giant mecha, a point which I would be remiss to not make clear at almost every opportunity.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=733162839\n[b][u]How is the DLC?[/u][/b]\nFirst thing about the DLC: Ignore anything that isn't a mission pack right off the bat, because they're weapons that are granted to you instantly, usually losing their effectiveness by about mission 20. If you want to deploy the inflatable anime girls for a laugh, be my guest, but steer clear otherwise.\n\nMission Pack 1 includes 26 new missions, and while it touts them as \"some of the most intense the EDF has ever faced\", I'm not sure about that myself. Some of them include approximately 4 million insects for you to blow up or be blown up by (exaggerated somewhat for the sake of hyperbole, obviously) and include a few new \"species\" of giant insect. If you like the difficulty curve of the base game and want more to play with friends, this one's for you.\n\nMission Pack 2 includes 23 additional missions, many of which are legitimately some of the hardest and most herculean efforts I have ever attempted to beat. Want to fight literally every boss monster in the game at once? Battle in an underground arena where new nests pop up on scripted timers until you're overwhelmed or kill them all? Take on 5 mega-nests at once? This one's for you, you absolute sadist. It could ruin friendships, kill your dog, or burn your house down. You have been warned.\n\nA little warning ahead of time: If you want to play the Mission Packs with people, you ALL need to own them. That's a little unusal for a co-op game, so keep it in mind before planning around playing them.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729422074\n[b][u]Final Thoughts[/u][/b]\nThe first time I remember seeing EDF 4.1 was on YouTube, way back when it was a console exclusive. My exact thoughts were something like \"that looks neat, but it doesn't run very well\". Years later, it's finally here. I've played through the base game 3 different times and am still somewhat interested in more. It's pure video game in every sense of the word, with a dorky story tacked on that will always give you something new to laugh about.\n\nSo what're you waiting for?

EDF!! WOOOOOOOOOOOAH![/b][/u][/i]\n\n---------------\n\nGrade Scale Notes: This review operates on a One-to-Ten rating scale for various segments.\n\n1/10: Horrible. \n3/10: Nothing interesting. Might have potential, but is weighed down (By glitches, poor/uninteresting design and controls, ETC)\n5/10: Average\n7/10: Well made\n9/10: Stellar\nI do not give 10/10's, as there is no such thing as perfection. I do not give 0/10's, unless the game truly lacks-everything. And I always round down.\n\n[b]Review Intro[/b]:\n\nThere are games out there that try to draw the player in with an in-depth narrative, compelling characters, a detailed backdrop, and high quality graphics.\n\nThen there is EDF.\n\nEDF knows that its a video game. It knows that video games are meant to be picked up and enjoyed from the get-go. EDF isn't here to waste your time getting to the \"Good stuff\"; the reason you bought the game in the first place. So EDF trims the fat to give you what it thinks games are all about: Honest-to-Fun gameplay that'll make you smile. It's streamlined...\n\n...and yet rather ragged.\n\n\n---------------\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]: 9/10 \n\nEDF is all about the gameplay, and that gameplay is very simple to pick up and get into. You run, you jump, you roll, shoot, and reload. The core basics of the game all play smoothly and simply. More advanced character classes (There are four of them) have other mechanics to them that the game will explain to you upon selection and occasionally during loading screens. Non-standard mechanical exploits also exist on some classes to give you an extra edge and also provide another layer of gameplay.\n\nThe enemies are simple but enjoyable to destroy, ranging from giant ants and spiders, to alien machines and a few other surprises I'd rather you discover for yourself. There's no real story to spoil you on, but spoiling some parts of the combat would ruin it for you going in.\n\nBragging about all the different tools you have to kill the Giant Insects, there are truly many of them; shotguns, assault rifles, gatling guns, rocket launchers, laser pistols, homing grenades, vehicles (we'll get to that in a bit), airstrikes, flame throwers, healing \"Kool-Aid\" guns...the list goes on, and each of the four classes has their own unique weapon lists.\n\nThat said, some weapons are either inefficient by virtue of their level (with higher level versions of the same weapons existing) or inefficient by virtue of the fact that they are deliberately worthless and made for fun...yes, there are a few like that.\n\nWhat's more, the vehicle controls, primarily for the Helicopters and the much LOATHED motorcycles (of which I'm apparently one of the few people who can somewhat use them...a little), are clunky and infuriating.\n\nNPCs, when presented with a red indicator arrow above their heads, will fall under your command. You can use the Voice Line Menu to \"Issue Commands\"...but they'll just follow you like bees.\n\n...and yet, all of this adds to the charm of the game.\n\nExcept the grinding mechanics for getting new weapons. That's annoying....like- the gameplay is fun and all, but you will wanna get new toys too. (There's a lot of them, remember?)\n\n------------------\n\n[b]Audio[/b]: [strike]10/10[/strike] 6/10\n\nThe audio quality, at least for the weaponry and enemies, is decent...but your NPC allies?\n\nNPC allies will engage in generated banter with one another, with an introductory call-out and randomly determined answer...which can lead to some interesting results:\n\n[i]Soldier One[/i]: \"Why did you get married?\"\n[i]Soldier Two[/i]: \"I ran out of ammo.\"\n\nIn fact, all of the voice lines reek of 60's Monster Movie camp, be it combat banter or actual story character dialogue.\n\n...that said, it grows on you, even if you already like that sort of thing the way I do. Soldiers who fall under your command will respond to the vocalizations you execute using the game's radial menu or Voice Line Menu...and should you choose to perform one of the segments of the EDF Fight Songs?\n\nThey will join you in a magical moment of comaraderie.\n\n------------------\n\n[b]Story/Characters[/b]: 3/10 and 3/10\n\nI don't like to mix story and character ratings together but...\n\nLet's be honest: EDF's story is there just to explain the action. It's not complex. It's not logical.\n\nAnd it's not trying to be.\n\nBoth the story and the NPC characters are there help guide the gameplay along. Their quibs in the missions you undertake might get a chuckle out of you once or twice, but they are mainly there to serve as background noise as you live out your Campy Fantasy. You never see their faces; you only hear their voices.\n\n[u][b]EXCEPTION[/b][/u]: If you frequently play as the class called [i]Air Raider[/i], you will come to love how the NPCs (Primarily the [spoiler]Pilot/Gunner of the Attack Gunship Whale[/spoiler]) you can call on in battle will act in the story. They're your [i]'Friends in the Air'[/i], after all...you will also hate how they will sometimes not be able to help you due to the Mission Parameters.\n\n------------------\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]: 7/10\n\nFor a PSP Port of the Remake of this iteration of EDF, the game looks pretty good.\n\nSimple, but good. There are no facial animations on humans, nor are the animations for the EDF soldiers or their various enemies really that great; they are gittery and low-framed at a distance which (I suppose?) helps with framerate issues but, to me, just helps add to the campy nature of the game itself.\n\nThe game isn't meant to feature High Quality Graphics, but they get the job done especially when one considers the destructibility of levels; turning bustling metropolitan cities into rubble with artillery fire tends to do that. Only in the most hectic of moments, when seemingly (but not really) hundreds of enemies fill the screen as the world blows up around them...its only then does the average computer get any real difficulty\n\n------------------\n\nFinal Score: 42/50, AKA 84%\n\nA B Grade...and to be perfectly frank: what more could you ask for in a game that tries to be a campy B-Movie? All it needs to fulfill that promise is for EDF to fight Godzilla, preferably in some sort of giant robot...\n\n[spoiler]DID I MENTION THAT THE BIG THING ABOUT THIS ENHANCED EDITION OF THE UPDATE OF EDF 4 IS THAT THEY ADDED A GIANT MOTHERFUCKING ROBOT THAT YOU CAN USE IN ORDER TO FIGHT A GIANT GODZILLA KNOCK-OFF!?

Here, just listen to the concept of it: \"An Army of Elite Human Soldiers with high tech guns, vehicles, tools, and more are fighting against Enormous Bugs from Outer Space as well as Alien Ships, Robots, Godzilla Monsters, and machines that are (literally) trying to eat the planet.\" THAT, to me, sounds like nothing but PURE, OVER THE TOP, JAPANESE AS HELL -={FUN}=-. \n\nI'll be honest. This game can get a little bit grind happy at times if you want to get good Weapons and Armor Points (especially if you want to play Inferno...), but all ya really need to do to fix that is to pick up a few friends for the ride so you can kill and collect Loot Boxes much...MUCH faster! This is a game you do NOT want to miss playing! Suit up in your Armor of choice, whether it be Ranger, Wing Diver, Air Raider, or Fencer, grab your Guns, Explosives, Giant Swords, Laser Cannons, Vehicles, Etcetera and Etcetera: And get ready to have a \"blast\"...geddit? \n\nNow, for those who have played \"Insect Armageddon\" before playing this one, your expectations for it may be a fair bit low. I assure you those expectations will be blown CLEAN out of the water like a Nuke being shot into a River filled with Giant Ants and Spiders. IA was made somewhere here in america, where we thought we were improving it by \"making it cleaner\" or \"giving it a better story\". NOPE. Putting those aspects in made the American Developers missed the point of what EDF is supposed to be! Giving a game like this a Story or a Touch Up of any kind is going to make the product not as valuable or likeable.\n\nI've heard EDF be known as a \"B-Movie Simulator\". That is such a good description that everyone thinks it was the developers intention. In fact, I think it really was. That being the case...IA kind of reminds me of how most American Movie Companies tried to \"fix up\" older Japanese B-Movies by making them seem a bit more realistic. Darker colors, Less Action, not as fast paced, etc. etc...but then said movies are completely lifeless and miss out on the magic of what those older movies had going for them. And trust me...this game has a certain magic that can make ANYONE love it. Sometimes: Even those who prefer more story-driven games! It's THAT GOOD.\n\nI'll say it again: You do NOT want to miss out on this! I give this game a 10/10!

Sort of used to it with    $50 indie games popping up on steam almost weekly. \n\nHOWEVER, I'd say the purchase was well worth it. This game is a gem. \n\nThis game has a metric dickload of weapons. Early on, you may unlock like 3+ weapons every level if you pick up all the weapon boxes that drop from enemies. They are pretty fun to mix and match, and there are level based variants so your favorite weapon types can often stay relevant into the endgame (barring some one-off weapons that don't have variants).\n\nThere is a quick-chat wheel to easily communicate basic messages like \"Can you rescue me?\", \"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH\", \"EAT THIS BULLET\", \"EDF EDF EDF\", \"GRRRRRRRAAHHHHHHHHHHHH\", and normal stuff like that. There are many, MANY preset messages to choose from, and a good amount of them are voiced. Some npcs nearby might even join in on the singing, screaming fun. \n\nThere is also manual text chat that you can access by pressing \"t\", for people that want to talk like a normal person, but even then messages like \"Lets use guided missles and targeting lasers\" or \"help me\" still have value to put in your chat wheel for easy access. \n\nOh, also voice chat is a thing in this game and can't be turned off unless the host explicitly chooses to or you mute your mic. Have fun hearing some random dude eating over the mic and making grunting noises that doesnt know you can hear him. You could always turn voice volume down in the menu if you hate it. \n\n\nGameplay didn't seem like it would be too exciting at first, but it gets way better. You get dropped into the game only fighting giant silver ants, but then you progress to more interesting enemies... like recolored ants. \nJust kidding!\nYou can fight web making giant spiders, hopping spiders, the previously mentioned ants and their variants, giant flying robot drones, giant mechs with varying weapons, EVEN BIGGER MECHS that make more small mechs, energy shield generator mechs, motherships, some godzilla like thing, dropships, and some other stuff. I didnt go that far in the game yet, so there is probably more. \n\nWave after wave of giant insects covering buildings and marching straight for you, so you get to use all those pretty weapons you unlocked. But did I mention classes?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere are four classes:\n\nRanger- Standard infantry unit that is extremely powerful in the right hands. Has access to a ridiculous variety of weapons, and has decent survivability and support potential. Rockets, shotguns, flamethrowers, assault rifles, snipers, grenades, Heal gun. When it comes to this class, you have something for every situation, but choose wisely! You can only carry two weapons as this class. Ranger is also the only class besides air raider that can drive vehicles (barring a special one that everyone can use).\n\nWing Diver- Can fly with the aid of a plasma-powered jetpack, with energy based weapons that draw from the same power source! Your survival depends on being able to manage your energy correctly, and know when and where to land to recharge, lest you run out of power over a group of 300 ants and get mauled to death. This class has the lowest health and armor growth of any class, so positioning is necessary. Weapons start out looking extremely weak, but the wing diver is capable of ridiculous damage at later levels, and even her default weapon \"rapier\" can take out a dropship within seconds if you fly in close to the hatch and fire away. Can only carry two weapons.\n\nFencer- RIP AND TEAR. THATS A BIG BUG, AND THAT MEANS IT HAS BIG BUG GUTS! \nCarry four weapons in your loadout separated into two groupings of two. One for each arm. \nYou are a tank of tanks. You can use shields, extremely powerful melee weapons, rapid fire mechafists, dual chainguns, shoulder mounted giant missle launchers, rocket pods, giant tank cannon sniper rifles, etc. \nDespite being a bulky mass of metal armor, you can dash around the areas really quickly with use of your weapon abilities like back and side thrusters in combination with shield reflection animation cancelling.  Shield reflection isn't just for quick transport glitches either, but can actually reflect enemy projectiles back at them provided you time it right. This is an action class for those that want to feel like an unstoppable juggernaut. \n\nAir raider- This class excels at supporting your allies! Everybody wants one of them on their team! They can heal, increase defense of allies, increase damage potential of allies, use remote explosive guns, send out turrets, send out explosive robot beetles, call in vehicles ranging from a motorcycle with a sidecar to giant mechs. Nothing is impossible for this guy!\nYou also have an important role as a  spotter with your laser targeting gun. You can mark enemies to make allies able to lock on to them faster with weapons that require lock ons. Laser targeting is also REQUIRED for some fencer weapons of mass destruction, so fencers that plan on using any of their ultra powerful missle weapons better have an air raider around, else they are useless. \n\n\n\nAll in all, it is a great game that is tons of fun. Play with friends. Play with randoms online. Play solo. It is all pretty good. \n\nI recommend this game to everybody that can see past or laugh at the cheesy exterior, and appreciate this game for what it is.

I won't go too much into the specifics right now, but I will point out few things that others might not talk about.  The short answer: If you think the game looks awesome, you'll love it.  To the average gamer the graphics are amazing, although I've seen some ultra-res pc buffs nitpick them, and the game is aesthetically beautiful.    On larger levels, shiny metal and detailed textures take a few extra seconds to load after the level starts, but they never take more than 10 seconds to load completely.  The controls are unique but not poorly designed and you will get used to them quickly.  Two things that aren't as intuitive about the controls but you will pick up after figuring them out (which is why I'm telling you):  Jumping and rolling are on the same button.  Moving straight forward or backward, or standing still and pressing the button makes you jump.  Moving sideways or diagonally and pressing it causes you to roll.  Secondly, the sortie menus are operated with the control stick/WASD keys, and the d-pad/arrow keys navigate the communications menu.  The four classes have a very surprising amount of depth to them, both in variety of gear and in base class mechanics.  The fact that the Fencer (the game's Tank class) is possibly more complicated than the Air Raider (the Specialist/Support class) should speak for itself.  The game runs extremely smoothly, and online works perfectly, with no lag or frame drops (If your connection is too bad to play, it disconnects you).  Also, SPLIT SCREEN LOCAL CO-OP AND VS!!!  And of course, the constant bombardment of dramatic psuedo-intellectual B-Movie dialogue is perfectly executed and amazing.  Actually, (this is as deep as this review will get), you could say the game itself is making fun of the people who criticize EDF for its simple nature.  The point of EDF isn't to make you feel like a selfless member of the military giving his life to save humanity in the face of an extraterrestrial threat.  You're supposed to feel like a soldier who saves the world by blowing up everything in sight with missiles and lasers while cheering and singing about the benevolent organization he works for.  Anyways...\n[b]On the DLC (what I've heard about it):[/b]  It's definitely not necessary but might be worth it to you if you really enjoy the game.  The weapons are not overpowered/game breaking, and are unique and well balanced weapons to use.  The vehicles are just joke skins that are funny to drop in game and surprise people with, like an anime tank.  The level packs contain remixed and new levels and while they do not add new weapons, they add many more hours of mayhem and have a few levels great for grinding gear and armor.  Like I said, none of it's necessary, but if you like the game you might want to look into the DLC.  I think enjoy the game enough that I'll eventually buy the level packs and an anime tank when they go on sale.\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI think I will get many years of enjoyment out of this game and although I think it should be permanently priced at $35, I definitely got more than $50 worth of fun out of it.  I think it's definitely a niche game initially, but anyone can fall in love with it if given time to experience its true scope.  Like I said, if you think the game looks awesome and you'd enjoy it, then you probalby will, but if you think it looks stupid, then try a friend's copy or do more research, only then should you count it out completely.\nGLITCH: I had this problem and others had it as well.  Some Nvidia users have a problem where the game does not use their graphics card and tries to run off integrated computer graphics instead, causing bad lag.  Fix this by making sure your drivers are updated and then going to the Nvidia Control Panel and creating a folder for the game in Manage 3D Settings, create a folder for the game under Programs and set the preferred graphics processor to High-performance Nvidia processor.\n\n\nI've given you all the details you might care about, but here's a rant about something that I personally find awesome that may be meaningful to few other people as well:  The scope of this game is insane, and everything is insanely detailed.  If you think the fact that a game can runs a constant 60FPS at ay resolution with literally hundreds of detailed enemies and buildings being blown up at any given moment isn't a big enough achievement on its own, the detail will amaze you.  The entire enviornment is pretty much realisticly shaped, and does not use textures to simulate depth.  In addition, while some environmental objects such as cars are a bit on the small side, and are not realistically sized to the human characters, all of the architecture is accrrately scaled.  This combined with the fact that the small details of buildings are actually modelled and not just textured in makes the world feel amazing.  Run out of fuel trying to fly up a skyscraper?  Take a rest on the ledge around one of its hundreds of windows.  One of the coolest things that happened to me was when I was playing local co-op with my brother and got blown up and flung into an apartment building, a motel-style one where the rooms are accessed from walkways on the outside.  When my brother flew onto the walkway to rescue me, we found out that we could walk to the end of the walkway and climb the stairs to the next floor, and we continued until we reaced the top floor.  While some people might not care about this, for me it's things like this that really enhance immersion and leave you with a much stringer experience.  Since the buildings in the game are made to be destroyed and not closely inspected, you wouldn't hold it against the developers if the buildings were pretty much rectangular blocks with windows and colorful billboards, but when you find that you can look through the glass doors and see the receptions and waiting rooms of small buinesses, and look at the advertisements and menus inside restauraunts, and of course, pretend you live on the top floor of an apartment and walk all the up all of the stairs on the side of the building, it's just one of the many things that make you feel that this game really has heart behind it, and was created with more in mind than just making money or being [i]just[/i] unique enough to be memorable, like so many other games these days.  Anyways, sorry for getting cheesy there at the end, but if you've read this far you should seriously give this game a try.  It's the most fun I've had in a while.", "timestamp_created": 1476163748, "timestamp_updated": 1476163797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25973591": {"recommendationid": "25973591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020887519", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475377554}, "language": "english", "review": "You WILL play with a mouse and keyboard.\n\n10/10 \nThe EDF Deploys", "timestamp_created": 1476137175, "timestamp_updated": 1476137175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25973420": {"recommendationid": "25973420", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976601597", "num_games_owned": 508, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 8466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499567130}, "language": "english", "review": "80 hours in, 5% completed.\n\nPros.\n- Blow up huge bugs.\n- Blow up buildings and level entire cities doing far more damage to earth than a few big spiders ever could with no repercussions whatsoever.\n- SImple, addictive gameplay with ginormous depth, oldschool Japanese style.\n- Multiplayer works flawlessly with anyone around the world without any port forwarding, lag, long wait times or any bs (besides hackers who can ruin your saves.

Your mission is simple \u2013 kill everything that moves.\n\nYou\u2019re given four class options before starting: Ranger, Fencer, Wing Diver or Air Raider. Rangers are your typical versatile infantry class, able to equip a variety of guns, sniper rifles, or a plethora of explosives and specialty weapons. Your next option is the Air Raider, a class that has the ability to call in buffs such as shields, turrets, healing modules and heavy armor, such as tanks, helicopters and a slew of different mechanized vehicles. Your third option is the lightly-armored, agile and swift-moving Wing Diver, an all-female crew of airborne infantry that use energy weapons and jetpacks to quickly move about the battlefield. Your final option is the Fencer, EDF\u2019s dual-wielding tank, comprised of thick armor and massive cannons at the expensive of maneuverability. \n\nThe entirety of the game will pit your class of choice and a handful of NPC AI against hordes of insects, robots, dragons and ships as you battle your way through every level. An improved feature over previous installments is the presents of your AI counterparts, which brings a greater feeling of an army, rather than just you versus the world. Some levels lack a sufficient amount at the expense of a higher difficulty, but overall the game doesn\u2019t feel as void of human life as it once did.\n\nThere\u2019s not much for plot aside from the simple \u201csave the world\u201d dynamic, set in a cheesy Japanese monster movie environment. I cannot stress this enough: [i] this game is cheesy [/i] and it is meant to be. The dialog is ridiculous, over-the-top and for all accounts just plain goofy, but the game knows that and plays it up all too well. I never felt the game suffered from a lack of plot or bad dialog, as I was far too enthralled with the sheer amount of destruction I was causing in every level to really care.\n\nWhile progressing through the level, you\u2019re only real task aside from dishing out death while avoiding it yourself is pickups you get from enemies in the realm of armor and weapons. Armor drops increase your overall character\u2019s \u201carmor\u201d rating, which stands in place of a traditional unit health. Weapon drops give you a random chance of finding a new or upgraded version of a weapon you might already have. However, more often-than-not, you might find yourself with two dozen of the same weapons you already own, which can be rather annoying. \n\nThis process of grinding is necessary for higher levels and increased difficulty settings, so expect to replay levels to gather extra armor and weapons so you can tackle particularly tricky levels. During my time playing I never felt that grinding was particularly time consuming, nor did it break the momentum of the game either; EDF is just too damn fun so any issues I ran into didn\u2019t damper my enjoyment at all.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n\n[list]\n[*] Multiplayer \u2013 Lobbies are easy to set up, join and play in. Very few, if any connection issues.\n[*] Weaponry \u2013 There are weapons; tons and tons of weapons. Some are jokes, some are DPM monsters. All of them add to new and refreshing builds.\n[*] Replayability \u2013 EDF has this in spades and with 146 levels comprised of single/multiplayer and DLC map packs, EDF will keep you coming back for hours to come.\n[*] The \u201ccheese\u201d factor \u2013 This game is cheesy. The NPC\u2019s dialog, your commanding officer\u2019s, the fact that you can sing while being dead, but it all adds up to a hilarious and amusing time saving the world. That\u2019s just EDF\u2019s inner charm.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n\n[list] \n[*] Clipping \u2013 EDF has issues with enemies [particularly spiders] attacking you through solid objects. This also applies to dead enemies, in which an enemy attack can clip through a dead enemy, but a player\u2019s shot is blocked by the same dead enemy.\n[*] Vehicle controls \u2013 EDF has always had a notorious reputation for stiff and unforgiving vehicle controls. I felt they did a decent job with ground control vehicles, however helicopters are atrocious and feel nearly unplayable. \n[/list]\n\nOverall, EDF is a tremendous amount of fun. It\u2019s easy to pick up and play in short bursts, or for long marathons. If you haven\u2019t played any of the past installments, you won\u2019t be missing anything by picking up this title. I highly suggest it if you are even the least bit interested; give it a try.

is the equivalent of a B-movie you pop in with a few friends and a couple drinks in you, gather around, and laugh at how crazy it is. You won't find anything this deliciously full of ham and cheese at your local deli. And to top it off, it's really fun to play.\n\nWhat's the story? Something about an alien invasion? Who cares! Time to strap on some armor, grab a rocket launcher and a curiously-powerful handful of firecrackers, and blow up some giant bugs and robots, all while singing the EDF anthem to the tune of the Battle Hymn of the Republic!\n\nYour controls couldn't be much simpler. Move, shoot, reload, change weapons, use key for entering vehicles or reviving co-op partners. The only thing to take note of is that jumping and dodge-rolling are bound to the same key as a Ranger. You can only jump when moving straight forward or straight back. Going at an angle will cause you to dodge roll. I can't comment on how this is for controllers, but after a little adjustment, mouse & keyboard players should have few issues with it.\n\nThis game is not exactly what you call balanced and I wager that is by design. This can be both good and bad; you can utterly curbstomp hordes of enemies when you're kitted out properly, but unfortunately, if you're not, it can be you getting curbstomped. Difficulties above normal can be quite a wake-up call as larger enemies can take a huge beating and do an incredible amount of damage, easily one-shotting players in some cases. And since friendly fire is not optional, this can result in lots of accidental collateral. When the game warns you to increase your max health and gather good weapons before trying higher levels, IT MEANS IT.\n\nTechnically, I've had almost no problems. However, my friend uses an unconventional control scheme that utilizes the arrow keys. These are permanently bound to quick chat functions and cannot be rebound. Unless you have some keymapping software such as Razer Synapse, you're just out of luck there. There aren't many graphics scaling options either, but I wager that this won't be too big of an issue unless you're running a pretty old machine.\n\nBut if you want a game that you can pick up and play for either a few minutes or hours at a time and have a grand ol' time either solo or with friends (splitscreen co-op!), you can't go wrong here.

This game has only one objective. Kill everything you see. Yep, kill everything that is in that mission. Insects and Aliens from space have taken over most cities of Japan and the EDF has been sent out to save the people of Japan and to wipe out all threats. The EDF is one of the most powerful squads that have saved many people and cities from Aliens and Insects and they have also destoryed the Mothership a long time ago, but now they seek revenge and reunite with a new army of threats for the EDF to face as well as the Mothership.\n\nThe E.D.F (Earth Defense Force) have many troops that have been well trained and they get stronger and stronger as they add new types of soldiers and lots of weapons that make them powerful then anyone.\n\nLet's go over the classes you can play as.\n\n~Ranger:\n\nThis basic soldier is the most easy class and recommended that you play this class first before you try out the other three classes. He can equip two weapons. He can use Assault Rifles, Snipers, Rocket/Missle Launcher, and can also heal his teammates with some special weapons. He can be pretty deadly with some of his higher level gear but remember not to blow yourself up.\n\n~Wing Diver:\n\nThis solider is one of the most basic classes to play but has very weak armor. This class can be very fast and comes with a jetpack that allows you to fly in the air for a while until you need to regen that fuel for it. A silent but deadly soldier that can deal quite some damage with bigger groups of threats. She can equip 2 weapons. She can use Plasma Launchers, Rapiers, Plasma Grenades, Thunder Bow/Plasma Snipers, Mid-Range Lasers, and many others. She is a easy class to play but remember that she has weak armor so she can die pretty fast if you are not careful of your surroundings.\n\n~Air Raider:\n\nThis solider is for intermediate players (people who have some experience with the game and made it through most of the game). This class can be one of the most fun classes to play as well as very deadly. As the name says he can call in Air Raids/Air strikes. He can equip three weapons (two being airstrikes/limpet guns and the other being any vehicle of your choice). He can also call in Tanks, Battle Suits, Helicopters, Ground Vehicles, and a Balam. This class has a lot of weapons that you can collect and each one can be very powerful or useless. His Limpet Guns can also be pretty useless because low damage. Some of his vehicles can be a little hard to control but once you get used to using it a lot you won't have a problem killing all threats your way.\n\n\n~Fencer:\n\nThis class is for advanced players (Players who have lots of experience with the game and completed it all the way.) This class can be one of the hardest to learn and use correctly, but fully learning all his special moves and skills he will be one of the most powerful and deadly tank characters in the game. He can equip four weapons. He has Miniguns, Shields, Strikers, Piercers, Cannons, Artillerys, and many others. It's best to play this class last because his controls for most of the weapons can be a bit tricky and hard to know at first. But once you know all the tips and tricks for this class and get the right gear, you won't regret this class.\n\nThis game does have over 800+ weapons and each mission you can collect higher level weapons on higher difficulties. (Easy, Normal, Hard, Hardest, Inferno <-- most difficult) it's best that you get and collect as much armor/hp in the game before you go on higher difficulties in low and higher levels. (Hardest, Inferno)\n\nThis game also has a lot of missions for singleplayer and co-op (89 SP, 98 Co-op) and the higher you get you will face new threats that can be more powerful so it's best to play lower missions on higher difficulties to get those high level weapons. This game does have a lot of grinding in it so it will be a fun game for people that like grinding a lot for their stuff.\n\nAlso remember that everytime you kill a threat they will have a chance to drop one of three things. (Red Crate <--- Armor/HP, Green Crate <--- Weapon, Health Crate (small and big one).\n\nI would say this game is a very fun experience for me to see and enjoy. If you like killing dragons, spiders, ants, and different types of alien spicies from space that are all giant then this game is for you. Thanks to the split-screen and co-op with four players this game can be fun with friends to just roam around shooting insects and many other things.\n\nI would rate this game 8.5/10 in my opinion.\n\nEDF!!! EDF!!! EDF!!!\n\nThe Earth Defense Force will live on. [/i]\n\n\nSomething that ruins this game for me is the amount of people that use hacks in game lobbies that gives everyone a lot of armor or every weapon.

Briding yourself with random experts on the internet helps. It still doesn't change the fact that if you sit down and exclusively play with a group of friends you'll be grinding your asses off. However, having the mindset of just playing the game to enjoy it and not worrying about the grind makes it much more entertaining; so I'm going to have to swing this back to a precarious thumbs up.\n\n~\n\nAfter all this playing, the final verdict is simply that this game isn't nearly as good or properly balanced like EDF 2017 was. At first it is fun, but if you're a completionist this IS NOT the game for you unless you have the patience to grind several hundred hours of tedious maps because you've played each one 14 times over just to unlock the limits (not including the times you've died.) GRIND.\n\nIn the late game, the weapon drops for the levels you're on that can actually make use of them become so rare that you'll be playing the same level repeatedly, winning by the skin of your teeth, and not getting anything new. The rare time we did get new things, the weapons proved to be novelties and nearly useless. GRIND.\n\nFor whatever reason they decided that giving you 1 armor point per pickup was too much... except now you have FOUR classes that all get these pickups separately. The strongest class will only get 1 armour point per TWO pickups. GRIND.\n\nThe Weapon and Armor limits in multiplayer are simply pointless other than to make you waste more of your life than you wanted to on this game. I got a level 50 weapon, I want to use it. Oh, but hey, you can unlock the weapon and armor limit if you beat 70% of the game.. meaning you have to play and WIN 1372 maps (98 levels, 4 classes, 3.5 difficulties.) GRIND.\n\nThis game is the absolute epitome of tedium, and it really pains me to not like this game because 2017 was close to my heart, but the grinding in this is just too much. The first game was perfectly balanced, and took about 70 hours to complete all difficulties. You had to grind once in awhile, but it wasn't to the point of being ridiculous like this one is.\n\nThe only thing that would redeem this for me is modding support with a weapon editor and map editor.. and possibly a random mission generator that would slowly ramp up the difficult with each completed mission.\n\nOh, but then you wouldn't be able to sell your map packs for $10 a pop? You got enough money out of me for your $50 B game ($50 for a B game... cripes.) and all I did was waste so much of my life for a game that was more often frustrating than entertaining.\n\nPlease note: THIS IS NOT AN MMORPG.

This game might be too fun to be good. Go play another walking simulator. \n\nFor normal people who play video games for entertainment this is one of the best video games to come out in at least the last decade. Earth Defense Force 2025 (A.K.A 4.1) is an unpretentious, pure, and wonderfully absurd third person shooter that pits the EDF against an evil alien threat hell-bent on conquering earth with an army of giant insects and building-sized alien robots. It's a game that combines Starship Troopers, classic Toho films, with a dash of  a (more or less)Power Rangers vibe. From it's gameplay to it's gleefully cheesy dialouge EDF never once forgets that it's a entertainment product first and foremost. \n\nEDF if you have never played it before, is about fighting large waves of enemies using a vast array of destructive weapons, in a fully destructible 3D envoirnment. Essentially the closest you can get to a modern 3D equivalent of Robotron 2084. And there are a lot of weapons. Different character classes can carry a different number into battle, for example a Ranger can carry two weapons, and you choose them before starting a mission. Weapons range from assault rifles, to missile launchers, even rocket launchers that can annihillate an entire city block with one shot.  The game has 4 character classes each with it's own strengths.\n\n-The Ranger- He is your generic soldier whom is mostly unremarkable, but the most well balanced class. He has decent move speed, and a dodge roll. He has access to the more conventional weapons and is the best class to start playing the game at until you unlock better missions for armor/weapon farming for the other classes.\n\n-The Wing diver- She is the most mobile but the least armored. She can fly around the battlefield and rain death from above. Unfortuanately the Wing Diver has a an energy meter that decreases as she flies, and this meter is also used to reload many of her weapons\n\n-The Fencer-Initially starts out near useless because of his starting weapons and abnoxiously slow move speed. He needs to utilize jump jets to get around at an acceptable level. The trade off? He can get some of the most powerful weapons in the game. He also has the quickest armor gain.\n\nAir Raider- A support oriented class, not as good in direct combat, but he is the only one who can call in vehicles.\n\nA lot of missions have minor updates and there are a couple of new missions. They added the Kaiju and \"Walking Fortresses\" from 2017. A few new vehicles as well, and a mech.\n\nThere's only two issues witht the game I have.\n\n1.Most weapons are blatantly better than others.\n\n2.Unlike in 2017 you can NOT use vehicles unless you are a Air Raider, or are playing co-op and have an Air raider to request vehicles. It would have been nice if they could have added pre-placed unpiloted vehicles in single player to use if you are playing as a Ranger, and there is only one mission that I know of where you can pilot a vehicle. And that one be one of the several new missions, there is one that you get to use the new mech.\n\nEasily recomennded to anyone who enjoys japanese monster movies, cheesy movies in general, fast paced arcade action, and games that are fun above all else.", "timestamp_created": 1473370016, "timestamp_updated": 1473370016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472561", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25410985": {"recommendationid": "25410985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046293698", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 9038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493984806}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3044\u308d\u3093\u306a\u866b\u3084\u3069\u3046\u3076\u3064\u304c\u3067\u3066\u304d\u305f\u3089\u3082\u3063\u3068\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3068\u304a\u3082\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f", "timestamp_created": 1473343409, "timestamp_updated": 1473343409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459182", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25410384": {"recommendationid": "25410384", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995345116", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483387848}, "language": "english", "review": "So I've played EDF 2025 on ps3 all the way through on my own, and it was pretty fun.

If you restrict chat it does turn off voice chat but also disables keyboard inputs. Outside of that you have to select the player in the lobby and mute their mic (steam auto enables mics for games with no disable feature)\n- A big flaw of the game is no joining on the fly, new players have to wait until the game returns to lobby for a repeat or next level.  They can set items/chat however, they cannot join in.  So sometimes you will see a bunch of people join and quit as you go thru a match.\n\n\nShould you own this game?\nIf you love B movie cheese and sifi goodness then YES.

EDF!!![/h1]\n\nEDF4.1 is a very fun game that doesn't trip over itself in attempt to offer the world (or, well, a more serious/immersive experience). Despite the premise and title of the game, it is usually quite lighthearted. This is due to a mixture of enjoyably eye-rolling NPC banter, and mission scenes/commentary that would be right at home in a budget alien invasion movie. The shadow of new despair, yet most EDF soldiers appear to be overly content and upbeat, often discussing meals and marriages on the battlefield.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple - mainly made up of you shooting things, or calling in things that will assist you in your bid to shoot things, and/or helping others in their struggle to shoot various things. The result? Explosions, pretty lasers, crumblings buildings, and flying bodies are all a common sight here - so you'll likely be finding yourself reviving people a lot, or in need of some medical attention yourself. Especially on the harder difficulties, which can genuinely be a challenge, many of the most sedate-seeming missions are a bullet-hell environment on Hardest/Inferno difficulties. Generally more enemies with higher health is a bad way to increase difficulty, but it works in EDF. The enemy behaviours do change slighty, they become more aggressive and dangerous, but you can also make yourself expontially more dangerous too through the equpping of unlocked weapons (and blood doping too).\n\nThe game is separated into Online and Singleplayer modes - with singleplayer mode offering split-screen co-op. There are 4 very unique classes to play as, with separate pools of collectible weapons and armour (health). To level up your classes, you pickup armour/weapon drop boxes in-game (red/green drops). Higher difficulties and later missions generally tend to give better weapon loot. There are 4 difficulties to play as, and progress is tracked independantly for each of the 4 classes, and missions progress is also kept separate from online and singleplayer modes - however armour and weapon loot is shared between the 2 modes.\n\nThere is a large range of weapons/equipment to obtain - these will help you shoot things and increase the enjoyability of shooting those things. It also makes for some collecting to be done - and if you want to 100% the missions, you need to play each one 16 times! Yes that sounds like a chore, but the beauty of the game isn't in chores, but in it's gameplay - which is fun in singleplayer, and exactly 3 times more fun in multiplayer. Although in singleplayer you can player the easier difficultyies without a weapon level limit, making for some really brutal insect fumigation.\n\nImprovement areas do exist with EDF4.1, despite all my positive feedback. My personal annoyances mainly revolve around the ranger's general lack of movement options - the fastest way to move being to roll at 45-degree angels, and yes this means literally looking away from where you want to move. I tell a lie, actually you could launch yourself into the sky with a high-powered sniper rifle, so there's that.. All my other personal annoyances are tied into the UI, being general UI layout/limitations and some UI related bugs. The gameplay is largely robust though which is good, i've only ran into 2 gameplay bugs that required us to restart the mission. Unlike some games, you don't have to linger in the menus for long.", "timestamp_created": 1473074391, "timestamp_updated": 1473074391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25361970": {"recommendationid": "25361970", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970902309", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500384916}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING!\nEDF!

However, as where I liked EDF 2017 for the 360 I have to say...\n\nTHIS GAME IS WORTH ITS PRICE. \n\nThat is something I rarely say, so hear me out.\n\nPros:\nCONTENT! There is a lot to do, especially if you are looking for 100% and even if you aren't there are so many missions and difficulties to do and the anticipation of new weapons can easily keep you going and make harder levels worthwhile.\n\nENEMIES! There is a good amount of variety in the enemy types. To even throwing in some Mutant enemies on Inferno difficulty, This makes the game a blast to play, but at the same time, the start is limited in enemy types to help the player get into the game.\n\nDIFFICULTY! The Difficulty is handled VERY WELL in this game. Some levels are against massive hordes while some are against special targets or bosses. On each difficulty setting, the enemies' health and damage scale really nicely as to give you a good margin of error on normal and easy, but to punish you for getting hit on the harder difficulties.\n\nCOOP! This is a big thing I like. Playing with others. If a game can have an amazing single-player game, then if they can do it right, they can have a far superior Multiplayer experience. EDF 4.1 NAILED IT! You can bring your friends in to help you clear the game in a multiplayer lobby. And it runs really well! There are also items that work well in conjunction with one another for much more of an advantage against the waves of enemies!\n\nCONS:\n\nUNSTABLE! This is really the only bad thing I have to say about it. Sometimes in multiplayer lobbies, when loading a mission the game will get stuck on connecting with the other players, dropping everyone out of the lobby. Probably just a small coding oversight but it can get annoying. Even if it doesn't happen all that often.\n\n\n\n\n_______________\n\nAll in all, EDF 4.1 stays true to the series, a run&gun third person shooter with a lot of variety of weapons for dispatching HUNDREDS of enemies in a very well done atmosphere that gives a sense of urgency!\n\nWill you pick up your weapons and join the Earth Defense force?\n\nEDF!

Typically I'm the person that'll play a game for a couple dozen hours, drop it, and typically not pick it back up. A few games that have managed to hook me in the past/present were/are Counter Strike:Source, Diablo 2, Path of Exile, World of Tanks, Dragon's Dogma, Warframe (Pre-Pushover DE), Dungeon Siege 2, KOTOR, SWAT 4... And a couple more I can't remember.\nLong story short, it's very rare that a game grabs me and keeps me in, and I've played many hundreds of games over the years. Many very good games, too. Many games that claimed great replayability.\nBut this one hits all the right notes in all the right ways, and I can firmly say is WORTH the hefty price tag.\n---------------\nNow, let's get into an actual review. There are 4 classes for you to choose from: Ranger, Wing Diver, Air Raider, and Fencer. I'll say that Wing Diver is my least favorite class to play... But it's still a blast to play Wing Diver. Each class in this game has its niche and play style, and such a varied arsenal that you just want to play each class just to see what they can get.\n----- Classes -----\nRanger is your standard foot-soldier type class, with a very variable arsenal, their weapon classes as such: Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Rocket Launchers, Missile Launchers, Grenade Launchers, and other miscellaneous weapons/tools. This would including healing tools, flamethrowers, and other weapons that don't quite fit into the other categories.\nRanger's specific attributes entail that he can jump, roll (through light obstacles), has the 2nd-place armor scaling, has two weapon slots, can pilot vehicles, and has the fastest normal recovery time to get up off the ground after being knocked down.\n-----\nWing Diver is the class I know the least about, but I still know enough to give a decent overview.\nWing Diver has a flight-frame that runs on a power-pack that'll allow you to fly around at a good clip for a decent bit of time, however, a good deal of their weapons draw from the very same power pool, so one has to be mindful of their energy consumption. Their arsenal's theme is very high-tech weaponry, such as laser, electronic, and mind-guided missiles.\nWing Divers have access to the following in their arsenal: Short-Range lasers, Mid-Range lasers, Mid-Range Electric, Particle Cannons, Sniping Weapons, Other Ranged Attacks (Such as plasma-bombers and grenades,) Homing Weapons, and other Special Weapons that don't fit in the rest. This class has weapons that can cover just about any range, but I'd say they're more-so specialized for Close Quarters and are proficient up to mid range, however they have powerful tools for long range as well.\nTheir specific attributes are that they can fly, have the least armor scaling of the 4 classes, can use a bit of power to burn their thrusters and recover from a ragdoll knockup/knockdown, has two weapon slots, can NOT pilot vehicles, and probably some other stuff I don't know.\n-----\nAir Raider, my personal favorite class, is the support class of this game. While he doesn't have much in the way of direct-attack, (being limited to \"Limpet Guns\" which are basically remote-trigger grenade launchers,) He has access to a powerful arsenal of air/sea support and vehicles to draw from.\nAir Raider's arsenal goes as such: Guidance Equipment (Such as laser-designators for homing weapons,) Calling for Support, Support Equipment (Such as buffs, heals, and power-rechargers for Wing Divers,) Limpet Guns, Stationary Weapons (Such as C4, Sentry Guns, Claymores, AA Mines, etc,) and other Special Weapons such as razor-wire launchers, decoys, and electromagnetic shield systems.\nThey also have an equipment slot for a vehicle of choice, which can range from tanks, to AFVs, to SPGs, to Helicopters, to Hard-Suits, to a giant rock'em-sock'em robot.\nAir-Raider's particular attributes are that they can pilot vehicles, have 3rd-place armor-scaling, and have laser-designator tools that grant/assist functionality of the other classes homing weapons.\n-----\nFencer has a super-heavy exo-suit which allows them to use heavy-weaponry, and at that, dual-wield them. It's also the most technical/skill demanding class of the game, having many mechanics and caveats.\nTheir arsenal goes as such: CQB Striking weapons (Hammers, Swords, etc,) CQB Piercing weapons (Spears, auto-spears, etc,) Shields, Automatic Artillery, Artillery, and Missile Launchers.\nWhile they have the least weapon categories, don't let that fool you. What goes under \"Auto Arty/Arty\" is a very diverse cast of weaponry, such as autocannons, gatling guns, heavy machine guns, cannon-shot, mortars, etc. Missile Launchers, while some of them are personally usable, the heavier ones are crew-served, requiring an Air Raider to designate targets to grant them functionality.\nFencer is the only class that has access to shields, which are what makes them able to be tanky. Shields come in different flavors, such as ones that are focused on re-directing ranged attacks, focused on giving you wide-angle protection, focused on high damage-reduction, etc.\nFencer's particular attributes are that they can carry two sets of two weapons, can bull-doze through obstacles, and have a very tricky to master ability to use the thrusters some weapons grant them to recover from knockdowns.\nSomething important to bare in mind about Fencers, is that due to the heavy-weight of their ranged weaponry, they are very unweildy and have slow, dragged out aiming. Dual weilding ranged weapons amplifies this effect, making it very difficult to use them proficiently, but still very possible with practice.\n----- Gameplay -----\nI'll say that I'm only on mission 47 of the standard online campaign, but it's to my understanding that, DLC not-withstanding, there are... I believe 90+ missions, with 5 different difficulties, so there's PLENTY of game time and replayability to be had.\nThis is a Third-Person shooter game, with an arcade-y feel, and a big focus on co-op gameplay, supporting sessions of up to 4 players, with a solo-mode as well. Enemy health scales with the amount of players ingame.\nLet me tell you, that the difficulties aren't just what you'd expect them to be. You actually need to come prepared with a respectable arsenal from the lower difficulties first. The higher the difficulty, the more health your enemies have, the more deadly their attacks (Both in damage dealt, and in functionality,) and the faster they are. This game does difficulty very well, and doesn't just give them more and more HP... It adds a progressively more challenging gameplay that requires you to be prepared, both as a player with skills and logistics, and with your classes' weaponry.\nThe missions you play in vary, from wide-open mountains and/or fields, to cityscape, to underground tunnels and caves. It's to be noted that Air Raider's Support doesn't work underground, and only particular vehicles can be called in.\nThis game has a way of really imersing you into the atmosphere; from the battle-banter of your NPC allies (A+ for having NPCs under your command singing along with you and responding to your emotes,) commander, and mission handler on the comms; really making you feel tiny as you behold your gigantic enemies, in the hundreds and hundreds that you're tasked with eradicating in each and every mission; and the way the lighting plays with the underground environments is something I have never seen in any other game before... It's both beautiful and distressing at the same time.\n---------------\nI could go into details about some other junk that doesn't really matter, such as graphics, sound, controls, yadda yadda, but I'll simply say that this game does it all RIGHT. It hits all the right notes, and the controls perform exactly as you'd expect them to.\nAll said and done, this game gets a resounding 10/10 from me.", "timestamp_created": 1472913435,

get to blast away at hordes of huge enemies with anything from lasers to explosive plasma blasts to lightning guns?\nWhere you can wreck the environment, causing more explosions and turning more skyscrapers into rubble than a Michael Bay movie?\n\nThen this game is for you.\n\nThe basics of the games is this: Earth is being invaded by giant insects, arachnoids, alien spaceships, giant robots and more. Are these things connected? Who cares? Just let HQ worry about that while you mop up the enemy forces to the sound of your fellow soldiers singing songs about the EDF.\n\nGraphics are not exactly top notch, but I suppose that's the tradeoff for having such huge scale battles. There's a city map, for example, with skyscrapers tall enough to make me want to avoid the edge just because the height makes my self-preservation reflexes kick in XD\n\nThere are 4 classes to play and 5 difficulties. Normal starts off relatively easy, but ramps up quite a bit during the midgame missions. It's what I played through the entire game at, though I did have to go back to some earlier missions on higher difficulties to get the weapon drops I needed to overcome certain levels.\n\nIt took me about 24 hours to go through all the missions on Normal difficulty (not counting DLC missions) with the flying Wing Diver class, which was a ton of fun. I expect I'll try one of the other classes soon to see how they play.\nI also spent something like 2 hours in multiplayer with a friend. The multiplayer lobby system is a bit clunky, but once you're in a game together it seems to work just fine.\n\nMusic is overall fine, though it seemed a bit uneven in volume depending on where you were in relation to the action (could be someting with my system, I guess). The voice acting feels just cheesy enough to fit in a game like this. The ragdolling can be quite hilarious depending on what weapons are used, but seeing a ~8 meters tall robot flying off in 4 different direction after an airstrike hardly ever gets old :)\n\nTLDR: It's like an 80s/90s B-movie - the game. Starship Troopers meets Independence Day, only turned up to 11.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1472886047, "timestamp_updated": 1472886047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25318893": {"recommendationid": "25318893", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991155122", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473484311}, "language": "english", "review": "this is the best game ever made\n\n\n\nholy fuck what a savior out of all the shitty releases of 2016", "timestamp_created": 1472883307, "timestamp_updated": 1472883307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25316733": {"recommendationid": "25316733", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976095981", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 1027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495082102}, "language": "english", "review": "Extreme gratuitous fun, but waaay overpriced for a re-release of a console port of a last gen game.

You'll start off with basic stuff like rifles and rocket launchers that feel really tame, but by the end that rifle will shoot in a V shape with bouncing bullets reflecting all over a small tunnel that turns into a tornado of ant death while your friend is summoning the not-Megazord to punch not-Godzilla in the mouth.\n\nThe only real negative I can give this game is that as a single player experience it feels somewhat lacking. The gameplay doesn't change in any way, the missions don't gain or lose anything nor do you (unless you're playing the Fencer class that has a few weapons that require an Air Raider present), but the game just feels -right- as a co-op experience. The satisfaction of coordinating your efforts to land that PERFECT hit on a group of enemies just feels so rewarding that going back to playing solo almost feels dull by comparison.\n\nIdeally, get a few friends together, kick back and enjoy the ride that EDF has to offer. If you can't talk your friends into it, jump into a game online and go nuts.

I managed to get it on sale a few months back (and didn't realise it was on sale), and thought that it was going to be a fun little time killer, but when i started racking up 20+ hours into it and it showed no sign of stopping and the levels slowly became less and less forgiving. I knew I had picked up a jem. The progress menu doesn't even display how many different types of enemies there are in the game until you encounter them. \n\nThe game's graphics are underpar but it'll still give your computer a little work out with just how many enemies that you'll run into constantly. After playing through each class I found that the air raider could \"summon\" mech type machines, and from there the game turned into a \"starship troopers, meets godzilla and war of the world's vs me and my mini mechwarrior.\"  \n\nThe multiplayer can be a little finicky at times but having four people in game with you is a nonstop blast (puns for days) and with the highest difficulty setting the game seems to ramp even higher with the more people you have. \n\nBy the end of the game I felt like a true war hero that saves the day from a world ending event.

Mind you this game is stupid fun and quite frankly, I think a lot of these actually adds quite a bit to the charm. However I must, because I know people tend to hate these things, which is not  unreasonable.\n\n1) It is janky, physics, some controls, animations,ect.\n2) Menus don't have mouse support (but really it's not that bad to navigate), and multiplayer menus have some optimization issues.\n3) Load times are somewhat (though not ridiculously) long\n4) There is a grinding element. Though I'm fine with it because you grind weapons and HP directly, not XP, not credits, or anything like that, just weapons and armor from drops. Though to be perfectly honest other than maybe health, it's not really required and you'll more than likely get what you need for the next difficulty level after you finish the one you are on.\n5) Mics are ALWAYS on! (though you can set it to \"Off\" in the lobby, bear in mind this disables text chat but not quick-chat)\n6) Check your system specs, some people have reported problems with certain hardware configurations. To my knowledge the dev's know about this. (Me personally, Audio gets a little messed up in some firefights)\n\nOk that's out of the way, lets get to it! (EDIT: Wasn't terribly happy about the first review I pushed up here, decided to trim it down a bit and structure it better)\n\nThe premise: A Japanese game development studio one night watched too many B-Movies and Kaiju films and decided to make a game out of it, and this is the result. It also contains, to my knowledge, the greatest gaming moment ever.\n\nThat moment is leading your squad in the EDF fight song*, which is a hillarious rewrite of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, while mowing down swarms of bugs, robots, and whatever the heck these aliens feel like throwing down at you, and you do this with some of gaming's most ridiculous weaponry. That is what makes EDF awesome in a nutshell.\n\nThere's also hillariously unrealistic physics (Try rocket jumping with a Ranger), intentionally bad localization and Voice acting (\"Progress faster than science is impossible!\" among MANY more like that), city blocks being leveled in order to save the city, and LOTS of content! 800 weapons almost 100 Missions, and that's WITHOUT DLC\n\nNow sing the EDF Fight song with me!

Most of the gameplay is comprised of ridiculous ragdolling, getting swarmed by spiders and shouting \"EDF!\" Uncontrollably.  In general production values are a bit low, but the games tend to be scenario-driven stage to stage, intentionally ridiculous and quite visceral.\n\nLocal co-op has always been one of the main draws of the series, but this time the Online Multiplayer is quite good as well.  With four different classes that play quite differently (including one that's almost entirely team-oriented), there's enough variety that not everyone will necessarily call the same roles.  Multiplayer is the majority of the fun, as you collaborate while trying to parse how your friend is wearing a tank as a hat, why most of the city is missing or why half of the vehicles are out and out terrible.\n\nYou collect weapons that generally all have a strength and weakness, but gradually become stronger over time.  Not unlike diablo, the higher difficulties allow stronger weapons and let you obtain them through crate drops from enemies.  You end up getting a trickle of interesting guns and death machines, but if you need to get a shiny new toy every mission, this might not work out for you.  On the flip side, there are a lot of missions, so that may appeal to you instead.\n\nAll in all, unless you're really dedicated to so-bad-it's-incredible bug squashing on your own, or plan to play split-screen co-op, make sure you can convince some friends to get their own copies and play with you.

At first I could only get myself to play till about level 10, then I died and was like \"I need help to beat this\"\n\nThen I played it with friends.... Stayed up until 4 am, was in tears laughing multiple times. The chat wheel is the cherry on top of this masterpiece of a game. We sang the entire EDF anthem across multiple missions with out soldiers singing every other verse.\n\nAt first the weapons seem pretty straight forward. The ranger gets realistic military weapons, the more sifi classes get sifi weapons. But then we started getting things like giant energy swords and practically shoulder mounted nukes for the fencer, triple rocket launchers and laser guns that shoot 900 bullets once you pull the trigger once, hand held mini nukes and lightning crossbows for the wing diver and giant spiders and attack helecopters for the air raider.\n\nTHEN we found a level we could beat on hard, pretty far into the game. Laser Chainsaws, 20m radius air strikes from 150mm cannons that recharge almost instantly if you kill something with it, acid squirtguns. Sadly I didnt find anything too whacky for the fencer, but it's already pretty out there when you dual weild massive artillery cannons.\n\nThe game starts off pretty simple. Go here and kill some giant ants. The difficulty and level design get pretty advanced pretty quickly. There's actually alot of enemies that you have to play very differently against. The level design is actually amazing. How much could you possibly do with giant ants? quite alot actually. My favoite level so far was just quite literally 3 anthills under some forcefields.\n\nThis game was my childhood a long time ago. Playing this game split screen on inferno trying to abuse all of the levels until we found a way to beat it was so fun. Now that I'm actually 'good' at video games (somewhat) I'd say I can actually beat them straight up. But I took one glimpse at harder and I was like \"How can you possibly beat this\".

On these difficulties you can easily have a conversation and breeze through a level.  On Hardest and Insane however you better focus like a muh fug because poop's about to get real.  My GF and I (and some time local with my roomate)  have already sank 16 hours into this and we are only on level 17 because of how much we go back and play the higher difficulties.\n\nThis game is so sick it's ****ing disgusting.\n\nOh and I did play Insect Armageddon on the PS3 and this is WAAAAAY better.\n\nIf you like fast paced action, and are looking for an amazing Local Co-op game then get this.

WELL worth the money IMO. \n\nThe various player classes you can choose from have very interesting mechanics that totally change the way the game is played. Also, the 7 or 8 HUNDRED weapons you can unlock in the game keep it fresh. The varied maps are very large and open; it's like a camp sandbox destruction game. I'm VERY happy with my purchase!

Seriously, there are anywhere between 30 to over 100 enemies in a group at a time.\nIt's up to you, faceless soldier, to destroy them all. It's essentially B-Movie, the game.\n\nYou've got 98 missions, 800 weapons, 4 classes, and 5 difficulties.\nAbout 20 different enemy types including giant ants, spiders, hornets, 30ft tall robots, 50ft tall tripods, and a 300ft tall transformer robot, the Motherships, alien aircraft, and so on.\n\nDon't listen to other people when they say the game is a 'mindless shooter.'\nSure, it can be on the lower difficulties, and that's fine.\nBut once you try Hardest/Inferno with 4 players online, EDF is far from mindless. Only players with peak reaction speed, communication, situational awareness and tactical planning will succeed.\n\nOne word of warning, the first 10 missions of the game are slow and not representative of the whole game.\nThe progression starts off small with giant ants and boring weapons. \nTo really understand what EDF is like, you're likely going to have to play way past the 2-hour refund mark to have access to orbital satellite strikes, fight Godzilla, pilot Pacific Rim Jaegers, use laser snipers, napalm grenades and a whole slew of bad-ass content.\nIt is well worth it.\n\nEDF is a testament to the fact that most of the time, the simplest games are the best ones.\nNothing since Doom has demonstrated that better than EDF. It's a beloved series, and if you're even slightly interested, you simply owe it to yourself to give it a try.\n\nGet this game. There is HUNDREDS of hours of entertainment, especially online with 4 players.\nJust ask any newcomer to the series and 99% of the time, you'll see their unbridled, quickly attained burning love for

The planet Earth is once again attacked by the Ravagers, an alien force with a unexplained love for Japanese Kaiju B-movies. Now the planet is overrun with giant insects, flying dragons, huge killer robots, and UFOs.\n\nJust like my sex life. \n\nI'm going to just go ahead and say that this game is radical. Planet Fight Guys is one of those games that revels in it's simplicity in the best way. Each mission is about exterminating an enemy army or destroying a specific target, which sounds boring if it wasn't for the overwhelming flood of enemies they send to chew on your tender spicy butthole. \n\nYou have four classes to choose from in Terra Kerfuffle Men. You can play as shoot guy, flying shoot girl, angry radio man, and  Harambe the Gorilla. Each class has their own weapons and special abilities like how Harambe can deflect enemy attacks and dash cancel, Flying shooty girl can fly, Angry Radio Man can call in mechs and mechs and why would you use anything other than a mech? And Shooty Guy can get punched in the face and not cry for 30 minutes. \n\nKilling enemies can get you an assortment of drops, ranging from stronger weapons, weaker that you don't need, mostly weaker weapons, armor drops, health, assorted anime, a pillow to deal with your crippling loneliness, and video games. \n\nSphere Boxing Gang is arcadey fun at it's finest. The guns are weighty and crunchy, and the amount of enemies rushing you at any given time makes me feel like I don't scrounge for thrown away games in the EB games dumpster.  \n\nThe game is not for everyone however, but neither is freedom or the embrace of a loved one. Even so, I do have some problems with the game.  You spend a lot of time in the game looking up, which can get disorientating at times, And your view can be completely obstructed if you get swarmed like the kid in class with gum. Your allies also seem to be so prepared to die for the EDF that they'll jump into your rockets at point blank just to prove it. \n\nBut should you play Dirt Guardian Guys? \n\n\nYes. \n\nGoing to be honest, I love EDF since I played it on an Xbox 360 back in 1985. It's a simple series with a simple premise, lots of enemies on screen, go kill them. I'm biased when it comes to the series because I'm a stinky idiot who likes bright colors and flashy lights. If you're new to the series, I would recommend waiting for a price drop, but if you aren't then. Well. You probably already have EDF. \n\nLand Combat Army gets 4 EDF soldier's singing out of a possible 2. \n\nA worker ant can withstand pressures up to 5000 times greater than it's own body weight. But it can't feel true love. \nThe Curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1470542774, "timestamp_updated": 1470542774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24750731": {"recommendationid": "24750731", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967893228", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471220618}, "language": "english", "review": "I fucking hate wasps.\n\nThis game gives me so much satisfaction.\n\n10/10 would shoot wasps with rocket launchers again.", "timestamp_created": 1470526108, "timestamp_updated": 1470526108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24748072": {"recommendationid": "24748072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055884566", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487698580}, "language": "english", "review": "I punched a giant godzilla knockoff in the face as it hit my giant robot in the face while the city crumbled around us and the people on the ground looked up and chanted EDF!

Diese Klasse ist eine Angriffsklasse welche \u00fcberall gut ist und ebsonders f\u00fcr Einsteiger geeignet ist. Wird meist mit 1 Maschinengeweghr oder Shotgun und einem Raketenwerfer gespielt\n\nFencer:\nEine Art Tank, sehr langsam aber mit starken Waffen ausgestattet welche zus\u00e4tzlich je 2 Modis haben k\u00f6nnen\n\nAir Raider:\nEine Klasse die weniger durch ihre Angriffskraft gl\u00e4nzt, eher durch seine F\u00e4higkeit Luftunterst\u00fctzung zu Rufen, z.B indem er sich einen Panzer oder Hubschrauber oder anderes droppen l\u00e4sst.\n\nWingdiver:\nEine Klasse mit einem Jetpack welche sich das Schlachtfeld auch von weit oben betrchten kann. Der perfekte Kundschafter und eine sehr schnelle Klasse. Meineserachtens wenn man mit ihr umgehen kann eine der st\u00e4rksten, jedoch nicht f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger geeignet da man mit dem jetpack umgehen k\u00f6nnen muss und die Klasse das geringste Leben ebsitz\n\n\n[h1]Gegner[/h1]\nDie Gegner langen von gro\u00dfen Ameisen und Bienen, Spinnen und Raumschiffen bis hin zu riesigen Godzilla\u00e4hnlichen Kampfmonstern und Maschinen.\n\n[h1]Allgemeines[/h1]\nEDF ist ein Spiel das einem gef\u00e4llt oder man hasst es. Die Grafaik ist gut aber nicht \u00fcberragend, Strategie braucht man eher nur in den letzten Leveln wirklich gut, Viele Level werden in mehreren Missionen wiederverwertet und vieles andere. Was macht das Spiel denn f\u00fcr mich nun empfehlenswert?\nGanz einfach, es ist ein verdammt spassiges unterfangen mit 3 anderen Leuten gegen eine unz\u00e4hlige Masse an Rieseninsekten in einer Stadt anzutreten, alle zusammen singen zu lassen, EDF zu schreihen und sich ins get\u00fcmmel zu st\u00fcrzen. In einen riesigen Kampfrobotter einzusteigen und gegen einen Godzilla \u00e4hnlichen Gegner anzutreten, an einem Stradt gegen Riesige kampfmaschinen anzutreten und zu sehen wie durch Luftschl\u00e4ge und eigene Raketen Bombardements der ganze Horizont in Flammen steht. EDF ist zwar keine spieltechnische Meisterleistung jedoch im hinblick auf Gr\u00f6sse, Masse, Action und Waffenvielfalt ist es so ziemlich unschlagbar.\nEs bietet \u00fcber 800 Waffen f\u00fcr 4 absolut Unterschiedliche Klassen und im online Modus 98 Missionen f\u00fcr welche man beim ersten durchspielen gut 20h einplanen kann. Wenn man alles erreichen will bietet das Spiel mehrere Hundert Stunden Spielspass.\n\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nWer schon immer mal gro\u00dfe Gegnermengen in schier unglaublicher Gr\u00f6sse erledigen wollte sollte dieses Spiel nicht verpassen. F\u00fcr Spieler die eher absolut taktisches vorgehen lieben wie bei Splinter Cell oder Metal Gear Solid wird dieses Spiel vermutlich eher nichts sein.", "timestamp_created": 1470498828, "timestamp_updated": 1470504451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24741255": {"recommendationid": "24741255", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993461538", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471440557}, "language": "japanese", "review": "EDF!

The series has been fine-tuning itself over the years, and while the ill-fated American-made Insect Armageddon may have flopped, it did introduce to the series class-based gameplay (although earlier versions did have two playable characters) and teammate reviving (I wish sprinting would've made its way over, too).

With the garbage fire that was Insect Armageddon I thought the series was going to run into issues with outsourcing that would leave it dead and ruined.  Once 2025 hit I had hope that maybe that wouldn't be the case after all but issues surrouding screen tearing and frame rate drops made me hold off on picking it up.  Now we have the port of the remaster of that title and it's just as good as what I remember playing back in the day.\n\nFor those that haven't played the series imagine a 1950s sci-fi movie combined with an arcade game and you basically have what gives EDF its appeal.  You're placed smack dab in the middle of an alien invasion by robots, insects, kaiju, and space ships and it's as amazing as it sounds.  Nothing beats the feeling of trying to murder giant ants while you \"accidentally\" level an entire city.\n\nWith 89 levels, 4 classes, 5 difficulties, 100s of weapons, online and split screen co-op this is the type of game that will end up eating a lot of your time.  I've already put in 20 hours (15 in single player and 5 in online multiplayer) and I'm nowhere near being worn out on it.  I know that some may feel hesitant about picking up a title like this based on the way it looks coupled with the price it is asking but I'd recommend watching some gameplay videos of it on Youtube to help get the idea of what it really is offering.\n\nFor those that played 2017 and loved it this follows in its footsteps faithfully.  Tons of fun and well worth the price.  There have been some having issues with running it on certain hardware configurations so I'd also recommend looking on the forums first to see if you'll encounter those issues, what workarounds exist, and when the devs have had a chance to fix any of the problems.

EDF has the beating, unconvincing latex and ketchup heart of a B movie, and every component of the game is below par. The graphics would have been primitive ten years ago, and the animation truly needs to be seen to believed \u2013 a jumbled mess of spazzy death animations and clipping errors, assuming the enemies get that far and don\u2019t just vibrate repeatedly against a poorly rendered tree for the whole battle. To the game\u2019s credit, nearly every structure in the game can be destroyed, and the buildings fall apart with all the force, dynamism and realism of a Styrofoam jenga tower.\n\nAnd yet, it all works. The extraordinary level of jank on display is entirely in keeping with its B-movie inspirations. The terrible voice acting is absolutely spot on in both languages \u2013 every actor sounds like they\u2019re reading their lines for the first time with a mixture of confusion and disbelief, and every line has only the most tangential relation to the last. It sounds like a conversation between two concussion victims, and it is glorious.\n\nThe game itself has been described as Dynasty Warriors with giant insects, and that\u2019s a pretty on point comparison. Whatever the mission claims to be, you have one objective \u2013 kill all the red blobs on the radar. There is a surprisingly excellent variety in enemies, even with the inevitable palette swaps, and despite the jank the controls are responsive and tight. The four classes have admirable variety as well, from the nimble jetpack enabled wingdiver (taking to the air sans breastplate and trousers, ostensibly to reduce weight) to the vehicle summoning support class air raider. There\u2019s a huge variety of weapons available to each class as well, and in co-op building a balanced team is key to survival.\n\nWhether or not I can recommend EDF to you will depend on your circumstances. As a single player, EDF is enjoyable but repetitive and lonely, and the difficulty is very uneven with some enemies being a breeze for one class whilst being a nightmare for others. It\u2019s obviously built for co-op, and this is where it\u2019s manic gameplay shines \u2013 getting one shot by a superlaser 90% through a mission is annoying but hilarious when a friend can drive over and revive you, but utterly infuriating in single player. The class based gameplay and ridiculous excess are at their best when enjoyed with inebriated friends, a playable Mystery Science Theatre where the enjoyment comes both because of and in spite of its budget and limitations.\n\nUnfortunately on the PC version at least, the game is plagued by cheating, and cheating players can permanently screw up your save file. The cheating is so ubiquitous that I cannot recommend playing with randoms if this is your only multiplayer avenue. With a friend or three and a suitable level of intoxication/brain damage however, the game is a blast and absolutely worth the surprisingly hefty outlay \u2013 but this is not a situation that everyone is lucky enough to be in.", "timestamp_created": 1470073534, "timestamp_updated": 1470073534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675955",

The price tag is not too high at all for the contents you get. You get 4 different classes to play with. They play differently, so you basically get 4 in 1 games. The game is fun, and enjoyable both Offline, and Online. Still, there are something that you should know:\n\n[h1]Grinding, and Mindless Shooter?[/h1]\nIs 4.1 a grindy, mindless shooter? It depends. IMO, it is 'not' the grinding game, but can be play as one. The mindless part maybe true, but it is the mindless shooter on lower difficulties especially for Offline Missions. Online missions, on higher difficulties are not.\n\nBack to the grinding, each class has its own progressions (missions on 5 difficulties), armors and weapons (loot drops). These loot drops can be earned as you progress through missions on each difficulty. They are limited to missions, and difficulties\n\nHowever, these missions can be played in any order as long as you have unlocked it, by playing through them once as any class on any difficulty. This is where the grinding is. \n\nPlayers, that want to get strong fast, and easy, will be playing certain missions on certain difficulty over and over to grind for armor, weapon drops. That is very BORING, and killed the very objective of the game, progressions.\n\nThese players, apart from their equipments, often lack the skills/knowledges they need to play with others especially on higher difficulty. Some are series vet, which is fine for me as they are fun to play with, and know their parts, but there are lots of new players playing this way. These guys are annoying. They don't communicate, and make things harder than it should be.\n\nI have been playing from Normal, and almost onto the Hardest for my Wing Diver. I have done zero farming. I haven't replay any mission unless, got wiped > restart. I don't have any problem with current armors / weapons that cannot finish the Online Missions with my friends who do similar thing. (Online missions are harder than offline.)\n\n[h1]Relentless Cheaters[/h1]\nThere are these idiots. They can ruin your fun. They can give you any amount of armors, and weapons by manipulating with loot drops picked up amount.\n\nThere are also some harmless hack (to your save) likes God Mode, No Reload, etc.\n\nSo if you are looking to play Online, you should be playing with friends than the randoms. There are good randoms too, but from the cheaters I encountered so far, it doesn't worth playing with randoms in my region.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nThe game is fun to play, and can be played at your own paces.

Giant bugs, robots, UFO's, massive firepower, cheesy one-liners, action-packed... it's all here, baby, and it's bloody glorious!\n\nEarth Defense Force 4.1 has the giant monsters of B-movies and the cheesy humour along with it. House-sized bees and spiders, 10-story robots, groups of soldiers singing while moving from one objective to the next, dozens of trails left in the sky after rockets find their target, large UFOs slowly crashing into a fireball of destruction, monster ants flinging NPCs or my character for miles with arms and legs flailing as we somersault through the air awaiting our final landing spot: it all just puts a giant grin on my face.\n\nThe 4 classes in Earth Defense Force 4.1 were all fun to play, some a little more than others, but your mileage may vary. For e.g. the Wing Diver has a jet pack and is great at hit and run tactics and collecting loot sprawled all over the battlefield, but she has the lowest armor of all classes making her more of a glass cannon. Want a little more beef and fire power? Play the Fencer who wears Fallout-style power armor and has the capability of wielding tank-like cannons in each arm.\n\nI was a big fan of the fact each class comes with their own set of weapons I needed to find and unlock, half of the fun was experimenting with each new weapon, experiencing its strengths, weaknesses, and quirks. After getting a good feel for each weapon, it was fun playing with optimal weapon pairings for each mission!\n\nAll of this fun can be shared with 3 other players in online co-op. I found myself thinking back and laughing at the fantastic memories and stories generated by Earth Defense Force 4.1 based on the experiences I had with friends and random players online. The game produces so many epic \u201cwow\u201d and \u201cwhat the f*&$! is that?!\u201d moments it makes it difficult not to recall them.\n\nImagine building-sized robots stomping towards you while massive alien motherships drop 100's of giant ants, all while dodging a barrage of lasers and alien bee stingers.\n\nOne of my favourite memories so far was the surprise mech called in by a teammate during a mission where giant red ants storm the beach we were tasked to defend. During all the carnage, one of our online teammates stops firing and says, \u201cDon't worry guys, I got this.\u201d I looked up to the sky to find a huge Pacific Rim sized Mech Warrior being choppered to the beach, lands with such force the sand kicks up, momentarily blinding my view of the impending ant swarm. Then my teammate enters the mech and starts stomping the ants like a slow moving angry child throwing a 1000 ton temper tantrum. All the while, the ants swarm the mech, crawling all over and up and down the hulking armored body. I took the opportunity to pull out my rocket launcher and start firing at the ants, watching them fall off the mech in droves. This was such an incredible moment.\n\nI don't kid myself, Earth Defense Force 4.1 has many glaring issues, the menu UI, lack of VoIP control options, sluggish vehicle movement, slight frame drops during gigantic explosions with 100's of enemies on screen, less-than-impactful weapon sounds, and a host of other bugs (not of the insect kind!). Yet, it remains one of the most fun games I've played in 2016, slowly creeping up the ladder of my top 5 games of all time. It's the type of blissful, mesmerizing fun I have not had in a long, long time.\n\nEDF!!

These things are all great, but here's a big secret about EDF.\n\nThe gameplay is actually [i]really[/i] good.\n\nNo, seriously, you'll find yourself balancing your loadout, coordinating what to take with friends over voice chat, figuring out strategies and improvising when inevitably the wheels fall off.

I just wasn't sure mindlessly killing bugs with Michael-Bay-inspired exmplosions and gunfire was something that I'd enjoy past a level or two.\n\nAnd yet, here we are, with me recommending this. It's glorious stupidity. It's America by way of Japan. It's Starship Troopers: The Third-Person Shooter. \n\nYou destroy bugs with missiles, miniguns, and mecha. It's great, dumb fun. However, it's not without some frustrations.\n\nThe graphics options aren't as customizable as most games, which can be frustrating if you want to turn things up or down.\n\nThe UI can be wonky to navigate, as you use WASD instead of the mouse or arrow keys.\n\nI WILL say that the game is much more entertaining with other people, but that's almost a non-issue with how easily you can find randoms to play with online. \n\nHowever, buddies always make it more fun.

I recommend this to anyone who loves run and gun, asymmetrical class archetypes and general destruction and decimation of entire city blocks.  It has fantastic(and active) co-op campaigns with plenty of replayable challenge modes to try.\n\nPros:\n-Replayable\n-Upwards of a hundred missions with many different enemies to fight\n-Challenging in a good way\n-Asymmetrical class gameplay where every class brings something good to the table\n-Highly Destructible environments, buildings and vehicles go up in flames and crumbles\n-Fast paced, hectic gameplay with most missions averaging between 5-20 minutes\n-Hundreds of guns to choose from\n-Runs well\n-Co-op and splitscreen work flawlessly\n\nCons:\n-The menu and UI are controlled via wasd and the mouse has a weird draw on the selection(move your mouse and you may select the wrong thing)\n-Limited options menu.  Basically all you can change are vsync, AA and ratio/fullscreen and windowed.  No borderless here.  There are key rebindings but some seemed to be missing, but that could have just been me missing them.\n-Controller is sometimes fussy with splitscreen, even using a proprietary xbox controller\n-Dated graphics, though great taken as a whole are pretty much PS3 level of quality.  This REALLY shouldn't deter you, though.\n-The picking up of items and armor isn't completely intuitive.  If you kill the last enemy and haven't managed to grab everything(especially difficult for air raider and mostly ranger due to their limited mobility) you're pretty much SoL for whatever dropped.\n-Many items are fun but just aren't useful.  There are literally hundreds of guns to pick from but many are just so unwieldy that they're immediately outclassed.  This isn't surprising given the sheer number of available loadouts  but it's still a con.\n\nIn summary I think this is a great game but it's definitely not for everyone.  I love looting and killing things in interesting ways and this game has that in spades.  The classes are all unique and fun to play in their own way.  You can always bring something useful to the team and your loadout can heavily determine your success in a particular mission.  The game doesn't swamp you with bulletsponges but rather enemies that are legitimately dangerous.  Their health DOES go up with difficulty but it's hardly ever an unreal amount that can't be overcome by using the right weapons and strategy.\n\nThis game basically took the premise [b]\"Wouldn't it be cool if....?\"[/b] and ran with it.\n\nIf you want to see a few of the earlier missions played in hardmode; my friend and I did a first impressions video!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH4FFt4IS2I&feature=youtu.be", "timestamp_created": 1469748749, "timestamp_updated": 1469749013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24583407": {"recommendationid": "24583407", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963272325", "num_games_owned": 1428, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482865193}, "language": "english", "review": "OUR COMPUTERS CAN DO [i]THIS[/i]\n\nWHY HAVE WE NOT MADE THEM DO THIS EARLIER\n\nWHY IS THIS NOT THE ONLY THING WE MAKE THEM DO", "timestamp_created": 1469739933, "timestamp_updated": 1480275267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 79, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737942", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24583020": {"recommendationid": "24583020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003170264", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 5137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498775039}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.\n\nUnadultared arcade fun. Straight to the point with no fluff.\n\nFor how janky the game might seem, it is deceivingly well-designed with a lot of minute detail. One of my favorite aspects of this game is how it manages to mask its arcadey nature - guns at first might seem not the best way to mow down hordes of giant insects and yet the flow of combat and difficulty feel just right. When you play as a Fencer (power-armor class) you'd imagine that the game would turn into Crackdown or Saints Row 4 in terms of having super abilities. And yet, in this game of eradicating giant bugs, the Fencer feels hefty and like you're really carrying all that weight on him, having to learn how to dash properly and then that grows into learning tricks like dash-cancels and so forth. Even vehicles operate too realistically from what you should expect from this game, but yet again, they fill in their gap just right without feeling over or underpowered.\n\nWeapons are unlocked through a loot-box system, crates which you pick up during the mission and unlock after successfully completing it. Often times you will get already-unlocked guns but once you get something new it truly feels rewarding. Weapons themselves don't progress liniarly as some stats might be better over the previous weapon but it may have quirks which can make it even more useful or a gun for a very specific task. This game is a much better Borderlands than Borderlands itself in terms of whacky gun drops. And replaying old missions with newly acquired arms is always fun.\n\nFour distinct classes, plenty of missions and a lot of detail which you wouldn't expect to be there nor would you have ever cared even if was absent.\n\nI can just keep gushing over this game, it's just so good and filled with many damn fun moments, solo or in co-op.\n\nIt is a port, blatantly obvious port, but fairly stable for such.\n\nGrab your AF14, sodlier - it's time to save the Earf, once more.", "timestamp_created": 1469738648, "timestamp_updated": 1469738648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620095", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24582726": {"recommendationid": "24582726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066407374", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1515101910}, "language": "english", "review": "Got stepped on by a giant robot and was stuck to bottom of it's foot.\n\n11/10 Would get stepped on like ant again.", "timestamp_created": 1469737673, "timestamp_updated": 1469737673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24582681": {"recommendationid": "24582681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037454487", "num_games_owned": 554, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477424079}, "language": "english", "review": "Like [i]Onechanbara Z2[/i], this PC port of a former PS4 exclusive came pretty much out of nowhere.

Multiplay has even more missions than the solo game. Each difficulty will give you better, more powerful, crazy weapons to cause mass distruction with.  Each class has its own unique gameplay.\n\n-Rangers are the basic ground troop, best class to start with to learn the game. Their weapons consists of rifel, shotguns, and rocket launchers.\n\n-Fencer is the melee/tank class. The deliver destructive close combat damage and heavy weapon support. Chain guns, cannons, shields, melee weapons and rocket launchers are their weapons.\n\n-Wing diver is the fast flying class. They have little armor, but can engage enemies from above the battle field. High explosive plasma weapons, sniper rifles, and close quarter energy lances are their weapons of choice.\n\n-Air raider is the support class. This is a co-op recomended class cause their abilities come from your team killing the enemies. They can call in airstrikes and other support attacks. They can also get vehicles air dropped in that they and the rangers can drive.\n\nAll in all this is a fun frantic game.

Singleplayer Shooter aus dem Hause Sandlot und ist eigentlich ehr im Asiatischen Raum bekannt.\n\nNichts destotrotz ist EDF ein purer Geheimtipp auch wenn man es erst nicht vermuten mag, weil dieser Titel Grafisch & Technisch gesehen schlechter abschneiden w\u00fcrde als Helena Fischer bei einem Hip Hop Konzert.\nAlso was macht dann EDF zu einem wirklichen Geheimtipp fragt ihr euch Mitsicherheit, na dann h\u00f6rt mal ganz gespannt zu !\n\nKurz gesagt ist das Spiel selbst die reinste Homage an so wirklich jedem Klischee eines  Invasions Film den jemals gab.\nSo werdet ihr schnell den Bezug zu Stormship Troopers, Independents Day oder Godzilla  entdecken, ebenso  die passenden Gegner Horden von Stormship Troopers geparrt mit Aliens und vielem mehr.\n\nUm der Invasion auf den Pelz zu r\u00fccken habt ihr die M\u00f6glichkeit verschiedene Waffenkisten aus den Missionen zu bergen, diese Enthalten nach dem Abschluss der Mission f\u00fcr eure Klasse diverse Zuf\u00e4llige Waffen aus einem Sortiment von Rund 800 Waffen.\n\nDas Gameplay an und f\u00fcr sich ist dabei recht Monoton aber durch und durch Unterhaltsam durch die Brachiale Art der puren Waffengewalt sowie den 4 spielbaren Klassen und dem grandiosen physikalischen banalen Zerst\u00f6rungssystem. \n\nAlles in allem f\u00fcgt sich letztendlich ein ganz Spezielles Bild zusammen welches man einfach mal Erlebt haben muss. \n\nWer also ein Grafisches sowie Technisches Meisterwerk erwartet der sollte von EDF  eindeutig die Finger lassen.\n\nWer allerdings einen Spa\u00dfigen Solo sowie Coop Shooter sucht der Banaler und Lustiger nicht sein k\u00f6nnte der wird mit diesem Titel genau auf seine Kosten kommen ! \n\nZudem gibt es genug Schwierigkeitsgr\u00e4de um f\u00fcr jeden Spieler seine richtige H\u00e4rte zu finden mit gen\u00fcgend Spielzeit. \n \nWie immer ist EDF also ein klarer Geheimtipp !\n\nVideo zum Review: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/dcOfQ5VRh60", "timestamp_created": 1469611027,

A sadistic smirk forms as you take your other hand and rip one of it's legs off.  It's panicing gets more frantic which you reply back with tightning your grip on it.  You flip it over and rip it's other front leg off and flick it away with jubilance.  You lower yourself to the ground and place it on the middle of the sidewalk and watch as it struggles to move.  You could be merciful...  You could end it's misery, but you continue to stare at it.  The food it was going to bring back home long forgotten, it moves slightly to the left or to the right in a desperate attempt to escape it's tormentor.  Your smirk grows.  This brings pleasure to you as you look to your left and right to see if any other misfortunate insects will emerge from the grass when they should have stayed put.  Feeling like it's time to move on, you stand up, raise your foot, and end the miserable ant's suffering and continue on with your life as if nothing that transpired here had any significance on you what-so-ever.\n\n\n\nNow it's their turn.  \n\nPayback is a bitch.", "timestamp_created": 1469602035, "timestamp_updated": 1469608906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24546640": {"recommendationid": "24546640", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960863685", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470364448}, "language": "english", "review": "It's time to fumigate!

It's non-serious, all-fun as you shoot explosives at giant ants and giant spiders and watch them all go boom. There's not much to say, personally. There is a fair amount of skill that you can use on certain classes, but in the end, it's at its best when played to kill time with friends. It's fantastic to binge on because of the fun it offers, and it's great on those offdays when you say to yourself \"Man, what do I even want to do today?\"\n\n[h1]Our Forces Have Now Dwindled and We Pull Back to Regroup, or; How I Learned to Hate Armor Grinding[/h1]\n\n\"Armor\" is your character's health. Armor is gained by a ratio; Each class has a different ratio as well. Without drawing the actual numbers, 2 boxes of Armor = 1 actual Armor for Ranger, the \"basic\" class that carries over from other EDF games. 4 boxes of Armor = 1 actual Armor for Wing Diver, the mobile and squishy class that focuses on manuevering through the air. These boxes of Armor have a [i]CHANCE[/i] of dropping from all enemies in the game. Other things that can potentially drop are: Small Healthpack, Large Healthpack, and Weapon Boxes. Armor gain is not affected by difficulty. This means that you gain the same amount of armor per crate regardless of difficulty. 2 crates = 1 Ranger armor whether Easy or Inferno. You start off with a measly amount of armor, which is to be expected. You are recommended to have ~5000 armor for Inferno, roughly. Armor gain does not transfer to other classes; If you have been playing Ranger throughout the whole campaign and got 5000 armor somehow, your untouched Wing Diver will still have ~200 armor that you will have to gain all over again; probably by going through the Normal/Easy difficulty campaign all over again, but with this class. \n\nThis isn't necessarily bad; It encourages you to keep playing the game with these different classes until you gain both familiarity with the class as well as sufficient gear and armor. The problem is that armor farming is a slow process even at its most grindiest. And you have to do this with every single class. It is the most unfun part of an otherwise great game. The only workarounds are farming specific missions or using a cheating tool to modify your armor; obviously, neither of these are great. It is simply a sad reality.\n\nYet still, the game shines as a prime example of how to make a fun game in all other aspects. There's not much balancing for multiplayer and even singleplayer can seem a bit iffy sometimes. It takes experimentation to know what weapons to use on what missions against what enemies, but it's not impossible to understand. Sadly, some weapons are really mediocre compared to others and may tempt you to use these overall better choices, but this is not the whole case.\n\nThe armor grinding is horrendous, yes, but I completely urge you to buy the game, even if it's only when it is on sale. It's great fun alone and with friends the same.", "timestamp_created": 1469562752, "timestamp_updated": 1498047921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490308", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24542124": {"recommendationid": "24542124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181728893", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471311775}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5206\u304b\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0+\u30b3\u30f3\u30bb\u30d7\u30c8\u3002\u30bd\u30ed\u3067\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3002\n\u96e3\u70b9\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3059\u308c\u3070UI\u304c\u82e5\u5e72\u4f7f\u3044\u3065\u3089\u3044\u304f\u3089\u3044\u304b\u3002\u3068\u3066\u3082\u826f\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1469559128, "timestamp_updated": 1469559128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24541710": {"recommendationid": "24541710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308451295", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473019529}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Keeps Crashing on First mission", "timestamp_created": 1469557681, "timestamp_updated": 1470850541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24541371": {"recommendationid": "24541371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037871007", "num_games_owned": 1171, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 2812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507315377}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been trying to write a review for this game for quite some time now, but i simply cannot write one.

What you see is what you get.  Repeatedly used models of a small number of enemy types used over and over again to create massive battles.  Despite that, the gameplay is very addictive for those who enjoy the destruction and havoc during each mission.  The game has a large assortment of weapons for each class, all of which need to be unlocked by playing progressively harder missions.  This ends up being a very long grind to get the weapons you want, but the missions are such pure mayhem and chaos that while some missions might feel similar, varied level design keeps the gameplay fresh.\n\nOn the technical side, the port is very solid, though the keyboard controls feel VERY shoehorned in.  They work, but not as well as a controller does, especially the fencer and air raider.  These two classes have an abundance of weapons that need to be finely adjusted, but to give them weight, their aim is slow to move.  This makes you FEEL as though you are aiming an enormous cannon, but while the controller just holds the stick upwards, the mouse has to continually move upwards, and most likely be picked up and placed lower on the mousepad to continue moving up.\n\nAnyway, I'm ranting.

I bought it when it was 5 days old from release on the Steam with -30% discount + with all DLCs. The gameplay is amazing, each charater has its own awesome weaponry, my favorite charater is Wing Diver. \nI wish the game was open world, but im ok with it. Been doing a lot of missions on easy, sometimes in normal or hard mode too. Singleplayer is great, multiplayer is great, you can join or create your room there and wait few minutes for the players to join you. Been having a blast on the game and on my GTX 750 2GB graphics card it didnt fall 1 fps from 60 fps. Been running smooth even on high explosions for days.\nI love Sci Fi games, especially with giant creatures like silver and red ants, spiders, bees (NOT THE BEEES!!! AHH THEYRE IN MY HEAD!!! Chill, was just joking.) And the mothership which drops hectors, flying drones felt like independence day just like in the film.

The story is simplistic and the voices are equivalent to a good bad movie, but the game play itself makes up for all of it.\n\nSome are experiencing freezes and even crashes, so I can only recommend this for this who meet or exceed recommended system requirements as just like the console version, it requires a lot of processing power to handle. Console was pushed to its limits in this game with its large amount of bugs, particles, and enough big explosions on one screen that will make Michael Bay cry in joy.\n\nIf you like mindless fun killing giant creatures with weapons big and small and giant mechs, this is the game for you.

I thought it was gonna be locked to specific ones BUT NOPE YOU CAN CALL IT IN ANY TIME (as long as you kill enough enemies to charge up it's cooldown timer during a mission).\n\nSo yeah BEST GAME 2016", "timestamp_created": 1469506947, "timestamp_updated": 1490319895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24530541": {"recommendationid": "24530541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002590414", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473508842}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u307e\u3060\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u3059\u304c\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3067\u3059\n\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u3082\u5927\u5206\u591a\u3044\u307f\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3084\u308a\u5fdc\u3048\u3082\u3042\u308a\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u306d\n\u306a\u3093\u3068\u3044\u3063\u3066\u3082pc\u306a\u306e\u3067\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u3068\u3001\u51e6\u7406\u843d\u3061\u304c\u5168\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3057\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u65e9\u304f\u5feb\u9069\n\u305f\u3060\u30bb\u30fc\u30eb\u671f\u9593\u306f\u7d42\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u6ce8\u610f", "timestamp_created": 1469506787, "timestamp_updated": 1469506787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499884", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24530519": {"recommendationid": "24530519", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970904942", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469516897}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u6253\u8d77\u4f86\u662f\u5f88\u723d\u5feb\uff0c\u53ef\u60dc3D\u6a21\u7d44\u4e00\u822c\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u5ea61080P\u4e0b\u4f30\u8a08GTX750ti\u3001R260X\u5c31\u80fd\u723d\u73a9\u3002\n\u6b66\u5668\u591a\u4f46\u597d\u7528\u7684\u5c31\u90a3\u5e7e\u628a\uff0c\u627e\u670b\u53cb\u73a9\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u8010\u73a9\u5ea6\u3002\n\n\u5728Win10\u4e0b\u9700\u8abf\u6574\u5b57\u578b\u7e2e\u653e\u6bd4\u70ba\u9810\u8a2d\u7684100%\uff0c\u4e0d\u7136\u65e5\u6587\u5b57\u578b\u6703\u5de6\u53f3\u9593\u8ddd\u904e\u5c0f\uff0c\u82f1\u6587\u5247\u662f\u4e0a\u4e0b\uff0c\u770b\u65e5\u5f8c\u6703\u4e0d\u6703\u4fee\u6b63(\u7b11)\u3002\n\n\u904a\u6232\u6642\u9593\u4e0d\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b49\u50f9\u683c\u780d\u534a\u5728\u8cfc\u8cb7\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1469506705, "timestamp_updated": 1469506705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24530264": {"recommendationid": "24530264", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996180128", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500690868}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the third system I've bought this game for.

It is completely hilarious and doesn't take much skill so really anyone can play. \n       Your ability to play higher difficulties is based on your drops, the problem is the drops don't seem to have set levels so if there is a kind of weapon you need before you can move onto Hardest (not the hardest difficulty) or Inferno you may need to grind mission 26. \n       My only other problem is that in online co-op there are level caps to weapons you can use by difficulty, it's to prevent people from being carried, but the only reason I want to go into a higher difficulty right now is to get a better weapon for a lower one.", "timestamp_created": 1469417473, "timestamp_updated": 1469652048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24511632": {"recommendationid": "24511632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289340394", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1515489149}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u52d5\u4f5c\u505c\u6b62\u3067\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1469417352, "timestamp_updated": 1469417352, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494020", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24511526": {"recommendationid": "24511526", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980221014", "num_games_owned": 2775, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 4853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475938914}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e04\u0e19\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 \u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d+\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e14\u0e32\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e46 \u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\u0e19\u0e30\n\n\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e1e\u0e2d Co-op \u0e40\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e30 (\u0e22\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e01\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e19\u0e30) \u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e41\u0e21\u0e23\u0e48\u0e07\u0e42\u0e04\u0e23\u0e15\u0e17\u0e23\u0e07\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e04\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22 \u0e2d\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2e\u0e32 \u0e16\u0e16\u0e16\u0e16\u0e16\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22\u0e25\u0e30\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e22\u0e14\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e48\u0e21\u0e40\u0e15\u0e34\u0e21 (\u0e04\u0e23\u0e48\u0e32\u0e27\u0e46 \u0e19\u0e30 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e04\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e38\u0e01\u0e14\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19)\n\n\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e48\u0e27\u0e22 EDF \u0e44\u0e25\u0e48\u0e09\u0e35\u0e14\u0e44\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e43\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e41\u0e21\u0e25\u0e07\u0e15\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e22\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e4c (\u0e44\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e01\u0e47\u0e1b\u0e37\u0e19\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e30)\n\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01 Mission \u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e04\u0e25\u0e32\u0e2a \u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e27\u0e38\u0e18\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e08\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e14\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e46 \u0e44\u0e1b \u0e42\u0e14\u0e22 Objective \u0e2a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e19\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e04\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e06\u0e48\u0e32\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e14\n\n\u0e21\u0e35\u0e04\u0e25\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19 4 \u0e04\u0e25\u0e32\u0e2a\n1.

Sandlot brings a great game to PC with excellent optimization.[/h1][/b]\n\n[b]For the first time, you can play a Sandlot EDF game with a nearly 100% stable 60FPS.[/b]\nNeedless to say, to any EDF fan this is a dream come true. 60FPS was one of the bullet points for the PS4 version, and disappointingly it couldn't hold up to. The game performance was wildly variable with it spending most of the time under 60FPS and constant screen tearing to boot, thanks to the Adaptive Vsync used by the game.\nIt was by no means unplayable;considering if you suffered through past EDF games;,but just that much out from the dream.\n\nNow we have this, not only at 60FPS, but with free online and even SPLIT SCREEN. Something that is often ripped out of PC Ports! Sandlot is great. (Despite minor issues)\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Great performance, \nCPU limited. The only way I could get the game to drop frames was for things to really go nuts using physics, like blowing up multiple buildings. Which on my aging 1st Generation Core i7(Even overclocked to 4Ghz), will probably result in worse drops in these situations compared to a recent gen Intel Core CPU.\n\nMy GTX 980 uses only up to about 25%(+-5%) usage at 1080p 60. Suffice to say, even a much lower end card should be just fine.\n[*]Good KB&M support\nIt's not great however as navigating the start menu and the main menu is odd. You'll have to use the keyboard for this, but even after remapping keys, the start menu still is hardcoded to WASD for movement. Not whatever you have remapped them to.\n\nRotation sensitivity is mouse sensitivity (Carryover from PS4 version)\nHopefully this will be patched.\n[*]Split-Screen!\nThis is great, EDF shines in Co-op locally or online. I haven't tested performance yet, but I'd imagine it be more performance hungry than Solo. On PS4, this brought the framerate down even more. \n\n[*]Arbitrary Resolution Support!\nThey had an issue with it at launch, but Sandlot patched it. Resolution works correctly now. \n\nTake that ShitEnix, ShitmoKoei and the rest of you yuckles!\n[*]AA\nEDF4 has some pretty nasty aliasing on all UI elements and even in the game. So thankfully they included an option for this. BUT, it seems to be partially broken ATM. Only working on UI elements and character models (In the main menu only,) In game AA doesn't do anything.\n\nhttp://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/179024\n\nHopefully just a bug. Even still, the UI clean up is very worthwhile and much nicer looking than the PS4 version.\nIt scales up with resolution beautifully too. The entire thing. I don't know what they are doing for the UI, but it is better than a lot of other developers. It looks great at every resolution.\n[*]Free Online!\nDo I need to say more? No more being stuck behind the PS+ paywall. Which frankly isn't worth the money for MP games that don't use Dedicated Servers. Which EDF didn't and doesn't here AFIK.\n[*]A lot of replayability, despite uneven mission design.\nThere are 89 base missions for solo mode and several additional ones for online only.\nNow take that and multiply it by 4 difficulties. Sometimes things get changed around in harder missions, tougher enemies, more of them,etc.\nIn Co-Op there is a separate multiplier as well to make it more dififcult based on the number of players.\nAdd in 4 very different clases with over 800 weapons total.\n\n[*]You can get in a 50M tall Mecha and fight Godzilla basically. The scale of it is amazing.\nEspecially if you forego the Mecha and do it on Foot!\n\n[*]There is a sense of scale to the environments and enemies that few games pull off as well as EDF4. Even with it's visuals.\n[/list]\n_________________________________________________\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n\n[*]Not many Graphical Options. Making scalability tough.\nYou can turn AA&Shadows off.\nAF can be set up to 16 or turned off  (Point or linear i'm assuming when off).\n\nAnd that's it.\n\n[*]Chat Wheel seems broken currently. \nIt doesn't do anything when you select an option. No speech bubble, no sound when a yell/sing choice is selected.\n\n[*]AA seems broken currently. \nhttp://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/179024\n\n[*]Bringing up the Chat Wheel currently seems to cause hitching/skipped frames about 3/8ths of the time.\n\n[*]Awkward Mouse/KB Support in menus.\n\n[*]Wish it supported the DS4 natively like some other games.\n\n[*]Mission design is farily uneven and uncohesive. There is some overarching narrative through voice overs that ties things together. But it's all a bit haphazard. It works well enough though.\n\n[*]Achievements/Trophies are on the INSANE side. To get them all, you'd have to beat the game with every class on 4 difficulties, accross 89 missions. Nuts baby. In addition to other mundane and grindy stuff. \nDon't get me wrong, I love EDF. But this is ughsville.\n\n[*]LoDs and draw distances for shadows are very aggressive. But it's understandable considering how much shit is going on screen at times.\n\n[*] [b]Price[/b]. They are asking 50$ for a digital only version of a game that launched with a physical copy brand new at 40$ on PS4. It's 35$ the fist week, meanwhile EDF 4.1 on PS4 is still sitting at 20$ on Amazon.\n\n[*]No option for push to talk. Mics always on. You know how this goes..\nYou can mute it selective in mission select but.. volume would be nice!\n\n\n[*]Text scaling issues even at 100% DPI in Windows 7 at resolutions lower than 1920x1080\nNot a problem in the PS4 versions(It ran at 1080p though, sooo, not a huge deal)\nhttp://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/EDF41201607202151519.png\nThe very right edge of some letters are still slightly cutoff in various menus as well.\n[/list]\nIs EDF4.1 worth 50$? If it's your first time purchasing the game. I'm going to lean on yes. But to those of us who bought 2025 and 4.1 both new at full price. No.\nSo i'd wait for a sale. If it goes on sale for 35$ again, GRAB IT.\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThere were some more issues, but they have been removed from my review because Sandlot patched the game on August 4th 2016. \nEven better, a developer that actually gives a crap and fixes problems with their game!

There's very little of a story as it's just mission based where your objective is always to kill everything. The lack of story is ok because it isn't needed, and what is there is B-movie entertaining.\n\nThere are 4 entirely distinct classes with each class having ~200 unlockable weapons each. Each class can carry 2 weapons except the fencer who can use 4 and the air raider who can also equip a vehicle (to request on the battlefield). You get weapons by picking up the green cases dropped by enemies and then it's random what you get at the end of the mission based on difficulty and mission number (the higher for both the better the potential weapon drops). You can also pick up red armor boxes which increase your max armor (health) at the end of a mission at differing rates for the 4 classes.\n\nThere is single player with a whopping 89 missions with 5 difficulties for each. The missions are short being 5-20 minutes long depending on difficulty and the mission. Online mode has 96 or so missions but progress in mission completion is independent of single player. You can play with up to 3 other people by having either public or private player slots. The more players the harder the enemies are compounded with whatever difficulty you chose. Weapons you find in online mode are available in single player and vice versus. The only problem I personally have with online is that there are weapon level limits you can use depending on the mission and difficulty. To use an inaccurate example say you chose mission 10 and difficulty hard in online mode, the game will only let you use weapons up to level 20, so your powerful level 50 weapon you can't use. The purpose is to have balance so people with uber weapons can't go to someone's easy game and obliterate everything. And finally there is splitscreen co-op which is something extremely rare for pc. It means 2 people can play on the same pc with the screen split down the middle, just like consoles are famous for. You need a controller for player 2.\n\nThe friendly ai is really annoying though. They are famous for getting in front of you blocking your shots and especially getting in the way of your explosives causing them to explode on you, even killing you on harder missions where friendly fire is higher. The enemy ai is adequate for the most part. No advanced tactics, they just swarm you and sometimes wander around. Occasionally they get stuck somewhere and you have to follow the radar to find and kill them to finish the mission.\n\nThe dialogue is really hilarious. Listening to your EDF soldiers talk among themselves is always good for a laugh. And of course everyone likes the EDF song \"To save our mother earth from any alien attack...\"\n\nThe amount of content and playtime here is staggering. Even if you concentrate on only one character you'll get dozens of hours of enjoyment. Not to mention online mode.

No. Yall are wrong.\n\nThis game is just a commentary of Imperial Japan's military aggression against the United States during World War II. EDF = Japan. Opposition (Aliens, Bugs, etc,.) = USA. Like Imperial Japan, EDF lacked the advanced weaponry and the numbers of her opposition (aka USA). Thus, my fellow comrades were both heavily outgunned and outnumbered to the point where I became a lone survivor to this inevitable doom. Remember the mission where only merely-poor tanks and rangers must defend the beach against the superior alien robots (the one without the free bombing run)? Doesn't this mission ring a bell? If not, ignorance must be erradicated as this mission represents the US beachhead operation on Iwo Jima. Many of my fellow soldiers were swiftly rewarded a plane ticket to Yasakuni Shrine. How about the alien attacks on civilian in urban environments? That represents the US firebombing of Japan during the course of the war. \n\nDespite our tremendous losses, I sense the Spirit of Yamato, the Essence of Bushido, and the Presence of the Samurai within the physical bodies of the EDF. Like the Imperial Japanese, the EDF fighting spirit will always outmatch the weapons of the foreign devils. Their arrogance only focus on material. We, EDF, focus on willpower. If I choose the side between Imperial Japan or USA, I'd obviously join Imperial Japan. The Emperor needs me. The white devils will never hinder me. The Yamato Race will live on to bring peace to the world through military unification like our Fore Fathers did during Sengoku Jidai, the invasions of Korea, the war against the Russians, and the conquest on the Chinese. OUR SPIRIT BULLETS ARE NO MATCH AGAINST THEIR LASERS, ACIDS, CLAWS, MANDIBLES, PHOTONS, SPIDER WEBS, ETC,. GUNS UP, MY NAKAMA!

One obvious glance at the game will tell you that the devs didn't put much effort into AAA production values, but the beauty of it is that they just don't care. What this game prioritizes and excels in is being fun. You have one goal for each stage, kill all the enemies, and you have free reign over how you need to do it. No checkpoints. No objectives. This often means unrelenting chaos and destruction as building debris and bug carcasses fly around all over you over loud explosions. Single player is good enough, but co-op'ing with friends, when you pull off a crazy plan to beat a hard stage you were struggling with on Inferno difficulty and everyone is ecstatic and laughing, that's some of the best co-op I've ever experienced in a video game.

I am not going to deny that. But is it $50 worth of fun? HELL no. Not even close. I am not going to go along with the rank and file fan boys that are giving this game rave reviews.\nAs a Gaming Critic I have to ask and answer the same question every time I Review a game: \"Is this good for the consumer?\" And unfortunately the answer here is a resounding no.\nThe game is marred by it's being a shoddy port. Dated graphics, framerate drops, horrendous PhysX, glitches, multiplayer crashes, and reports of the game outright not working on AMD processors all bring down the game in a big way.\n\nHere is an excerpt from my Review:\n\"this game\u2019s title is about as long-winded as the gameplay itself. Now, before we get into things it\u2019s worth noting that somehow these Earth Defense Force games seem to have a fairly large following of which I am not a member of. I have never played any of the previous titles nor do I expect to so please take that into consideration. I am no fan boy and I don\u2019t expect to become an EDF Disciple. What I CAN do, though, is tell you about the game itself. It sucks. There\u2019s no way around it. Looking at the mechanics of the game it fails on nearly every level, however like one of those B Movies that are pure horrendousness with campy lines, cheesy plot, and shallow characters. The graphics are dated, the port is riddled with flaws including poor optimization, framerate drops, horrendous keyboard/mouse support, lame samey horde mode levels, WAY too much screaming, broken multiplayer, and if you have an AMD Processor then forget about it. You will most likely not even be able to play it.\nSo, you\u2019d think that would be the end of it. But no, it has some good things going for it too. And strangely enough, a lot of them are the same ones I\u2019ve already listed. Pure horrendousness with campy lines, cheesy plot, shallow characters, and samey horde mode gameplay.

This game showed great potential, but fell short due to it's bad design decisions, overpriced self-pride, and just enough bugs to really start making you grind your teeth.\n\n6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1469157458, "timestamp_updated": 1469157458, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.332281", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24452515": {"recommendationid": "24452515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169523000", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469697956}, "language": "japanese", "review": "AMD\u306eCPU\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3089\u52d5\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3068\u304b\u9177\u3059\u304e", "timestamp_created": 1469155248, "timestamp_updated": 1469155248, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.382934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24452227": {"recommendationid": "24452227", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984680359", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492437226}, "language": "english", "review": "Turn a hundred-story skyscraper into rubble because you saw a spider crawling on it that one time.

I would like to give advice to the Soldiers...\n\nErst einmal vorweg: Bei EDF 4.1 handelt es sich um eine erweiterte Fassung des in unseren Breiten als \"Earth Defense Force 2025\" auf Playstation 3 und Xbox 360 ver\u00f6ffentlichten Spiels, welches in Japan den bereits vierten Teil der Reihe darstellt. Somit ist es im Prinzip der Nachfolger von Earth Defense Force 2017, welches 2006 in Japan und Sp\u00e4ter auch bei uns f\u00fcr die Xbox 360 erschien, und wiederum den Nachfolger von Global Defense Force darstellt. 2011 erschien zwar noch Earth defense Force - Insect Armageddon f\u00fcr Xbox 360 und PS3, dieser Teil wurde jedoch von einem amerikanischen externen Entwicklerteam erarbeitet, und stellt aufgrund seiner vielen Verschlechterungen im Gameplay sozusagen das schwarze Schaf innerhalb der Reihe dar. So ist es nur konsequent, dass es sowohl aus der Nummerierung innerhalb der Reihe als auch innerhalb der Story komplett ausgeklammert wird. Der hier vorliegende Teil ist also wie Gesagt die optisch und inhaltlich verbesserte Fassung von Earth Defense Force 2025. \nAuf den alten Konsolen brach die Framerate bei hohem Gegneraufkommen - und das ist quasi Dauerzustand in diesen Spielen - immer wieder bis hin zur Unspielbarkeit ein, da beide Plattformen mit der Darstellung der umfangreichen Action und Zerst\u00f6rung \u00fcberfordert waren. Diese neue Fassung f\u00fcr PS4 und PC l\u00e4uft dagegen fast immer Fl\u00fcssig, und ist sowhl f\u00fcr Fans der Reihe als auch f\u00fcr Neueinsteiger empfehlenswert. Doch wie muss man sich das Spiel nun vorstellen?\nEs ist schwierig einem Au\u00dfenstehenden, der EDF nie gespielt hat und vielleicht lediglich ein paar Spielszenen auf Youtube gesehen hat, die Faszination dieses Nischen-Juwels zu vermitteln.\nMan l\u00e4uft dabei leider Gefahr, als bekloppt abgestempelt zu werden, oder es wird einem unterstellt, man sch\u00e4tze das Spiel nur ob seiner Beklopptheit. Letzteres ist sicher nicht ganz falsch, macht aber nur den kleineren Teil des Reizes aus. \nWenn man das Spielprinzip von EDF auf seine Kernelemente herunterbricht, so handelt es sich um einen Third-Person Shooter, in dem man auf ger\u00e4umigen Karten immer wieder neu spawnende Gegnermassen umnieten muss. Ein sehr arcadiges Spielprinzip. Das ganze mit schlecht vertonten englischen Kommentaren, f\u00fcr die sich ein f\u00fcnfj\u00e4hriger sch\u00e4men w\u00fcrde. Die Grafik ist dabei auch nicht gerade von gestern sondern definitiv von vorgestern! Die Gegner lassen neben Medipacks auch immer wieder neue Waffen und R\u00fcstungsupgrades fallen, welche einem bei erfolgreichem Abschluss der Mission dann das n\u00e4chste Mal zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen. Das ganze h\u00f6rt sich jetzt nicht sonderlich reizvoll an, geht am Kern des Spiels aber auch vorbei:\nBetonen muss man viel eher, dass die Action und Inszenierung hier alles andere in den Schatten stellt. Das Spielprinzip ist simpel, die Steuerung in Ordnung aber auch nichts besonderes - Aber in allen anderen Aspekten handelt es sich um ein Spiel der Superlative: Wenn ich von Gegnermassen spreche, dann meine ich wirklich Massen. Ich spreche hier nicht von ein Paar Dutzend Ameisen, Spinnen und Alien-Drohnen, die hier mit jeder Gegnerwelle die Karte fluten, sondern - vorrausgestetzt man spielt in den h\u00f6heren Schwierigkeitsgraden - locker von ein paar hundert oder gar tausenden. Diese Insekten wuseln so chaotisch \u00fcber die Karte, dass man kaum den \u00dcberblick behalten kann, und stets mit gr\u00f6\u00dferem Kaliber wie Raketenwerfer oder M\u00f6rsern ganze Horden der Insekten zugleich in die ewigen Jagtgr\u00fcnde bef\u00f6rdert. Allein die wegfliegenden und explodierenden Insektenmassen sind schon episch inszeniert - dazu kommt, dass man oft zwischen H\u00e4userschluchten spielt, und durchaus schonmal ganze Hochhaus-Komplexe zugleich einst\u00fcrzen - w\u00e4hrend dutzende Insekten beim Aufprall der Raketen in alle Richtungen zersprengt werden. Das ganze ist auf den niedrigen Schwierigkeitsgraden einfach. \"Easy\" und \"Normal\" stellen kein Problem dar. Um an neue Waffen zu kommen - und das will man in diesem Spiel: glaubt mir - muss man aber die Missionen auf den h\u00f6heren Schwierigkeitsgraden schaffen. Und auf \"hardest\" oder gar \"Inferno\" ist das eine echte Herausforderung, auch wenn die vier verschiedenen spielbaren Soldatenklassen aus jeder Mission mit zus\u00e4tzlichen Lebenspunkten hervorgehen.\nUnd all dieses Chaos l\u00e4uft jetzt 2016 auf dem PC v\u00f6llig fl\u00fcssig - vielleicht noch etwas fl\u00fcssiger als 2014 die Playstation 4-Version, von der diese PC-Fassung geportet wurde. Hierbei handelt es sich \u00fcbrigends ausnahmsweise um einen sehr guten Port, der der Konsolenfassung in nichts nachsteht. Wennman bedenkt, dass Hier zugleich unz\u00e4hlige Gegner, fliegende Projektile und Masssenweise Gegner berechnet werden m\u00fcssen, ist dass eine Leistung, ist das auch in dieser m\u00e4\u00dfigen Grafik durchaus beindruckend.\nDas ganze l\u00e4sst sich online in Viererteams oder auch super mit dem Kumpel im Couch-Splitscreen zocken - In der heutigen Zeit alles andere als selbstverst\u00e4ndlich!\nFazit:\nF\u00fcr mich ist EDF das mit Abstand beste Splitscreen-Coop Spiel seiner Generation und macht auch alleine erstaunlich viel Spass. Die langzeitmotivation ist Gegeben - ich habe schon weit mehr als 200 Stunden in das Spiel versenkt, und ein Ende ist noch nicht abzusehen.

Yes.\nIf you have played any EDF's before 4 do I still recomend this? Yes, but 4 and 4.1 are like a whole new game from the previous games imo, still great games and personaly I like 4 and 4.1 beter, however, if you have not played the older ones they are still amazing games.\n\nWhat is EDF?\nEDF is the Earth Defence Force, you are a member of lightning team who is part in the fight against giant bugs as well as aliens and their robots. All loot is shared and split randomly so working together is a great tactic. This game has an insane amount of replayablity since you can increas the dificulty without makeing a new save, also you can change classes whenever you want, if that was not all the replayability you needed then at harder dificulties you get NEW and BETER loot, that is right, weapons and vehicles you may not of even heard of. Oh yeah by the way, SPLIT SCREEN IS SUPPORTED!, this is a vary great game for single or in teams, but it is even better with a freind.\n\nClasses:\nEDF has manny diferent classes that you can adapt to your play style by chooseing from the different weapons and weapon types, such as playing as a fencer and bringing artilery weapons for long ranged bombardments.\n\nFencer: A class that can tank damage, the Fencer has weapons varying from long range artilery, to hammers that you can create shockwaves with, all the way to miniguns. The fencer is slow but if you use his thrusters that are built into his power suit he is actualy rather fast. The fencer comes to battle weilding 4 weapons, one on each hand and or shoulder. This class is built for fighting at ranges or for up close, also if you get mobed usaly they are the ones to charge in to help you.\n\nAir Raider: This class is rather adaptable to what the team needs, a great class for strategy, such has creating traps uncase you have to fall back, or weakinging the hostiles with air attacks before rushing in. The Air Raider is the only troop able to call in various attacks such as a ship of shore fireing a tomahawk missile to your chosen position, or even calling in bombing runs. The Air Raider has manny vehicles ready for request as well, but keep in mind, the Air Raider can only have 3 things on them, 1 is a vehicle, then 2 weapons, the 2 weapons could be anything, but if you want to bring a air strike it has to take a weapon slot. The vehicles vary from giant robots to bikes with a side gun on them, to helicopters with flamethrowers on them. The Air Raider and Ranger are the ONLY classes that can drive vehicles, however, everyone can gun (includeing the Air Raider and Ranger). The disadvantage of the Air Raider is that while they have a pretty good armor count, they have weapons that are not the most usefull if picked up by a bug if your vehicle is destroyed.\n\nWing Diver: The Wing Diver is fastes of the bunch, they use a jet pack to get around mostly and have a pile of insane high-tech weapons. They are great for dashing above the battlefeild rainging down plasma and lasers or for droping down to revieve teamates, they are also amazing for colecting loot fast due to their speed advantage.\n\nRanger: The Ranger may look like your ordinary EDF infintry, but they have quite a larger weapon cache than thoes AI. The Ranger also has a wide aray of weapons, cluster granades, missle launchers, granade launchers (some of which are incendiary), sniper rifles, asult rifles and shotguns. The ranger is the only other class that can drive vehicles other than the Air Raider. The ranger is pretty much built for combat at medium to close range, honestly is you are carrying a sniper rifle you will not stay back for long.\nWhat has changed from 4 to 4.1?\n1. The EDF AI are usefull now and actualy have things like tanks! Much more fun and interseting.\n2. The levels have been spiced up a bit and new hostile types added.\n3. Underground missions are AWSOME now, it is dark in them and all you have are helmet lighs to see, the air raiders can call in depth crawlers which have two spotlights foward faceing on it to help everyone see a lot better.\n4. New weapons and vehicles.\n5. Ligting effects for explostions, this actualy is a pretty nice adition.\n\nI hope that this review has helped people wanting to know if they should get this, the graphics were not improved much BUT it is way to fun to turn away from because of that... in short Fun>Graphics\n\nI spent a hour makeing this review because I would like to share this great game with everyone I can, whenever anyone has come to my house and have played this or any other EDF games, they have always loved it and will always ask me for the name of it later on so they can buy it, yes it is cheesey but it is so much fun, I really can not stress this enough. If anyone has any sugestions to improve this review plz let me know.\n\nEDF! EDF! EDF!

It had lost its identity.\n\nEarth Defense Force 4.1 brings back that experience, and builds upon it. More missions. Fun and varied classes. Same old ridiculous dialogue.

It's like playing the most epic Invasion movie you've never seen before.\n\nStory: Aliens Invaded and you have to kill them. That's it!\n\nThe graphics are crisp and decent enough, Shadowplay capture takes a lot of detail away even on max bitrate. I have no idea why.\n+ Smooth 60FPS \n+ Decent mouse and keyboard controls with good key binding.\n+ No ping lag whatsoever in coop.\n+ Awesome Coop experience! EDF! EDF!\n+ Gameplay is too much fun with lots of content. 80+ Campaign with tons and tons of different weapons and vehicles to try out. Plus those Pacific Rim type Gigantic robots that makes you tear up in exitement punching those pesky War of the Worlds Invaders is just super awesome. The Xplosions and sheer number of aliens on screen is just spectacular.\n\nHopefully they'll fix or add some of this Negatives:\n\n- Sound and music is really chaotic. (Maybe there's no 5.1 or 7.1 Audio support)\n- no mouse cursor to select items in menus, you use your mouse to swipe up, down, left, right.\n- No Push to talk and open mic by default. You can turn of chat when creating a lobby but if you acquire the lobby from others, you can't change a lot of settings like turning off voice chat or ability to kick people.\n- Real Life Time seems to pass by quickly when playing this game.\n\nThe 30% discount on release in our region which is equal to $18 is well worth it. DLC is fan service and kinda useless in game.\n\nHopefully they'll fix the AMD CPU/GPU issue that others are talking about.\nPlay on normal with other people first to learn each characters moveset and gain a variety of weapons and find your favorite. Then when you've learned enough, play on the Harder difficulty for the best experience.\n\nAlso hope they add more Character classes and hundreds of unique weapons/vehicles bundled for them. That's the DLC I want as long as it's reasonably priced.\nEDF! EDF!

Friendly AI will see a wll of ants pouring out of a hole and will charge at it until they can boop them with their nose, chatge in front of my heavy ordinance fire, and bet themselves killed in a spectacularly braindead fashion,  while the Hector AI will hide behind cover, pop in and out of protective screens and have near pinpoint accuracy at extreme range.\n\n- Enemy corpses stay for a long, LONG time. This wouldn't bother me so much, except that they're bullet sponges. If you're using a shotgun or gatling, you'll waste half your clip if there's a body in the way (does not apply to the flamer)\n\n- Where is my sprint button? I'm playing the heavy dude and his walking speed is ridiculously slow. I'm being forced to equip at least one machinegun-type weapon just so I can hop my way across the battlefield. (Not to mention how many freaking crates I have to leave behind to keep up with the AI, or at the end of the mission...

It's a cool class, and the weaponry feels so much better than in IA, but I simply can't fit in my mind why the damn armor cleavage...

EDF!\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the series, then EDF 4.1. Is an amazing place to start. A re-release of EDF 2025, 4.1. is only the second title in the series to be released on PC and is far superior to Insect Armageddon, though that game had much better voice acting and, I think, better-looking player models.\n\nA no-nonsense third person shooter, EDF is about teams of relentlessly enthusastic soldiers battling comically oversized insects, spiders, robots and flying saucers bent on world destruction. Along the way, you recieve intel from the stoic mission control guy, the communications officer ladies, and the continually unhelpful panicky scientist, Ohara, as well as the badass pilot of the gunship Whale. The players assume the role of Storm Team, the EDF's top squad capable of defying the odds and securing victories in spite of dwindling reinforcements worldwide. Four player coop, 90+ missions, huge battles, four player classes, 700+ weapons and vehicles, unlimited reloads for your guns, five difficulty settings and a huge number of voice commands. At its core, EDF is all about having fun with friends.\n\nClasses include The Ranger, an uncomplicated but dependable infantryman with the largest range of available weapons, the ability to roll through obstacles and to heal NPCs when picking up health items. The Wing Diver, an impractially-armored jetpack-equipped woman with a range of devastating energy weapons. The Air Raider, limited to various sticky-bomb launchers for direct combat but able to call in large array of support items like shield generators, health stations and sentry guns, as well as vehicles: tanks, apcs, motorcycles and mechs, including the giant \"Walking Fortress Balam\", one of the signature additions to this rerelease. Lastly, there is the Fencer, a power-armored walking tank with directional jet boosters and the ability to carry four guns, switching between sets of two.\n\nSimilarly to a number of other Japanese games like the Musou and Senkoku Basara series, Naval Ops and the Choro-Q games, EDF has a large number of levels and collectibles, with completetion achivements only corresponding to the exact combination of class and difficulty- completing the game on Normal as the Ranger, for instance, would not give you credit for Easy, and furthermore, online progression is entirely seperate from local play. In addition, to unlock the ability to use any weapon on any mission without a level limit, one would need to attain a certain completion percentage- a daunting task, to say the least. EDF has the potential to be an enourmous time sink, and I prefer to play it in moderation with friends, lest one burn themselves out on its straightforward, but largely singular type of gameplay- shooting a lot of bad guys and picking up boxes afterward to increase your maximum health and, hopefully, find new weapons, the drop rate for which is quite low- you end up with a lot of duplicates.\n\nIt could be argued that EDF is repetitive and tad dull. While the former is quite true, I heartily disagree with the latter. The core gameplay is highly addictive, and the campy tone, bright color palette and solid controls set the series well apart from other shooters available today. I heartily recommend it, especially for coop play.", "timestamp_created": 1469043555, "timestamp_updated": 1486318246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503423", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24429944": {"recommendationid": "24429944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073770416", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494118256}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome! \n\nIt is Dynasty warriors (less characters but wayyyyyyyyyyy more weapons) meets Starship troopers and then adds independance day! \n\nAlien ships, massive bugs and screaming civilians all mixed together with a jolly band of EDF!

Imagine a cross between Starship Troopers, Mars Attacks (minus the Martians) and Dynasty Warriors, and you might get a rough idea what you're in for.\nThe game offers almost a hundred missions that will either drown you in giant insects as if they're bullets in a bullet hell shooter, or have you duke it out with a horde of giant robots that can easily stretch across the entire horizon. Not to mention truly gigantic bosses.\n\nIn contrast to the earlier game Insect Armageddon on Steam (same series, different developer), EDF 4.1 returns to the typical Japanese insanity of the classic series. Health power-ups and weapons are now again gotten solely through loot, for that little bit of Diablo-style weapon farming.\nEDF 4.1 also returns to having much shorter missions, but offering a whole lot more of them. And the hectic action of EDF really works best in short, but intensive bursts.\n\nWhile Insect Armageddon wasn't the most liked in the franchise, it is nice of the original developers to honor the IA team by adapting the two new classes introduced in that earlier game to the classic-style of EDF, cranking them up to 11 like everything else in the game.\nSo aside from the versatile Ranger and the flight-capable Wing Diver, we have the support-oriented Air Diver who makes up for his lack of direct-fire weapons with mini-turretsand the ability to call in air strikes and vehicles (mostly tanks and mechs, some of which can get pretty huge, as in Godzilla huge). The Fencer with his power armor on the other hand is essentially a man-sized Armored Core, dual-wielding ridiculously huge guns and able to equip melee weapons with literally earth-shattering results.\n\nPerformance-wise, the port is very, very well done. Gameplay is smooth (even smoother than in the much older Insect Armageddon it seems) and can handle a crapton of enemies without a noticable slow-down. I did turn off shadows though, seeing how much enemies you typically face in this game.\n\nControls are very good and responsive (though I do miss the sprint button from Insect Armageddon). Can't say much about keyboard and mouse controls as I'm more of a controller guy for these types of games.\n\nLong story short: Get this game. EDF!

I found no way to get the AI stuck or something yet.\n\nBecause there are so many weapons there's always a new setup to try out and you can raise the difficulty more and more forcing you to find new setup and getting you on the other hand new weapons to play with. So the replayability is very high and the many levels are usually rather short, which also allows to have a short \"shooting break\" now and than just to relax. Moreover the game is obviously not a dead serious military game, there is instead a lot hilarious stuff in it, like all the panic reactions you hear on radio or troops singing battle songs for the EDF when fighting super big bugs. :)\n\nThe game is a very good console port. The only minor issuees I had was that apparently only one resolution is supported (full HD) and not all keys are available for binding but the control system is mostly made pretty easy, like the usual movement keys, weapon selection via number or wheel, left and right mouse button to fire and in some cases also space for a special action or third weapon. Only one class out of the four has 4 weapons so in that case the shift key is the 4th fire button. I had to disable GSync in my NVIDIA controls because it caused some stuttering. But GSync is hyped half-working crap anyway and I'm deeply regretting paying the extra money for GSync monitors.\n\nAs for the DLCs, they are completely optional, they only add a some low level stuff that for fun. That said, the tanks are not just reskinned but have different or modified weapons. They also have a lot more armor and some are more agile than the default tank.", "timestamp_created": 1469020920, "timestamp_updated": 1469616582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24424982": {"recommendationid": "24424982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030422851", "num_games_owned": 459, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506829199}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been a follower of EDF for years, first played EDF 2017 on Xbox 360, picked it up randomly in a bargain bin in a wal-mart, best 12 dollars every spent.\n\nEDF 4.1 is based off of 2025, a game I also played on PS3, and this definitely feels like a console port, the menus are shit, options are pretty lacking, and I found that sometimes during the equipment screen it would lag for no reason. Some other technical difficulties I found were that anything far away was rendered at around 5 fps, which is a method to allow them to have hunderds of bugs on the screen at once on console, but considering the graphics of this game and it's on PC, I think my system could handle more.\n\nI've played this for a few hours with mouse and keyboard and with a controller. Both work but I really do recommend the controller considering the shitty menus, but you can learn to love the jankiness of this game regardless of what control method you use.\n\nNow with that negativity out of the way, lets get to the positives; EDF! EDF! EDF!~\n\nI frickin love this series, the cheesy dialogue, the not-so-pretty graphics, but mostly the ability to kill waves and waves of giant insects and robots with your friends and a huge arsenal of impressive weaponry. Nothing beats the feeling of saying danger close while calling down what equates to a frickin nuke on a bunch of giant ants; your friends running for cover and you're screaming EDF at the top of your lungs as the giant explosion covers your screen, ants flying everywhere!\n\nThere are many many missions, and the difficulty runs from easy, to normal, hard, hardest, and finally inferno; each difficulty really changes the way you interact with the game. The enemies do more damage, have more health, but also improve their abilities and accuracy; this making it pretty important that you develop a strategy with your friends, making sure everybody has the right equipment to deal with different situations you find yourselves in. \n\nTo sum it all up in the most effective way possible, should you buy this game? Yes. Why? Because EDF! EDF!

The style is super japanese, and reminds me of those old coin-op games. The sounds, the effects and gameplay is very arcade'ish.

This means you will need to grind a lot to collect enough armor and find the right gun for the job. \n\nThe many weapons and multiple choices for characters allows you to deploy a lot of different strategies to win, and although it is first of all an action game, your wits at strategy is what will determine wether you will win or not.\n\nThe graphics looks a bit old, but it makes up for it by a great physics engine allowing you to destroy almost anything, including huge buildings. The game gives you a grand feeling of scale and power, and the insects move around in a creepingly realistic way.\n\nIf you have a high end computer with a high resolution screen, you wont be able to take advantage of its full power. The graphics will be scaled up from a lower resolution and stretched to fill the screen (seems the highest real resolution is 1080p?). Only text will render in the native resolution.

You get either Armor, Health, or Weapon crate drops from killing enemies. Once you finish a mission you can see what weapons you got and any armor you picked up as well. You can then apply that armor to a class to increase their total armor.\n\nI would say 4.1 is the best in the series so far. Lots of epic things happening in this game and the fact they inculded local split screen co-op is awesome.\n\nIf you are a fan of just blowing stuff up and leveling cities and a fan of B Monster/Kaiju Movies then you would enjoy EDF 4.1.\n\nHighly Recommend this game.

Unfortunately the giant ants came, and destroyed the city square where I was applying for a job, took my childhood crush away, and ate all the dogs in town.\n\nWith nowhere else to go, I went to sign up for EDF because I heard they give free packets of dried tropical fruits, in which papaya, pineapple, cempedak, and durians are my favorite. I used to eat them when I was a kid, and it would bring back childhood memories of squatting in the back of my dad's farm while flipping through his stash of pornographic memories (mammaries! ha ha ha!).\n\nThey gave me a free officer's welcome on my first day! Although it was a video on Youtube, I felt really special because they greeted us with warmth and care, and I never felt so important in my life before. We were given DVDs each to watch for weapons training, but since my DVD player is broke due to me rewinding to the special moments of Basic Instinct, I crashed my newly found EDF buddies place to have a \"Weapons Training Party\". We even got NERF guns to follow along with the instructional video, which I highly recommend, as it really made us feel like we were part of EDF!\n\nI noticed that the EDF folks are really fond of yelling EDF! EDF! and I can see why. E, D and F are the easiest alphabets to read out loud in public, and the cheering of Walking Fortress BALAM while it stomped past the troops (sometimes killing some of us, but that's a small price to pay for something as awesome as BALAM). I practiced this day and night, when eating the tropical fruits, when brushing my teeth, when taking a shit in the loo, before I went to sleep, when talking to random girls in the bar (girls really dig the alphabets E, D and F by the way).\n\nOn the second week, we were deployed to secure the very city square that I applied for my job!!! Needless to say, I was pumped, because I really wanted to get back my USB drive containing all my special memories (mammaries! ha ha ha!) collection that I borrowed to the boss because he said that he doesn't get much sex at home due to all the weird sounds the giant ants make. The officer was really friendly, and he gave us some really sound advice : \"CHARGE FORWARD FOR THE PRIDE OF EDF!!!! PICK UP AMMO OFF YOUR FRIEND'S DEAD BODIES!!!\"\n\nI got so pumped that I started practicing my special roll skill that was taught in the instructional video. With enough practice and work out, I have toned my body from man-mammaries to iron manbuns, and whenever I roll into small objects, they get destroyed now! How awesome I am, ha ha ha!\n\nAnyway, the giant ants came, and they brought their entire family tree with them. I could tell that they brought their aunts/uncles/grandmothers/first cousin once removed/sister in law/second cousin in law once removed to the fight, but man, I pity them. If they faced any other defense force (like the Fire Defense Force, Waifu Defense Force, Mars Defense Force), they might stand a chance, but no. They faced us, the EDF!\n\nI think I saw my new friend Bob get eaten by a giant ant but I was so caught up in the moment that couldn't help but shout EDF! EDF! EDF! while Bob became kebab by burning in the flames for the giant ants. Apart from Bob (I miss you Bob), we mowed them down with our so powerful arsenal of devastating rocket launchers, limpet guns, pistols and tropical fruits that they called out their friends, the Spiders! \n\nI am scared of spiders ever since that day I was spanking my dolphin in the small cabin where I used to live when I was young, and one of them crawled onto my man-bone. I almost cried like a little girl when I saw the giant spiders but surprise! EDF has a spider mech of our own!!! Bob's brother in law came into action with one of them new spider mechs and blasted all the giant spiders to bits!!!\n\nI wish I could write more but I think it's time to sweep the streets (I brought my own broom today!) to clear up the alien gibs.\n\nTTYL Diary!", "timestamp_created": 1468998696, "timestamp_updated": 1468998696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 233, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683188", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24420794": {"recommendationid": "24420794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040837514", "num_games_owned": 491, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471043933}, "language": "english", "review": "Earth defense force 4.1 is a very fun arcade shooter.

BUY TODAY!\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nFinally Earth Defense Force comes to Steam. Sure we've had Insect Armageddon but that's only an EDF game in spirit.\n\nEDF is a very particular sort of game series. It won't appeal to everyone but for those of us who love it we REALLY love it.\n\nThe reasons people love this game (and any EDF games, for that matter):\n*Distinct classes to play\n*Very over the top combat scenarios (what other game has you fighting kaiju size monsters in mechs, or on foot, while getting to destroy the city around you?)\n*Impressive graphics for how much is going on (It isn't the fanciest game in the world but given how much stuff is happening its very impressive they've managed to make it look and run as good as it does)\n*Very addictive loot based progression\n*Loads of missions\n*Lots of different enemy types\n*The amount of content+difficulty that extends the life of the game x4 because of the 4 separate classes and item sets\n\nReasons why you might not like it:\n*Game can feel samey for those who don't like destructive bliss\n*The campiness of the game will rub some people the wrong way\n*The graphics snobs won't understand why it looks the way it does\n*The difficulty can be very intimidating as you get into the later levels and higher difficulties\n\n\nAll in all, this is a freaking fun game. There is really nothing quite like it on Steam right now, so do yourself a favor and pick it up. If the pro/con list piqued your interest you'll probably enjoy it.

Please consider reading more reviews here and reviews elsewhere to consider if this game and it's gameplay is for you.\n\nI have a fairly recent build (Intel i5, 16gb RAM, Geoforce 960) and for me the game runs at a solid 60fps even when there are literally hundreds of enemies and a lot of mayhem happening on the screen. The game runs solid, the load times are more than acceptable and the netcode seems very solid (when it doesn't disconnect which I'll get to in a bit) and all in all I feel that this is a port that is somewhat acceptable after a patch ironing out a few issues. However with that said it is because I am comparing it to it's source material - the EDF series, for as much love as it rightly deserves, has ALWAYS run like absolute s**t on consoles (we're talking that you are LUCKY to get ~20fps most of the time) and to actually get something that is this stable was way more than I'd ever hope for, and it brings me no small ammount of happiness to play EDF as it was rightfully intended. However, you have to consider that I consider this port a compromise compared to the originals:\n\nThere are no graphics options to speak of except for resolution options. The menus are not able to be navigated with the use of the mouse in a normal sense, instead movements of the mouse are used to \"scroll\" through menus as if it was a D-pad. The game has no option for adjusting it's FOV. These are serious flaws, and if I can consider a port to be \"acceptable\" despite all this you have to understand how bad the originals ran on consoles. \n\nMy main issues is that I have experienced several disconnects and crashes when playing online. My internet connection is not the fastest (~14mbit up/1mbit down) but I have talked to my friend who also bought the game who sits on a high speed line (100mbit up/100mbit down) and he has experienced both issues several times as well. When a disconnect happens it happens to all in the group that you are playing with. This is unacceptable, and I am unsure of it is due to busy servers due to the fact that from what I could tell there were not that many games going on at any time.\n\nI believe that the disconnect and crashing issues can be fixed in due time, so I remain hopeful.\n\nI lastly want to stress that this port is not optimal, but I want to mention once again that despite all of the issues this is most likely the most optimal version of EDF to date no matter the platform. It is a heavy compromise, but I'm willing to accept it. Frankly I'm just very, very happy of finally having a dream come true of getting a version of EDF without any heavy slowdowns. I'm going to have many, many hours of fun with this one both online and with a good pal next to me.\n\nThank you for reading.", "timestamp_created": 1468977488, "timestamp_updated": 1468977488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24417635": {"recommendationid": "24417635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064533459", "num_games_owned": 850, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487810442}, "language": "english", "review": "All you need to know is i ran into a battle with a giant hammer that left a giant crack in the earth which destoryed just about anything in it's path", "timestamp_created": 1468976804, "timestamp_updated": 1468976804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24417611": {"recommendationid": "24417611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016085707", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469328239}, "language": "schinese", "review": "EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01EDF\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1468976712, "timestamp_updated": 1468977234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528936", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24417541": {"recommendationid": "24417541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247064788", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469152792}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f5c\u4e3aEDF\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u6b64\u4f5c\u7684\u79fb\u690d\u5f88\u4e0d\u4e0a\u5fc3\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff0cps4\u4e0a\u7ee7\u7eed\u5237\u5237\u5237", "timestamp_created": 1468976212, "timestamp_updated": 1468976212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24417469": {"recommendationid": "24417469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019596361", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476331710}, "language": "english", "review": "Cheesy sci fi that knows exactly what it is.

Then I retreat a few blocks because I didn't want to risk taking on three giant robots at once.  I switch to my sniper rifle, take out one robot while dancing away from artillery fire and incoming ants, then down a second giant robot.  I then close distance and mop up using my more efficient lightning-gun.

EDF!

Just plug in one XBox 360 controller, choose 2 player splitscreen and may the madness start\n- Finding dedicated online play partners is really easy on Steam\n- The game itself is an over the top quality-trashy shooter with a lots variety in weapons/enemy types/environments, replayibility due to the equipment drop progression, where you fight giants insects/roboters/godzilla and just have a good time while it still manages to be challenging and have a tactical component to it on higher difficulties\n\nFew downsides:\n- Game currently doesn't work with AMD Phenom CPU's (Launch Problem)\n- Bad Anti-Aliasing. Though there are rarely white jaggies and the game looks really good with its stable FPS, HD textures and new lighting system. The game still has too sharp edges and therefore doesn't really look next-gen. We'll see if they implent improved AA methods in the future\n\nIt's not for everyone, but if it's your type of game then you'll definitely love it.

Os 2 pacotes de DLC s\u00e3o um belo complemento (mas s\u00e3o recomend\u00e1veis s\u00f3 pro final, pois no geral tratam-se de miss\u00f5es mais dif\u00edceis e complexas que as demais, j\u00e1 inclu\u00eddas no jogo). Ao todo s\u00e3o 98 miss\u00f5es, mais 49 em DLC (nos dois pacotes, sendo 26 no primeiro e 23 no segundo).\n\n\u00c9 um tipo de jogo que n\u00e3o enjoa facilmente, pelo menos depois que pega-se experi\u00eancia e libera todas as armas, se torna muito divertido e desafiados jogar com a galera (de prefer\u00eancia no m\u00e1ximo, com 4 jogadores).\n\nAgora \u00e9 aguardar o lan\u00e7amento do 5 em vers\u00e3o americana no PS4 (e torcer que seja lan\u00e7ado por aqui tbm, na Steam).

Citizens running and screaming in terror everywhere. Somewhere there's another EDF soldier screaming that he's being eaten alive and on top of that you have an alien \"expert\" chiming in over the com, laying down the facts about this new type of enemy and how it should be named. And as if that's not enough, suddenly your squadmates start singing the EDF song. [i]That's[/i] EDF for you: a pure B-movie in videogame form. Both, thematically and gameplay wise. \n\nAnd talking about gameplay, EDF is as straightforward as an arcade game gets. Run & gun, roll, dash, charge up etc. Everything is there, spread out over the four classes. The classes are:\n[list]\n   [*][b]Ranger class[/b] is the standard ground soldier, which comes with a great variety in weapons. Rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers etc. you know the drill. Often considered the most boring class, but I like it a lot. Versatility is the key here.\n\n   [*][b]Air Raider[/b] is the support class. Call in tanks and other vehicles, call for air strikes/raids or deploy various tools to the battlefield, such as energy barriers, health, energy ammo etc. or just mark enemies for your teammates' weapons. This guy really shines in multiplayer since he's highly customizable and has a great range of different tools to his disposal to fit whatever your team needs. \n\n   [*][b]Winged Diver[/b] is a fast flying class using regenerating energy for both, flying and shooting her weapons. She's pretty quick, and like the Fencer has a knock down recovery, to get her back up easily. Chargable laser weapons and homing rockets to rain terror down from the sky are her main tools. \n\n   [*][b]Fencer[/b] is the heavy guy of the game, which's specialty is having four instead of two weapons slots. Which also can be filled anyway you like. Two sets of gatling guns at the same time? Sure! Dual wielding melee weapons? Why not?! His weapon range consists of shields, heavy artillery to close combat weapons such has lances and hammers. Since he's slow as hell, he comes with two different dashes, depending on which set of guns you're using.\n[/list]\n\nIt's kinda hard to describe how the game feels when playing, if you've never experienced it yourself. EDF has a mission based system, with varying objectives[i](which mostly come down to \"blow the shit out of giant insects\")[/i] but still has kind of an arena shooter feeling to it. Ever played Geometry Wars? EDF often feels exactly like that kind of game, only in third person, and with a bunch of guys singing and shouting...\n\nPort wise, the settings are fairly basic. Resolution, AA, Anisotropic filtering and Shadows off/on, are all you get. And tbh, it doesn't feel like the game needs more, because it runs flawlessly. I was really concerned because we all know how Japanese ports can turn out, especially from devs new to the PC. But this port really is amazing.  Where it visibly dipped in frames on the console, it's pulling straight 60FPS across the board here. \n\nThe price point may be a bit of a dealbreaker for some, because on PC, we're used to getting older titles considerably cheaper, or at least bundled with all previously released DLC[i](see Senran Kagura for example.)[/i] But the content of EDF makes it worth the price in my opinion. Be it singleplayer, co-op with friends, or splitscreen with your buddy, EDF delivers pure and straightforward arcade fun, the way that only Japanese devs are able to deliver. \n\nEDF is certainly a game you either love or hate. I for one, certainly love it. I mean how many other games let you sing the first line of a song, and your AI squadmates automatically sing the next line in turn?\n\nOne warning at the end: If you think about getting Insect Armageddon for its cheap price instead, to see if you actually like this kind of game - [b]don't![/b] While thematically similar, the games are worlds apart in terms of gameplay and content quality, and you'll get nothing out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1468944618, "timestamp_updated": 1468945043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522669", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24410373": {"recommendationid": "24410373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026836559", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470369117}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game where you destroy insects for the glory of Super Earth.

Me and a friend of mine got to the final boss on hard, and one thing to know is that the harder difficulty is where most of the good weapon loot is kept. As for the gameplay it's a ton of fun and campy. The game would chug the more damage and carnage you inflict on the environment, and I need to play more of the PC port to know if that's improved depending on hardware. There's a ton of enemy variety and inferno will wreck you if you're not careful. You'll go from pretty basic weapons that barely hold their own against enemies to weapons that can level city blocks. I'll be back to update this review if the port is not up to snuff.\n\nEdit 7/21/16: It seems that cheating is making the rounds in online play.

This truly brings all the fun of the classic arcade shooter with none of the non-since you see in a lot of modern day games. The game does not take it self seriously , and is not trying to be real world realistic in looks or psychics, but that is part of what makes this game different.\n\nWhat you get.\n1080P bug killing non-stop action.\n60FPS for liquid smooth game play.\nOver 800 weapons to use.\n4 different characters with there own weapon load outs.\nRandomized enemies spawn locations for even better replay value.\nOver 80 missions to beat and some online only missions.\nDestructible environment.\nOnline Co-op and vs.\n\n\nWhat you don't get.\nThere are no unskippable cut scenes. (don't you just hate games with long drawn out cut scenes)\nNo fetch quest busy work(find a trinket across the map and then bring it to xyz)\nLong loading times like on the Xbox 360 / PS3 2025 version.\n\n(Seems to be issues for AMD users until a patch comes out,  but I'm a Intel owner so no issues for me at all)", "timestamp_created": 1468930685, "timestamp_updated": 1468933226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24406909": {"recommendationid": "24406909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019348775", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474580783}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc\u306f\u304b\u308c\u3066\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3051\u3069\u539f\u56e0\u304c\u3088\u304f\u5224\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\n\u540c\u3058\u4eba\u3068\u304b\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\n\u305d\u308c\u4ee5\u5916\u306f\u6e80\u8db3\u3067\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1468930435, "timestamp_updated": 1468930435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498780", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24406900": {"recommendationid": "24406900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024314930", "num_games_owned": 485, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470052617}, "language": "english", "review": "The game runs fine on my setup and played it perfectly.\n\ni5 4670k\n8gb DDR3 Ram\nGTX 970\nAsus Maximus VI Gene\n\nThe game's objective and only objective is to exterminate and shoot ... shoot ... and shoot a lot of bugs and scream EDF!

I rate this game 8 / 10 why its because there are a lot of video or graphics setting that are absent with only a couple of setups that you can toggle Anti-Aliasing, Shadow, and AF apart from that you can also adjust the resolution. The game runs smoothly on 60fps playing it on 1080p.  I'm loving this game it gives you the freedom to destroy everything in your path I mean literraly everything like you can destroy building, houses, cars, and flatten them.

Great job devs!!!\n\n\n+Excellent mouse and keyboard controlls with no signs of mouse acceleration\n+Solid 60 fps in almost all scenarios.  A couple drops to around 30fps when a hundred enemies are on screen while multiple buildings are falling and artillery is dropping.  It is extremely rare and only last for a few seconds.  99% of the time you are running at 60fps!  \n+Excellent network code and great coop play just like the 360/PS4 versions\n+Planned modding!!\n\nAn excellent job but there are a few negative areas as well:\n\n-no real mouse control in menus\n-only a few video options for fine tuning\n-no push to talk voip\n\nHopefully these few items can be corrected.  Again, it's simply amazing to be playing EDFV4.1 on a PC with mouse and keyboard support and a solid 60fps.

They said things got wild in the game pretty damn fast. I didn't really believe them at first.\n\nThen I played this game.\n\nLet me tell you, the devs know how to escalate things pretty damn fast. Not to spoil things, but they know how to make you feel tiny compared to the behemoths you'll have to fight against.\n\nThis game is like Independence Day and Starship Troopers rolled into one and multiplied by a thousand.

They spit, weave, chew and sting you into oblivion.\n\nBut hey, you're EDF, the toughest, meanest, baddest dudes on the planet that can stop any GIANT INSECT from terrorizing the world. You blow them up, you riddle them with bullets, you shower them with missiles or roast them with your flamethrowers. GIANT INSECTS have no chance-\n\nAnd then you look up the sky and see A GIANT FUCKING MOTHERSHIP SO BIG YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE WHOLE THING AND IT DROPS EVEN MORE ANTS AND BEES AND SPIDERS AND DRONES AND TRANSPORT SHIPS WITH ANTS AND BEES AND SPIDERS AND OH MY GOD LEAVE MY BUDDY ALONE ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n\nIn short, it's very much worth the asking price. Especially if you like to shoot GIANT INSECTS with your buddies.

It's an accumulation of simple mechanics that add up to a great experience. The third person shooter style with many varied weapon types and upgrades help this game stand out. I have found myself smiling from ear to ear several times as hordes of bugs explode when my rockets smack into their faces, or when I conquer that one level that was difficult at first, but with some changing around of weapons I'm finally able to pass. The game is arcady and archaic, light-hearted and just all around an enjoyable game. The complexity is just enough to keep me thinking but not nearly too complicated to overwhelm me. It can be mindless fun and an intense shooter depending on how you choose to play.\n\nThe port quality is pretty darn good, running smooth and looking nice. However the menu sort of supports mouse controls, though I just end up using WASD because my fingers are already there for movent. Keys are rebindable, but I will need to test if extended mouse keys are supported. There are few graphic options, but generally the game is smooth, the mouse support outside of the menu is great, and the port solid overall.\n\nEDF!", "timestamp_created": 1468918232, "timestamp_updated": 1468918232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24404450": {"recommendationid": "24404450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002890193", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507399878}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest game ever, this game is very simple, kill all the alien bugs.\nIt will suprise you how much fun this game have with such \"simple\" and \"repetitive\" premise.\n\nIt's very hard to make such simple premise this fun, many games tried to fill it's bullshit deep story, complex gameplay mechanics doesn't even come close to how much fun EDF has.\n\nPlay this game with friends is one of the greatest game play experience ever.

Puts the PS3/PS4 versions to shame with beautiful 60 FPS even on a subpar rig like mine (With a mere 680 GTX).\n\nFor those who aren't familiar with EDF, it's the videogame equivalent of an Alien Invasion B-Movie. Earth is under siege by aliens and their giant bug minions, and it's up to you (and up to three allies if playing co-op)  to blow up everything in sight to save the Earth. Thankfully, there's no civilian casualties to worry about (They can't die for some reason) and all the buiildings are evacuated, so if a skyscraper or two gets blown up...No harm, no foul.\n\nThe flow of the game is very simple. Begin a mission. Kill everything. Grab loot. Move on. There's no complex objectives. Just kill and don't be killed while grabbing items that will strengthen you on future missions such as max health ups and new guns to improve your arsenal. Most guns can reload infinitely aside from a few special ones that you'll likely never use, so you aren't going to be looking for more bullets. More health packs, yes, but bullets, no. Just keep shooting.\n\nThe game's a budget one, but its sense of scale is amazing, as you'll fight through entire city blocks, levelling them as you blow up every bug in sight.

Hours upon hours were spent on that game solo and with friends. It's mindless chaos at it's core and it doesn't need flashy cutscenes or AAA graphics to keep my attention. The EDF series will always have a place in my heart, despite the few flawed releases. I endured the embarassment of Insect Armageddon, and I was disappointed in the awful frame rates of 2025. Then came the re-release of 2017 and EDF2 for the PSVITA, both respectable ports but unfortunately they were limited by the hardware of the VITA.\n\nNow were are in 2016 with the PC port of the Earth Defense Force that was a remake of the PS3 game re-released for the PS4 (and xb1 I think?).. Whew that was a mouthful! The company behind this game has done an amazing job porting EDF 4.1, and while there's limited graphics options, it doesn't ruin the experience. The game runs beautifully smooth on my setup (i5-4690k , Nvidia GTX 970) and it feels great to play with a controller. If you were disappointed by awful mess that Insect Armageddon was, then you'll appreciate this release!

For those who played Insect Armageddon on the PC, this game is vastly superior to it in almost every single way.\n\nAt the time of release, the game does have a few quirks, but with the promise of mod support, even with these minor quirks the game is easily playable.\n\nOne of the first things you will notice when you start this game is the extremely weird mouse behavior in the menu. Do not let this fool you though, the mouse and keyboard support in this game is about average. The menus are best navigated with WASD and spacebar.\n\nCarried over from the PS4 version are quite a number of quirks that will annoy some players. For example, at this time, release day, there is no option for a push to talk button in multiplayer. Meaning you will have to turn off voice chat as the host if you plan on playing with your friends and using a voip program such as skype, teamspeak, discord, etc. \n\nPerformance wise, the game runs well so far. As an experienced player of the game (I played it on the PS4 and previous games in the series), the later missions will absolutely lag you. This game will not hesitate to sacrifice 60 fps for 100 more enemies and hundreds more projectiles. The options for adjusting the game quality are very few though. If you cannot run this game well, I do not know what you can do to improve your performance. There is no option for borderless windowed mode and the framerate is capped at 60 FPS for the time being. Compared to the PS4 version, scenes that would normally cause my framerate to dip into the single digits on the console wouldn't even make my computer flinch.\n\nRegarding the DLC, almost all of it is cosmetic and effectively worthless for the time being. There is absolutely no reason to buy most of them. In the future there will be two mission packs that will be released. The mission packs will include a total of about 40 missions together.\n\nThe game is senseless fun and a good challenge at times. With over 80 missions to play through and 4 classes to play with, this game has a large amount of replayability with plenty of goals to set yourself towards.\n\nIf you are curious about the game, but on the edge, I recommend watching a streamer on Twitch play the game.

There's not much story or lore to speak of, just you, up to 3 friends, and a bunch of crazy weapons that get crazier the more you play. My personal favorite is the Wing Diver's Laser Chainsaw, a close range laser sword that lives up to its name; it cuts through the hordes like a hot knife through butter. But no matter how strong the weapons might seem, the game is more than willing to one-up you with a new enemy or with hordes that make Dynasty Warriors armies look tiny (if you play a melee Fencer you won't be able to see your character on screen sometimes, just because of the jittering, writhing mounds of bugs--but when you swing your Vulcan Hammer and they all explode into clouds of juice, it feels *so good*.) \n\nNote that while the game calls the Fencer the most difficult class to use, for my money it's got to be the Air Raider, who has almost no ability to directly attack and has to rely on sentry guns, stickybombs, and vehicles with weird, squirrely controls.

With destructable environments and waves after waves of enemies on screen at a time, it leaves you outnumbered but never outgunned, thanks to a 4 playable characters and lots of weapons at your disposal. The way to upgrade your character is a bit odd though, you need to get HP upgrades/additional weapons though walking over them from defeated enemies, but in order to get better weapons you need to play on higher difficulties. You likely wont be able to get the better weapons on your first time though because the higher difficulties are hard to play through, even the first level, without having good enough weapons and enough health pick ups. Weird choice aside, I still cannot recommend this game enough.

And this is in split screen always and usually using a rocket launcher that rapid fires meaning lots of building collapsing. In those 74 levels no dips at all with a i7 4790k, GTX 980Ti.

If you played Insect Armageddon and hated it. At least try this game, as IA was a terrible game in comparison to the other titles in the series.\n\nSimply put this game is amazing. Single player is fun and split screen or online coop is awesome. With a cheesy story and b tier graphics, sound, and pretty much everything, the game still manages to be plain fun to play. Very few other games can be this mindlessly enjoying. Destructible environment and hundreds of enemies on screen at once create a hectic experience that is better to play yourself than watch a video of.\n\n\nCollect new weapons and increase armor across four classes while stomping alien invaders and their bug friends to bits, the only good bug is a dead bug. Each armor pickup gives your class chosen a small bit of armor for the next time you use them. Each weapon pickup has a random chance at one of hundreds of weapons per class you were when you picked it up.  The game allows multiple playthrough by offering harder, faster, stronger enemies as the difficulty is increased, not only by playing later missions but also a selectable difficulty option per each mission.  After obtaining more powerful weapons and increasing armor, you can then take on those harder settings. On those hard difficulties comes higher loot tables for better weapons. Across over more than 80 levels, there is a lot to see and even more to do.\n\nWith each player class playing different than the next, you are guaranteed to find one that suits you and your playstyle. \n\n- An all around Ranger with assault rifles, missles, rockets, shot guns and snipers to name a few. A decent all around character. Has evasive rolls and decent armor. Can select two weapons for a sortie.\n\n- A vehicle summoning and air strike calling support infantry Air Raider. Has building sized vehicles, or small tunnel crawling vehicles. Has health fountain support to heal allies and missile guidance support to help kill.  Has claymors, mines and auto turrets. Harder to play than a Ranger, but rewarding and unique. Same evasive rolls and same decent armor as the ranger. Can select two weapons/support at once and one vehicle for a sortie.\n\n- A guerilla type high-damage dealing Wing Diver. Using a jet pack and constantly recovering energy supply. You fly in, while managing your energy, deal massive damage and back off to recover. Weapons also use this energy, when you over use it your jet pack fails and weapons can no longer reload until your energy system cools off. Very light armor means certain death when you run out of juice in bug city. Can select two weapons for a sortie.\n\n- A Fencer. A high armored walking vehicle-like humanoid suit. Can use incredibly large weapons. Hammers, spears, swords, shields, artillery, missles, etc. Can select two sets of two weapons at once, capable of switching between each set on the fly. The fencer has a jump boost or forward boost depending on his equipped weapon and his armor is unmatched.\n\nThe opposition ranges from acid spewing black ants. to tough armored red ants that grab you. To flying alien spaceships and wasps. To giant walking robots and walkers. There are plenty more but I won't spoil any of that. Plenty of variety in alien and bug opposition, to keep you always changing your loadout and tactics.\n\nThere isn't much more to say.\n\nAfter hundreds of hours in the series (100+ on 2025, 100+ on 4.1, 200+ on 2017, 200+ on MA+GDF+EDF2) I will spend hundreds more on this pc version. It runs smooth and is by far the definitive version to play. New to the series or not. It seems to run very well even on lower end hardware (jokingly played it on a Surface Pro 1, and it actually worked at 800x600).  Controllers recommended although mouse and keyboard work fine, I can see the controls are skewed to controller.. \n\n\nIf I run into any bugs (lel) I will let people know by adding them as comments. As of now I have no complaints, as they have been fixed by the August 4th patch..\n\n\nOh and one more thing.

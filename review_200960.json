And I feel bad saying that, because what the game does well, it does very well.  But what it does badly, it does [i]disastrously.[/i]\n\nThe setting and storytelling are excellent.  Really, really excellent.  It's a complex story with lots of nuanced interactions between a lot of different factions with their own outlooks and agendas.  You fluidly act between them without really locking yourself into a side, and there are plenty of different layers to how the end can play out depending on what you did.  The NPCs are scripted well.  Dungeons are full of neat gimmicks; automated bio-defenses that can be brute forced, disabled, or even \"convinced\" to aid you.  A couple areas have environmental hazards that are pretty unusual for Spiderweb.  The game just generally feels very believably alive in a way a lot of games don't.\n\nThe Shaping gimmick to create your own minions is, at its core, brilliant.  You effectively create them by spending from your [i]max[/i] MP, and can only regain it when the minion dies or you reabsorb it.  They level up over time, so they're effectively as disposable as you make them, and you can shoot for quality or quantity as you feel like, leaving as much or little of a casting pool for yourself as you judge.  It's a really interesting system and it gels perfectly with the story, aesthetic, and themes of playing God that the game centers around.\n\nUnfortunately, it's an excruciating slog to actually play through to [i]see[/i] that story.  The interface and combat is horrendously clunky and dated even as far as Spiderweb games go, but honestly that's the least of the problems.\n\nThe main issue with the game is that enemy attacks have a massive, massive damage range.  Throughout the entire game everyday enemies will be launching attacks that do anywhere from 0 damage (not necessarily a miss -- null damage) to almost twice your max HP for an instant game over.  I wish that was an exaggeration.  Armor has a marginal effect at best, and the numbers are so explosively wide that you practically need statistical analysis to tell an average reduction is happening at all.  And the whole time, your own damage output is generally pretty predictable with much narrower ranges, so you know the dev could've scaled incoming damage properly too and just...didn't.  It's a numbers game and you don't have or ever really get all of the numbers that make it particularly reliable.\n\nIt seems like the game expects you to leverage your created minions to tank these hits for you, but it doesn't really work.  Most creatures' movement range is greater than your sight radius, and unlike later Spiderweb games there is no action penalty for moving around opposing units or attempting to disengage -- so everything just sort of randomly picks a target.  Most of the game is out in the open or in wide spaces that are impossible to bottleneck melee enemies, and even in tight spaces permittivity is wonky because movement isn't grid-based and enemies will usually squeeze through.  Ranged attackers will just shoot you freely.  Even if you just run around a corner out of line of sight and leave your minions in place, enemies will often ignore your minions and pursue you.  And in the event your minion does eat the hit, everything you create up to and including explicitly tanky Thaads are very nearly as prone to instant death as you are, forcing you to run back to town to regain the half-to-a-third of the magic bar you had to semi-permanently invest and recreate it.\n\nThis ends up turning the whole game, every single time combat initiates for a 30-odd hour game, into a quicksave-scum slog that make old-school classics like Baldur's Gate feel downright generous.  With how broken the combat is, I just can't recommend it.  I feel like the fluid faction interplay is the only reason Geneforge wasn't better off as a book.  Because I'm gonna level with you here -- it would be a [i]really kickass book.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1515657037, "timestamp_updated": 1515658717, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532020", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39220830": {"recommendationid": "39220830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243725378", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 564, "last_played": 1515732677}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was my first RPG ever.

gamer. For those liking more story-focused RPG games, it may very well be a hidden gem.\n\nG1 is a testament to how a well-written story will outlast graphical advancements any day, because while graphics become more outdated with time, a good story will last forever. G1 hits you with a curious but well-executed medieval Sci-Fi story, that's simultaneously thoughtful, memorable, and well before it's time. There are no real low points to it either; from start to finish, it remains strong and consistent. You are also very much the master of your own destiny in the game; unlike the future games, which place you into a specific sect as soon as you start the game, G1 has zero hand holding. Beyond the vague reputation of your kind, you're free to do whatever you want, and you can very easily play without allying yourself with the numerous factions presented to you. There's also the option to go completely mad with power, which I personally have a big preference for, and very much appreciate and recommend.\n\nAs a small segue from the storyline point, from a graphics perspective, this game is very primitive. That's not to say it's bad by any means; it's very simplistic spritework (which you can actually view frame-by-frame from files in the main data section), which I personally like a lot. But emphasis should be made that it's VERY simplistic, as even when the game first came out, the graphics were considered primitive. If you're someone who prioritizes prettier graphics over storyline, the Geneforge series will not be for you.\n\nExploration also plays a large role in this game. Beyond finding enemies to kill for XP & loot, and hidden vendors to sell loot too (as vendors have a static amount of buying currency, and you'll very quickly exhaust the main city buyers), you'll find a surprisingly dense amount of lore scattered strategically throughout each map. Enemies are placed in smart locations, traps are both smart & fair, and neither is so oppressive that they cancel each other out; you can very easily do everything and go everywhere in this game, despite what some of the ingame text tries to tell you. I would very much recommend exploring everywhere you find interesting or worthwhile; beyond the aforementioned points about loot & XP, G1 has some of the most memorable map areas of any game I've played to date (Hill of Jars, Shaper Crypt, and Valley of the Wind, to name a few). With that said, you will reach certain level caps where lower-level areas are no longer rewarding enough to explore, which is completely fine, as you can always prioritize them in another playthrough.\n\nCombat is generally simple and well balanced, with positioning and terrain usage/awareness playing key roles in your success or failure (especially on the higher difficulties). Your choice of Shaper (creation user & support mage), Guardian (physical DPS with some creation support), or Agent (magic DPS with some physical options and very limited creation support) will very drastically affect the way you play, with some options being more user friendly than others (in my opinion, Shapers are the easiest to play as, Guardians in the middle, and Agents as the hardest, almost solely due to how well creations do). Unlike some of the future Geneforge games, every class is viable on every difficulty. \n\nWith that said, perhaps one of the very few minorly-negative points I have about G1 is that it's a very offensive-oriented game, though do take in mind that this is most from the perspective of someone that plays solely on Torment difficulty, where taking 2 hits kills you at pretty much every stage of the game. There are no defensive spells, and only one defensive buff exists, which can only be applied with a very rare item set. Furthermore, Anatomy replaces Parry from the future games, so the only option is to pump points into Endurance (which give limited returns), or focus entirely on offensive DPS. As such, melee is theoretically usable but entirely nonviable, and ranging is king. You will live and die on your DPS, positioning, and combat priority. This is also why creations are so good, as they can help supplement in damage (as your own damage will start falling off later on), and tank damage that'd otherwise kill you. With that said, it is entirely natural do die several times during a run, which makes mistakes more forgiving, but kills immersion a bit, as you can run straight into an enemy stronghold to scout out their defenders, than reload and strategically start picking them off (with knowledge you shouldn't have if you were doing everything in one go). With that said, none of these are a real deal breaker, but it does encourage similar play-styles between characters.\n\nAs a small aside, I'd like to point out that, while this game uses a die/%-to-hit system, which I find very easy to despise if implemented improperly, G1 executes it well enough that I'm comfortable liking it. Hits can be a bit more variable in the later stages, as several die are cast for attacks & can lead to a 40% variance in damage sometimes, but the game's forgiving enough that it becomes less of a factor (so you don't get the FTL paradox of losing a run because a series of rolls didn't go your way). It also, mercifully, does away with the 95% to-hit cap from the Avernum series games of the same era.\n\nA few veteran tips; if you can handle the responsibility (and not be tempted to exploit the game), holding down Shift + D, and then typing \"exitzone\" can be used to warp out of towns and dungeons instantly, and hence save a lot of time that'd otherwise be spent backtracking. Likewise, \"clearthisarea\" can be used to a similar effect. Again though, use these responsibly, as both can break game progression. Secondly, G1 has hands down the best secret of the series, which I think every player should get to experience. Without spoiling the secret itself, start at the special totem in Drake's Vale, than work your way clockwise around the mountain, touching each level's special totem in order (you'll know when you've hit the last one). The rest I'll let you experience for yourself.\n\nIn conclusion, Geneforge 1 is one of the closest examples of a perfect game I can think of. It flawlessly merges simple graphics with well-balanced gameplay, and a deep, complex narrative. It offers players with a large, vibrant world to explore, and rewards their efforts with fun challenges & chunks of extra lore. \n\nSome games don't need to unring a bell...\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1512726682, "timestamp_updated": 1512727629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37865106": {"recommendationid": "37865106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124391036", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 30708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514736315}, "language": "english", "review": "Old game, but still interesting to play, and like the rest of the series going powermad be fun.", "timestamp_created": 1511861360, "timestamp_updated": 1511861360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37280214": {"recommendationid": "37280214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113676627", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503575348}, "language": "english", "review": "Frankly, this game is an often forgotten rpg, that really deserves some more playtime and for $6 on Sale, is there any reason not to get the full series?", "timestamp_created": 1511507555, "timestamp_updated": 1511507555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37019560": {"recommendationid": "37019560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025217479", "num_games_owned": 668, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402203508}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306eRPG\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u3089\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1511435160, "timestamp_updated": 1511435160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36324927": {"recommendationid": "36324927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097644433", "num_games_owned": 474, "num_reviews": 209, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448066445}, "language": "english", "review": "no", "timestamp_created": 1509984833, "timestamp_updated": 1509984833, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.124542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36031103": {"recommendationid": "36031103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000833782", "num_games_owned": 459, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 3088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509179835}, "language": "english", "review": "Strongly recommended for people who are into these types of games. If you like slow, plodding, methodical, difficult tactical turn-based RPGs with a lot of reading, this is one of the best one of those I've ever played. The intro eases you into the mechanics in a way that's incredibly friendly to beginners, so once the game opens up I felt empowered to explore and unravel the mysteries of Sucia island. The setting is completely unique, and although the moment-to-moment writing is nothing special, the world-building and presentation of the backstory were fascinating from beginning to end. If you're interested at all in the old style of punishing but rewarding computer role-playing games, Geneforge 1 is an exemplar of its genre.", "timestamp_created": 1509076505, "timestamp_updated": 1509076505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35978557": {"recommendationid": "35978557", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974465543", "num_games_owned": 723, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509290268}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR - A breathtakingly original, open ended, nuanced, ahead of its time, extremely well written sci-fi yarn about people meddling with overwhelming power and the fallout of using it to create living (intelligent and self-aware) tools of servitude wrapped inside a horribly paced, convoluted, imbalanced, frustratingly buggy, puke green shell.\n\nPacing and balance is the main problem with Geneforge: it takes way too long before anything interesting happens, locations become stale before you get anywhere relevant to the story, enemies and obstacles are painfully repetitious (and lazy- how many freaking maps are nothing but endless turrents/mines put behind every corner and bend)...  the list goes on... talent trees are unforgiving, leveling up is far too grindy (especially after the game stops rewarding you exp for completing quests), core abilites level up purely on random exploration, inventory management is painful, towns are far too big, most abilities are pointless, enemy difficulty goes from too easy to downright stupid so fast you can't even see it, looking for specific quest or story NPCs in the sea of identical NPCs is annoying, save/rest scumming is a core mechanic... you get the idea.\n\nThe one redeeming element of Geneforge- and it's pretty bright considering- is the extremely sharp and hauntingly subtle storyline.  The idea of the shaper knowledge changing your persona as you grow in power, putting you on top of several groups all vying for their own freedom in a hopeless situation is expressed with efficient detail (not a word too few or too many).  All the major factions rest in grey areas where you're simultaneously intrigued and repulsed.  Getting the second hand story of everything else happening on Sucia island mirrors your own journey with surreal flavor; you can't help but be taken aback and become invested in the various outcomes.\n\nUnfortunately, even the brightest parts of Geneforge are not without serious issues.  Allying with the different groups doesn't alter the general game in any real way, there are too many strange side factions introduced so late you can't really care, there is way too much back and forth running around, the Geneforge itself is haphazardly shoehorned into the story, the main antagonist is fun to read about but doesn't make an appearance until the end of the game, and again, everything takes way too long.  It might sound as if I'm nit-picking or being overly critical but due to the amount of wasted, pointless time in Geneforge, little annoyances become overwhelming.\n\nI am familiar with Spiderweb Software and yes, such a huge game is an achievement for such a small dev team (in the early 2000's no less).  Moreover, I don't necessarily wish to tarnish Geneforge's positive Steam reception, but reviewing the game has to take into account both the time it was released as well as the time it's currently being played in.  While Geneforge has a wealth of content (something to be noted and prized in the early 2000s) most of it feels stretched thin like too little butter across too much toast.\n\nIf you're a fan of early PC western RPGs (ie. Fallout, Baldur's gate, or other Spiderweb games), and you've got the patience, you will most likely enjoy Geneforge (especially for it's story).

More recently, I bought the game on Steam about 4 years ago and played some of the beginning.  What do I think of it?  It's a good game--I can't deny this.\n\nBut in many ways it doesn't even come close when compared with some of the titles I feel to be truly great.  When I played it I compared it specifically to Final Fantasy 6 and Chrono Trigger, and the first Dungeon Siege, which were basically the only RPG's I'd played.  Like most typical RPG's your character increases in strength and abilities by killing enemies and completing quests.  But the classes differ vastly.\n\nYour character can be one of three classes: a Shaper, who specializes in creating living creatures directly from magic; an Agent, who is far more focused on using magic spells to inflict the actual damage; and a Guardian, whose specialty is dealing direct physical damage, mostly with swords.  I tested Shaper and Agent, but in the end enjoyed Guardian much more--the other classes seemed playable, but I think Guardian is easiest from my recollection, and didn't require as much micromanagement.  The gameplay is good, and in combat your character gets action points you can spend to move, fight, and use items and abilities.\n\nCombat makes up a lot of Geneforge, though you'll probably also spend lot of time talking to characters in the game, picking up items and selling them and trying to amass enough money to purchase the best items.\n\nBut the best part of the game is the story.  You will learn more about magic, and the Geneforge in particular, a powerful piece of magical machinery that can greatly enhance those who use it properly.  You'll learn about the different magical creations in the game, learn about the different factions in the game (four of them IIRC), and learn about the history of the land you've been stranded in.  And much of the heart of Geneforge is freedom to choose--your character build, your faction, your ending.  If you sufficiently improve your character, you will be able to roll over most enemies.  \n\nAnyway . . . if this review sounds a little bland, perhaps it's because the game itself is kind of bland as well.  There are people who absolutely adore the whole idea of turn-based strategy, the idea of tactically micromanaging the actions of each of your party members, and carefully choosing their equipments and stats.  I used to be one of those people, when I first started playing RPG's, but less so today.  And if you are one of those people--I suspect that you will LOVE Geneforge.\n\nBut these days, I suppose I feel I need more from a game.  I think all the micromanagement has gotten to me over the years.  But also, Geneforge has very little atmosphere or enjoyable character.  It has virtually no music, though it does have atmospheric sounds.  I can't remember the name of a single character from Geneforge--whereas I can remember the names of all the main characters from Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, even though it's been even longer since I played them.  Geneforge's environments are mostly brown--deserts and dirt, though there is some variety thrown in.  And--while the ability to create life in Geneforge is quite awesome--I didn't even feel that this aspect of gameplay was very fleshed-out.  The story in Geneforge is definitely interesting, and there is a huge volume of writing in the game, so if you're a big fan of reading in your games, I can see it appealing to you.  But frankly, I still feel that both FF6 and CT have significantly more interesting stories, characters, environments, and of course excellent music.\n\nGeneforge is a good game.  Some people love it.  You may.  Someday, I may go through and play the others in the series.  But . . . I didn't find a whole lot be excited by in this title, and I feel its impact is far less than it would have been than if, for example, the creator had even expended minimal effort to create a few characters that are really memorable.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1482637229, "timestamp_updated": 1483418774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28483356": {"recommendationid": "28483356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041012284", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482166023}, "language": "english", "review": "Memeforge 1!

Starting off, i know it may say i only have a couple hours on record with the game, but id like to stamp that out now. I played this game years back off an old game engine before steam was a thing, buying it again now is more comfort and support for me, like buying an old book that you read years ago. I have well over 200 hours in the game, and about a thousand in the series. So let me dive in, and let you know what this game is about.\n\n   Geneforge is more than a game, its a book, an experiance, a choice, and a beautiful combat system all in one. It cries out to the imaginiative, the 3 am readers, the DnD players, the indie game searchers. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up 10 fold in story. The game puts you in the middle of an entire world and has you influence the outcome of it. In the first game, you find yourself in this estranged world, where the game gives you a brief history of it, then immediately tears that away. It isolates you, shows you that you must survive, and asks you what to do to survive. But that is only the first part. once you gather your bearings, you have to forge a path. At first the paths seem clear, good or evil, but the more you progress the more you realize there is no good. there is no evil. This game makes you question everything, with the only clear progression being that of power. You single handedly experiance the start of a world rebellion, and reitre as a god or a soldier by the end. The same picks up in each consquensial title later on, each putting you, a young shaper, smack dab in the middle of the biggest points in history of this new world. The hours, weeks, months of text painstakingly put into this game alone makes it a solid game, but the combat is fantastic too. You play a tactics style turn based micromanaging comabt system, sort of like fallout: tactics or final fantasy: tactics. But instead of pre determined abilities, like everything else you determine your path. Conjure up an army to fight for you, use magic and objects to trick your opponets and take them out one by one, or don a helmet and sword and slash your way through hoards, the choice is yous. My by far favorite part of it however, has to be the fact that nothing is safe in this game from you. It emphasizes that your choices can change the entire reality. No npc cannot be killed, although it may be hard. The world will form to what you want it to, if you are brave enough to undergo the task. Dont take this as you cannot lose, for the wrong desicion will put you in a spot where you cannot escape. But understand that you are free to make that deicion, you are free to make any desicion. This is the closest i have ever come to DnD Freeplay. \n\nPro's: Excellent story line, worth of a novel of the highest value.\n          Freerealm as hell, you are free to make any desicion you want, nothing stops you, you shape the future and history alike. \n           LOTS and LOTS of content, as said earlieri  have over 1000 hours in the series as a whole. thats a lot for a single player non grind game.\n          Decent combat tactics system, many ways to play out combat.\n          Can easily engulf you in for weeks.\n          Lots and Lots of Text\nCon's: The graphics are subpar at best, must be able to use your imagination \n           Game doesnt hold your hand at all, in fact quiet the opposite. This may be a con or pro.\n           Again, a LOT of text. again, could be a con or pro depending on your preferance.\n\nOverall i would rate this game a 9/10, Despite the horrid graphics. i honestly believe that if ther were better graphics, there wouldnt be enough reasources to make everything else so amazing.

I'm glad I finally did.  When I first tried to play it, the graphics and sound and simplistic gameplay turned me off, and I put off playing the game.  However, having picked it back up, I can happily say that the game makes up for the lack of graphics and sound with excellent gamplay and a cool new world to explore.  I was surprised that such a simple design could give so much freedom to the player in how they interact with the world.\n\nThe fact that it's so simple actually works in the game's favor.  Gameplay is straightforward and challenging, but not because the controls are clunky, but because every situation requires careful planning.  The plot is good enough to keep you invested, and at least for me, the gameplay was entertaining enough that I kept playing long after I could have ended the main plotline just because I wanted to explore the world more.\n\nIf you have trouble with games that rely on text to tell the story, this might not be for you.  If you have trouble with older looking games, I'd encourage you to give it a shot.  I'm glad I managed to look past the graphics long enough to let the game grow on me.

A healthy mix of fantasy and sci-fi where you play as one of three classes; shaper(mage),guardian(warrior), and agent(rogue).

Shaping is a type of magic that is the main bread and butter of the game because you get to create your own minions,pets,followers,soldiers,etc. to fight for you.

But you can skip to the summary at the end.\n\nREVIEW\n\nGo back to the very early stages of this millenium (when this game was released), and you might remember two things:  (1) fascination with emerging medical technologies surrounding genetic modification and (2) the Infinity Engine at its zenith.  Both of these influences can be found in Geneforge, which takes genetic modification as its theme, and uses a Baldur's Gate-like mechanic for its gameplay (although shorn of D&D rules and a conventional fantasy setting).\n\nLike the Infinity Engine games, Geneforge is an isometric, story-driven RPG which actually respects the *R*.  It takes place in several discrete zones spread out over a world map.  It is text-heavy.  The basic mechanics are much simpler here, however--simpler, but complicated enough to admit of sophisticated strategy.  It is also quite robust, giving many hours of gameplay to anyone interested in exploring everything.\n\nAs an indie game, however, it is graphically ugly.  Much of the text exists to describe what more graphically advanced games would show without words.  The interface is sometimes incovenient, and you'll naturally find yourself irritated with some of the aspects of inventory management--although my own irritation might have a lot to do with my neurotic hoarding/organizing addiction.  (For a reference, check out some of the screenshots posted in the Steam community to get a sense of how loot can get away with you.)\n\nThe open-endedness of the world can also be a curse as much as a blessing:  about halfway through the game, it's easy to lose focus on where you ought to be going.  ([url=https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/562951-geneforge/faqs/16837]There's a nice FAQ out there, however, which can help out.[/url] If nothing else, check out the Matt P's numeric rating of the difficulty of each zone--this can give you a sense of what areas are best to tackle next.)\n\nTo my mind, there are two main selling points to this game: (1) the novelty of creating and modifying creatures to aid you as you go about, and more importantly (2) the story.  But the attractiveness of the story needs some unpacking.\n\nThe story is open-ended, and it involves you responding to some events on an island surrounding competing factions with conflicting motivations vying for power.  That's nice and all--although you can get that kind of fare elsewhere.  That's not where the real juice of this game lies.  The best part of the story isn't the plot proper, which concerns your character.  It's what has already happened in the *past*, and which you discover incrementally as you proceed.\n\nThink of yourself as a kind of archeologist, doing a dig.  You dig at a site, and discover what a certain society was like.  But if you dig a bit deeper, you might see the remains of a civilization that existed at an even earlier time.  Dig even deeper and...you get the idea.  The way I counted, there were *four* layers of history contained in this game, from the truly ancient to the recent past, and you fill in the pieces of this rich puzzle of what has happened on Sucia Island as you proceed.  (Incidentally, I have no idea if this pattern continues for other games in this saga, although I suspect not.)\n\nIf the idea of playing the role of archeologist sounds like your cup of tea, pick up this game.  (You might also want to pick up Steven Erikson's fantasy novels, but I digress.)\n\nOne final note:  This is the first of a long saga of 5 Geneforge games.  I haven't played those other games, but GF1 is quite satisfactory all on its own as a standalone title.  So, don't feel that you *need* to get drawn into the larger saga to enjoy GF.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n+ Open-ended, with interesting moral themes\n+ Simple but sophisticated gameplay\n+ Great story\n+ The novelty of shaping/creating your allies\n\n- Ugly\n- Lacks direction at times\n- Interface can be clunky\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who can appreciate its intellectual flavor and doesn't mind primitive graphics.", "timestamp_created": 1468546810, "timestamp_updated": 1468546810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555204", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24164332": {"recommendationid": "24164332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038743618", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 2668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426799320}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favortie games of all time.\n\nWorld, Setting, and Story: You're a shaper (magical sorcerer people who can create life from humaniods to drakes to raptors) about to be some apprentice when ship gets attacked and dies with you on a quarintined island.

Built primairly around atmosphere, the first of the Geneforge games is adicting to anyone who likes questing and exploration.\n\nIt should be noted that you may start to burn out after a long time if you don't know where you're going. I got stuck wandering for several hours, simply because I didn't go to a bridge to cross. But by that point, I'd pushed myself to near max level and was able to clean through whatever was left.\n\nWith multiple endings, several factions you can join, and a healthy challenge curve between the different classes, there's days of replayability to be found.\n\nPro tips though for anyone playing a shaper class: Intelligence is your friend. I know you only get 6 skill points to spend with each level, and one point in a main stat costs 5 to level up. But it's worth it in the long run. I also spent a lot on fire/magic shaping and leadership and mechanics. Investing in shaping skills will raise the base level and starting stats of any creature you create. Most people will tell you to specialize. I kind of prefered having a mix. I had them both up to around 9 or higher. Anyone that says mechanics is good at 10 is a freakin liar! There were obstacles that required me to have as high as 15 mechanics in the late game! Leadership should be good at 12. Though I've seen some encounters that suggest higher is needed.\n\nYou'll come across 3 factions in the game: The Awakened, Obeyers, and Takers. You'll learn about them as you go. A fair warning: joining the Awakened seems like a good idea because you encounter them first... But they have the least to offer for the majority of the game. It seems as if the game was built more for the Obeyers and Takers.\n\nDifficulty may ramp up at times. Just come back when your a few levels higher and you should be good. But there are 2 levels where you'll get screwed the first 8 times, guaranteed. The power core, and a freezer level. As you walk around, you'll take damage. And if you're out of combat, this will kill you very... VERY quickly at random. Your only means of survival is to bring lots of healing spores and stay in combat mode as often as necessary. The freezer level can at least allow you to shut the cold off at a bit of a risk, should your mechanics skill be high enough.\n\nEnchanted items will also be your friend. So stock up on the best equipment you can find. And don't make your character a work horse. It's not worth it. The game does a really good job at saving things, so you can keep a pile of junk wherever you want in the world (you can fast travel btw).\n\nI'd certainly recommend getting this game, preferably with the collection at a discount.

The story is engaging and mysterious, drawing you to play more to learn about the forbidden island you've been stranded on. The story is text heavy and those who enjoy reading will be happy that the game is, in a certain sense, a constantly evolving novel. The choices you make, dialogues you pursue, and your inclination to support one faction of the island over the other is a consequantial and important part of the game. The writing is excellent and shapes the experience into a memorable one.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the fighting is turn-based and becomes quite strategic as you delve further into the game. The control scheme is point and click (Diablo-esque). Your character levels up by gaining experience through killing monsters and completing quests, and there are also many containers/tombs which enable you to build up skills as you explore the island. One of the most fun aspects of the gameplay is making a variety of shaper creations, monster-like creatures, to aid you in combat. Your choice of creations can make or break certain battle areas, finding the right combination between different creations is what lends quite a bit of strategy to the battles. \n\nThe game can be quite challenging and you can expect to die pretty often. I had my hand hovering over the quicksave key most of the time.\n\nFinally, the sound is sparse and the music is nonexistent. While sometimes I enjoyed this, I also liked to add in my own music. I really enjoyed listening to Korsakov's Scheherazade while playing.

You've arrived -- by accident -- on an island filled with shaper creations called serviles. They're more or less the same in physical capability and appearance as humans, but they were created by shapers to do the bidding of said shapers. The island has since been deserted of all shapers for hundreds of years, leaving the serviles with no masters. They've split into three sects based on their views of shapers. There are the Obeyers, who believe that, despite their absence, shapers are still, for all practical purposes, their gods, and should be worshipped as such. Next are the Awakened, who believe that their self-sustinance has severed their ties with shapers, but are also humble enough not to ignore them entirely. Thus, the Awakened view themselves as equal to shapers. Lastly, there are the Takers, who believe that, because they were abandoned, their survival has granted them superiority over shapers. In short, Obeyers < shapers, Awakened = shapers, and Takers > shapers.

Only about 50% through, I'm guessing, but wanted to post this review for anyone considering purchasing this while it's still on sale. Can't stop playing, and my 360 and PS3 are getting dusty -- and I've got Skyrim, Dragon's Dogma, Dark Souls, Demon Souls, etc., all of which are great but are now on hold!\n\nPros:\n* Well-written story, and location, item, and character descriptions are compelling and not too long or short.\n* Turn-based combat, assuming you like that.\n* No loading screen more than 3 seconds -- lightning fast, which means area transitions and other activities are never discouraged. This seems like a minor point, but it isn't. It makes the game feel quick and responsive like driving a Porsche (even though the game looks like a Kia).\n* Some (although not consistent) decent challenge here on occasions, especially based on what creations you choose to bring with you on your adventure. Strategy is rewarded nicely.\n* Love the graphical interface -- almost all information is on the playing screen, which means most (but not all) commands are one mouse-click away.\n* Very low computer demands, playable on old machines.\n\nCons:\n* Minimal graphical treats, very basic map and character and monster animations. However, in my opinion, this adds to the charm of the game, and also makes the game easier on the eyes. After a few hours, it becomes the new normal.\n* Minimal audio treats, no voice-acting (so far) that I can remember. The audio for combat, door slides, and other events is adequate but limited.\n* No cut scenes (so far) that I can remember.\n* Interface could be improved by allowing the same key that opens a pop-up menu to close the same menu when pressed again. Other fans have mentioned this but Spiderweb for some reason has resisted making this improvement.\n* Would be nice if clicking anywhere on screen other than a pop-up closed the pop-up. Would be nice to have the right mouse button select player character and all creatures, instead of forcing player to find and punch the \"0\" on the keyboard every time -- a minor but constant irritation.\n* Would be nice if the hotkeys were customizable.\n\nNote on how to enjoy:\n* Read everything! The material is enjoyable, short, and well written. If you get tired, play something else until you are ready again to read everything. In this game you will create your own mental image and interpretation of the game world, based on what you read, unlike most games in which you will be shown a more explicit graphical representation of everything.\n* Don't read a guide, stay away from forums. They're not necessary (so far). Use trial and error. You can save anywhere.\n* Don't worry about trying to make the perfect build or to select every optimal decision in dialog choices. Immerse yourself in the world and let consequences just happen. The game is not so tough (so far) that you will get stuck.\n* Even if you don't finish this game, or for some reason don't like it much, it should be at least interesting to see what a very small but talented development team can accomplish with limited resources.\n\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1437852627, "timestamp_updated": 1437853236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17206258": {"recommendationid": "17206258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051590616", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474573157}, "language": "english", "review": "Out-dated graphics made up for by creative, mysterious storyline.", "timestamp_created": 1437754180, "timestamp_updated": 1437754180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17202775": {"recommendationid": "17202775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077358538", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454149188}, "language": "english", "review": "big game, big stoy, must buy saga, lost of fun in this gem\n\ni think i have done this fast but havent finisht it, a game for any mod you are\n\nsuper recomend it", "timestamp_created": 1437737451, "timestamp_updated": 1437737451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17177345": {"recommendationid": "17177345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134332253", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439944270}, "language": "english", "review": "Get ready to die ALOT", "timestamp_created": 1437593497, "timestamp_updated": 1437593497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17074950": {"recommendationid": "17074950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014431520", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437125295}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun, graphics are deifinitely dated, the interface a little clunky, but its a retro type game so that is to be expected, but the gameplay gets you hooked, I am finding it great fun and challenging.

I have been a long time fan of Spiderweb's games for the last 6 or 7 years, I grew up playing these games, given that they were the demos from the Spiderweb website, but I never got bored of the limited length of them. having seen the 45$ 13 game bundle, I jumped on it. I have already beaten most of these games, and am thrilled to have them all now.\nAs far as having an opinion of this game, first and foremost you should remember that this is one of their earlier games, and that it is an indie game. \nNow for the highlights of the games, though the artstyle might have that dated feel to it, it is a charming and unique style the developers have not strayed too far from, each of their different series have slightly different but similar art stlye, that, while simple, are quite intricate.\n\nThe combat is, as others have said, turn based and based on speed stats which can be altered based on skills, items, or gear. The wide variety of companions you can summon makes for a large part of the tactical aspect of the game. You can choose between an average strength army, or a couple strong warrior creatures to assist you. I noticed some people didn't like the game based on all these different areas that have 'monsters so strong you can't beat them' or 'monsters killing me in one hit' but that is the fun of this game, the idea of it is, if you can't win, look for a different path, or try later, or use a different tactic. As long as you don't stick to running in with the same strategy 30 times in a row, dying each time, it shouldn't be too rough.\n\nNow, I might be placing this a little far down the list, but from the get go, you can pick several different characters based on your overall desires of game play, they are all rather diverse and skilled in their own special ways, but as such their skills might cost more or less skill points to learn.\n\nThe depth of the story is all narrated in text, which in my opinion, I found to be more in depth then a cutscene, depending on how fast you read, it can be agonizing or delightful, the choices are almost always going to influence people and potentially anger them, or make them approve of you more. \n\nDispite all my praise I am willing to give the game, no true review would be complete without admitting some flaws with the game (Personal opinion I feel) and so I will list several of the downsides to the game. \n\nFirst and foremost is, that if you ever learn of the little hidden cheat console you can access, it will remove all the fun of the game if you overuse it, I used it once and managed to clear most of the game in about an hour.\n\nSome of the area's do get rather tough, I will admit, I have managed to get a bit stuck in several areas. But there are generally about 4 or 5 areas you can go to at that time, or quests you can finish. With that said, all you need is a little side trip to finish some and you will manage to gear or level up to reach your needs for that challenging area. It is very easily a frustrating game with it's scaling, but worth every moment. \n\nThe noises and sounds, while short and sweet, memorable and appealing, do tend to grate on the nerves after listening to them through the hours of play.\n\nIn conclusion, if you have made it this far, you are either an avid reader of reviews, or you are truly interested in this game, and if you haven't purchased it, I would strongly reccommend it, that is, if you enjoy a nice text based turn based rpg with hundreds of choices and many outcomes. This game has a beautiful art style for it's time, and a long well thought out story that I can only imagine took many months to think out and many more to fine tune and decide upon.

I'm sure that the game had many interesting choices to make that led to different stories. I didn't mind the poor graphics one bit, and I'm normally a fan of games like Baldur's Gate.\n\nIn the end, though, I just couldn't get used to the terrible combat. It's infuriating. Make and ugprade a few meat shield creatures coupled with a few ranged ones and you're good to go. Just charge forward and hope that you don't die. And I say hope because it all really does hinge on luck. In games like X-COM, you might need to rely on a few lucky hits, but for the most part, some dumb mistake you made is responsible for your deaths. Your choices matter in games like X-COM. Too bad Geneforge isn't like that.\n\nIn Geneforge, there are a-holes that can instakill your main character everywhere. Seriously, there are areas where more than 75% of the monsters can bring your main character from 100% HP to 0% HP. Even the second hostile monster in the game, the Thahd, can one-shot your main character. All any of those instakilling a-holes have to do is attack your main character, get a decent damage value from the RNG, and land the hit to trigger the game over screen. All you can do about it is pray that their AI picks on your creations rather than your main character or get bad RNG numbers if they do attack your main character. Too bad the AI doesn't always pick on your creatures. Sometimes, they just arbitrarily walk past your meat shield and give your main character a lethal smack, and that's it. And all of that happens on normal difficulty. On harder difficulties like torment, the monsters get better hit chance and damage, which means more one-shots on your main character. That's half the combat: just hoping that some monster doesn't one-shot your main character.\n\nIf you can get over that hurdle, you'll have a good time.

Although it's an early 2000 game, the interface feels like it's from the mid 90s - makes sense, Jeff Vogel is essentially a one man development team.\n\nBut why do I recommend this game? Because Jeff Vogel creates wide open worlds with large amounts of content, alternate paths, and meaningful quests. Throughout my ~35 hours of play, the only parts that felt like a grind/chore were a few specific areas (<1 hour, because I chose to ignore them) that had large swarms of mobs roaming the map, or environmental damaging effects that were too annoying to deal with. The only quests that felt like the reason of being given as \"because fuck you, that's why\" were few, played for good effect, and completely optional. Speaking of optional quests and really open worlds, it is technically possible to beat it by performing the only quest that you get at the very beginning - Get Off Sucia Island. Of course, you miss out on a fair amount of treats Geneforge will offer you. \n\nCombat is alright, but hardly optimal. Pathfinding is trash - you gotta manually path out a lot of movement or face the consequences of letting the pathfinding handle it. RNG can be somewhat harsh - 50 max hp, take 8 damage, take 6 damage, take 41 damage, dead. Frequent saving and/or high risk aversity can negate this. Despite all of that, there is a variety of playstyles, builds, and spells that make combat entertaining enough.\n\nIn summary, if you are willing to overlook the flaws associated with an aged genre, you will find world building and open-ended questing/exploration strong enough to rival the best of titles in that category.\n\nNOTE: There is a slowness issue in this game that is not patched by default.

To put it simply: It's an oddly fantastic game. \n\nHaving never heard of the series, I purchased a bundle with all 5 Geneforge games. I really enjoyed my playthough of Geneforge 1, despite the difficulty and dated feel of its isometric graphics. Many of the sound effects are terrible and yet somehow memorable and enjoyable. The entire gameworld is immersive, and the creators succeed at inviting the player into a curious world unlike anything I've found elsewhere. \n\nThe turn-based combat is unique and seamless with world exploration; no cutscenes to a battlefield. Feel free to disagree, but this games combat feels a lot like what Dragon Age would have been (without the dragons) in 2001. You set your party into a formation (some strategy), you scout bad guys, you draw them into battle and then the turn-based system engages right where the characters are standing, based on the players/enemies speed as determined by stats. The balancing is steeped against the player and pots/items/spells saved my creations several times. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention? [spoiler]You're a Shaper, a god-like race of techno-religious beings who fashioned slaves through genetic engineering, albeit 150 years ago before much of the technology was abandoned, ship wrecked on an island populated with the decendants of those slaves.[/spoiler] If you want to know more, or about what the Geneforge is, buy the game!\n\nAside from combat, content-wise it's pretty dense. I was able to get up to 50hrs in a single playthrough, although I explored just about every square inch of map and tried multiple different endings. The story is pushed by text-narration as opposed to characters rendered in 3D, animated w/ voice acting. This makes it impenetrable to many spoilt by games such as Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, and Bioshock, but nevertheless it has it all. Political intrigue, factions, tons of choices that shape the world and your standing within it, hundreds of items and creatures, and dungeon after dungeon to crawl through.\n\nI can't speak to the whole series, although I may play them through in the future, but IMO Geneforge 1 is worth your time for anything under $3.

You aren't allowed to be there, and the story is about why that is, what made it that way, and how do you interact with the inhabitants left behind, all while learning more about what your order is about, what they're like, and how you're going to resolve it all when you go back.\n\nI have absolutely never played another game where I wanted to know more strongly what came next, except for its sequel, perhaps.

Je nach Klasse/Inventar und Ausr\u00fcstung variiert die Punktzahl die man am Anfang eines Zuges hat.\nIm Kampf stehen einem \"selbst erschaffene Kreaturen bei\" , diese kann man erschaffen(bis zu 7 St\u00fcck) und unterst\u00fctzen einem im Kampf.\nEin Tipp m\u00f6chte ich hier abgeben, wenn man 2 Skillpunkte beim erschaffen einer Kreatur in die Rubrik \"Intelligence\" setzt so kann man die Kreatur im Kampf selbst befehligen,\nandernfalls rennt sie rum und greift an wie sie lust und laune hat. Das kann ziemlich nerven wenn man es nicht wei\u00df ;) .\n\n\nDas Spiel selber gibt es nur auf Englisch, die Story muss man aber nicht lesen, weshalb man es auch durchaus spielen kann wenn man kein Englisch kann.

This review is for Geneforge 1 through 5, the complete series.\n\n  Mr. Jeff Vogel and his [i]Spiderweb Software[/i] are involved not just in the Geneforge IP but also the [u]Avernum[/u] series which is enjoyable.  Geneforge was developed in five installments from 2001 to 2008.  Graphics were never a priority with this IP, and in my opinion like most games developed by this company, its greatest strength is story.\n\nSome things that must be talked about when discussing Geneforge:\n[list]\n    [*]Heavy use of text\n    [*]Merciless combat & careful character progression\n    [*]No hand holding or linearity in a huge world\n[/list]\n  Understand that these games feel old by any standard.  People who didn't grow up playing MUDs or other types of games in high school will likely be frustrated by the high amount of text here: it's how you get the dialogue, interact with people and objects, and absorb specific information about every new area you come across in addition to most of the situations that dynamically arise in the game world.  The pace of the game is necessarily slowed down by this feature and many players either don't have the patience or simply aren't inclined to sit through so much content when presented in this format.  Yeah, you have to stop and read.  I urge you to take that time and effort, since the reading provides great detail and insight into the lore, characters and story --not to mention you'll be completely lost on what to do next if you skip through it!\n\n  Combat can be very fun and is especially rewarding after you've repeated an encounter that initially punished you but discovered a viable path to victory.  \"Shaping,\" the act of creating life via magic, is the central theme of Geneforge and translates into an \"essence\" mechanic, a second mana pool the player character spends to summon a host of little minions (or a handful of stronger ones, or a single powerful one; it varies based on the demands of each encounter).  There are a few types of shaping that each come with their own creations (magical, melee, ranged, control, etcetera).  Even on the casual difficulty you need to be smart about how you invest skill points upon leveling up.  Support skills like Leadership and Mechanics are great; they can supposedly be used to beat the game without a combat-viable character.  Melee and ranged specializations are available too, of course, if you aren't into the magic system.  I found the most success with a bit of everything, emphasizing survivability + stats over armor in my gear choices.  Be prepared for some trial and error (or look up some cheats online...but really, don't do that).  There are a couple of succinct and helpful guides out there, though.\n\n  The third item on that list just further drives home the importance of realizing it's a long game with lots of text.  You have very little indication of where to go or what to do even when given a quest.  You'll forge out into the world and earn every inch of progress with meticulous interrogation of NPCs in towns and navigation of treacherous, trap-filled monster infested wildlands in equal measure.  If you skip that text, eventually you'll be having to consult a guide or just roam randomly until you get lucky.  I did not explore every area, complete every quest, hunt down every rare item or talk to everyone I met.  In fact, at times I followed the main questline as closely as is possible in my eagerness to see the main plot play out.  \n\n  Technically the game is very simple but runs without any issue.  It started as demoware on the Mac.  Everything runs fine but looks extremely dated and perhaps feels clunky.  \n\n  The themes dealt with in this story are ones I liked and would enjoy seeing more of in future games.  I found it very pleasing that the story unfolded in episodic manner from one game to the next, especially regarding the recurring characters who I'd grown attached to.  The only criticism I'd level against the story is that it is delivered almost too arbitrarily; I felt at times I would have been better served experiencing the story through my actions rather than being told what to think with a text box.  Overall however, it was an excellent delivery.  Of the cRPGs I've played, this series isn't my favorite but it's up there, although...\n\n  I can only recommend Geneforge to players who have considerable patience and time on their hands for the experience I've described above, and who are craving an \"old school\" game.  It's challenging but good fun.  Defeating your enemies to reach the ending and see how everything wraps up based on your choices is so rewarding.\n\nTIP: Be thorough in exploring, talking, and reading the text for each area.  It'll help in various ways, not just the extra experience points.\nTIP: Guides exist online if you find yourself in an unbeatable fight or unsure of where to go next.", "timestamp_created": 1410917919, "timestamp_updated": 1410917919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510663", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11932544": {"recommendationid": "11932544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055624111", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479627099}, "language": "english", "review": "Best isometric RPG series ever!", "timestamp_created": 1409478438, "timestamp_updated": 1409478438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11928504": {"recommendationid": "11928504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000878931", "num_games_owned": 731, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 2023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412872692}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been playing this a lot lately. At first i thought i would hate it but as i got furthur in the game (very slowly) I started to enjoy it. \n\nFIrst of all i have not completed it yet  but i have played enough to probebly write something. \n\nStory \nIf you do not like a lot of reading then you mind as well pass on the game. There is a ton of reading and the game is very heavily story based which is a good thing because so far it has been pretty well written. I won't give anything away so i can't say much just know that it is well worth reading through. Also talk to every npc  that is a must. You also might want something to write down notes. \n\nGameplay\n\ngees where do i start  ... Well i guess the battle gameplay. It is a stradegy turn based rpg. Every turn you have a certain amout of ability ponts. moving, using items, attacking will use ability points. This makes you think a lot about your move during the combat phase which again is a good thing.  As you level up you will gain point in which you can distribute to certain stats. \n\nEventually you will be able to summon creatures to fight by your side. But if you do not keep them happy the will turn on you and start attacking you. Which could turn a battle thats going good in to a nightmare. Which brings another level of stradegy. Also creating creatures effects your essance points base stat. So say you summon one that uses 7 essance points. Your base stat will be ... 21-7 =14  you can gain back that stat by absorbing the creature when you do not need it. \n\nMusic \nThere is not much music here aside from the title screen but enough  form towns with the kids playing and running around to outside where there will be animal sounds. that is more then enough to be enjoyable. \n\nscore 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1409445371, "timestamp_updated": 1409445371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508538", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11859412": {"recommendationid": "11859412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051926788", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407846439}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like reading fantasy books I'm sure you like this game.My play time shows 7 hours but I played this game offline so real play time is about 55 hours..probably", "timestamp_created": 1408968288, "timestamp_updated": 1408968379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11803117": {"recommendationid": "11803117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020273912", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409396416}, "language": "english", "review": "This, and the entire bundle are CRAP and a waste of money.

You get to encounter different sects, and you can ally yourself with them, betray them later, and then change your mind and do what they probably would have wanted if you hadn't already massacred their town. All of these actions have consequences within the world and how that world reacts to you. Those consequences follow through all the way to the ending of the game, which has a pretty impressive variety of outcomes. This is probably the strongest part of the game and what makes it worth playing through.\n\nThe growth and progression of your character is also well done. You can choose to play Geneforge as three quite different \"classes\". Every level up you get a set of skill points that you can apportion as you wish. The class you choose doesn't dictate what you can do, but it does make it easier/harder to level up certain skills. Skills range from physical combat, magic spells, the ability to \"shape\" creatures to fight for you. General skills, such as Leadership and Mechanics, are also available. Pleasantly, these are actually very useful to find non-combat methods to progress through the game.\n\nAgain all of these things are well done, and are what make the game worth playing. Where it falls apart a bit, is in the interface and to a certain degree, the combat.\n\nCombat is turn-based, and on the surface, can be quite tactical. Timing, and awareness of the positions of both your allies and your enemies are all quite important. Particularly, when you do have allies (such as the creatures you can \"shape\"), you do have to take into account whether or not you or your creatures are blocking a path forward. You can use this both to your benefit and your detriment, by funneling enemies down a corridor into one of your stronger creatures.\n\nIn theory anyway.\n\nThe problem is that, at least in my experience, the game is rather easy. So, tactics more or less go out the window, when you can just click-click-click your way to victory. Positioning at that point becomes more of an annoyance, as you try to coax the pathing algorithms to make sure that you don't waste a turn because you clicked slightly to the left of something, so it paths all the way around and your turn is wasted. And it's even worse that the punishment for this is not death, but a test of your patience, more often than not.\n\nTowards the end of the game, the challenge is upped, but by presenting annoyances, like poisoned areas that do damage to you and your creatures for just being in them. There is an optional area towards the end that serves as a pretty robust challenge, but again, the tactics aren't really that interesting at the end of it. It's more a battle of attrition that you just need to push through.\n\nOverall, the combat side of this game seems like it would be great on paper, but it ends up being boring most of the time, and annoying some of the time. Very rarely is it actually much fun.\n\nI should mention that the presentation of the game is quite old-school, and to top it off, there is no music aside from the title screen of the game. You just get some ambient noise in towns, and sound effects for all the actions. That's it. Honestly, some music would have made some of the more annoying slog parts of the game much more palatable. I mean, it helped a lot when I was just listening to a podcast or some music when I was doing it.\n\nThat being said, despite all the gripes, I would still totally recommend the game. Normally, I'm a gameplay over story/presentation guy, but in this case I can overlook it. What it does right, it does very well. \n\nFrom what I've heard, the series just continues to build on itself as it goes on.

What, to you, makes a good game? There are many potential answers to that question, all of them valid. If, however, you rely on graphics for the sake of immersion you will not enjoy Geneforge. Its graphics are rather primitive, even considering their age. If you cannot bring yourself to overlook the game's presentation, that's understandable. But if you can see past the rough edges, you will find an RPG with a lot to offer.\n\n\n\nIf graphics are the lowest point of Geneforge, story is the highest. The game takes place in a creative and well-realized world where science and magic combine into an entire discipline based on creating life. Those who wield this power, called shapers,  hold immense social and political influence over the setting. Entire species owe their existence to these mad scientists of the magic world, and the shapers are quick to bring that up and exploit it. \n\n\n\nOn the island where the plot is set, long-abandoned creations get these quaint ideas like \"free will\" and \"fair compensation\". It's up to the player to decide to what extent they support the rights of the created beings, if at all. Choices like that are common in Geneforge, and railroading the player's decisions is refreshingly rare. None of the story paths is presented as the absolute most ethical--each faction has flaws and benefits, both to the NPCs and to the player. Not allying yourself to any of them is possible but more difficult.\n\n\n\nThe game play itself is adequate, but personally I only saw it as a vehicle to access more of the plot. Make of that what you will.\n\n\nIn summary: Geneforge is a game that must be viewed with certain expectations in mind. There are a number of obvious budget and technical constraints at work, which may turn away those with little tolerance fo such things. Those who can endure despite its flaws will find a game with immense personality, well worth the effort required to uncover its riches.

A game that's not just about seeing how many goblins you can bop on the head or how much gold you've shamelessly stolen by the end of the adventure. \n\nThe Geneforge series is all about story, strategy and whether or not, you're willing to sacrifice Binky (your sadly under-leveled Fyora) for a brand spanking new, just off the line, Terror Vlish (you might name him Keith). Now in any other RPG this is an easy choice - Binky doesn't even have time to say goodbye to his best friend Crispin (a dependable Clawbug), before you've reabsorbed him and used his essence to create Keith. \n\nBut this is the bit that makes Geneforge different - Keith might be better in every possible way, but you two haven't taken a journey together from the Bandit Woods, through the Thorny Fen, and down into the (horrific) Mines. You and Binky have a partnership and you're not about to give him up, not even for Keith (with his awesome name). \n\nEventually you'll either decide to give up Binky (Crispin still gets a far off look in his eyes whenever he smells roasted Ornk) or you'll keep Binky and find another way to survive the Labs. It'll take more healing, planning, tools and a fair bit of luck, but Crispin won't be crying himself to sleep every night. \n\nAnd that's what Geneforge is about. At its core, it's game where you create creatures to fight for you, that you actually weirdly start caring about (sorry Jiggly Puff). It's a journey, both plot and game mechanic wise of hard decisions. At the end you'll never feel completely happy with the choices you've made and that's the sign of a good game.

The game does have some things to be 'desired', one of them being companions/creations who can genuinely level and a better reason to keep around old ones.\n\n\nThis game has a sort of 'old style' charm to it with simple RPG leveling, stats to put points into and different classes to play. Graphics aren't amazing, but if you really want (like I did) you can go edit them a bit (not sure if you can do this with the steam version ) (I turned my shaper into a hot elf chick cuz I can).\n\nThe gameplay is solid, though it takes a bit to get used to the 'looting' system where you open the grab menu and you look at all the items around you or click containers to view what's inside. Stats and stat paths can determine if you are skilled enough to go certain ways and it's entierly possible to get through the game without REALLY fighting. I played a mixed route and tried my best to see it all and found it difficult because I wasn't specialized, but it was ok in the end since I reached a point where I felt I was 'thinking' about the combat, but also doing quite well by using some items correctly and also by positioned right, etc.\n\nOne of the best reasons to play the game though is the rich story, lore and plot. The game has 'canisters' that can enhance you throughout the game and although I don't want to ruin anything, I will just say that using them can affect the ending. So can a LOT of the actions performed. I think there is anywhere from 3 to 20ish different endings, only around 4 of which I really saw, 1 being death cuz duh it happens.\n\n\n\nSummed up, solid game, old world charm, slow paced, good story.

Here \u201cShapers\u201d are humans able to create and shape life through magic, raise armies of creatures to work and fight for them, and even genetically alter plants to serve as tools and weapons. Everything about the world seems exotic and well-thought, and it\u2019s very interesting to learn about its lore and workings. \n\nThe story starts with your character being washed in the shores of a mysterious island, where rogue creations run wild over abandoned Shaper ruins. As you explore the massive island in search for a way back home, you\u2019ll find the truth behind the abandoned ruins, and will decide the fate of the various factions that inhabit it. The writing is solid, and the game asks you to make some seriously complex decisions, without any banal morality judging you. I\u2019ll add that Geneforge is the only game I ever played where the NPCs managed to change my mind with solid arguments (instead of bribes) after I had decided on a set course of action.\n\nCombat is turn-based with action points, and although it has some annoying limitations (like only one attack per turn), it\u2019s solid. There are three classes to choose from, and they give you freedom to fight any way you want, being able to create hordes of weak monster to fight for you, focus on a large and powerful creatures, cast spells like firebolt and fear, or simply hack and slash your enemies. Non-combat skills like Leadership and Mechanics are also important, as they provide unique ways to avoid conflicts and solve quests. And although it may not seem obvious at first, there\u2019s a great deal of reactivity here as well.\n\nWhen this was release, back in 2001, cRPGs fans had their mouths full, being spoiled with the release of classic such as Arcanum, BG2: Throne of Bhaal, Morrowind, Wizardry 8 and Gothic.

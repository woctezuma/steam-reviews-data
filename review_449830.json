First off the game will start out slow, I had the issue with getting through the early part of the game just cause its a slow crawl. But trying to keep spoilers aside from this VN. Extra is pretty much a standard 'slice o' life' type of story where MC has numerous girls flocking to him and he has to make a choice, though I will say one of the choices left me emotional and impacted my decsion towards the end of Extra, so its not like its gonna leave you with out some feels.\n\nHowever this game truly starts to shine once you finish Extra and start on to Unlimited. Unlimited will take your mindset of Extra and flip it completly 180 degrees, and holy hell will it make you feel towards the end. Unlimited also has a somewhat slow crawl in the start as well. Though after seeing what they did with Unlimited directly affecting Extra I was hoked anyways and kept playing no matter what. By the end of Unlimited you will feel Remorse, Guilt, and Regret for the choices you make, it messed me up. Once the credits roll and that after credits scene you will get sucker punched to some feels you will wanna pick up Muv-Luv Alternative to finish out the series, which I am currently starting it.\n\nBut if I had to recommend this game to someone who is New to VN's and a Veteran to VN's I totally would based off this one.\n\nFinal Note: The game is good and has the 18+ content patched out of it. Though I managed to get an 18+ patch, I dont really think the missing content is needed however if you wanna find the patch just google it and it should be one of the first hits or check the forums to find a link to the patch.", "timestamp_created": 1511061053, "timestamp_updated": 1511061053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36536635": {"recommendationid": "36536635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022773497", "num_games_owned": 1159, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511280201}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this game because of all the hype and good reviews surrounding it but holy hell is it monotonous. The characters aren't interesting, and the \"story\" leading up to what people keep exclaiming is a \"brilliant\" conclusion to the series I honestly can't understand. 24 hours into the game and still nothing is happening, and i leave the text on auto and have read along for ages only for the characters to repeat the same tired jokes and doing very little in terms of developing the characters or the plotline. The \"drama\" hasn't even hardly begun. Please, don't waste your time with this crap, the people reviewing this have rose tinted glasses and probably actually played the \"game\" years ago when very little else was released or fan translated in terms of visual novel content. There are significantly better stories worth your time at a third of the price. Absolutely don't recommend this title or Alternative.\n\nEdit: it absolutely shouldn't take 24+ hours for a game to make the player/reader begin to start caring about its plot or characters, it just shouldn't. If the story were well paced even remotely I would have taken a liking to at least one of the characters by now, but overall, the protagonist does little more than make you hate him because of his behavior towards his peers, be it in his original slice of life world, or in the alternative. He comes off as whiny and generally useless and is the butt of just about every joke. Everybody else in the story are just tired, one-dimensional anime tropes with very little variation in behavior, after the first interaction with each of them it's fair enough to say you know exactly how they'll react to every future scenario you meet them in. They are BORING and 100% predictable.\n\nI have been ACTIVELY TRYING to find something to like about this game, as I spent another 2 (additional edit, make that 6 more) hours reading through it the other night, but yet again am I faced with uninteresting characters and a plot that doesn't know where it's going and so often and so easily gets sidetracked by little \"character arcs\" that, as i've said previously, don't do anything to add to your knowledge of what that character is like. If you were looking for an interesting story, look elsewhere.\n\nReposted because of all the salty downvoters trying to push this to the bottom. My critique of this game is fair, i'm not saying what I am because I dislike VNs as a whole, i've enjoyed quite a few, this one is subpar, you're not doing the VN community any favors by letting this one set the bar for what \"quality\" is.", "timestamp_created": 1510770281, "timestamp_updated": 1511024389, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532770", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36518631": {"recommendationid": "36518631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257637455", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505451030}, "language": "english", "review": "(posting the same review for Muv Luv and Alternative)\n\nIf you're into the visual novel dating sim deal then you should probably play this. I'm told it's one of the best ones and it does a lot of... interesting stuff with that whole concept. If you're like me and indifferent to that but thinking about getting these two games for the mecha aspect, that's where it becomes really difficult to recommend. That part has a tendency to fall into the background for more than a few hours at a time once you finally get to it (takes about fifteen hours if i remember correctly), and if I'm being honest that's a good thing since it maybe wouldn't be able to carry your interest on it's own even if you're already a fan of the genre.\n\nNot necessarily a knock on the game itself, I just came into it with the wrong expectations. This is very much an eroge visual novel about a ton of girls orbitting one oblivious dude's crotch, even if it does eventually involve giant robots and aliens and other sci-fi stuff. And if the former is your thing, again, this is almost certainly for you. But if you're just curious about the one super hyped up mecha visual novel you'll probably want to save yourself the time and money. While the mecha aspect definitely sees a huge jump in quality once you get to Alternative, you're talking about over 20 hours minimum to get there (I used a walkthrough), and even then it takes it's sweet time getting to (no spoilers) the parts you've actually wanted to see since halfway through the previous game, and would only stand up to average/slightly above average mecha anime or manga.", "timestamp_created": 1510691392, "timestamp_updated": 1510692368, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435533", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36516441": {"recommendationid": "36516441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150732671", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510688915}, "language": "english", "review": "Would not recommend to those who are not a fan of the genre.

So, wanting to see what the fuss was about, I got this one and started up.\n\nI'm not too sure how I feel about Extra to be honest. It's a very well put together VN, don't get me wrong; decent writing, great characters (except for Takeru, the most insensitive protagonist I think I've ever played as) and well-drawn character and background art. But I felt as though I was still waiting for something significant to happen by the time it ended. However, that's probably a bit harsh on my part considering I haven't explored all Extra has to offer.\n\nUnlimited, on the other hand, was definitely where I got heavily invested. Perhaps it's because I'm a sucker for giant robots, but that's not the only reason. The writing, art style and characters all kicked it up a notch. Even Takeru, insufferable he might've been, grew into someone who's somewhat admirable. While no tears were shed by the end of the game, the impact to my feels was definitely felt with the force of a TSF wielding a giant sledgehammer.\n\nSo yeah, I can now thoroughly accept this is one of the most acclaimed VNs ever, and going through all of this has me just itching to play Alternative to see how it ends. If you consider yourself a fan of visual novels, pick this up and enjoy the ride.

I would like to make a little background of myself just for people understand where i come from, i watch a lot of animes, read literally hungred mangas as well as read some LN, of course read some VN, but Muv-Luv tought me the feeling of being devasteded, bear in mind that i didnt play Alternative yet, i just finished Unlimited and came rushing to write this review, so yeah, lets begin. \n\nMuv-Luv Extra i'll be clear, its mediocre, not because it is different from Unlimited and Alternative, but the characters and writting are weird, you see, they diverge a lot, sometimes it looks like the writer knows that he is writting to a VN, other times it looks like he is writting a novel, and what is the problem? Inconsistency with the character, there are sometimes in some routes that the main character starts to think like a romantic novel, using methaphor for what he is doing, really cheesy lines, when the character is more immature and sarcastic, but that is not the only problem, there are a lot of inconsistency with the story, as well as the motivation of some characters, they're not compeling enough. You see, it is not that bad, it is just ok harem shoujo VN, if you read VN or even watch animes offen, you'll know the background of at least one character just 15 minutes in to the game, and it isnt that good but i digress, you have your share of laughts and thats it, if it wasnt for contextualize a little of Unlimited i have to be honest, i would just recommend if you didnt have something to read. \n\nNow lets go to the meat and potatos of Muv-Luv, Unlimited, my God, it didnt even look like the same game, the main character it is way more flesh out as well as the other characters, but the thing about the main character that makes him compeling is the difference between his perspective to the character in Unlimited, he seems immature, and using this adjetive to him, could be a shot in the foot, but it was really well written because the character is self-conscious, and that makes him relatable and not annoying, he can understand something, yet not accepting, not just that, you know something has a good writting when the character is something in the beginning, and at the end he is another. Talking about the story, it is more well paced, but when they need you to feel something, it is so effective, it is a great work of writting and music, makes ou anxious, or feel bad for it, you feel like Takeru in every moment, there wasnt a single moment that i didnt care, and i give props to that. Everytime i was sad reading, because some lines made me think about that world and how sad it was, i'll not get in to the specifics, even if you can read in the resume, but the more you think about that world and what they're going through, it is just sad, even if they are used to it and they are ok with it, just the setting it is so well placed that makes me, again, sad. And i think one of the most compeling aspect of Unlimited is the mistery, you dont know whats going on, whats this or that, and this is always in the back of your mind, this makes you want to read more and more to find out.

Even the beginning of Muv-Luv: Alternative is a power trip where the supersoldier protagonist breezes through basic training and displays his superior piloting skills (mecha otakuness pays off in the end). AND THEN IT GRABS YOU BY THE HAIR, PULLS YOU UP AND STARTS F***ING YOU IN YOUR FACE.\u00bb[/i]\n- Anonymous board user describing his experience with the Muv-Luv trilogy\n\n[b]Muv-Luv[/b] is massive, by all means.\n\nWhat on the first glance looks like a generic high-school-romance visual novel in fact turns into a dramatic SciFi / mecha / military-themed universe which took many influences from other franchises such as [i]Starship Troopers[/i], [i]Evangelion[/i] or [i]Gunbuster[/i]. The [b]Muv-Luv[/b] franchise was actually so successful that meanwhile it expanded into numerous sequels, spin-offs, light novels, anime series and much more.\n\nTo begin with, this particular release of [b]Muv-Luv[/b] consists of two separate games which you can select from in the main menu, [b]Extra[/b] and [b]Unlimited[/b]. [b]Extra[/b] can be considered as a lighthearted introduction to the main characters while [b]Unlimited[/b] finally introduces you to the serious SciFi world in which the franchise mainly takes place.\n\nPersonally I interpret both games as an overly long prologue to the amazing 50 hours long [b]Muv-Luv: Alternative[/b], the third game of the original trilogy which many players consider one of the best visual novels ever made ([i]not[/i] included in this particular release, sold separately). That being said you need to bring up the patience and effort to read through both [b]Extra[/b] and [b]Unlimited[/b], since in total it takes about 30 hours until you've seen all the endings. And to be honest, some routes and story branches in both games are not even that interesting. For instance I found [i]Ayamine's[/i] route in [b]Extra[/b] exhaustingly tedious.\n\nBUT (and here it gets interesting) it still pays off if you read through everything and therefore immerse yourself into [b]Muv-Luv[/b]'s characters and world, since later in the third game a huge chunk of the story touches upon that. After sucking in all that what [b]Extra[/b] and [b]Unlimited[/b] offered, finishing the third game will be one of the most rewarding and complete visual novel experiences you might ever have.\n\nTherefore especially [b]Extra[/b] may leave you rather unimpressed at first, but the experience definitely takes epic proportions by the time you finished both games and finally start [b]Alternative[/b].\n\nIn case you never played any visual novel before, here's the deal: You read yourself through textboxes and occassionally make decisions that to some extend change the outcome of the ending. Everything is accompanied by CGs, an appropiate soundtrack and sometimes even by voice actors. What may sound pretty boring to many is in fact pretty intense. Visual novels have the pace and format to tell such detailed and immersive stories that animes, movies or TV shows can't equally pull off due to their technical limitations. What a movie cramps down to 2 hours, a visual novel makes you experience in 40.\n\nThe story of [b]Muv-Luv[/b]  puts you in the shoes of Takeru, a regular, rather lazy Japanese high school student who's into mecha arcade games, good food and the comforts of life. He is best friends with Sumika, the girl next door who spent all her childhood with him. When he's not spending his spare time with her or his other buddy Mikoto in the local arcades, he's usually goofing around at school and interacting with his mostly female classmates. But everything changes as one day Takeru wakes up in his bed - next to a unknown, mysterious girl...\n\nTelling anything more would already result in spoilers, but rest assured that you'll adore the [b]Muv-Luv[/b] trilogy if you like SciFi-themed anime with military / mecha / conspiracy / traumatizing vibes to it. The later parts specifically reminded me of Verhoeven's [b]Starship Troopers[/b], which I already mentioned before.\n\nNow the [b]Muv-Luv[/b] games initially started as [i]Eroge[/i] visual novels with some kinky +18 scenes in it. This particular Steam release (also known as [i]All-Ages[/i] version) has all of the H-scenes removed due to Steam's content policies. The developers / publishers solved this problem by offering a separately available [b]Director's Cut patch[/b] that unlocks the +18 CGs in the game. While that's technically a good solution, the bad news is that you need to fork out another $10 for that patch, which is quite a rip-off in my opinion. In the end it doesn't even affect that many CG's and scenes, which are [i]pixelized[/i] anyway due to Japanese pornography law. Furthermore personally I didn't like the kinky scenes that much since they kinda feel out of place considering the intense story and all - but that's up to you.\n\nSo, should you get it?\n\nIf all that already sounds too long and tedious for you, then just leave it be. You'll most likely get bored after a few hours of listening to Sumika's annoying chatter.\n\nBut if you're ready to dive into this universe that later shines with excellent world-building and geekiness, then come on board and enjoy this rollercoaster full of excitement, emotions, blood and tears. Consider this release as an overly long prelude to [b]Muv-Luv: Alternative[/b], which will most likely blow you away completely.\n\n6 out of 10 Yakisoba Pans, if you look at both first games from a individual perspective\n8 out of 10 Henyus, if you put both first games it in context with the complete trilogy\n\n[i]\u00abThat purple haired girl has interesting and seemingly impossible polygonal shaped hair.\u00bb[/i]\n- Random normie comment about one of the protagonists", "timestamp_created": 1503864174, "timestamp_updated": 1505118646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773174", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34504119": {"recommendationid": "34504119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324663218", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511273653}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57  \u71c3\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1503751642, "timestamp_updated": 1503751642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34484424": {"recommendationid": "34484424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103242522", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 59978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511267662}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u71c3gal", "timestamp_created": 1503676739, "timestamp_updated": 1503676739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34459315": {"recommendationid": "34459315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376199963", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506549296}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente novela visual!

Let's start from the beginning. Extra starts rather slow. It has solid amounts of comedy. Your typical slice-of-life setting. However, it really takes off in Unlimited. It is worth the wait, that is all I will say. Given the nature of Muv-Luv's narrative setup, the promotional videos and descriptions unfortunately kind of spoil the eventual flow of the plot, which makes Unlimited a tad less impactful, but by no means does it spoil the lot of it. \n\nIt honestly reminds me of Steins;Gate, Sunrider, and eden*, all games which I have played/completed. Steins;Gate in the respect of it being slow to start, with a sudden significant realization that entirely shifts the narrative flow, and the pace gets exponentially faster. Sunrider with some of its sci-fi aspects. eden* with its narrative premise. Having solid knowledge on all four of the games, I have come to realize that they are related in more ways than one, and the satisfaction of that realization is/was amazing. Like an \"Ah-hah\" moment. In no way am I saying they were intentionally related, I am just mentioning what I realized and became so gitty about.\n\nFurthermore, it stands the test of time. For being a VN from 2003, it's animations, character/background CGs, and audio are fairly impressive. And, for not being 4:3 aspect ratio, I salute this game. I'll admit that some of its soundtracks get kind of annoying and repetitive, but that was really no big downside. They were still enjoyable.\n\nTL;DR: Can't wait for Alternative!", "timestamp_created": 1492565904, "timestamp_updated": 1509729683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0,

Also, the Muv-Luv Extra is really ordinary and the setting is just too cliched (well, pretty reasonable considering about how old the game is).\n   For Unlimited, I would say it is much better (It is the main story after all), but it lacks the tension that the mecha themed VNs are supposed to have, [spoiler]for the entire game, the 207 squad never encoutered a single alien, and there is no actual combat in the battle field.

F\u00fcr alle, die neu in dem Genre sind: das hei\u00dft, es ist eine Geschichte, erz\u00e4hlt mit Untertiteln, mit bewegenden Bildern und leichten Animationen. Das Bild ist stetig im Wandel, somit kommt beim Lesen auch auf Dauer keine Langeweile auf. \nDie Sprache des Texts im Spiel ist Englisch, mit japanischer Synchronisation. Dies sollte man vorher beachten, um wirklich in den vollen Genuss des Spiels zu kommen. \n~\nMuv-Luv erz\u00e4hlt eine lustige, herzerw\u00e4rmende, traurige, spannende bis herzzerrei\u00dfende Geschichte, die als Teeniekom\u00f6die/Romanze anf\u00e4ngt und in einem apokalyptischen Drama endet, in der aber einfach die ganze Chemie stimmt, was nicht zuletzt wegen des massiven Genre-Wechsels einen riesen Spa\u00df macht. \nEs ist wirklich ein riesiges Paket. \nDieser Teil ist der erste und dauert in einem Durchgang in etwa 12-15 Stunden. Und es gibt noch ein paar alternative Enden, die man erreichen kann. Nach 2 spezifischen Enden schaltet man dann 1.5 frei - Unlimited - welches ungef\u00e4hr genau so lang und genau so viele verschiedene Enden bietet. \nIch werde nicht mehr verraten, denn Spoiler sind doof. Es lohnt sich aber zuzuschlagen, denn f\u00fcr Langzeitmotivation gesorgt, ist allemal.\n\nEs handelt sich hierbei um die PS3 Version des Visual Novels, welche stark geschnitten ist, sprich: keine Inhalte sind nicht jugendfrei. Allerdings ist ein gewisses Alter dennoch voraussetzbar, da das ganze nicht wie ein M\u00e4rchen endet, recht komplexe Themen und Gef\u00fchle anspricht und daher doch eher an Erwachsene oder \u00e4ltere Jugendliche gerichtet ist, um wirklich verstanden/genossen zu werden. Aber das ganze betrifft doch -eher- Alternative, den Nachfolger. Dieser Vorg\u00e4nger ist dagegen ein Hauch im Wind, auch wenn ich schon hier die eine oder andere Tr\u00e4ne vergie\u00dfen musste - aus verschiedenen Gr\u00fcnden - ich bin wohl auch einfach zu nahe am Wasser gebaut. :)\n\nDer Soundtrack (OST) stimmt immer passend mit dem Geschehen \u00fcberein und geht auch von Anfang an recht gut ins Ohr. Wem dieser nicht zusagt, oder wem einzelne Sprecher nicht zusagen, so kann man diese auch muten. \nDie japanischen Stimmen sind allerdings alle gut vertont. Hier waren nur Profis am Werk.\n\nIch habe dieses Franchise erst nach Beendigung des kickstarters entdeckt, zuerst in der inoffiziellen \u00dcbersetzung, welche nun komplett \u00fcberarbeitet wurde, und nun finde ich das Spiel unterhaltsamer als je zuvor. Wiederholungst\u00e4ter k\u00f6nnen hier also guten Gewissens zugreifen. \n\nFakten f\u00fcr Anime Fans:\n*Hajime Isayama holte sich bei Muv-Luv Inspiration f\u00fcr Attack on Titan\n*es gibt mehrere Manga, Light Novels (und mehr) und einige Anime, die im selben Universum spielen, letztere sind derzeit:\n- Schwarzesmarken (Spin-off, welches zu DDR Zeiten in Deutschland spielt) - VN \u00dcbersetzung geplant\n- Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse (Spin-off, spielt zur selben Zeit wie Muv-Luv Alternative) - VN \u00dcbersetzung geplant\n- Kimi ga Nozomu Eien / Die Ewigkeit, die du dir w\u00fcnschst (Pre-quel/spin-off; Drama/Romanze mit bekannten Gesichtern, wer Alternative schon kennt) - VN \u00dcbersetzung im Gange\n- Akane Maniax (Sequel zu KimiNozo; Prequel zu Muv-Luv; allerdings reine Comedy)\n- AyuMayu Gekijou (= Theater; Comedy, die man gro\u00dfteils erst versteht, wenn man das meiste, oder besser alle Eintr\u00e4ge, dieser Liste abgearbeitet hat.)\n\nEs sind noch mehr \u00dcbersetzungen von Spielen der Reihe geplant.

existence. They were not exaggerating. I have not read many visual novels but Muv Luv indeed feels like a one of a kind, unique in the way it approaches storytelling. \n\nJust having a good plot and cute girls will not automatically make the visual novel good. This visual novel uses large amounts of visual effects and sound effects (Despite being a visual novel) to bring life to the story. The viewer becomes immersed and engaged, as if you were inside the story feeling what the characters are feeling, seeing what the characters are seeing. \n\nThe Muv Luv story is told in 2 parts, which are all carefully planned and executed. The difference in the mood between the 1st, 2nd part of this game is substantial, to the point where you can question if it was even the same game. Note, the story is not complete without Muv Luv Alternative, a sequel to this game which is not on steam. You have to play that after this to know the magnificence of the triology. This game, though not giving a satifying conclusion to ther story is still amazing on its own.\n\nPeople going into this game expecting Mecha and a lot of action may be disappointed at the beginning with the seemingly ordinary high school setting in the beginning and even in the second part, but this may as well be treated as a prequel to Muv Luv Alternative where the Mecha action actually is. Those going into this expecting cute fluffy romance will find what they are looking for in the 1st part of Muv Luv, but the 2nd part will come as a shock. You will quickly realise that the 1st part is just there to make you lower your guard, to make you familiar with the main character\u2019s feelings and then when plot advancement occurs you will be just as shocked as the main character.\n\nIf you play Muv Luv Alternative after this game, by the end the of that game you will be blown away by how flawless it was executed, showing us subtle hints and carefully placed foreshadowing\u2019s in this game, which eventually lead to the build-up to the climax of the story and everything can be pieced together. \n\nMuv Luv can only be described as a piece of art.

Y'know the type, dense protag, school setting, a half-dozen classmates of various waifu archetypes (Childhood friend and Ojou-sama being the main two). At the end you pick one and get a happy ending and it's all good, right? Well, now you're attached to the characters. All told, I found it enjoyable which is more than I can say for most haremshit.\n\nThen you start Muv-Luv Unlimited. Aw yiss, my b-type otaku waifuge got a sequel, right?\n\nYou wake up in your bed. That's odd, usually one of the waifus wakes you up. Oh well, get dressed, grab your gameboy, go outside and there's the wreck of a giant robot lodged in your neighbor's house.\n\nChildhood Friend's house is in ruins. So is the entire town. Dead trees, broken buildings, derelict mecha. So you walk up the hill to school, and your school is now a UN Military Base. The gate guards arrest you.\n\nTurns out you're supposed to be one of the five billion or so casualties from the ongoing alien invasion that's turned most of Eurasia into a barren wasteland.\n\nMuv-Luv Unlimited is about another 15-20 hours, and that sets the stage for Muv-Luv Alternative. Suffice to say that Extra gives you something to protect, and Unlimited gives you something to avoid. Alternative is where shit goes from 'pretty gud' to 'god-tier game'.

This VN you are purchasing here however, is the first two stories, while Muv-Luv Alternative (the final story) is due sometime in the near future. What you get here is Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited. One is a highschool harem romance as it is advertised to be and one is...well a military academy romance.\n\nLet's start with Extra. It is cliche. It is a highschool romance by the book. The genre is generally very dull for me and while I enjoyed going through two routes, the other endings were a drag to go through. You have to start from the beginning for most of them. I skipped through most of the text I'd seen to speed this up because the writing isn't enjoyable to reread that many times. Basically, if you like highschool romance genre, shoot for it. You'll love it. I liked it, but I'm not over the moon for it.\n\nUnlimited follows up on Extra. Unlimited is why I'm recommending this and why I am in love with it. The story is well written and works a lot more on world building, which makes it feel a lot more effort was put into it. Characters have modest development and the romance feels....less forced? I mean it is forced still, but you aren't being beaten over the head with it. It comes at an enjoyable pace for someone like me who cringes at that type of trope. It kept you wondering what was going to happen next unlike Extra which was pretty easy to guess because it was so tropey. The ending of the story is your choice, but [spoiler] it ends on a cliffhanger regardless [/spoiler]. Having seen the endings, I can say that I am genuinely excited for the conclusion for the trilogy when I came into this VN based on recommendation alone. \n\nOverall, buy it for Unlimited is just my personal recommendation.

Muv-Luv consists of two VNs, Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv Unlimited. A third VN, not included, Muv-Luv Alternative is ranked by vndb.org users as the #1 VN of all time. Playing through Extra and Unlimited helps build up the characters for that title.\n\nBut on their own, I can really only give a mild recommendation to Muv-Luv Extra, the first half of this duo. It's a charming and funny story about a guy who wakes up with a strange girl in his bed who turns his world upside down. It's full of heart and zany antics and is an absolute delight whenever focusing on the two female protagonists and the love triangle that develops. I laughed out loud plenty.\n\nOn the downside it's kind of a standard wacky high school romance. And every side route is unbearably boring.\n\nUnlimited takes the great humor of Extra and mostly bins it. With the change to a more serious setting and circumstance, the majority of the zaniness and heart got left behind. What you're left with is a dull military school tale about some kids preparing to fight aliens you never get to see. And some romance thrown in at the last moment.

Comprendre que vous allez voir d\u00e9filer les images et les textes, sur fond musical, et tout \u00e7a va vous raconter une histoire, sur laquelle vous pouvez influer \u00e0 des points cl\u00e9 avec des choix multiples, ces choix vous amenant \u00e0 l'une des fins pr\u00e9vues par le script. Sur ce point Muv-Luv se caract\u00e9rise par une libert\u00e9 assez faible: peu de choix, et des scripts assez bateau. Il est facile de trouver son chemin et de tous les arpenter sans avoir un \"walkthrough\" \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de soi. Rien avoir avec la douloureuse complexit\u00e9 d'un \"Clannad\" par exemple. Mais si l'histoire et le graphisme sont bon cette simplicit\u00e9 n'est pas un probl\u00e8me.\n\nAlors parlons des graphismes. Ils sont bons... A part les personnages un peu caricaturaux et les coiffures extravagantes en mode XXL, mais on s'y fait assez vite. Le moteur est mis \u00e0 contribution pour donner l'illusion d'action de mani\u00e8re souvent habile en agitant et d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant les images des personnages sur les fonds. On sent que d'\u00e9pisode en \u00e9pisode la maitrise de l'outil progresse. Et la transcription vers l'occident a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus que soign\u00e9e, l'ergonomie repens\u00e9e et bien plus confortable. Techniquement du tout bon.\nLa musique? Excellente, particuli\u00e8rement adapt\u00e9e, jamais lassante.\n\nL'histoire? Non, pas l'histoire: LES histoires.\n\nMuv-Luv est en 3 parties: Muv-Luv Extra, Muv-Luv Unlimited, et Muv-Luv Alternative. Le produit qui est ici vendu rassemble les 2 premiers \u00e9pisodes: Extra et Unlimited.\n\nMuv-Luv Extra est un visual novel en milieu scolaire. Notre \"h\u00e9ro\" tout-ordinaire-et-facile-\u00e0-s'identifier se retrouve entour\u00e9 d'une cour de jeunes filles avec chacune une histoire personnelle plus ou moins perturb\u00e9e dans lequel il va falloir cheminer pour aller d\u00e9crocher le c\u0153ur de ces belles. Mots-cl\u00e9s schonen, harem, school-life, du classique. Le scenario est pas trop mal ficel\u00e9, mais disons-le clairement, c'est niais. Non, ne partez pas. C'est la porte d'entr\u00e9e de cet univers, avec des probl\u00e8mes d'ados qui font des montagnes. Vous allez vous d\u00e9mener pour r\u00e9gler ces probl\u00e8mes \"immenses\" et tout content passer \u00e0 la suite, baign\u00e9 de la fraicheur et de l'innocence qui transpirent de ce volume.\n\nMuv-Luv Unlimited vous fait changer de dimension, dans tous les sens du terme. L'auteur vous pousse sans m\u00e9nagement dans un univers si semblable, et en m\u00eame temps si diff\u00e9rent de celui de \"Extra\". Tout au long, vous vous d\u00e9battez pour ne pas sombrer et \u00e0 la fin, vous avez surnag\u00e9, plus ou moins... Plut\u00f4t moins... Plut\u00f4t pas... A la fin d'Unlimited vous avez tant bien que mal jou\u00e9 votre destin\u00e9e et trouv\u00e9 une issue la moins d\u00e9favorable possible... Pour qui s'est laiss\u00e9 embarquer la meilleure fin reste douloureuse, insatisfaisante. \n\nEt c'est l\u00e0 que vous serez une fois ce jeu fini. Vous aurez v\u00e9cu une aventure fraiche et na\u00efve, suivi d'une aventure bien plus sombre. Les probl\u00e8mes immenses du premier volume vous semblerons tellement relatifs \u00e0 l'issue du second.\n\nEt demain arrivera Muv-Luv Alternative.\nEt l\u00e0 c'est la claque. Le voyage dans l'univers d\u00e9fini par \"Unlimited\" recommence, et le h\u00e9ro ballot\u00e9 par le torrent des \u00e9v\u00e8nements dans \"Unlimited\" tente de reprendre la main sur son destin dans \"Alternative\". Et lorsque l'on veut aller de l'avant, on s'expose. Ca sera dur, noir, violent... Il devra affronter une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e autour de la survie avec ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences culturelles d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 paisible, na\u00efve et replette. Il devra s'interroger sur le sens de son action, et si la fin justifie les moyens. Il ira au fond du d\u00e9sespoir, subira de plein fouet le d\u00e9calage entre son v\u00e9cu et les probl\u00e8mes si importants dans le premier tome, si futiles dans ce dernier. C'est l\u00e0 que le visual novel deviens g\u00e9nial, capable de nous plonger dans la g\u00eane, le d\u00e9saroi, de celui qui reviens du front et trouve un monde futile au retour, de celui qui a de grandes aspirations mais doit faire du sale boulot pour atteindre des objectifs nobles. Mais nobles jusqu'ou? Sont ils vraiment nobles? Pas de bons, pas de m\u00e9chants dans ce roman, juste des gens qui tentent de faire ce qu'ils croient le mieux. Alors oui des pointes de na\u00efvet\u00e9, des d\u00e9tours naratifs pas forc\u00e9ment utiles, des longueurs surgissent ici et l\u00e0, mais \u00e7a reste du grandiose. Pas de quoi d\u00e9crocher un prix Goncourt, mais bien, bien au del\u00e0 de la plupart des visual novel.\n\nAlors oui, \"Extra\" est moyen, \"Unlimited\" pas mal, \"Alternative\" colossal... Mais non, il ne faut pas faire l'impasse.\n\nCommencer \"Alternative\" sans avoir lu \"Extra\" ni \"Unlimited\", c'est pr\u00e9tendre profiter d'un repas en ne mangeant que le dessert. Un bon d\u00e9ssert au bout d'un plantureux repas, c'est un met qu'on savoure. Si vous vous contentez du d\u00e9sert et sautez le repas \u00e7a aura la saveur du gateau du salon de th\u00e9: pas mauvais, mais sans perspective.\n\n\"Extra\" et \"Unlimited\" plantent le d\u00e9cors, vous familiarisent avec les personnages, et avec le monde difficile qui attends Takeru. En arrivant dans \"Alternative\" apr\u00e8s avoir lu les 2 autres vous saurez o\u00f9 vous \u00eates, qui vous entoure, et toute la profondeur du sc\u00e9nario se r\u00e9v\u00e8lera \u00e0 vous. Le gouffre qui s\u00e9pare Takeru de ses anciens amis vous montera toute son ab\u00eeme. L'effet de la claque sc\u00e9naristique sera d\u00e9cupl\u00e9, rien de moins.\n\nCe jeu comporte les 2 marches \u00e0 monter pour atteindre le Nirvana qu'est \"Alternative\". Ne restez pas au pied de l'escalier. Montez, un grand voyage vous attends.\n", "timestamp_created": 1480955279, "timestamp_updated": 1480955279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501360", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28185937": {"recommendationid": "28185937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100231324", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503112315}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u8981\u6536\u56de\u4ee5\u524d\u5bf9MUV E\u548cU\u4e0d\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5728\u6b64\u4e4b\u524d\u5148\u8ba9\u6211\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n ---- \u5f52\u529f\u4e8e\u5b83\u90a3\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u53f9\u7684\u5b89\u88c5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cMUV\u5728\u56fd\u5185\u975e\u5e38\u51b7\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662fgalgame\u7231\u597d\u8005\u90fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u77e5\u9053\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5076\u5c14\u542c\u8bf4\u4e5f\u5c31\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u51e0\u53e5\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff0c\u7528\u5f97\u6700\u591a\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u6279\u8bc4\u7a7a\u95f4\u6392\u540d\uff08\u5bf9\u6240\u6709galgame\u7684\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u6743\u5a01\u6027\uff09\uff0cMUV AL\u5e38\u5e74\u4fdd\u6301\u524d3\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8fd9\u662f\u5341\u51e0\u5e74\u524d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5c31\u77e5\u9053\u6709\u591a\u6050\u6016\u4e86\u3002\n\n ---- \u4e4b\u524d\u7531\u4e8e\u7535\u8111\u7cfb\u7edf\u548csteam\u6ca1\u4e2d\u6587\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u53ea\u73a9\u4e86AL\uff0c\u518d\u52a0\u4e0aE\u53ea\u8bb2\u4e86\u6821\u56ed\u751f\u6d3b\uff0cU\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u548cAL\u91cd\u5408\u4e86\uff0c\u6211\u5c31\u8bef\u4ee5\u4e3aE\u548cU\u53ea\u662f\u53ef\u6709\u53ef\u65e0\u7684\u3002\u8d76\u7d27\u6253\u6ce2\u81ea\u5df1\u8138\u3002\n \n ---- E\u7684\u786e\u53ea\u662f\u5e73\u6de1\u7684\u6821\u56ed\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u4e86AL\u4f60\u5c31\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e73\u6de1\u624d\u662f\u6700\u73cd\u8d35\u7684\u3002E\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u5176\u5b9e\u5982\u679c\u7ec6\u5fc3\u73a9\u8fd8\u662f\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u51e0\u5904\u91cd\u8981\u4f0f\u7b14\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u6ca1\u73a9AL\u662f\u4e0d\u61c2\u7684\u3002\u5355\u770bE\u7684\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u6b22\u4e50\u4e0e\u611f\u52a8\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\u7684\u3002\u81f3\u4e8eU\u5219\u662f\u4e0eAL\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u606f\u606f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e5f\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u90fd\u8bf4\u4e86\uff08\u5bb9\u6613\u5267\u900f\uff09\u3002\n\n\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u6253\u6298\u53ea\u970050\uff0c\u4e70\u5230\u7684\u662fE\u52a0U\u4e24\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1480864215, "timestamp_updated": 1503016978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28125905": {"recommendationid": "28125905", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998393582", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476407880}, "language": "english", "review": "Perverted Japanese rubbish.

Sprites move, turn around and have a lot of variety. The camera also moves around quite and bit and isn't static like in most other VNs.\n- No annoying moe characters who make stupid sounds and are generally annoying and useless. Even Tama can be quite savage when she wants to be. There is the maid trio but they get so little screen time that they can be easily ignored. Yes, I know Sumika can be pretty moe but she is straightforward and doesn't have an annoying squeky voice.\n- The music generally fits whatever is going on, and some tracks are quite memorable.\n- Has that old 90's anime feel to it.\n- Good comedy and character development.\n- Amazing attention to detail. Its the small things that make the world more realistic and believable.\n- Improved translation which makes the whole thing flow better and easier to read.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n- The art does hold up quite well when compared to other games released in the same timeframe, but it is still outdated by modern VN standards. Those giraffe necks are hard to unsee.\n- Some parts can drag and some routes are just plain boring(most notably Tama's)\n- The Lip-sync. This is an extra feature which they implemented only in the later all-ages version of the game and it shows. Its not very accurate and feels lazy compared to Alternative which had almost perfect lip-syncing. \n- The genre-shift of Unlimited is no secret at this point, but it feels like the store page gives away too much.

First part is a standard rom-com and the second part is a sci-fi / adventure / action / mess. The Muv-Luv series has a large following and fanbase but a lot of it has to do with Alternative, the sequel to Extra and Unlimited.\n\nThe story, as already mentioned, is in two parts. Muv-Luv extra is a school rom-com. It is also exactly what you expect from a school rom-com, nothing special, nothing amazing. Just pull a few heartstrings, have a few laughs and there you have a successful rom-com. Nothing wrong with that mind, but some people might find it a bit dull. Unlimited, the second part, is a sci-fi / action / adventure / mess. The story itself is a bit clich\u00e9 but again, and in my opinion, is not all that great. You spend most of the Unlimited story trying not to screw up your survival. The romantic routes barely differ from each other and it is very blunt about whose route you take.\n\nThe characters have very few unusual traits and are all terribly tropey. To drive a point home I will now state all of the main cast: the bland nice guy who all the ladies inexplicably fall for, the cute and dumb best friend, the bossy tsundere, the deredere, the one who doesn't speak much, the oblivious rich girl with no common sense, the mad scientist and the decent looking, kind teacher. It's like the guys who were looking for inspiriation played a game of darts with a trope stuck on both the triple score and single score areas, making it near impossible to make a non-tropey character and still win the darts match. I can't help but feel that despite the fact that they are likeable, they have very little depth.\n\nThe artwork, when looked at today, is ok. But you have to take into consideration that Muv-luv is over a decade old now, and when you notice that people still play it today without complaints about it, you realise that the artwork was pretty good. [i] Was [/i] good, but compared to some modern stuff, isn't actually that great but you can't expect it to be. So, fairly speaking, it has fared well. Another thing to state is that this is completely censored. I also couldn't care less about it and if you do, you can wait until later this month when the uncut patch is supposed to be released. The music, however, is nothing special. I could not pull any track out and call it great, but the soundtrack as a whole is not bad.\n\nSo in conclusion, the story of Extra is a standard school rom-com and you can expect exactly that out of it. You can expect it to pull a few heartstrings and to get a few laughs and all in all, have a good, dumb time. Unlimited, in my honest opinion was not great and while it too, does invoke some feels, it tends to drag on a bit. This is a critical part of the Muv-Luv series however and while it might not be everybody's cup of tea, if you intend to play Alternative you should play this. So if Alternative is what you are planning to play, you should start here. If you want to play a dumb rom-com VN then wait for it to go on to a good sale. If you want it uncensored, wait a few weeks (at time of edit, the patch has now been released). If you want to get into Muv-Luv I suggest you also wait for it to go on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1478188283, "timestamp_updated": 1480162066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26174585": {"recommendationid": "26174585", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998859782", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506549493}, "language": "english", "review": "Muvluv is definitely one of the best (once Muvluv :Alternative is made available) visual novel released in the past 5-10 years. \n\nStarts lighthearted and silly (Muvluv : Extra) , really gets serious and dark (Muvluv : Unlimited), you get both Extra and Unlimited as part of the first release, but its Muvluv : Alternative that really draws you in into a very adult story of politics,  intrigue, sci-fi survival and the human heart. \n\nI really should post screen shots here but without sound,  voice and animation, screenies can't do this #VisualNovel justice because especially when you finally get to Muvluv Alternative you will see details such as periodic puffs of breath (scene is outdoors early winter) that brings each scene to life. \n\nWhat really stands out is the story. \nEven little inconsequential things you thought as \"silly\"  in extra,  later builds onto Alternative's story as past events were referenced and is integral to tbe main characters's state of mind.", "timestamp_created": 1477189737, "timestamp_updated": 1477189737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26163472": {"recommendationid": "26163472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073841450", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487397445}, "language": "english", "review": "This is completely different from what I usually play.

As someone who had read Muvluv Extra, Muvluv Unlimited, and Muvluv Alternative, I can honestly say it was one of my favorite stories I've had the pleasure to read. These first two parts of the Muvluv trilogy, Extra and Unlimited, are essential to fully enjoy Alternative, the best part of Muvluv.\n\nExtra and Unlimited (the two parts included in this purchase) will probably range from good to mediocre depending on your tastes. The first two parts of the Muvluv trilogy are lighthearted and comical. However, even if your not a fan of Extra and Unlimited's more carefree tone, I highly reccomend you still read them. This is because of the final part, Alternative. \"But the first two parts of Muvluv take around 30-50 hours to read. Is it really worth slogging through them if I don't like it for Alternative?\" Yes...yes it is. \n\nMuvluv Alternative is a dark and grueling experience that many, including me, would say is a contender for the best Visual Novel ever made. Despite its cute appearance, Muvluv is not for the faint of heart. If you don't feel things by the end of Muvluv, either you weren't paying attention or you're a heartless alien uncapable of human emotion. To tell you anything else about Muvluv would just spoil the experience. \n\nAnyone who is a fan or visual novels or just dark, mature stories in general will love Alternative. Sadly, Alternative is not included in this purchase, so make sure to buy that too (when it is released on steam later this year).

For me if this game was only MLE I'd not buy it I admit but if you combine it with MLU and MLA it makes sense and enriches the other two stories. \n\nA porn game;\nThis was the other biggest complaint people seem to have. \nWhen it was released the ML series was classed as Eroge which is basicaly otaku for a VN with porno scenes in it. \nIf you look up at the screen shots you will see pictures of the 'flight' suits that are revealing for no other reason than fan service and people seem to blast that too. \nProblem is. Fan service will exist in most forms of anime/VN/LN its just a thing. \nWhy hate on a game's story simply because you see boobs? \nDo boobs ofend you? If it does why are you bothering with the review section? Its clear they are in the game. \nThe steam version is the all ages version so all sex scenes are removed but as a person who has read sex scenes I can tell you they were shoe horned into the game only to appeal to the pervy otakus back in 2001 when it was EXPECTED to have those types of scenes, Fate stay night another famous VN which has since had succsesful anime ALSO had these types of scenes. \nAs a side note for people who are waiting for the 18+ patch take my advice when I say the sex scenes are pretty bad and just put into it 'because' if you really want porn there are plenty of free sites I am sure you know about already. \nTLDR; The game is not about sex. It has sexual content with the 18+ patch that will come eventualy but its not worth caring about. People bashing the sexual content in this game are prudes. If you are prude avoid and gtfo. \n\nStory\nOf all things some sites bash the story. \nAs a person who has finished the series I will say that for me out of all the games I have played over the past 24 years (alot) and as a person who focuses on story driven games when Im going single player-\nThis is the best story of them all. \nIt has to be due to the games nature but this story is amazing. \nIt will make you FEEL something about what is going on. \nIf you have a soul you WILL cry at certain points. \nYou will think about it will you study or are at work, you won't be able to wait to know what happens next and after its all over and you clear MLA you will feel like you just walked through hell and came out alive with all the good and bad feelings to go with that. \nFor me story wise you would have to get into some serious novels to get anything better. \nI am talking about enjoyment factor and the idea of caring about what is going on in this game. \n\nIf you are a person who enjoys anime in general then you need to read this, it is your duty. \nIf you enjoy Sci Fi and are no put off by any of the other content you have seen so far then you have to read this. \nIf you enjoy a bit of romance in your action story then you have to read this. \nIf you are a weeb, i guess you have already read this and if not you are a slacker. \nIf you like mecha this shits on any other mecha story out there. \nIf you like reading and don't mind anime themed stuff then read this. \n\nIf you get offended at any of the screen shots I guess you have to pass but thats your issue really and its you who will miss out simply because you can't see past the cover. \n\n9999/10", "timestamp_created": 1474974640, "timestamp_updated": 1474974640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776841", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25669281": {"recommendationid": "25669281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007850719", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 4840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494681429}, "language": "english", "review": "An old classic that has finaly come to steam.

A visual novel is essentially a visual and audio interactive book. You read dialogues on static pictures while listening to the voices and music. From time to time you are offered with choices that could change the story. The gameplay is thus almost non-existent but that shouldn't stop from enjoying a visual novel if you can enjoy book.\n\nMuv Luv contains actually two stories. The first one, Muv Luv Extra is about the daily life and romance of Shirogane Takeru, a Japanese high school student. The second, Muv Luv Unlimited, is about military training in an apocalyptic future. I can\u2019t say anymore about that. Muv Luv Unlimited is closely linked with Muv Luv Extra so you absolutely have got to play Extra first.\n\nTo go into more details about Muv Luv Extra, there 6 girls you can date. Sumika, the childhood energetic girl, Meiya, the heir of one of the biggest company in the world, Tama, a friend that looks like a cat, Ayamine, the stoic girl and finally Sasaki, \u201ciinchou\u201d, the class president. All of them are very unique and enjoyable. Oh and yes, there is one more (or two) girls but...\n\nThe first story lasts about 20 hours. The second story also about 20 hours but then you can replay it by choosing another route (girl). Unfortunately the first half of the game will almost be the same. I only played Meiya and Sumika routes so I don\u2019t know about the others.\n\nNote that everyone is voiced in Japanese except Takeru, the main character. That is done deliberately to help you put you in the shoes of Takeru.  Feeling immersed in the Muv Luv is very important to enjoy it.\n\nAbout the H content, there should be a free 18+ patch available later.\n\n2. Evaluation\n\nGraphics : Muv Luv was released in 2006, 10 years ago. Because the graphics are anime-styled, it doesn\u2019t matter as much how old it is.The art style is different from most modern anime production ( less round, more straight) but I still think it is a plus. The interface looks and works very nicely. This is a huge improvement over the original game. They are a number of CGs but not that much compared to, say Fate Stay Night. Still, I think it is enough and moreover they are used effectively. Also because the sprites are well drawn, I would say the graphics are quite good for a visual novel. Rating : 4/5 . \n\nMusics : Like the graphics, I think they are very good and particularly fitting to each scene.  Nonetheless save for a few of them, they are not exceptionally good. Rating : \u2158\n\nGameplay : It\u2019s a visual novel. Rating : ../5\nStory : The story of Extra or Unlimited or even Alternative alone is not exceptional. However if you read Extra and Unlimited then it becomes great. If you add Alternative then it becomes exceptional. A masterpiece. That\u2019s the reason it is seen as one of the very visual novel ever. Nonetheless, make no mistake, Extra alone is at least good and likely very good! It\u2019s funny, light-hearted and touching. Rating of Extra and Unlimited: 4/5 if you don\u2019t read Alternative. 7/5 if you read the trilogy.\n\nValue for money : The price of Extra and Unlimited is about $28 and gives you more than 40 hours of content. A book costs about $6 and can be read in 5 hours if you\u2019re very fast.So you have the same content as a book of the same price. Except you have pictures. And musics. And choices. It should be clear that Muv Luv is very good value for money. Rating : 5/5.\n\nFinal evaluation : 4.5 /5 a very good game\n\n3. Recommendation\n\nIt should be clear that I strongly recommend it. However if you :\nDon\u2019t like reading\nDon\u2019t like comedy\nDon\u2019t like anime/manga (even so, maybe you could give it a try?)\n\nThen you should not buy it. In the other cases, buy it and enjoy it at your leisure! You will have to wait for the climax, Alternative which should be released in December, anyways. I recommend you to at least clear Extra once first, preferably Sumika or Meiya and then play Unlimited.\n", "timestamp_created": 1473277362, "timestamp_updated": 1473277362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.940886", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25337566": {"recommendationid": "25337566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045829395", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511700228}, "language": "english", "review": "[u]Extra[/u] (8/10)\nPros\n-Genuinely funny\n-Interesting characters\n-Engaging story in the second half\n-Unique routes\n-Replayability\n\nCons\n-1st half of the story overstays its welcome\n-fucking lacrosse\n\n[u]Unlimited[/u] (9/10)\n-Sets the atmosphere perfectly without giving too much away\n-Interesting characters\n-Very engaging story from the get go\n-New soundtrack that really sets the mood\n-Can send chills up your spine at times\n-Pressence of funny moments to lighten the sudden serious atmosphere\n\nCons\n-Limited replayability value compared to Extra due to little variation in dialouge and choices in  most cases\n\nOverall i gotta say i really enjoyed this compiliation of Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv unlimited.\n\nTips\n1-COMPLETE ALL ROUTES IN EXTRA FIRST THEN ENTER UNLIMITED FOR A NICE PAYOFF IN TERMS OF CHARACTERS\n2-Don't half ass read the dialouge in Extra as it forshadows a lot of things\n3-DON'T EVER go to the wikia to read about anything as spoilers can easily be revealed", "timestamp_created": 1472956083, "timestamp_updated": 1488367851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25304611": {"recommendationid": "25304611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102939917", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480088797}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e8c\u5237\u5b8c\u6bd5\u3002\u6253\u5b8cdies irae\u4e4b\u540e\u518d\u6765\u73a9\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u6709\u4e9b\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u7684\u65e5\u8bed\u4e5f\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u95ee\u9898\u4e86\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u80fd\u670999%\u770b\u61c2\u4e86\u5427\u3002\u5355\u770bextra\u8fd8\u662f\u592a\u65e0\u804a\u4e86\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4f5c\u4e3aalternative\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u65f6\u5019\u90fd\u5fcd\u4e0d\u4f4f\u5feb\u8fdb\u3002unlimited\u6700\u540e\u8fd8\u662f\u54ed\u5f97\u7a00\u91cc\u54d7\u5566\u7684\u3002\u4e00\u8fdb\u5165unlimited\u5c31\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765\u4e86\u3002\u5f88\u559c\u6b22\u7537\u4e3b\uff0c\u4ee3\u5165\u611f\u7206\u68da\uff0c\u4e09\u4ee3\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u80fd\u611f\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u5728\u548c\u7537\u4e3b\u4e00\u8d77\u6210\u957f~alternative\u5feb\u70b9\u6765\u554a~", "timestamp_created": 1472822998, "timestamp_updated": 1472822998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25292516": {"recommendationid": "25292516", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986087857", "num_games_owned": 568, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1514784312}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not even done with this visual novel yet, but I am hooked on it.

I'm not even finished with the it yet, but it's been so great so far that I had to write a review for it.

Story-wise there are some flaws as far as how characters are portrayed based on their past actions, but overall it didn't bother me all that much.  Unlimited does repeat a bit of Extra (Sakaki and Ayamine's conflict) but it happens quicker than in Extra and provides some significant insight into the back storys of the characters that will probably come up in Alternative.  \n\nOverall, Extra is a bit of stupid fun that characterizes Takeru and helps add more impact to the sudden change in Unlimited.  Some people will criticize Unlimited for some its story elements, but I find them negligible (I won't say what in order to avoid spoilers).  \n\nHere's some advice if you're still on the fence about buying Muv Luv: If you played Katawa Shojo and enjoyed it, then you'll like Muv Luv (probably a lot more).

If you aren''t a VN reader or regular anime watcher, you will not enjoy the original Muv Luv (eg RPS' review) if you read it first, so please go read Alternative first (or wait until Alternative is released), No you do not need to read Muv Luv first.\n\nThe VN gets better in the second half for both arcs (the MC is very intolerable the first halves).

Basically this is a rather long prolouge to Muv Luv Alternative, and it lays the groundwork for it. Overall this VN might feel a bit mediocre and chlich\u00e9d, but that is the way it is supposed to feel. Standalone Muv Luv might be a bit unfullfilling, but it was supposed to be released with Alternative which is basically the third part of the story, so think of it as Part 1 and 2 of a trilogy. It's also important to read EXTRA before UNLIMITED since EXTRA is basically the groundwork for the whole series.\n\nThe characters are quite stereotypical, exaggerated to make it as clich\u00e9 as possible. The humor is usually silly and filled with references to pre-2000 anime and gaming. The main character Takeru can be a bit annoying at times, but he is mostly quite likeable when it counts, he learns as story progresses and you can tell by the end how much he has changed. Most of the EXTRA ARC is based around mindless sillyness and High School shenanigans. The UNLIMITED arc on the other hand is where things go all Sci-fi on you and make it a tad more serious. Once you're done with this VN and get into the third and final arc ALTERNATIVE later this year, they you'll understand the fruits of this VN.\n\nAll in all this is like whatching a \"never ending\" episode of anime and not like a video game so bear that in mind, it all story and player interaction is kept to a minimun\n\nI highly recommend this VN series for those who like anime, scifi and robots.", "timestamp_created": 1470631451, "timestamp_updated": 1470631597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504950", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24753862": {"recommendationid": "24753862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198223328052", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506392742}, "language": "english", "review": "I use to play Visual Novel all the time and just got back into them after about 15 without playing them.\nAnd I got to say MUV-LUV is one of the best ones I've played to date... \n\nThis comes with 2 of the 3 games in this Visual Novel Trilogy.\n\"Extra\", \"Unlimited\" and with the 3rd part \"Alternative\" which will be sold separately.\n\n\"Extra\"\nIs your simple comedy high school romance.\nBut it's over the top characters, style and with it's deep plot points which can give you,\nmuch to read and and look forward to see what happens next.\nThere's\n7 Endings All Together\n5 Romance Characters\n\n\"Unlimited\"\nIs more a heavier story.

bias if only for the sake of justifying my puchase\n\nMuv-Luv is an interesting visual novel conceptually, a Sci-Fi trilogy that at the time of its original release was sold simply as a romantic comedy. This is a remake of sorts, it runs on a new engine, some voice work was redone, there's support for widescreen and the biggest change of all is the fact that the plot twist is now shown upfront most likely due to it being a fairly old title that has had plenty of time for said twist to be considered less integral.\nThis particular iteration consists of Extra and Unlimited, with the third part Alternatvie being a more linear experience but just as long if not longer than both previous parts combined. Extra is the first part, taking place in a traditional school setting. It's a romantic comedy wherein the protagonist, Shirogane Takeru must choose between five different girls, the main two love interests being Mitsurugi Meiya, the mysterious heir to a large financial conglomorate whom Takeru finds in his bed one fateful morning and Kagami Sumika, Takeru's long-time childhood friend who's beginning to desire their relationship to be something more. Your route in Extra is determined by various choices you make over the course of the game, one of the typical choices involving which girl's lunch you choose to eat. It's recommended that you go through the routes of both main heroines before entering Unlimited. \nUnlimited shifts both in tone and setting, while still retaining the root of Extra, it's much more serious in comparison taking place in an alternate world where Kagami Sumika doesn't exist and an alien threat referred to as the BETA have ravaged the world, leaving only one billion humans left on Earth. This part acts mainly as a setup to the world of Unlimited, Takeru's growth as a person and to show the differences between the worlds besides the painfully obvious. The routes in this part are much easier to get, as it's left down to about three divisive choices around the end, and five of the six possible character endings have both a Normal and Good variant. Unlimited primarily acts as build up to the finale, Alternative however it still acts self-contained as does Extra so you don't have to progress down the line if you don't want to. \nAll in all I'd recommend picking this up if you're a fan of VNs and mecha, it's not everyone's thing but is fairly unique in its concept and execution and I certainly enjoyed it more than I expected to.", "timestamp_created": 1470150178, "timestamp_updated": 1470150178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570560", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24646226": {"recommendationid": "24646226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111341605", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494475904}, "language": "english", "review": "Although everyone says Muv Luv Alternative is the best VN, Alternative is not the Trilogy, it is only a part.

Maybe it is only my illusion, and he is also like a islamic believer. And he himself obviously has a poor understanding of weaponry, with countless flaws in the settings. e.g, if his setting of the Luxcius duo oculus's interception rate is to be realized, it is my estimate that we must cut off 90% of the artillery force, because the  Luxcius duo oculus is actually a ludicrous interception device that can only aim at one target at each time, with a minimum charging time of 12 seconds, not to mention that it need to aim in advance. And the most ridiculous thing is that the Luxcius duo oculus, which requires a 12 second charging time only occupies 1% of the whole beta population, and the Magnus  Luxcius  nioculus ,which need 36 seconds to charge occupies another 1%. what's more, in order to pretend that he understands a lot, kiso likes to use all kinds of seemingly advanced nouns, without even understanding their true meanings.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say: don't go deep into the setting and background of the game if you don't have the capability, because this will only dismay yourself in the end.\n\u3000\u3000\u73a9\u7684\u662f\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adf\u6211\u82f1\u8bed\u6e23\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u4e3b\u8981\u60f3\u8bf4\u7684\u662f\u6b64\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u7f16\u5e74\u53f2\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u5267\u60c5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5c31\u5b8c\u5168\u662f\u51fa\u81ea\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u624b\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e24\u4eba\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u600e\u4e48\u4ea4\u6d41\u8fc7\u4e00\u822c\u3002\n\u3000\u3000\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u89c9\u5f97\u8001\u5409\u662f\u4e2a\u65e5\u672c\u53f3\u7ffc\u519b\u56fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u6211\u90fd\u89c9\u5f97\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6211\u9519\u4e86\uff0c\u4ed6\u66f4\u50cf\u662f\u4e2a\u7eff\u7eff\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4ed6\u672c\u4eba\u663e\u7136\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6b66\u5668\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u767e\u51fa\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u5706\u5176\u8bf4\uff08\u6bd4\u5982\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u5149\u7ebf\u79cd\u7684\u62e6\u622a\u7387\u6211\u4f30\u6478\u7740\u6211\u5f97\u628a\u6240\u6709\u70ae\u5175\u780d\u53bb90%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u90a3\u5c31\u662f\u4e2a\u53ea\u4f1a\u5355\u70b9\u800c\u4e14\u6700\u5c0f\u51b7\u5374\u65f6\u95f412\u79d2\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u524d\u7784\u548c\u52a0\u9ad8\u8f93\u51fa\u529b\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u7b11\u62e6\u622a\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u6700\u89c1\u9b3c\u7684\u662f12\u79d2\u51b7\u5374\u7684\u5149\u7ebf\u7ea7\u5360\u636e\u603b\u6570\u76841%\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u5916\u5360\u636e\u603b\u65701%\u7684\u91cd\u5149\u7ebf\u7ea7\u5219\u662f36\u79d2\u51b7\u5374\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u88c5\u903c\u559c\u6b22\u5f3a\u626f\u5404\u79cd\u540d\u8bcd\uff0c\u504f\u504f\u81ea\u5df1\u4ec0\u4e48\u90fd\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u8bf4\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u6700\u7ec8\u603b\u7ed3\u4e0b\u6765\u4e5f\u5c31\u4e24\u4e2a\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e00\uff1a\u6e38\u620f\u80cc\u666f\u4e0d\u8981\u6df1\u7a76\uff0c\u4e8c\uff1a\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0d\u8981\u6df1\u7a76\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u8bf4\u538b\u6839\u4e0d\u8981\u53bb\u63a2\u7a76\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u90a3\u662f\u5bf9\u81ea\u5df1\u667a\u5546\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fae\u8fb1.", "timestamp_created": 1469781470, "timestamp_updated": 1469801702, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.431196", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24590753": {"recommendationid": "24590753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016877858", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507455436}, "language": "english", "review": "One of, if not the, best Visual Novel Trilogies to ever be released.

True to the conventions of the harem genre, a clueless and insensitive male protagonist finds himself surrounded by five young women who pine over him in spite of his complete obliviousness to their thinly veiled romantic advances. Aside from a few amusing moments that arise from the absurdity of the situations therein, the most polite way to describe [i]Extra[/i] would be that it is forgettable. One of its most egregious issues lies in the overlong, circuitous writing style on display in particular sections, where the story grinds to a halt in service of back and forth exchanges that have no significant impact on the narrative. This could have been greatly improved by simply removing \u201cproblem\u201d scenes or dialogue sections wholesale. All that being said, you\u2019d be doing yourself a huge disservice by skipping directly to [i]Muv-Luv Unlimited[/i] without at least playing through Sumika and Meiya\u2019s routes (more on this in a moment).\n\nIn spite of [i]Muv-Luv Extra[/i]\u2019s failings, however, [i]Muv-Luv[/i] it more than makes up for most of them in its direct sequel, [i]Muv-Luv Unlimited[/i]. Without giving too much away, [i]Muv-Luv Unlimited[/i]\u2014and its sequel, [i]Muv-Luv Alternative[/i] (not yet released as of this writing)\u2014are extremely different in genre, tone, and overall themes to their predecessor, [i]Muv-Luv Extra[/i].* This shift is crucial to understanding how [i]Unlimited[/i] succeeds in many areas where [i]Extra[/i] fell short. Its greatest triumph arguably lies in the way it recontextualizes everything the reader knows about [i]Extra[/i]\u2019s world, while anchoring it to the characterization of its female leads in ways that are by turns expected and surprising. Now, you may be wondering: if [i]Unlimited[/i] is so much better than its predecessor, why bother with [i]Extra[/i] at all? The answer is simple: you'll miss out on valuable plot and character information if you decide to skip it; I strongly recommend reading through at least Sumika and Meiya\u2019s routes in [i]Extra[/i] before diving into [i]Unlimited[/i].\n\nUnfortunately, however, some serious issues from [i]Extra[/i] persist, including its heavy-handed harem antics and thoroughly unlikable protagonist. While not quite as pronounced as they were in [i]Extra[/i], they nonetheless detract from [i]Unlimited[/i]'s much more interesting story (the same holds true for its sequel, [i]Alternative[/i]).\n\nIf you have the patience for a slow-burn story with a great payoff and are willing to forgive [i]Muv-Luv's[/i] overbearing genre idiosyncrasies, I would strongly recommend [i]Muv-Luv[/i]. Don\u2019t make the mistake of skipping [i]Extra[/i], though; it will pay dividends if you stick with it, greatly enriching your understanding of [i]Unlimited[/i]\u2019s characters.\n\n*MAJOR SPOILER: \n\n[spoiler]Transitioning from an insipid slice of life drama to a military sci-fi epic--albeit one that can't quite shake its irritating harem genre trappings (more on this later in the review).[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1469769568, "timestamp_updated": 1491333504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24588644": {"recommendationid": "24588644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023688774", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499182709}, "language": "english", "review": "Prequel to one of the greatest visual novels you'll find.

The two games out right now are Extra and Unlimited. The order of the series is Extra -> Unlimited -> Alternative, and it is highly recommended you play them in order. I jumped into these games without knowing much of anything about then because I heard a lot critical acclaim for the series, and I don't regret my decision.\n\nExtra is considered the least intriguing of the group, and I would have to agree. It\u2019s a fairly time SOL game. The kind where the extremely average, nearly faceless lead character somehow amasses a handful of girls who are eager to aim right for his groin with the precious of a heat-seeking missiles. It features a lot of slapstick comedy (most of it based on tried-and-true genre clich\u00e9s, some of it actually funny). It took me a while to warm up since it wasn\u2019t all that interesting (no overarching plot), but in the end I enjoyed the characters and the various scenarios their personalities brought about.\nUnlimited is where the series starts to reveal its true colors. Starting a short while before the conclusion of Extra, Takeru awakes in his bed one morning to find the world outside a devastated wreck. Although he initially believes it to be a dream, he is soon confronted with the fact that he has somehow ended up in a parallel world where humanity has been at war with aliens since the 60s. Seeing the ways in which the world and the characters that had become so familiar during Extra have diverged due to this new history is one of my favorite things about Unlimited. \n\nThe game comes with the option to play either entry whenever, although again if you're a newcomer you'll want to go in order. There are a ton of save spots, always nice when a game features a lot of choices, and I like that the game instantly resumes from where ever I felt off when I reopen it. That a pretty neat feature I've never come across before.\n\nThe spritework is interesting as well. Characters move into the foreground and background accordingly, providing some depth and additional animation to scenes. There aren\u2019t a ton of CGs, and some see a fair amount of re-use. Some silly scenes see the inclusion of chibi drawings that look like they\u2019re drawn with crayon. I have noticed sometimes the characters seem to lag or freeze when they\u2019re in the middle of changing poses or facial expressions, and while it doesn\u2019t happen often it is noticeable.  \n\nThe music is alright. To be honest, while I realize music can add a lot of emotional impact I generally don\u2019t ding games much on that area unless a significant portion of the soundtrack is actually bad. For the most part the music is certainly\u2026 there, some of it is even a little catchy, and the tracks chosen match up with the flavor of the scenes they play in, but at this point I haven\u2019t heard anything that blew my socks off. \n\nThe series does have a large amount of time investment, and while I wasn\u2019t entirely sold during the first few hours with Extra I can now see places where the hinted at the series\u2019 true nature. I grew to really enjoy the characters, and so far Unlimited has me enthralled. \nI'll update this review with more thoughts as I finish the games.

The main character Shirogane Takeru tries to gain affection from a variety heroines to unlock each heroine\u2019s respective ending while comedy ensues. However, events take a much darker turn during Unlimited and Alternative where the peaceful lives of everyone turns into a bloodbath and fight for survival. \n\nThe Muv-Luv franchise gets the majority of its praise from Alternative which is considered a masterpiece from several people among the anime community (myself included). The unfortunate part is that, except for being a slightly above average romcom Extra doesn't have much depth and just can't compare to its sequel (Alternative); however, it still plays a vital part in building the foundation of the Muv-Luv franchise and thus shouldn\u2019t be skipped.\n I do however recommend to rather wait for Muv-Luv Alternative to release before playing Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited.\n \n\nStory: \n__________\nIf I were asked to describe the story of the Muv-Luv franchise in one sentence, it would be the following: \n\u201cThe Muv-Luv franchise tells the story of Shirogane Takeru and his quest to find meaning to his existence and the role he can play in shaping everyone's lives around him.\u201d This holds true to all 3 parts in the Muv-Luv franchise, albeit in vastly different ways. \nDuring the first part Muv-Luv is a casual romcom and Takeru has to solve the problems from each heroine in Muv-Luv while also romancing them to unlock each heroine\u2019s ending. \nDuring Unlimited and Alternative Takeru finds himself in an alternative timeline from his own. Instead of facing trivial problems like training for a lacrosse match from his initial timeline he is caught up in a war with aliens called BETA to determine the fate of humanity. It tells the epic story of how Takeru faces hardships and how he tries to overcome each obstacle that is thrown his way, while still maintaining his sanity. \n\nCharacters: \n__________ \nQ: What defines a perfect character? \nA: An imperfect character. \nMuv-Luv contains a large cast of characters who all get a fair amount of screen time, however the one similarity all of them share is the fact that none of them are perfect. \nDuring Muv-Luv Extra the opinion you will initially have regarding the characters will be that most of them are without any glaringly obvious flaws and that they are perfect. As you continue with Unlimited and Alternative these specific characters that you might have idolized will crush your expectations of them when you realize that they are also merely \u201chuman\u201d and that they can also only deal with so much before finally breaking. \nThe whole cast of Muv-Luv remind me of a form of art called Kintsugi. Kintsugi (\u91d1\u7d99\u304e) means \u201cto repair with gold\u201d. It is the process in which a broken pot or bowl would be pieced together with gold or silver to form something stronger and more beautiful than before it was broken. Each character in Muv-Luv has flaws, but it\u2019s these flaws along with their progression and growth that make them unique and makes you feel attachment towards them. \n\nGameplay:\n__________\nMuv-Luv is a Visual Novel and as the word suggests it is a novel with visuals and sounds. It doesn\u2019t contain any gameplay elements and the only real interaction between the reader and the game is making choices during dialogue and seeing the outcome of said choices. \nIf you are looking for a game with gameplay, then skip this it\u2019s probably not for you. However, if you don\u2019t mind treating it as a book with sound and visuals then you might find yourself pleasantly surprised. \n\n\nSound & Art:\n __________\nSeeing as Muv-Luv is a Visual Novel the sound and art play a great role in influencing how the reader perceives the characters as well as the world itself. \nMuv-Luv\u2019s graphics, sprites and CG no longer hold up to more modern Visual Novels; however, they fulfill the task that they set out to do which is delivering an immersive experience. \nMuv-Luv has excellent music, sound and voice acting and despite it being almost 3 years since I originally read Muv-Luv (Fan translation) I still remember what each character sounds like as well as most songs from the soundtrack.\n\nOverall thoughts:\n ___________ \nMuv-Luv is a visual novel and should be treated as such. It contains virtually no gameplay elements. The story of Muv-Luv Extra starts slow and quite generic; however, after you reach Unlimited it becomes a lot more interesting and the overall pace of the Visual Novel picks up and continues to do so until it finally reaches its climax delivering a truly epic experience. \n\nWho is it for? \n__________\nPatient people who want to read an exceptional story, and are willing to sit through a few hours of mediocrity to achieve it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1469743779, "timestamp_updated": 1469743779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24579797": {"recommendationid": "24579797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054051486", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469716846}, "language": "english", "review": "I just started reading so I cant say much about the story and all that.

While it is not a requirement I would recommend watching the Kiminozo anime before playing Muv-Luv Extra.

Dialgue flows much better and many of the characters' personality that were less compelling when originally reading the visual novel due to the difficulty in conveying their sense of humor/intention with the fan translation are all much better, to the point that first-time readers are much more likely to enjoy the experience of reading all of the routes in Extra as opposed to just Sumika and Meiya (the two main heroines) routes like how most read it originally.

Text size is larger than the original Japanese text. The interface is skinned using extremely large text to fill up the giant buttons on the menu. There is even an advanced interface to decide how many cores the game should use (why a simple VN should need more than 1 core is beyond me)\n\nIf I were to mark down for something, it'll have to be the fact that the text in the game is now center aligned. Because as a reader, you can't tell where the start of the line will appear when you ask for the next line, your reading speed will drop. This is not a problem with the original JP version which is left aligned, so I'm very confused about the change.\n\nAll in all, Degica did try their best to make what they could of an outdated engine.

I was already fond of the original trilogy's release in its full glory, so my inmediate opinion would have been biased. Instead I opted for having someone else play it as I watched, getting their feedback as a fresh starter and comparing it to my  own memories. \n\nNot 100% of the translation agrees with me based on word choice, but it seemed to resonate with the test player; fortunately core concepts remain.\n\nThe characters managed to retain their \"charm\". By a twist of fate, their opinions of them aligned with my old. Specific ones were praised, others hated, a few cringed at. They went in no spoilers and enjoyed Extra with no problem, which I feel is needed to mention as there is a general hate for that part from some in the community. I personally find it charming in a (what now is) retro-anime way.\n\nThe story requires a definite suspension of disbelief for starters. In both parts there is a degree of setup before growing into their tone. Are they prefect? no. There is some wishy washy instances between well paced tense or endearing setups, some more prominent per route. Here is where lies the flaw of jumping into Unlimited. Character aspects and revelations are thrown in with varying level of assumption that you might be familiar or at least clued into them already.\nIf anything, this is where I would focus my dissapointment. Between characters and their stories there is an inconsistency in strenght of narrative. It is a normal ocurrence in multi-route VNs but when you have some character designed like Tama and you are supposed to take her seriously, it felt just impossible whenever she was involved; the fact was even made worse in the 2nd half.\n\nWhile still holding onto the ideal of not spoiling the trek, this is an alright intro to the series. Many emotions were personaly felt, but just as many I could see reversed on others, or even just taken from an alternate perspective. That may in fact be its greatest strenght, that there is something for many a player here, not everyone but many.\n\nNotes: \n- I believe the original release required you to beat Meiya's and Sumika's routes in EXTRA before unlocking Unlimited. That is still recomended. Even if not your primary choices.\n- This still remains an excellent prologue for what is/will be Alternative.\n- After all these years, and even by the test player's words \"Can we just get rid of that trio?\"(players will know who)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1469668464, "timestamp_updated": 1469668464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24563651": {"recommendationid": "24563651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055163322", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493828496}, "language": "french", "review": "Le d\u00e9but de l'Histoire!!!", "timestamp_created": 1469655608, "timestamp_updated": 1469655608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24560882": {"recommendationid": "24560882", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962484686", "num_games_owned": 726, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 3621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1514494382}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey everyone, just 100% finished Muv-Luv a little earlier so I'll give my not-so-quick advice [spoiler]that nobody asked for[/spoiler] while it's hot!\n\nI'll avoid spoilers, Muv-Luv being a really, really nice piece of story/Visual Novel.\n[u]WARNING:[/u] avoid searching too much information about Muv-Luv to not spoiler yourself!\n\n\n[h1]The Muv-Luv trilogy, a crescendo[/h1]\n\nFinally, here it is: the official English edition of Muv-Luv! [b]At the moment the first two parts are out: Extra and Unlimited, they form Muv-Luv[/b]. The third part, [b]Alternative, will come out during Winter 2016.[/b]\n\nThese three volumes can be compared to a crescendo, let's see why:\n\n[list][*]Extra comes first, it can be seen as the seeds of the general story: you are a student passionate about mecha video-games. The plot is a school romance where you get closer to the characters around you while learning more of their backstory. It has some humor among good references from other VNs/medias (Akane and Takahashi, yep - looking at you).\n\nYou will find your [i]classic[/i] heroines: [spoiler]the childhood friend, the rich one who comes from nowhere, the class rep., the sportive, the asocial[/spoiler]...\n\nAs you could figure when you read the game description and looked at the artworks, you will have two main routes and more others for each characters.\n\n[*]The second part, Unlimited, can be seen as the moment where things begin to get real.\nYou wake up in your room to realize the world has changed. Unlimited is more about action, war, cohesion and [spoiler]of course mechas[/spoiler]!\n\n[*]To finish, Alternative will be the climax, loud, simple as that. It follows the events of Unlimited. I don't want and cannot spill the beans but hell, the ride will be tough there.[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Tip for you to enjoy Muv-Luv as it should be & some personal babbling[/h1]\n\nDon't skip Extra or even Unlimited when Alternative will be out, or do at least the main routes!\nYou will enjoy a lot more the 2nd and cumulatively the 3rd part being closer to the characters, with their backstories and memories. Trust everyone who said so. That's how it is designed, you won't regret it.\n\nI discovered Muv-Luv with Alternative back in 2013 on some board but never took the time to launch it.\nI'm glad I did not because it would have been a waste to read it without knowing Extra & Unlimited.\n\nI can say that because Alternative have some very emotional [spoiler]and strong[/spoiler] moments. Sadly, I was spoiled on some of those back in 2013... thankfully, I don't remember which characters were involved! I've been very lucky but [u]please, for your own sake, do not search too deeply about Muv-Luv to avoid spoilers!![/u]\n\n\n[h1]More generally[/h1]\n\n[list][*]The voices are very good and recorded in binaural for better immersion.\n[*]Soundtrack is polished with a lot of tracks. OP/ED are catchy, so are the themes. Soundtrack DLC, when?\n[*]The hand-drawn visuals are still good even if the original release was in 2003 - you even got some animated sequences!\n[*]Long story, faaaaar better that the majority of VNs out on Steam! It took me [spoiler].....56+.....[/spoiler] hours to complete every routes.\n[*]It's an All Ages version. If you cannot enjoy a VN without H-scenes, the free R-18 patch will come out soon (in a few months, correct me if I'm wrong).[/list]\n\nWhen I heard about their Kickstarter for an official English release, I took the good opportunity to get all Muv-Luv on PC and PS Vita.\nI must say I am not disappointed at all... [b]good job to everyone behind Muv-Luv[/b]...\nCan't wait for Alternative, I know it will impact me like few VNs did...\n\n\n[h1]To conclude[/h1]\n\n[i]If you are into VNs,\nif you are a bookworm,\nif you like romance, science-fiction, mechas, war setting,\nif you want a real story which at first looks funny but gets darker and darker,\nif you like toying with your feels,\nif you have nerves of steel,\n\n\nif you want to save the world,\nsave in the name of true love,[/i]\n\n\nPUT ON YOUR SUIT AND JUMP IN YOUR MECHA AT ONCE, SOLDIER.\n\n[b]RECOMMENDED.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1469644988, "timestamp_updated": 1469729111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24559527": {"recommendationid": "24559527", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999894104", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469549033}, "language": "english", "review": "I regret starting this series.

Each of the routes carries its own weight and fleshes out the characters that much further. You won't finish a route and wonder why you wasted your time on it.  Everything has its purpose here, from tiny, subtle character interactions to big plot twists and developments.  \n\nThen you hit part 2, Unlimited (also included here), and the game changes.  \nI don't mean that literally, it's still a VN.  But it's like night and day.   The series shows its true colors, and you are presented with sci-fi so good it sucks you in and leaves you wondering when the hell we'll get Alternative.\n\nFinal Thoughts:  If you're familiar with VNs, grab this one. Play Extra first, don't just cheat right into Unlimited. \nIf you're not, this is the best place to start experiencing them.  It's one of the best VNs available and is something you'll want to read again. \n  \n\"Achieve your mission with all your might! / Despair not until your last breath! / Make your death count!\" -Creed of the Valkyries, UN Special Task Force A-01, 9th Squadron", "timestamp_created": 1469447591, "timestamp_updated": 1469447591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24514872": {"recommendationid": "24514872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050537057", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509145617}, "language": "english", "review": "It is incredibly difficult to explain what makes Muv-Luv as good as it is without at least partially ruining one of the major events within this game. So difficult, in fact, that the marketing blurb on this very steam page 13 years after the Japanese release (yes, this game is 13 years old) does just that. I will try to give my thoughts without revealing anything the store page has not already, but with that said *POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD*\n\n\n[u] 1. Thoughts on the game as a whole:\t[/u]\n\n\nAt first, you may think this game another typical dating sim-esque visual novel, in the vein of games such as NEKOPARA which have appeared on Steam in the last couple of years. You could be forgiven, as you wouldn't be [i] entirely [/i]wrong. This title is split into 2 parts; a light-hearted and cliche slice of life comedy (Dubbed 'EXTRA'), and a significantly more serious, alternate universe affair that parallels the first half of the title (Unlimited). Curiously enough, the developers of this localisation have decided to allow both routes to be immediately playable upon launching the game, though I cannot stress enough the importance to play this game in the correct order. The contrast, foreshadowing and tonal shift are all essential elements which elevate this game, particularly the first section, to something greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe general consensus among fans of the franchise is that the first portion of this game, EXTRA, is something worth slogging through in order to reach Unlimited and the (as of yet unreleased on steam) sequel, Alternative. While I cannot deny that the latter 2 games are definitely the meat and potato of the series, with Alternative in particular considered by many to be the greatest visual novel of all time, I have to confess that personally I find EXTRA to be legitimately enjoyable. While it is nothing special on its own by any standards, it is a genuinely funny, short and sweet experience with very likable characters that manages to never take itself too seriously. I would happily give it an 8/10 on its own merits.\n\nUnlimited, on the other hand, is undoubtedly the highlight of this game. Introducing the world and story that will carry over into the sequel, Alternative, the game begins to show its true colours, and is a tense, sobering sucker punch of a follow-up act to EXTRA. At this point, the series really does become one of the all-time greats of the mecha genre.This chapter of the game, paired with Alternative, is what I consider to be quite honestly one of the best works of science fiction ever made. If EXTRA is an 8/10, then Unlimited is quite easily a 9/10.\n\n\n[u] 2. Thoughs on the localisation: [/u]\n\nAs a reader of the original release and a backer of the Kickstarter that accompanied this steam version, I can say that Degica have mostly done a fantastic job and porting this game on to Steam. They listened to the fans when it came to features we wanted to see implemented, and the game has released in a very polished state. Particularly, the ability to switch between English and Japanese text on the fly is a fantastic feature. The official translation reads very smoothly, and is less overly literal than the fan translation sometimes had a habit of being. The dialogue does at times feel almost [i] too [/i] colloquial however, with mannerisms feeling a little too '2016 America' for their own good. This is clearly an intentional decision by the translation team, however, and is really just a matter of personal taste.\n\nSome people also seem to be unhappy with the presence of censoring in this title when compared to the original release, particularly with regards to the 'adult content'. These scenes were few and far between in the original release anyway, and in my opinion took more away from the game than it added. There is supposed to be a patch eventually from the developer's website to rectify this regardless, if that's your cup of tea.\n\n            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           \n\nOverall, if you have an even a fleeting interest in the concept of this visual novel, I cannot recommend it enough, and the sequel alone makes this game an absolute must-buy.", "timestamp_created": 1469436817, "timestamp_updated": 1469438016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24514498": {"recommendationid": "24514498", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997900072", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506388994}, "language": "english", "review": "Dont let the fact it start with school like fantasy give you a bad impression, extra is the origin of your character, Unlimited is when your character get torn from that reality into the end of the world, Alternative is the combenation of both with incredibly well written story and emotional impact, with alot of throwback to the first 2 games, its important to note that you must play the first 2 games befor playing alternative, otherwise you'll be out of the loop with all the refferances and memories tied to the first 2 games.\n\nmuv-luv extra, 7/10.\nmuv-luv unlimited, 8/10.\nmuv-luv alternative 15/10.", "timestamp_created": 1469434963, "timestamp_updated": 1469434963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24506201": {"recommendationid": "24506201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043959548", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486070846}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best VN's ever, hands down.", "timestamp_created": 1469391477, "timestamp_updated": 1469391477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24496460": {"recommendationid": "24496460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010763019", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486997649}, "language": "english", "review": "The game trilogy that ruined my life.\nI have spent more on Muv-Luv merchandise than I did on my car.", "timestamp_created": 1469355968, "timestamp_updated": 1469355968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "4.998001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24493741": {"recommendationid": "24493741", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993667959", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 157, "last_played": 1514760774}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay,  First off,  I only found out about this series after watching the Eclipse Anime , and I gotta say the world and story had me hooked *mecha fan here*  So I was curious of the well Origin of the univers and then Boom comes this soooooo I figure Worth a look and at firs tI am like how does this tie into the ANime then After readign I see the connections and am like.... okay  thats pretty inventive for a 13 year old story.

The conclusion will come out later this year (Alternative). Let's start by introducing the story.\n\nEXTRA\n\nThis is the part that you'll want to play first (this version allows you to go straight for Unlimited, which you should NOT do). It's a generic slice-of-life rom-com in a highschool setting, and it features Takeru, your run-of-the-mill carefree protagonist who's surrounded by cute girls but is totally unaware of their feelings for him. Takeru wakes up one day to find a mysterious girl sleeping in his bed. His childhood friend, Sumika, who comes wake him up every morning and has a crush on him, is not very happy about that. Shenanigans ensue. In order to ensure the best possible experience, you should at least read Sumika's and Meiya's routes, but I'd still recommend going for all of them.\n\nUNLIMITED\n\nPLOT TWIST! Takeru wakes up one day and finds out that the whole city around him is in ruins. Not only that, it seems that a huge mecha has crashed into Sumika's house! Understandably confused, he starts walking around town towards his highschool, which is now... a military base, for some reason. It soon becomes clear that our hero has stepped into an alternate dimension where humanity is on the brink of extinction after decades of war against a seemingly undefeatable race of aliens, the BETA. How did he end up there? Will he ever be able to go back to his own world? Or will he stay and help humanity's struggle for survival?\n\nI really need to make this clear: Muv-Luv is nothing special by itself. It's not supposed to be played by itself. It's not self-sufficient at all. If you buy this, then you'd better be ready to buy Alternative in a few months, otherwise don't even bother. I promise it will be worth it. This trilogy has a pretty high barrier of entry, you'll need to invest at least 50-60 hours in it before it really gets good (most likely more than that), but the payoff will be immense. MLA will take you on one of the wildest rides you've ever experienced, but it wouldn't be even half as good without Extra/Unlimited. So yeah, don't expect this game to be good on its own, it's not, it was never meant to.\n\nNow, to be fair there are some differences from the original version that I feel I have to point out. First of all, the default resolution is 1024x600 instead of 800x600, which means that most CGs had to be cropped. I wasn't particularly bothered by this, but others might be. Secondly, a couple tracks from the soundtrack had to be replaced because of licensing problems. I don't particularly mind about the one in Unlimited (I don't even know what it's called), but I really miss the other one (Warudakumi, a.k.a. the \"Livin la Vida Loca ripoff\"). That was one of the best things in this game, and I'm completely serious here. The new translation is pretty good, some might dislike it for not being 100% faithful but I don't really care, I personally think that a good translation should read well in the target language, and this one certainly does. I would have done without the Linkin Park reference though.\n\nSo, to sum things up: this VN is not for everyone. If you don't intend to read this trilogy \"seriously\" (if that makes sense), don't bother, you'll just waste time and energy.

Une sorte de parodie dop\u00e9e aux hormones qui ne recule devant rien pour s'assurer de divertir et faire rire mais qui au final ne semble que grotesque et forc\u00e9e. La pr\u00e9sence de longs passages de remplissage (l'arc du Lacross va vous pousser au bord du suicide par ennuie) n'aide pas non plus.\nPas qu'Extra soit compl\u00e8tement rat\u00e9, il en a m\u00eame de tr\u00e8s bons qui sonnent justes et certains lecteurs l'appr\u00e9cieront m\u00eame pour ce qu'il est, mais difficile de s'en satisfaire tant son histoire semble partir constamment dans tous les sens. Son vrai m\u00e9rite est d'introduire les personnages dans un contexte \"normal\" (aussi normal que puisse \u00eatre le monde de Muv-Luv Extra).\n\nAvec Unlimited l'histoire subit un changement dramatique de ton et de contexte. Le r\u00e9cit devient plus s\u00e9rieux, malgr\u00e9 des passages comiques bien plus maitris\u00e9s ici et l\u00e0, et des enjeux concrets apparaissent.

My friend half 'forced' me to read it and tell me at least finish that two routes. Not to mention bug in Sumika's route (fan TL). At that time I need about 2 months to finish Extra because I didn't really interested in this VN.

I actually think that it is really clever to have the first part of the Muv Luv trilogy be a romantic comedy type of story.

By Now you've seen all the reviews from all the people who have played it before. Every single one basically has the same message, put out in different terms. But you're there wondering, okay, I'm a noob, I don't know VN, or any of this stuff, and I've never played Muv-Luv. Where's my voice so I can make an educated decision?\n\nI'm that voice.\n\nHeads up, I've been aware of VN's but never been able to get them or figure any way of making them work, so the closest I've gotten to this kind of game is my love for anime/manga/manhwa. That, and reading some reviews and getting the genre shift spoiled for me is as far as I had knowledge wise heading in.\n\nFirst thing's first. I loved Muv-Luv Extra. I loved the characters. The humor made me laugh. I enjoyed the world. I enjoyed the different routes I played. I enjoyed the harem aspect. I enjoyed working to find one route/girl to pick and seeing where it went. I enjoyed the cartoons/journal drawings. I think Meiya is best girl, but ayamine is most interesting. I liked the mutual violence between Sumika and the MC. I was happy playing that game. I do not agree with other's who say that that Extra is trash. Even without playing Alternative, maybe because I haven't played a thousand other games just like Extra, I had a blast. Do I believe Alternative is the best ever, and ties in and builds up the other two? A hundred thousand times yes. I was looking for forshadowing but couldn't really find or feel any, so if they are as intertwined as promised my mind is really blown.\n\nWhy am I so confident that Alternative is everything they are promising us it is?\n\nUnlimited is Fucking awesome. If Extra made me happy, Unlimited got me pumped. The  production values went through the roof, and there were so many cooooooooollll moments and plot stuff. It was like if you liked Code Geass, but you got to sit in it and read it and enjoy it in immersion at your own pace. And it felt like this was only the first half of season one. Meaning I could kinda sense I still had like 2 or 3 wild balls to the walls arcs to go. I don't think I'll be dissapointed in the payoff.\n\nLet's be clear though. This was not meaningless build up just for Alternative. Even if I die before Alternative is released or it goes dark, I won't be sad for my time or money. 9.5/10. Great story. Great Fun.

I haven't read to much of this VN ever but really wanted to get into the series. From the many many reviews i've read over the years, Muv-Luv turns into a god level VN, but it just takes some time to get to the epic mech/sci-fi/romance because of the slow world building and character development in Muv-Luv: Extra. \n\nSo far, its honestly not that bad (2-3 hours in). It feels like a slightly better than average school romantic teen comedy with all the tropes you could possible hope for. A few boob jokes here and there, ample amounts of insults, topped off with a slow build up of scenes that you really want to skip, but know you shouldn't. \n\nThoughts so far:\n\n-The voice acting is actually really good.\n-The art is dated (but not bad), but its to be expected with such an old title.\n-It is pretty slow, but keeps you entertained with silly dialogue between MC and his childhood friend.\n-It doesn't throw oppai in your face every five minutes to try and keep you in. However there is a bit of fan service here and there. (so far at least)\n\nMore thoughts on the series...\n\nFrom what i understand, Muv-Luv: Extra is usually rated as a 6-7 out of 10. So far i'd agree with it. However, Muv-Luv: Unlimited is made to be the saving point in the series that actually starts to make you want to dive deeper, leading up to the \"God level\" Muv-Luv: Alternative (coming out soon) that contains all the mecha sci-fi goodies.\n\nTL;DR:\nMuv-Luv: Extra is the Star Wars episode 1 of the Muv-Luv series, it exists, you have to acknowledge it for the important character development and setting of the plot.

Individuals who aren't into enjoyment or appreciation of such culture may choose ignore this*\n===============================================\nFirst, a few FAQs before actual review.\n\n-This is a Visual Novel, where the main entertainment is the storytelling with choice-consequence effect throughout the VN. Thus, there isn't much of a gameplay apart from texts, dialogues and choice selections so please kindly not compare these with mainstream games. \n\n-Muv-Luv was first released back in 2003 for PC with heavy influences of Galge genre of VNs. At such, it might seem generic with fanservice similar to a lot of animes at first. However, there are more to it for the Muv-Luv triology which I'll explain in my review later.\n\nMuv-Luv is considered a triology consisting of 3 parts, aka [b]Extra, Unlimited and Alternative[/b], with the first 2 part released together in this VN and the last part available in the upcoming release of Muv-Luv Alternative. These parts can be played as standalone without the need of the following story arc. Each playthrough across different story arcs delivers a new twist/taste that builds upon the setup on previous parts of the triology. The VNs are [b]highly rated in VNDB[/b], a visual novel database for western fanbase. Muv-Luv Alternative is being rated as first place, though many fans agree that this score is given based on the overall enjoyment of the triology.\n\nTo avoid plot spoilers, I can only give a general overview. [b]Extra[/b] offers the experience one can expect from [b]slice-of-life or romance stories[/b] and acts as a parody for the related tropes in these genres. However, this is specifically written in such a manner to enable readers to get acquainted to the characters' personality to setup for further development. Unlimited then builds upon these bonds to setup a new premise for story progression. While retaining it's slice-of-life moments, Unlimited [b]delivers a more serious background[/b] revolving around familiar characters. Again, the ending for Unlimited can serve as a standalone story without Alternative despite mixed opinion, but it definitely offers a greater story when read together with Alternative.\n\nWith the origin of Muv-Luv in mind, there are considerable amount of [b]fanservice elements[/b] in the VNs, especially in Extra and Unlimited. This often leads to a misperception of what Muv-Luv offers as general community are more familiar to anime or fanservice aspects of similar VN/game. However, Muv-Luv is meant to [b]relay a deeper and grander emotional experience[/b] when readers progress through the triology, even if Extra starts of as cliche and fanservice-y. Thus, I highly recommend going through the trilogy by Extra>Unlimited>Alternative despite the ability to skip directly into Unlimited in the current release. Apologies if you do find my review vague in regards to the plot but this is something best experience by accompanying the characters through [b]a coming-to-age story[/b]. You'll find a more detailed review by the time Alternative comes out.\n\nAlso, do note again that this VN was first released back in 2003. Some have nitpicked that the story is not as revolutionary as acclaimed but I do want to point out that the details in writing and tie-in across the triology was unique at the time of release. And it still remains impressive with few fictional works able to match similar experience.

When I first laid hands on the Muv-Luv series a few years ago, two thoughts instantly crossed to my mind: \n\n1. This looks like a fun trip. \n2. Best Girl\u2019s easy to spot by her purple hair and elegant demeanor. \n\nThere was never any doubt about the second point. But boy, was I wrong about the first one. So yeah: you're in for one hell of a ride. Though there\u2019s a bunch of words to describe the journey, you\u2019ll need to look closely at the end of the line, to finally find \u201cfun\u201d. But we\u2019re still talking about Extra and Unlimited here (and not Alternative, which will hit Steam on a later date) so let\u2019s stick with \u201cfun\u201d for now. \n\nAll starts as a whacky and lighthearted romantic comedy, with your typical dense protagonist Takeru and his gang of potential love interests. It\u2019s all nice and cute, but there\u2019s nothing outstanding there, so a lot people ask, if there's any loss in skipping or rushing through Extra. - Well, there is. Because at some point into the series, you\u2019ll notice, that it\u2019s all part of the greater picture and every part\u2019s crucial to grasp the saga and its impact as a whole. In fact, it\u2019s pretty reasonable to see Extra as one long prolog to the core story, which starts with Unlimited and also a drastic change in tone and setting. \n\nThrough mysterious circumstances, Takeru awakes in an alternative timeline, where mankind is stuck in a desperate fight for survival against an alien race known as BETA. Gone are the dull days of Extra and you\u2019re thrown right into a far more serious and darker universe, with very strong SciFi/Mecha themes. Saying much more about the story would be high treason, but let me assure you: it was worth every single one of the many hours, I spend in front of the screen. The story sometimes drags itself through extensive explanations, yes. But overall, it\u2019s woven nice and tightly (there\u2019s no perfection when it comes to time travel/alternate timelines) and plays with some interesting concepts. \n\nIn short: this is a definitive worth-your-money recommendation. And if you perchance still think of \u201cfun\u201d when the credits roll, keep in mind: by the time Alternative arrives, you\u2019ll have to learn the hard way, how utterly and dreadfully wrong you were. \n\nPros:\n\n- Intriguing Story, which \u2013with Extra- lulls you into a false sense of mildly amusing harmlessness and sets the stage for the magnificent main event, known as Alternative.\n- Still nice production values for a VN originally released in 2003.\n- Length. You may want to reschedule your golf lessons, meetings and dinner with your waifu  to dig through this. You\u2019ll be busy for a while. Roughly around 50 hours (and more), I\u2019d say. \n- Reasonable price \n- Meiya \n- Kasumi \nIn that order. \n\nCons:\n\n- Extra alone is barely nice, tumbling on the brink of boredom here and there. Nonetheless a day will come, where you\u2019ll yearn for this innocent times gone by\n- Story drags here and there with its excessive explanations.

Throughout both Extra and Unlimited, you're introduced to the main characters of the series and you'll get to know them very well. You'll see each person's personal development, which makes you all that more attached to them.\n\n+ The writing is well done. Each character has a pronounced personality that shows through their dialogue. Not only that, the dialogues themselves are funny, emotional, and impactful. \n\n     |\n     -----> I'm going to say here that the plot is lacking, but not horrible. Extra is a typical romcom type harem VN, and Unlimited is more or less the same with a different setting. Both have their strong plot points, especially Unlimited, but it all feels like a huge build-up for Alternative and as such, don't really stand out on their own.\n\n - I also docked some points for the music, as it didn't have as much of an emotional impact as I thought it would. By all means, the score is good, but not as inpactful as it should be, especially in a VN. \n\n\n\nOverall, if you were to compare these two VNs without knowing about their relation to Alternative (the third installment and widely considered the best VN), you'd still get really solid reads worth your time, especially if you're a fan of VNs. The plot is enough to get you to keep reading, and again it's really well written but it's the characters, I feel, that really make you stay.\n\nI can't wait for Alternative to come out!

You'll enjoy plot twists and everything that way much more.", "timestamp_created": 1468878000, "timestamp_updated": 1468878124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24394884": {"recommendationid": "24394884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047142315", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487506611}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm one of the lucky ones that started reading Muv Luv totally blind. The only thing I knew was, it was the #1 translated VN of all time (and still is). I really don't like hyping things up and set the expectations too high to any newcomers, but Muv Luv was DEFINITELY the best experience I ever had, and still is, even after reading lots of other VNs. All of the positive comments here are the truth. \n\nAnd yes, you need to read Alternative, which is yet to be released, to get the full effect. So if you're a new buyer, just keep in mind you will need to get the next game too.\n\nI'll just stop here just in case I might spoil anything. The only thing I'll advise is that for the current release (Extra and Unlimited), just expect it as a fun and comedic love story, as per intended by the original developers, Age. Screen out any preconceptions you may had from reading all the reviews. Put yourself in Takeru's shoes and just go and enjoy bullying Sumika, getting mindblown by Meiya, weirded out by Kei and lots of other shenanigans with all the other guys and girls. It's wacky, funny, fun as hell and ... I'll stop here. \n\nOh yeah, this release have Japanese too.

Nothing groundbreaking but what it does, it does well. It is coupled with Unlimited you see the trilogy start to distinguish itself and the later Alternative, due later this year, it becomes a masterpiece. In total you may end up with a hundred hours to read all three and the story is well worth it.\n\nThe sprite animations from Alternative is a nice addition to the new release. Other than the system shapeups, clear list and new translation; it is the same story as before.\n\nThoroughly recommended for anyone interested in a great visual novel story, but this is considering the three parts as a whole. While the two parts in this game are both nice on their own, they work best together with the third. If you are worried about the price or losing the threads of the story between now and the coming release of Alternative, feel free to wait a bit.

I have completed the Muv-Luv Trilogy, via the unofficial fan translation, twice.\n\nThe Steam version of this game is the All Ages version. That means the explicit adult content that is in the normal game is removed or in some cases censored.  There is a Director's Cut patch available.\n\nThis review will be as spoiler free as I can make it.  The thing that makes the Muv-Luv experience so memorable is not knowing where it is going to go or what will happen next.  I would hate to ruin that for someone else.\n\n[b][u]Overview:[/u][/b]\n\nThe Muv-Luv Trilogy is considered by many, myself include, to be one of the best Visual Novel experiences of all time and to see it receive an official English release is really exciting.  Muv-Luv's Extra and Unlimited are meant to function as an introduction to the characters and the universe.  Skipping either would be doing yourself a big disservice.  Thankfully boasting improved visuals, much needed engine and UI changes, and of course translation updates, this iteration should offer a fresh experience for both veterans and newcomers.\n\n[b][u]Story:[/u][/b]\n\nDiscussing the story in Muv-Luv is a very tricky thing to do.  Doubly so when you are trying to avoid spoilers.  Unfortunately one of the biggest twists is proudly displayed on the store page: the genre shift.  I'll be dividing this section it two parts, one for Extra and one for Unlimited.\n\n[u]Muv-Luv Extra:[/u]\n\n[i]Takeru Shirogane is an average high school boy.  He wakes up one morning to find a young woman sleeping next to him.  His childhood friend, Sumika Kagami, is not particularly happy about it.  This mysterious young woman is Meiya Mitsurugi.  She is determined to be Takeru's bride.[/i]\n\nThat is the elevator pitch.  Pretty simple, right?  The story plays out much like you would expect in any standard harem centric romantic comedy.   With a large cast, including Takeru's fellow classmates, teachers, and a whole host of other supporting characters, the story can be really sweet and funny but mostly feels an exercise in absurdity.  On the surface Extra may feel mediocre, especially if you're not new to visual novels.  In reality it is actually a very clever parody and deconstruction of the entire trope filled genre.  The fact that it is stuffed to the brim with subtle foreshadowing only makes it all the better.\n\nThe goal of Extra, at least the first time through, is to introduce you to the characters.  There are routes for each of the main girls along with a few common routes.  In the original release you would need to complete both Sumika and Meiya's routes before you could unlock Unlimited.  All other routes were considered optional.  In this release however Unlimited is unlocked from the start.  As a result I would suggest still doing both Sumika and Meiya's routes before moving on to Unlimited as a bare minimum, and ideally doing all the routes.\n\nExtra has a lot to offer but to fully appreciate it you need to know the whole story.  Many suggest replaying Extra after completing Alternative.  I am one of those people.  You don't know just how much you'll miss it.\n\n[u]Muv-Luv Unlimited:[/u]\n\n[i]One day Takeru wakes up late and wonders why Sumika didn't wake him like normal.  Worried, he ventures outside only to see that the town he has lived in all his life is in ruins.   He is convinced that this must be a dream, nothing else could make sense.  After discovering that there is a military base where his school should be Takeru decides to join them.  Why?  So he can pilot a mech.  But what has happened?  Why is the world in ruins and why is he meeting people that look exactly like all his friends?[/i]\n\nWelcome to Unlimited.  Hopefully you didn't get whiplash from genre shift.  At this point I don't think any of this is a spoiler, especially since it is proudly displayed on the store page, but for those of us that jumped in to this series all those years ago with no clue what was in store for us this was like flipping the world upside down.  To go from a bog standard romantic comedy to post apocalyptic hard science fiction?  It was jarring.\n\nWhere Extra exists as a way to introduce us to the characters Unlimited instead introduces us to the world.  We get a lot of lore and a lot of world building.  The tone for Unlimited is more serious than Extra but still retains some pretty light hearted and goofy moments.\n\nThere are a total of six routes in Unlimited, five associated with the main heroines and one \"hidden\" route.  Despite that the main story is fairly linear.  I personally suggest completing at least Meiya's route along with the \"hidden\" route (though I'm unsure how that route will work in the All Ages version).  Other routes are once again optional but to get everything out of Alternative that you can, much like Extra, I suggest completing them all.  Unlimited gives you a glimpse of what you've signed up for.  It is the final jumping off point.\n\n[b][u]Visuals:[/u][/b]\n\nMuv-Luv was originally released in 2003 and despite that I think it holds up pretty well darn well.  Not everyone will agree with me, the art direction has been a bit of contentious topic for years, but there is more detail, action, and movement in this series than in most visual novels.  The sprites are very well done and varied, backgrounds look good, the CGs are fantastic, and the handful of movies look just fine.\n\nAll of the various improvements, which are based off of the Japanese console releases some years back to my understanding, are welcome and do a good job of bringing Extra and Unlimited up to the same level that Alternative is on.  At the time of writing the only issue I currently have is that because of the process of moving from the original 4:3 aspect ratio to wide screen there has been some zooming in and cropping of CGs.  Thankfully the developers have addressed this issue and made the various CGs scrollable within the gallery.\n\n[b][u]Sound Design:[/u][/b]\n\nThe best way I can describe the OST is iconic.  Some of the tracks still give me goosebumps.  But, as music is pretty subjective, I'll try not to drone on.\n\nThe voice acting is top notch.  Not much else to say.\n\n[b][u]System:[/u][/b]\n\nThe original version of Muv-Luv was a prickly beast.  It was old, it was clunky, it didn't play well with a several different OS versions, and the translation could be rough.  Our official release however has none of those problems.  There are some things that I wouldn't mind seeing changed like the limit on the number of saves, bringing back notes, and the ability to customize text colors, but as a whole the experience is a lot better.  Some people have pointed out that the UI is a bit ugly and very reminiscent of a mobile game, but I think it is fine.  The stability improvements and translation updates are the big things and in that regard it delivers.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b]\n\nI love Muv-Luv.  Hopefully you will too.", "timestamp_created": 1468810021, "timestamp_updated": 1504148275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24382458": {"recommendationid": "24382458", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995211835", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480162598}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr: Good title, becomes excellent when combined with its sequel, Alternative, which is not yet released.\n\nIgnore the play time, I've read the series before this Steam release. \n\nFirst things first: if you plan to read the entire series (or even just Alternative), go in as blind as you can for the best experience. DON'T google search, DON'T search Youtube, DON'T go to wikis, as these are all places where you will likely encounter spoilers in some fashion. Even if you don't run into a spoiler directly, any site with comments has a high potential of *that guy* who likes to spoil things because he wants to be a douche. \n\nMuv-luv is a highly acclaimed series of Visual Novels, much of which is focused on Alternative, the third part of the trilogy which has not yet been released. This title contains the first two parts, Extra and Unlimited, which I believe are essential to the experience. While Alternative is where the rollercoaster is most thrilling, the climb up provided by the two parts in this title enhance the experience, and in my opinion, are pretty good themselves.\n\nExtra is the first part of the trilogy, and it is a fairly standard Slice of Life High School Romcom. It establishes many of the important characters in the series, and has some foreshadowing of future events. Its most important role is to establish emotional connections between you and the characters in a carefree environment. If you find this part unbearable, the main route(s) to read for plot are Sumika's and/or Meiya's. These two routes are largely the same, except for the ending, and completing these two were originally required before unlocking Unlimited. The other routes obviously delve more in-depth with the other heroines, and also introduce a few side characters who pop up later, but are not necessary to the main story. \n\nUnlimited is the second part; in this Steam version, it is unlocked from the start, but I would highly recommend reading at least one of Sumika/Meiya in Extra before reading Unlimited. The genre shift from Extra to Unlimited was originally a surprise, but over time it has become rather well known, and even a selling point for the franchise. It is spoiled in the preview video, but I can't blame them when the part of the franchise that most people think of is after the genre shift. Most of the side stories and spinoff VN titles are concerned with either Unlimited or Alternative, and the world most think of when talking about Muv-luv is introduced in Unlimited. The routes in Unlimited are nearly identical, save for a couple unique romance scenes; completing any character's route is more or less the same as finishing any other, though each route has the same two variations of endings. If you don't have a favorite character to choose at this point, Meiya's route is probably the best option story-wise. Unlimited has a significant amount of world-building; some find it tedious, others fascinating. I fall in the latter camp, but regardless, understanding the world established in Unlimited is important for understanding Unlimited and, ultimately, Alternative. Let's just say the ending is rather...abrupt.\n\nMuch of the hype understandably goes towards Alternative, but I would still recommend buying this title as well. I found Extra more tolerable that others, it seems, and found Unlimited quite enjoyable. On its own, I might recommend waiting for a deal before purchase, but upon finishing Alternative, I believe buying both titles at full price is well worth the cost. There is some debate whether it's worth buying something when you only experience an enhanced payoff in a later title, but I would recommend getting both. Having some time between the releases is useful in a couple ways; it gives you time to digest what happened in Extra and especially Unlimited before diving back into the world with Alternative, and if you find Extra or Unlimited tedious, there's plenty of time to get through it before Alternative arrives.", "timestamp_created": 1468806625, "timestamp_updated": 1468806638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786150", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24382015": {"recommendationid": "24382015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049405520", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470659390}, "language": "english", "review": "NOW LISTEN HERE, MAGGOT! \n\nMUV-LUV IS A VN ALL THE WAY FROM 2003 -I REPEAT, FOURTEEN YEARS OLD- BUT IT STILL ISN'T JUST A FOSSIL IN AN ABANDONED MUSEUM! \n\n NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

If you can look past the quirky character designs and well-aged old art style (the game series being more than 10 years old) Muv-Luv can be charming and an enjoyable read on its own. \n\nAs an enthusiast of Japanese Otaku subculture, I can say that Extra/Unlimited will probably at first read and appear as mediocre, average, or even perhaps boring to anyone that has had previous experience with all the various anime/manga or visual novel mediums out there. However, do not be fooled by Extra/Unlimited's cheerful, laid back and moe filled story line. Although it appears innocently dumb, a plethora of allusions, foreshadowing and subtle hints litter the first hour of the story and onward, which when looked back upon when one completes the series, will amaze you. You can even say that the entire narrative of the first two games were confidently written in preparation for the final game in the trilogy. \n\nExtra can be seen as introducing the characters and relationships, while Unlimited shows you the world and background for the grand finale which is Alternative. Extra will bring you laughter and joy and Unlimited will bring you sadness and hope. Essentially, Extra and Unlimited lay the foundation that leads to one of the most highly acclaimed visual novel of all time. It is well worth the read to to get there and is an absolute requirement in understanding the characters and its story.\n\nThe Muv-Luv series is one that is near and dear to my heart. An exceptional experience that I will never forget. A story of unique quality that is rarely written once a decade. One of the few visual novel series that I'd wholeheartedly recommend to anyone that is a fan of romance/comedy, mecha and science fiction. Lighthearted, goofy, and sweet... Muv-Luv Extra is like any other generic romantic comedy visual novel out there, while Muv-Luv Unlimited introduces a unique sci-fi genre twist. The appreciation of their value and beauty can only be truly seen once one reaches the Alternative.\n\n\u201cTime is the cruelest kindness.\u201d", "timestamp_created": 1468776425, "timestamp_updated": 1468776425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24374150": {"recommendationid": "24374150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100749973", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469217289}, "language": "english", "review": "The short version of this review is this: If you like visual novels, the Muv-Luv trilogy, including Extra, is a series you should not pass up on. If you can find a way to go into it with as little exposure to what lies ahead as possible, then I encourage anyone who can and is interested to do so. \n\nIf you're prepared for the long version of this review, then buckle up, buster.\n\nFull disclosure: I've previously read fan translations of the trilogy (of which the first two parts are contained in this release) and backed at a pretty high tier for the Kickstarter. I've been a fan of the franchise for a long time now. However, as far as this review is concerned, I'll be keeping things to what's in this release (Extra and Unlimited) since that's what a potential buyer would be buying.\n\nSo! Muv-Luv. What is it? \n\nMuv-Luv is a visual novel divided into two parts: Extra and Unlimited, and despite their names, Extra actually comes before Unlimited, and despite the fact that the game gives you the option of choosing what you want to play, it's my recommendation to play Extra at least once before jumping into Unlimited. \n\nExtra, at a glance, is your standard visual novel setup. A high school setting with high school problems. Romance, friendships, clubs, the works. The characters are lively, varied, and the chemistry they have with each other and the protagonist makes for a good experience even when you aren't looking for the romance. \n\nThe writing is funny and over the top, but also familiar and easy to slide into. As the game was written and released roughly a decade ago, older fans of anime, manga, and other types of Japanese content may find themselves finding a sense of nostalgia in Extra's flashy style of nonsense and fun, as a lot of Extra's antics, harem-related and otherwise, have since fallen out of style. \n\nThat said, if you're coming into Muv-Luv solely for what comes later, you may find yourself opposed to Extra. My advice is to disregard that \"I don't want to play this\" mindset or don't even bother. Every good story builds up, and while Extra is plenty enjoyable for what it is on its own, it is important to recognize Extra for what it truly is: buildup for what's to come. \n\nIt's the opening chapter to the protagonist's story, and it lays the very foundation of everything that follows, regardless of how little it may seem. What's more, as far as visual novels go, a couple of runs through Extra aren't actually all that long even if you don't use the skip text function, and don't even get me started on if you do. \n\nSo don't worry, and have fun with it! Enjoy it for what it is, because Extra is plenty enjoyable. You may even find yourself longing for it in the chapters to come.\n\nFollowing Extra, players can open up Unlimited (provided they didn't skip to it).\n\nUnlimited opens with the protagonist finding himself in an alternate future. There are no high school antics, there are no over the top hijinks, everything is grim and serious. He finds himself thrust into training for a war against monsters that have essentially all but destroyed the world, and through Unlimited, he starts to grow and change a great deal. \n\nIn Unlimited, players will see a whole new side to Muv-Luv. The characters from Extra will appear once again, but in an entirely new form. Now cadets training for battle, they learn about fighting rather than math and science as they did in Extra. The switch from the over the top feel of Extra to the despair-filled setting of Unlimited is one of the most important reasons to play Extra first - players will be able to firsthand grasp the jarring shift from the protagonist's perspective, and through that, take part in his journey to come to grips alongside him.\n\nBut that's just the writing. What about the rest of this \"visual\" novel? Well, one thing that has always impressed me about Muv-Luv is is how it handles its visuals. \n\nWhereas even today one might expect to go into a visual novel and see a transparent text box taking up a portion of the screen as it displays what the mostly static characters behind it are saying, Muv-Luv, despite its comparative age, goes a step beyond this. \n\nMany, many characters can be on the screen at the same time, and the variety of costumes and poses they take on puts even many of today's visual novels to shame. With the way Muv-Luv goes about displaying its characters, character sprites will move about the screen in a much more animated and exciting fashion than some might have come to expect from the standard visual novel. \n\nAdding to that, the game incorporates super deformed versions of the characters in animations and a variety of fitting styles for different CGs, adding to the overall experience and making it a surprising visual treat despite how much older it is than some of the other popular visual novels these days. Similarly, one might be surprised to see how well it holds up compared to some of the other popular visual novels that were coming out around the same time.\n\nOne caveat of the sprites I do want to mention is that some of the new additions to the game for this release are the animations to the sprites that were added. Originally, some of the sprites were displayed with characters gritting their teeth or holding their faces in asymetrical positions, and the animations for these aren't as good looking as others. Additionally, these animations overall aren't as fluid as what visual novel enthusiasts today might expect from such titles as Nekopara or Neptunia, and if not aware of the series' quality and history, might choose to unfairly ignore it for that reason. However, I can say from experience that after the first couple of minutes, you get used to it if they're bothering you.\n\nAs for the music? The music is also quite good. Some tracks in Extra might come off as standard initially, but then others (a favorite of mine would be the one that plays when Takeru plays his favorite video game) might stick out and stick with you from then on. At times, the soundtrack on its own might seem like it lacks coherency, but this is one of Muv-Luv's strong points - even when a song on a disc or a YouTube playlist might not seem like it belongs, when you see it played out in the game, you realize that this song was incredibly appropriate for the scene it was chosen for, and the developers did an excellent job.\n\nAll in all, when it comes to Muv-Luv, although most generally praise the trilogy's finale as the best part of the series (which will be releasing later on as a separate release), I can confidently say these two games are still more than worth a purchase now. Even if you've played fan-translations before, the new translation and updates make this well worth your time and money.", "timestamp_created": 1468770607, "timestamp_updated": 1468770607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598296", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24371876": {"recommendationid": "24371876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163700518", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487706239}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Muv luv is a must to read epicness", "timestamp_created": 1468762330, "timestamp_updated": 1468762330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24369916": {"recommendationid": "24369916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064838002", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 2590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484686495}, "language": "english", "review": "Golden VN classic, should i even say that?", "timestamp_created": 1468753096, "timestamp_updated": 1468753096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.388994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24369594": {"recommendationid": "24369594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049960201", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470387426}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a classical Visual Novel with a real great story.

This game currently spans the first two parts (Extra and Unlimited) of the main trilogy, with the third and arguably best part (Alternative) on the way. Without spoiling this game, I can only say that I love the way it subverts several classic VN, light novel, manga, and anime genres. Extra starts off as your stereotypical harem VN, and gradually leads you down the rabbit hole. The characters, outwardly cliche VN archetypes, gradually develop into unique and compelling personae. Extra exists to attach you to the characters, and while there are a few pacing issues, its more than entertaining enough to get you to put the time in to learn about the characters and setting. Unlimited introduces you to the real meat of the muv-luv universe. You really want to avoid spoiling yourself on this, so all I'll say is that Unlimited introduces a magnificent twist to the drama, putting the characters you grow to love in Extra into an entirely new light, and setting the stage for the  \u00e2ge-soft's magnum opus, Muv-Luv Alternative.

So let's begin.\n\nVoice Acting: Check.\n\nVisuals: The Visuals are not the most recent, but Muv-Luv has done a lot more work visually than most Visual Novels bother with, which lends a very different feel to the game and enchances the overall system.  For example, the sprite's lips move when the voice acting is playing, which makes it feel like an anime cutscene.  Characters turn and aren't always facing the same direction, and so forth.  At the same time, they do have scenes that use very little in the way of art budget, but have done a decent job in making those scenes feel like they are supposed to be in that art style for comedic effect.\n\nMusic:  The Music is nice, worth hearing, but it hasn't yet moved to levels of To the Moon in that last finale.

I backed the project on kickstarter merely on a whim (300 dollar tier).\n\nI read the twitterfeed and played EXTRA first.   This review will be based on the first hour and a half of playing through Muv-Luv Extra.\n\nYou take the perspective of Takeru Shirogane a teenager who is actually a genius mech pilot...at least that's what the first two minutes of EXTRA are teasing only to find out that all a dream.  You're actually just a normal Japanese high school boy being awoken  by your childhood friend Sumika as part of a daily routine. Along the way you meet your other classmates Meiya, Tama, Sakaki, Ayamine and Marimo all of which take up stereotypical heroine roles in this visual novel such as the transfer student who you promised to marry when you were kids, the class rep, the underclassman, etc.\n\n Now I've played plenty of visual novels, and I thought that extra was gonna be dry.  I was really tempted to start unlimited first to jump into the drama but digressed after reading the twitterfeed.  Boy am I glad I stuck to playing extra first.  The character reactions are so hilarious (even if they aren't animated) and every character (including the dog)  just meshes so well together.  \n\nAnother feature I like is when you close the game and open it again you start off in the same spot as before so you don't have to accidentally worry about accidentally closing the game without saving.  Second is no text boxes, just text.\n\nThe music is pretty catchy and the visuals are more than just character cutout portraits.  Overall, the hour and a half I played just passed by in an instant.  I'd recommend this novel for anyone who enjoys visual novels or is just starting to get into visual novels.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1468655562, "timestamp_updated": 1468655562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24348010": {"recommendationid": "24348010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005507216", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468825021}, "language": "english", "review": "Muv-Luv is a visual novel split across three parts: Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative. This Steam version contains both Extra and Unlimited, while Alternative will be released at a later date. \n\nExtra plays like a very typical visual novel from Japan: a childhood friend of the opposite sex, a sudden change in the main character's life, multiple potential love interests in a high school setting. Extra is considered the weakest entry of the Muv-Luv trilogy, but it's there for a reason. It introduces the characters that will be present in the future parts of the triology, and allows you to get attached to them. This Steam version does allow you to access Unlimited without playing through Extra, but I strongly urge you to give Extra a shot first. \n\nTo avoid spoilers (I strongly recommend people to go in to Muv-Luv blind), I'll have to be vague in describing Unlimited. The high school romantic comedy setting of Extra is completely wiped away and replaced by... well, something, and this is when the story REALLY takes off. Muv-Luv follows the typical VN format: a slice of life comedy portion for you to get you attached to the characters, and then a major event that completely turns things around and you're caught up in a swirl of emotions. \n\nHaving read my fair share of visual novels, the Muv-Luv trilogy is among the best for good reason.

I'll just say how it went for me.\n\nThere are three parts in the Muv Luv Trilogy. Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative.\n\nWhen I first started reading Extra, it seemed inane and cliche. It took me several months to get through it, because I wasn't really particularly invested.\n\nWhen I hit Unlimited, suddenly it became pretty interesting! Still a little slow, but I was hooked. I played it when I had spare time over the course of a week or so.\n\nWhen I hit Alternative, I literally could not put it down for anything. I literally did not sleep for nearly 72 hours until I finished it. By the end I was a complete emotional wreck.\n\nComing back to Extra, it's very emotional experience on your second playthrough.

Degica has made some fantastic improvements in art and technical quality to go along with a retranslation of the original fan work that made Muv Luv famous.\n\nThe series as a whole shifts from slice of life romantic comedy to hardcore science fiction, taking characters you already know from a normal setting and putting them in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction and human-piloted mechs are their only hope for survival. There\u2019s plenty of action and emotion in the latter two parts, while the first focuses on romance and comedy, and you should definitely play them all in order to get to know the characters. \n \nMuv-Luv Extra is a mixture of normal comedy, hilarious exaggerations and absurd truths that will probably keep you laughing for most of its length. Some might describe it as a run-of-the-mill rom-com but it sets the scene for other instalments in the series and I personally find it to be great fun.\n\nIf you thought the Muv-Luv series itself was entirely romance and comedy, though, you would be horribly wrong. Unlimited launches the characters introduced by Extra into a sci-fi mecha setting where humanity is on the brink of extinction at the hands of the terrifying BETA. Seeing those characters you've built connections with face the adversity of unadulterated war is hugely entertaining, and Unlimited is still only setting up for the amazing final chapter of Muv Luv Alternative.\n\nOf all of the visual novels, video games, TV series, movies and books i've read before, Muv Luv Alternative sits at the top of the list in terms of sheer entertainment value and Muv Luv is the game that paves the way for it.

This new universe he finds himself in is a twisted parody of his home. His hometown is a ruin, his childhood friend, Kagami Sumika's, house is crushed by what seems to be a giant robot, and the high school he attended is now a U.N. military base. Upon arriving at said military base, he is immediately thrown into prison after a thorough cavity search and interrogation. Herein lies his salvation, Kouzuki Yuuko, his (in his universe) high school physics teacher. After some cursory questions, he is released into her custody and summarily informed of his new circumstances. \n\nIn this unfamiliar and nightmarish environment, Takeru does what any teenager would do in his situation; he panics. He's completely unwilling to accept reality and rationalizes his experiences as a crazy dream. Shortly afterwards, Kouzuki Yuuko, who is revealed to be the base XO assigns him to squad 207b, so she can keep an eye on him. When he heads out to meet them, he's stunned to find himself surrounded by familiar faces--people who he's supposed to know, but finds out are completely different, at least on the surface. \n\nAfter being introduced to the squad, he begins his basic combat training, where he discovers one of his many shortcomings, namely his pathetic physical state. This is a recurring theme, where his utterly civilian background does not lend itself well to any of the drills squad 207 is assigned. Even in the CCSE (Comprehensive Combat Skill Evaluation), the final test before cadets are allowed to undergo eishi (pilot) training, he almost causes the squad to fail because he caught a cold in the middle of it. Somehow, they pass, and in a twist of irony, the boy who near-failed at everything related to the military scores the highest in the aptitude test. With this reversal in fortune, Shirogane Takeru coasts on his newfound talent to become the strongest cadet, using skills gained from countless hours of video games.\n\nIn true Muv Luv fashion however, happy times never last, and on the eve of Christmas, right after a Tanabata-Christmas party, the base CO (General Paul Radhabinod) reveals that Alternative V, a mass exodus from the blue planet, has gone into effect. 100,000 people, chosen by the government, will head for a planet with conditions similar to Earth, effectively abandoning the rest in the fight to take back the Earth. Their departure will herald the start of Operation Babylon, the mass deployment of G-bombs to clear the Earth of hives while the armies follow up with their TSF units.\n\nMuv Luv Unlimited ends with one of the romanceable companions (Mitsurugi Meiya, Sakaki Chizuru, Tamase Miki, Yoroi Mikoto) and their [Shirogane's and her] daughter pointing out a distant Sun in the night sky, while engaging in a heartbreaking dialogue.\n\nThroughout all of Unlimited and Alternative, Shirogane Takeru learns many hard lessons. He learns how truly fragile and transient happiness is, and the lengths he will go to in order to preserve it. He learns the definition of nationalism, both its positive and negative aspects and what it means to truly be Japanese. He learns about responsiblity, both taken on willingly and not, and the consequences of abdicating it. He learns of the burdens of power, of both having it and lacking it, and that to truly affect change, he must not be afraid to bloody his hands. He learns of courage, and how to stand back up in the face of overwhelming despair. Most importantly, he learns of love--what love will drive people to do, and its impact on the world around us, for the better or for the worse. \n\n\"I want everyone I love, everyone in the world to smile happily together.\" - Tamase Miki", "timestamp_created": 1468612967, "timestamp_updated": 1468613053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503946", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24340416": {"recommendationid": "24340416", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998133210", "num_games_owned": 563, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480110334}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best visual novels now with english translation and on steam.", "timestamp_created": 1468612829, "timestamp_updated": 1468612829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455680", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24340180": {"recommendationid": "24340180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069974852", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495300637}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5230\u5e95\u8fd8\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u4f1f\u5927\u7684GALGAME\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u8bf4\uff0c\u5750\u7b49\u7eff\u5149\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u7cfb\u5217\u4f5c\u54c1\u6328\u7740\u4e0a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6328\u7740\u4e70\uff0cALTERNATIVE\u5feb\u51fa\u6765\u554a", "timestamp_created": 1468611929, "timestamp_updated": 1468611929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24340136": {"recommendationid": "24340136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038486613", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471245809}, "language": "english", "review": "Part 1 and 2 of the world's greatest PTSD simulator.

I previously read the fan translations of both Muv Luv and Muv Luv Alternative, and will base this short initial review on those experiences.\n\nI should start by saying that the Muv Luv trilogy is the best piece of fiction I've ever read in visual novel format. From start to finish the story was very well thought out and designed, each instalment building upon and surpassing the last. Despite its flaws (read: Extra) you absolutely have to read the whole thing if you're a fan of visual novels.\n\nPreviously I'd found it difficult to review or recommend this VN to others for two reasons:\n\n-because my words can not do it justice. I recommend reading the top reviews on this page if you haven't already;\n \n-because it's inherently spoiler heavy. Originally Unlimited was not revealed to the reader beforehand, it would be unlocked after finishing Extra as a surprise. Fortunately the English release is not as secretive as the original.\n\nI say fortunately because Extra on its own would be a very generic harem romcom in a tired high school setting. I don't think it would be unfair to say that it's actually a hurdle on the way to enjoying this trilogy, despite being a decent VN that contributes a lot to the series. It requires some commitment to get through Extra if the reader's tired of its kind of story, but you'll have to take my word for it that it's all worth it in the end. I recommend reading Sumika's and Meiya's routes at least, because this was the requirement to unlock Unlimited in the original release and they follow roughly the same story path with alternate scenes. I'd give this one a 7/10.\n\nAfter enduring comedic shenanigans in his original universe Takeru the harem protagonist wakes into the darker world of Unlimited. Out of his comfort zone in a fundamentally familiar setting with familiar faces that don't recognise him, Takeru has to adapt to an unfair reality, unsure if he'll be able to return to the world he knew. Unlimited is a much more refreshing experience after Extra, and yet only dips into the depths Alternative goes to. I like to call it a boot camp coming-of-age story, and it's a solid 8/10.\n\nAt the time this review is being written Alternative is not yet released on Steam. It could be that playing through Muv Luv may leave you unsatisfied with Unlimited's ending since a lot of questions remain unanswered and closure is left to Alternative.

It's a lot better looking than the original PC release, and uses some of the visual improvements introduced by Alternative such as lip flaps on sprites. The translation is much improved so far and I laughed far harder at a lot of the jokes, and in addition, there's an option for images to be translated too. I'm unaware if a H patch is in the works, but the all-ages versions are surprisingly enjoyable, giving us new CGs that don't deny the progression of the relationship, but merely remove the graphic element, so for this game I don't mind. The only downsides are that Unlimited is available from the get go; whilst this is convenient, it means the dream of gifting this to your unaware friend, so they jump in blind, isn't really possible. In addition, some of the music tracks have been replaced. Not a big problem, just don't expect to be Livin' la vida loca.\n\nHighly recommended to fans and newcomers alike.

This will mainly focus on extra ( will update at a later date)\n\nThis is by far the best Visual novel i have played.

While you can nit-pic with meiya's  \" dude, dude,dude\" i haven't noticed any issues, nor have i saw any grammar errors. \n\nCharacters and story-\nA typical highschool rom-com( Extra only). Do not be put off with this. If you can put up with the setting, it is an excellent VN.\nNow, on the best part. You will steadily grow to like, and enjoy the characters in the series. From Takeru's laziness and sarcasm, to Meiya's \" dude dude dude\" and sumika's drill milky punch. You will instantly love the characters as you experience their day to day run ins with each other. fortunately, to understand why, you will need to play! This helps in the long run, when you eventually play Unlimited( and alternative later on). \n\nGame quality ( interface, sprites etc)\nI personally think the interface could do with a little overhaul( While playing). The options are giant, and a few options are missing which were in the original game( Nothing big, and doesn't detract from the experience) . The overall quality of the sprites are well done. There are various updated ones throughout. The english voiced scenes are a vast improvement! I can stop cringing whenever i remember them! Good job :P \nNo ingame bugs so far. I'm surprised on this point. Typically with any game, you find small bugs/glitches. None so far. Looks like moving the release date helped a bunch!\n\nOverall thoughts-\nHappy to be playing Muv-luv on steam, and with an updated version of it at that! \nAs someone backed the KS, i feel my money( and many others) has been well spent.

Push through it and start Unlimited.\n\nUnlimited is where the real novel is. All of the time spent on Extra is worth it once you start reading. Right from the beginning, Unlimited catches the reader and poses questions that keep him/her intrigued until the end.

Also, this is a review of the overall experience and not this particular port, and as such, performance will not be addressed. As I play through the game, I may update this review.[/i]\n\nFirst things first, some people may be confused with the playing order. This listing comes with both Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited, but unfortunately, unlike in the original game, both Extra and Unlimited are accessible from the beginning, adding to the confusion. The order that I recommend you play, and the order that was originally intended is: \n\nExtra > Unlimited > Alternative\n\nI'd recommend you at least finish Sumika or Meiya's route (personally, I found Meiya's route to be more entertaining) before playing Unlimited as it continues directly from the common route of the two. Then once you hit Unlimited, pursue any route you want. Of course, this is the bare minimum so you can pursue other routes in addition to those mentioned, but keep in mind that the purpose of Extra is to familiarise yourself with the characters before diving into Unlimited. In Unlimited, knowledge of characters and their personalities is assumed and as such, you shouldn't start Unlimited before doing the above.\n\nI'm not really one to beat around the bush, so here's a summary of pros and cons of both games.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]A lot of references to other media\n[*]Great characters\n[*]Handles relationships well\n[*]Can skip all read text; good for pursuing different paths\n[*]Unique artstyle\n[*]Sprite positioning/Animation\n[/list]\n\n[b] Extra [/b]\n[list]\n[*]Very light hearted, can be enjoyed casually\n[*]Excellent lead up to Unlimited and Alternative\n[*]An event so bad it makes the rest of the game less painful\n[/list]\n\n[b] Unlimited [/b]\n[list]\n[*]A thought out and interesting setting/World\n[*]Great mech designs\n[*]Serious while retaining the light hearted shenanigans of Extra\n[*]Great fanservice for mech fans\n[*]All characters have their chance to shine\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Both Extra and Unlimited are pretty generic\n[*]Mediocre music\n[*]Takeru isn't the smartest guy around\n[/list]\n\n[b] Extra [/b]\n[list]\n[*]Overall very bad even for a romcom\n[*]Can be very cringe-worthy if you don't like romcoms\n[*]Common route only branches at the end for Sumika and Meiya\n[*]An event so bad it makes the rest of the game less painful\n[/list]\n\n[b] Unlimited [/b]\n[list]\n[*]Without Alternative, ends with a cliffhanger and many unanswered questions\n[*]Can be overly patriotic\n[/list]\n\nIn conclusion, Extra may be bearable for some and completely unbearable for others, but even so, it's very worth playing through Extra as it has a huge pay off once you hit Alternative and as it introduces the characters. It's not great by any stretch, but some of the issues it tackles can be very emotional, such as choosing a girl to pursue. While playing it, you may not realise that it does indeed tie into Alternative, so it is integral to the overall experience. Personally, I despised Extra at the time I played it, however, after playing Alternative, it blew my mind with how much it was actually related.\n\nUnlimited, overall, is a much better experience and if you're a mech fan like I am and there's a lot of fun to be had with Takeru's shenanigans as well as the world design. There are also many references to other mech series in here that would delight fans. That's not to say it's perfect either, as the story is fairly generic and it still retains the light hearted nature of Extra which can be both good or bad depending on how you look at it. It assumes that you have played Extra, and as such, spares no time introducing characters but instead builds on the characters from Extra. Furthermore, some events can be overly patriotic, which may be annoying to some people.\n\nAs a standalone experience, both Extra and Unlimited are average, however, they lay the foundations for Alternative which continues straight from the end of Unlimited. If you like narratives that focus on characterisation, the Muv-Luv series is definitely something to experience regardless of if you're a mech fan or not. If you prefer a strong story, Muv-Luv might not be what you're looking for, but I would recommend it regardless as it may give you a few surprises. Doing the bare minimum in Extra and Unlimited will take about 20 hours altogether.\n\nIf you do end up playing the Muv-Luv Trilogy, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.", "timestamp_created": 1468574574, "timestamp_updated": 1468574574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24330607": {"recommendationid": "24330607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116176385", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503554171}, "language": "english", "review": "Said this years ago and will say it again now.

What this means is that I like Extra much more than the first time I played it. Alternative has a tendancy to boost appreciation of the earlier games a ton. Mainly because... reasons.\n\nBut this isn't about ALternative or the trilogy.\n\nThis is about Extra/alternative. And Extra is ok. It feels like a 90's anime romantic comedy, with all the good and bad of it. It's not bad, in fact I'd rate it's story a solid 7/10 as an above average visual novel. But its not great, and can drag in some areas. If you've played a bunch of visual novels it might even seem like it's a bit stale because of the tropes being so familiar. But it is a solid visual novel, and there are some good story arcs, and I rather like the endings for Meiya/Sumika (the endings one had to reach in the original game to unlock unlimitted). \n\nNow onto Unlimitted. Unlimitted is where things get interesting. IN this new world Takeru is a fish out of water and everyone's personality is slightly changed from extra (cause yeah... humanity is dying out and everyone kind of is aware of it but trying to beleive it can be stopped). This is definaitly a good visual novel and I wouldn't hesitate to give it's story a 8.5/10. Very enjoyable and fun. Love the atmosphere and world building. \n\nBut again these are only the prelude to the amazing, tear jerking, roler coaster that is Alternative. I'd say too anyone on the fence this is a game you should play before alternative realeases (if you don't care for extra, I'd say just play one route and then jump to unlimitted). \n\nThe Interface and game quality is definitly updated and has some of the higest levels for VN available. But I personally don't really care for that too much, I prefer story, but compared to the fan translated 200X version, yeah I can see the difference. \n\nAs a standalone i'd say it's worth the buy, but not everyone will like all aspects of it.

To say I have a bias would be fair.[/i]\n\nAlso, this review was originally a post I made on the discussion boards when someone asked why they should read this.  If it looks familiar, that's why.\n\nMuv-Luv is a single tale split into three parts. The first part, Extra, is one of character building. The generic high school setting and romcom story are meant to familiarize you with Takeru's mindset as well as the characters he is involved with. If you've ever read or watched Steins;Gate, it's kind of like the first half of that. It has a certain amount of charm and no small amount of humor in it, but also some clever foreshadowing that you probably won't get on the first read, but will look back to while reading the later parts and go \"ohhh, that's what that was.\"\n\nThe new translation is vastly more readable than the old fan translation, but if you aren't interested in the romcom genre, Extra may be a tough read. Fortunately, just going through a single route won't take that long. And that's all you really need for Extra to serve its purpose.\n\nThe second part, Unlimited, is one of world building. It introduces you to the sci-fi setting that the majority of the story takes place in and shows how that world has affected the lives of the people you grew to know in Extra. Unlimited is more of a military academy setting, and the genre is more of a dramedy than a romcom, though there are still romantic aspects to it. Again, there are a lot of points in Unlimited that will be referenced in the third part, but even without that, Unlimited is a worthy read on its own. Keep in mind that original readers were waiting for 3 years after Extra/Unlimited to get the next part. \n\nThe third part, Alternative, I won't go into much detail on, except to say that if you have any interest in the Mecha genre at all, this is one of the best ones out there. Even if Extra and Unlimited were borderline unreadable(which they are not), I'd still recommend ploughing through them to get the most out of Alternative. It's the highest rated VN on VNDB for a very good reason.\n\nIf you've watched Total Eclipse, the Muv-Luv Trilogy isn't that. If you've watched Schwarzesmarken, that's only a pale imitation(and yet still quite good on its own). If you're asking why you should read Muv-Luv, then my answer is because the entire trilogy, taken as a whole, is just that damn good.", "timestamp_created": 1468566376, "timestamp_updated": 1468566376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677553", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24329208": {"recommendationid": "24329208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164935241", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468566794}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u636e\u8bf4\u672c\u4f5c\u662f\u541b\u4e34\u4e8e2Wgalgame\u7684\u9876\u70b9\uff0c\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u6700\u4f1f\u5927\u7684GAL[spoiler]\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u8bf4\u7684\u8868\u6253\u6211[/spoiler]\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u90fd\u65e0\u6240\u8c13\uff0c\u5feb\u628aAlternative\u51fa\u4e86\u8ba9\u6211\u5145\u503c\uff08", "timestamp_created": 1468566312, "timestamp_updated": 1468566312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24328754": {"recommendationid": "24328754", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982068784", "num_games_owned": 1245, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468746960}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR: Muv Luv series is one of the best visual novel series out there! Steam version is a definitive improvement from the old fan-translation. Price is good and fair. Recommended for fans and newcomers! If you didn\u00b4t like it before, you probably won\u00b4t like it this time either if you enter with the wrong mindset. \n\n___________________________________\n\"Muv Luv Extra sucks so much!\"\n\"I really love Muv Luv Alternative, but Extra was the worst visual novel I\u00b4ve ever read!!\"\n\"WTF I thought this was some deep mecha-badass-action visual novel, not some generic school s***!\"\n\nFirst of all, let me say that Muv Luv should be looked and reviewed as a whole package. For many people (myself included) Muv Luv series is really the pinnacle of visual novels. It\u00b4s meant to be a trilogy and people really should treat it that way. Of course its possible to watch Return of the King or Return of the Jedi and skip everything before them, but you wouldn\u00b4t care as much about anything thats happening, right?\n\nFor all the haters and newcomers to the series I\u00b4d like to offer a few tips that should make the Muv Luv experience better:\n\n1) The order to read is Extra -> Unlimited -> Alternative. One should play all the routes from Extra!\n\n2) Don\u00b4t listen to people saying it gets better later on, because that just makes you really negative and critical towards Extra. You\u00b4re not in a hurry, so why not enjoy the story at your own pace? Extra is lighthearted fun for the most part, don\u00b4t make it a chore to read for yourself!\n\n3) Extra has lots of comic relief, lots of moe, and quite a lot of drama too. If you\u00b4re too serious to handle the cutesy, sometimes cringy humor and moe, try to relax, walk a little, take deep breaths, and soul search yourself to the point that you can turn your Serious-mode off, even if its just for this one time. \n\nAll in all, maybe this was really more of a pitiful, overly defensive rant, but I really really really like Extra, Unlimited and Alternative all equally. Everything is a pissing contest these days anyway (Dark Souls X is harder than Y, this X anime is better than Y, why would anyone X when you can Y?), so remember to stay positive, try to be happy for once, have fun, enjoy, and share the Luv with everyone!", "timestamp_created": 1468563705, "timestamp_updated": 1468563705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.983403", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24328606": {"recommendationid": "24328606", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999309428", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506264103}, "language": "english", "review": "There is a good reason why Muv Luv Alternative has been #1 on VNDB for almost 10 years now.\n\nUnfortunately, Muv Luv in itself is not the reason.

Extra and Unlimited are the first two parts of the Muv-Luv trilogy which are in included in this release, with Alternative (the final chapter) coming out later this year. Muv-Luv follows the story of Takeru thru a plain old regular life at first, until he is thrown into another world fighting to keep itself from destruction, with each passing moment becoming more intense than the last.\n           Our story begins in Extra. Extra is your run of the mill High School Rom-Com visual novel, where Takeru enjoys his life at school and spending time with the five heroines (each with their own endings). Extra is a bit of an odd duck in that it is not at all representative of what the majority of the Muv-Luv trilogy is like. Does this make it bad? Not at all. Extra is the ground work for the trilogy, introducing characters and developing connections to them, showing what Takeru\u2019s life was like before it is turned completely upside-down, and laying in place plot points that prove crucial later. You don\u2019t need to complete all the routes in Extra (although it would improve the all-over experience), but it is highly recommended to finish Sumika and Meiya\u2019s routes before continuing on to Unlimited. Muv-Luv Extra should take around 10+ hours to finish the two main routes and around 20+ hours to read everything if you wanted to.\n          In Unlimited everything changes. Gone is the life Takeru knew and in it\u2019s place is a world teetering on the edge of destruction, with humanity making their final stand with giant Mechs. Unlimited role in the trilogy is to set up and show us the world in which remainder of the story takes place. We are also introduced to the main conflicts of Alternative. Unlimited has multiple endings but you only need to see one (unless you want to see them all). Completing one route of unlimited should take you around 8+ hours and reading everything would be around 10+ hours.\nYou may see some people saying that Extra and Unlimited are not worth your time and just read Alternative, but both Extra and Unlimited are incredibly important for increasing the impact that Alternative delivers. Think of it this way, you could just watch the last movie in Star Wars (original trilogy) or The Lord of the Rings (The Return of the King) and understand what the plot is and who the characters are but the experience is lessened. By watching the movies that came before you spend more time with the characters and the world they live in, becoming more attached to them and understanding their struggles. The same can be applied to the first two parts of Muv-Luv.\n\nShould you read Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited?\n\n\tAs the key foundation supporting and enhancing one of the greatest visual novels of all time, Muv-Luv Alternative, the answer is a resounding \u201cYes!\u201d.     \n\n10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1468559489, "timestamp_updated": 1468559489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24328027": {"recommendationid": "24328027", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984764771", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480105802}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good visual novel.

Those people are big whiney babies. However 'generic rom-com' Extra seems at a glance, its humor is audacious, at times brilliant, and the novel keeps itself at a fast pace. Moreover, besides laying the groundwork for the characters' personalities, it's filled with foreshadowing for later parts of the series and necessary to fully appreciate the relationship between the protagonist and the heroine of the third part, Alternative.\n\nBut feel free to skip Chizuru's route, it adds nothing. I like the character, but her personal story is anemic.\n================================\n\nFirst and second parts of the most excellent Visual Novel series 'Muv-Luv'.\n\nExtra is the story of a high school senior whose carefree life gets thrown in disarray with the sudden appearance of a comically wealthy, eccentric girl who sets about attempting to win his affections, and in doing so prompting our protagonist's inseparable childhood friend, a literal girl-next-door, to rethink their circumstances; the taken-for-granted notion that they'd always be together, whether simply being 'friends' is something is satisfied with, and insecurities regarding her own merits compared to the more colorful lives and personalities of the girls in our protagonist's life. A generally sweet, at times melancholic, romantic drama tempered by light-hearted comedy.\n\nUnlimited is a military science-fiction drama, featuring much of the same cast of Extra. It introduces us to a world that has been ravaged by an alien invasion, with our protagonist forced into the role of a trainee pilot for the giant mecha used as the mainstay weapons of humanity in the war. While keeping the light-hearted comedy and romance aspects of Extra, its pace is slower, the general tone darker and more melancholic, with a narrative that deals primarily in looking at the lifestyle and values of a world thrown into a long attritional war and the protagonist's attempts to find his own place in it. Starship Troopers (the novel, not the film) meets anime, in a way.\n\nBoth stories are parts of the whole, meant to be read in order and play off each other.\n\nExtra offers something of a branching storyline, with the main heroines Sumika and Meiya possessing a largely shared route, plus one short diverging path for each of the secondary heroines, and a pair of gag endings. All are worth pursuing, except for Chizuru's, and I personally emphasize completing Sumika, Meiya, and Ayamine's stories. Unlimited, on the other hand, possesses a singular story divided into distinct chapters, with choices providing small variations in scenes and determining the possible romantic pairings at the end. There are no routes, and while the particulars will vary, the story will always reach same ultimate conclusion.

There is a lot of story here and the new engine feels snappy and modern.\n\nExtra+Unlimited is about a 8/10 on their own but the whole series when including Alternative is an absolute 10/10. I highly recommend playing through Extra+Unlimited before going through Alternative to get the most out of the series. This is my favourite visual novel series and I hope you will give it a chance.

Muv-Luv means tragedy, determination, alienation, hopelessness, love, comradeship, loss, peace, terror, war. \u201cMuv-Luv\u201d, like the game, uniquely belongs to Muv-Luv, it\u2019s a nonsense word that means nothing in any language, but means so much to you the player. Muv-Luv is also the best damn story in any medium that I have ever experienced. \n\nThis review is basically spoiler free. Watch list is early in case you want to get right to it though.\nThe only necessary things on this list are Muv Luv Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative, the rest though happen in the same place with much the same characters, they give important context and character development\u2026 let\u2019s just say I did not watch them before playing the series and I still loved it but upon reflection I wish that I had.\n\nWatch Order: \n1 -Rumbling Hearts anime: at least 2 episodes, if you enjoy it continue otherwise feel free to stop. Direct prequel to Akane Maniax\n2 -Akane Maniax anime: 3 episode long direct prequel to the muv-luv trilogy, the anime and VN are linearly connected\n3 -Muv Luv Extra: You HAVE to play Meiya and Sumika\u2019s routes, 100% required you play both to get the barest sense out of the trilogy. You also have to play Ayamine\u2019s route in order to make sense of story later down the line. Chizuru or Miki\u2019s route will help, but are not necessary.\n4 -Muv-Luv Unlimited\n5 -Muv Luv Alternative Chronicles Volume 1 VN: spinoff short stories, between Unlimited and Alternative.\n6 -Muv-Luv Alternative\n\nIn case you need more convincing \n\nYou have never seen a piece of work that drags you through the depths of despair and tragedy until you have played Muv-Luv. This trilogy will give YOU the player PTSD, a few months of post-muv-luv depression is common. You cannot have loss without something to lose, you cannot have sadness without dynamic, well developed characters and a well-developed world. Also, yeah, characters and world building are the best of the best here. The trilogy is a hard science fiction series (yay), and a deconstruction of the mecha genre.\n\nExtra and Unlimited are where you experience mostly character and world building and get invested, with a focus on developing the characters of the supporting cast. Alternative is where you finish up the world building (with all questions answered), and you truly develop the main character, then you tear everything down and viciously rip its head off, exposing the quivering mass beneath. \n\nIn Extra/Unlimited the music, artwork/animation, and story are all high quality but nothing game changing. Extra while a subtle parody plays like all the clich\u00e9s in romantic comedies, but has a great cast and a sense of humor. Unlimited is a more unique story, and is surprisingly engaging considering how little outside of character development and world development actually happens in it. The main character is not insufferable, but is a bit annoying and feels at times a little flat in extra/unlimited (but that means his character has room to grow and be dynamic). The supporting cast is fleshed out and very well defined.\n\nAll of these become a 10/10 best you have ever seen ultra high quality in Muv-Luv Alternative, and in fact Alternative will make you improve your opinion retroactively. Extra/Unlimited is designed from the ground up to work for that payoff you get in Alternative. \n\nThe developers have stayed true to the things that made us all love and celebrate the original trilogy, while updating the art, sound, animation, just making it a more beautiful game.\nBUT, Developers, there is still work to do to finish up the game! You need to return to having Unlimited locked from the start! It is narratively important, especially that forced title change, and mechanically important due to saves imported, people can ctrl skip if they want so they still have that option anyways! There are not even any warnings that Extra comes first!\nAlso give us back text speed options! Syncing the text to the voice was wonderful! And more options in general, like choice as to whether or not we have to deal with a jarring music volume change when there is dialogue.\nGreat work so far", "timestamp_created": 1468552789, "timestamp_updated": 1468856911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507451", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24326813": {"recommendationid": "24326813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001157372", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487050674}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this game, the third final game in the main story and played some of the extended releases within the series before this official over seas port.

Matching the quality of the best works by Orson Scott Card.  With Incredible world building, excellent character development, and creative but mostly correct use of quantum physics theory. All while having a plot that is as unpredictable as it is coherent.\nThe symbolisim filled first half, Extra serves as a dream like exaggerated foil to the tragic reality of the second half.  \n\nThis version has been remastered, with improved animations higher resolution and redrawn sprites and backgrounds. It is bugfree, on win 10, unlike the fan translation I played. It does not require patching, compatability mode, or localisation. The game is very long at about 40 to 50 hours total, far longer than most of the Vn's on steam. And is definatly worth the cost. \n\nAs a warning, This is one of the grimmest most realistic war stories you can find, with similar themes and plot to, \"All Quiet on the Western Front\". One of the first film/books to focus on PTSD.

For now, I'll just write my unorganized and probably unhelpful review. If you want a helpful review, then I recommend to look elsewhere. I honestly just want to put a positive review out because Muv-Luv is an amazing trilogy that must be read. Also, I want to add a tip for people that want to read the visual novel.\n\nMuv-Luv (containing Extra and Unlimited) is the first two parts of an amazing trilogy.\n\nMuv-Luv Extra itself is pretty generic. Highschool life, slice of life, love triangle, ect. It's nothing special.\nMany might be tempted to skip this one, but I HIGHLY disagree. Extra is not as good as Alternative or Unlimited, but it's actually fun to read (...except the lacrosse arc...). I just keep on laughing at Takeru's misfortune as a highschool student. Furthermore, it does contain a lot foreshadowing for the events that will occur in Unlimited and Alternative. Moreover, you are giving yourself a reason to care about the characters and you'll understand the protagonist's feelings and actions when reading Alternative and Unlimited. Just read at least Meiya and Sumika's route if you want to read Unlimted/Alternative as fast as possible.\n\nMuv-Luv Unlimited is where this visual novel starts to shift its genre. Basically, this is where things get exciting and where mechas make an appearence.\n\n\nHonestly, I wish I could write more, but this is all I can say. Please enjoy and read Muv-Luv. =)", "timestamp_created": 1468551677, "timestamp_updated": 1468553601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999608", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24326609": {"recommendationid": "24326609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015375020", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468559994}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Muv-Luv. I already read the Muv-Luv trilogy before but I'm definitely happy to be able to start playing it again on Steam after supporting the Kickstarter.\n\nDon't listen to the crazy people who say Extra, the first half of this game, is lame. It's a legitimately charming and funny romantic comedy/slice-of-life that sets up foreshadowing for both the second half, Unlimited, along with the bombastic and heart-breaking finale of Alternative. It also is integral character development for the main character, Takeru, where playing Extra truly puts you in his shoes when you suddenly get your world changed in Unlimited. Who knows? By a certain point in Alternative, you might actually wish to be back in Extra, just like Takeru. And honestly, if you can't sit through a few hours of Extra, the >50 hour length of Alternative is going to be a long trek.\n\nI really recommend playing at least Sumika OR Meiya's route in Extra before jumping into Unlimited. You might have become interested in Muv-Luv because of mecha action or whatever but do yourself a favor and earnestly read the beginning parts of the Muv-Luv series even if you don't particularly care for romance and slice-of-life comedies.

It starts as parody of the rom-com genre in Extra by throwing some of the most insane situations you\u2019ll ever see, only to switch to a slightly more serious sci-fi rom-com in Unlimited. There you\u2019re reintroduced to the cast and setting, but this time taking place after a sort of apocalypse. Once again the story ends without much but the character relationships moving forward, but in the last moments you\u2019re given a glimpse of something much larger happening before the game cuts off. Finally in Alternative everything is laid out before you, but the cost of this knowledge is great indeed, and you\u2019ll find yourself experiencing the kind of story that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to if you hadn\u2019t spent countless hours with the wide array of Muv-Luv\u2019s cast of characters.\nNow that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s talk about this release in particular shall we?\n[list]\n    [*]This game only includes parts 1 (Extra) and 2 (Unlimited) of the series, each an entire visual novel in their own right.

You\u2019re not missing out on anything but the sex scenes, which are at the tail end of each route (1 per girl).\n    [*]This is [i] the best [/i] version of the game by far.

Don't go! Hear me out. That's not actually the best comparison, but bear with me for a few moments.\n\n(Ignore the time spent; I happily admit that I've read through the entirety of this trilogy (third part unreleased, coming soon) 3 times so far. I'm starting my 4th now and was happy to back the Kickstarter for this project.)\n\nI'm here to add one voice to the multitude of clamoring fans: this game is worth the time it takes to read it. That being said, if you don't like reading, give it a try anyways but know you're in for millions of words.\n\nMuv-Luv is a massive visual novel. It's word count easily eclipses such stories as Lord of the Rings and other epic fantasy/sci-fi titles you can name. It's a little old, looks a tad wonky, and definitely doesn't seem like a serious or grave narrative.\n\nIf you think that, you have been successfully fooled. Don't let the imagery - or the banality of Extra (the first part) - get you to lower your guard. Muv-Luv easily encompasses the following areas:\n\nPolitical intrigue. Romance. Psychological trauma. Military life. Mecha. Romantic comedy. Slice of life. PTSD. Mystery. Backstabbing. Friendship.\n\nThere are more, but to say more would be spoilerific. Muv-Luv is an experience. Suffer and chuckle helplessly through Extra, because you'll be grateful you did and miss that comedy later on. Enjoy the change of pace of Unlimited (the second part which absolutely shouldn't be read before Extra). Wait eagerly for the masterpiece that is Altenative (the finale).\n\nThe visuals show their age but are crisp and sharp. The narrative is standard romantic comedy with some good twists here and there for Extra, and features good military-themed settings in Unlimited. The characters are lovable, the narrative on point, and the translation fantastic.\n\nI cannot recommend enough that this game is worth your time and money. Good luck.

And really, the quality of the updated translation is the main draw in purchasing this product, outside of supporting the developers for future localizations in the Muv-Luv series of Visual Novels. In fact, I did a quick playthrough of the previous translation so my expectations could be set in this regard, and I have to say it has currently been exceeded well beyond my imagination. While the previous translation may have been awkward at times, the entire script has basically been re-written in order to flow more organically - at least, that's what I'm taking away from what I'm currently reading. Furthermore, there are additional scenes and dialogue added that I can't remember from the previous translation, so I would say that's worth an experience on its own. I may not entirely get used to Takeru throwing \"Dude\" out every chance he gets, but I'm sure that and other changes will soon grow on me as I continue pushing through the story for the nth time.\n\nThe only negatives I can find in this release are few and far between, as the positives outweigh them in my opinion. In the options screen, there are very little window choices to accomodate various monitors for those who want to view the VN in Fullscreen; but there are, however, options for those who prefer Muv-Luv windowed. For example, my monitor's a 24-inch 1080p/144fps that I use for both gaming and the work I perform - but when I run Muv-Luv on Fullscreen, there are black bars on the left and right edges that I can't seem to get rid of, and the sprites themselves look washed out and have a bit of an aliasing issue that may just be nitpicking on my end in terms of quality. Who knows, if enough noise is made, the development team may add further settings to the options menu in order to accommodate for this, but do not take my word as law in that regard; I'm actually quite content with the presentation as it currently stands, because it is leaps and bounds improved from the fan-translated version, but I thought it should still be noted.\n\nOne other thing that might deter newcomers to the series is the lack of barrier when progressing to \"Muv-Luv Unlimited\". As it currently stands, you can skip Extra entirely and go straight to Unlimited. For long-time fans of the series, it is known that Extra is essential to Unlimited is essential to Alternative, creating the experience that is currently the number one ranked Visual Novel available in the West (regardless of how one feels about endless Lacrosse matches). Unfortunately, anyone that doesn't already get the gist of Muv-Luv may not understand that quite a bit of content may be missed if they just jump straight to Unlimited - or, worse case scenario, Alternative - in both a story sense and an emotional sense. While the developers and localization team have issued a statement about this through Kickstarter, I can agree with them on the points they have brought up - and at the same time suggest some improvements in that regard. Yes, the option to jump straight into Unlimited should still be available, not just for newcomers drawn into the Post-Apocalypse Sci-Fi setting who do not wish to run multiple routes of Extra, but for returnees who still have nightmares about Lacrosse Hell. This could be improved through the addition of a window warning those who have not completed Extra if they wish to continue with the full knowledge that the events in Unlimited are a direct continuation of Extra, and that character development may be missed entirely otherwise (with the suggestion of at least completing Sumika and Meiya's route, of course). This should hopefully please the majority on both sides of the potential internet argument that I can hear from a mile away regarding this issue.\n\nTo finalize, I am of the opinion that the Muv-Luv Trilogy is one of my all-time favorite Visual Novel experiences, and I am absolutely on board with any and all localizations to other titles in the series (specifically, Schwarzesmarken Part I and the upcoming Part II - please localize at super-sonic speed, Degica, I beg of you). I should also disclose that I have pledged several hundred dollars to the Muv-Luv Kickstarter, and will also be receiving Alternative and Photonflowers/melodies because of it, so I may be biased in regards to my recommendation. Hopefully Muv-Luv will be able to reach further successes once it's in the hands of non-backers, and the dream of an original trilogy anime adaption inches ever closer.", "timestamp_created": 1468550477, "timestamp_updated": 1468550477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465116", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24326438": {"recommendationid": "24326438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046084696", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497497900}, "language": "english", "review": "Its pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1468550411, "timestamp_updated": 1468550411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999608", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24326398": {"recommendationid": "24326398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010699910", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508831241}, "language": "english", "review": "A great Visual Novel to start with for people who are new to playing VN's.\nOnly three hours in and I can't wait to play the second half.", "timestamp_created": 1468550210, "timestamp_updated": 1468550210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999608", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24326392": {"recommendationid": "24326392", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983361266", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468550217}, "language": "english", "review": "I played through Extra, Unlimited and Alternative some years ago so my review is based mostly on the game itself and its story rather than Degica's release. However, this is essentially the definitive version and for Extra/Unlimited it certainly ticks all the right boxes. The game itself is now in a very close to 16:9 aspect ratio, compared to the original 4:3,  without a stretching of the assets that we can see when some VNs attempt to accomodate for widescreen. The main menus are remastered with art from the later console releases, and we're also presented with the option of playing Unlimited straight away, instead of having to clear the two main heroine's routes as was the case with the original Japanese release. This is a welcome addition in many regards, although I can't recommend enough that you at least play through Extra once even if you don't pursue one of the main girls' routes as the sudden \"shift\" that we see into Unlimited requires the set up from Extra.\n\nNow on to the game itself. Extra is in the best way of saying things, a relatively generic and completely standard dating sim. It doesn't do anything exceptional, nor does it do anything particularly poorly. The characters vary in depth and likability, with their routes varying in similar ways. I feel that Sumika and Meiya are afforded the most fleshed out stories given their place as the main heroines, but some of the other girls do offer surprisingly enjoyable routes, however there are times when you can't help but feel they're lacklustre in comparison. The story itself is extremely normal as far as high school romance/comedy plot lines go. However, despite having no dizzying heights of excellence it does suffer from some rather dull and sometimes outright boring lows. They detract partially from the overall experience, especially if you're playing Extra purely to get to the rest of the series and looking to get it over with as fast as possible. However, most routes progress acceptably and offer a nice resolution to their plot lines in the end. To put it simply, Extra is a pretty fun dating sim but it suffers from being a necessary first step in a trilogy that has such a strong pedigree. Many expect excellence from the get go and mediocrity alone would be dissapointing, so when things get boring it seems even worse. Approach Extra with a light mindset, and look to get as much as you can from the enjoyable character interactions and comedic situations and you'll probably come out of the experience happy, or at least satisfied. As a title enjoyed most of all in retrospect after completing the trilogy, it certainly presents itself as the oddball for newcomers. Stick with it, and when you play through the rest of the series you'll certainly be pleasantly surprised.\n\nContinuing on to Unlimited, I personally not only find it to be a lot more interesting when compared to Extra but also quite compelling even as a stand alone title. The dramatic shift of environments and plot direction evoke an excellent sense of displacement when one comes from the normality of Extra, and I feel it helps to emulate the feelings (to a very minimal degree) that our main character is also experiencing. The world building in Unlimited I found to be excellent, and it kept me hooked from start to finish. We're experiencing things from the perspective of the main character who knows about as much as we do, so the drip feed of information as the plot progresses is incredibly compelling. What exactly happened in this world? What is humanity up against? You're always kept tantalisingly close to finding out more, but suitably in the dark as one would expect for our main character's current position in the world and overall story. Compared to Extra, Unlimited offers much less choice in affecting the story and choosing routes. One can pick their favourite girl in a similar manner, but events are much more tied to the relatively strict narrative. I feel that this affords Unlimited to have more time to explore the aspects that it wants to show to the reader, rather than to cater to various different plot lines.\n\nDespite these strengths Unlimited isn't without its own faults. Much of the light hearted tone carries over from Extra and it can seem to be starkly out of place at times, compared to the gritty tone established through the world building. With Unlimited essentially being a prequel to Alternative in terms of plot and world building, it also suffers in the limitations of its scope. The information drip that I talked about earlier can sometimes dry up frustratingly, and leave one feeling left too much in the dark and wanting to delve deeper into the world. In this respect, and similarly to Extra, it suffers slightly as it's best enjoyed in unison with Alternative and the trilogy as a whole; similarly to Extra it also benefits from being enjoyed more retrospectively as one progresses through the final part of the trilogy. None the less, these weaknesses don't detract enough from the title for it to be unenjoyable, and I find that for those who are here for the action, the mechs and the excellence that Alternative is said to offer are able to find much enjoyment in the second entry. It doesn't really suffer from similar lows of boredom that Extra has, and largely offers a robust experience from start to finish. Judging it as it is, it stands as an excellent preface to the bulk of the saga which comes in the form of Alternative.\n\nFor newcomers to the series, Extra is an average dating sim that's worth a play through for the set up for the rest of the series. Unlimited offers us an exciting peak into the Alternative universe, and serves to whet one's appetite admirably in anticipation of the final entry. Its plot is both more interesting, infinitely less standard, and overall more enjoyable than that offered by Extra, yet the set up from Extra is absolutely vital to fully enjoy the world and story of Unlimited.

The reason is amazing and you should if possible go into it as blind as possible.\n\nI would like to note a few things you need to know that aren\u2019t spoilers but will prevent you from ruining your experience.\n\nThe first is you must play Extra first. While the game allows you to skip it for some reason with this release you will be losing all the characterization and you won\u2019t enjoy the other two parts nearly as well.\n\nThe second is you should at the very least play Kagami Sumika\u2019s route for the full enjoyment or for the way that the Japanese version did it and is really a good idea is to also play through Mitsurugi Meiya\u2019s route.  You could technically get away with just playing Meiya\u2019s route and having an okay experience.\n\nThe order that I would however suggest to do is Mitsurugi Meiya > Kagami Sumika  > Any other side characters you care about (Tamase Miki has a good route imo)  >  Move onto unlimited.\n\nOne last thing is that the game will be getting a 18+ patch but they haven\u2019t released it at the time of this review. I will attempt to remember to update the review if they add the translation patch for how to get the patch. Hopefully they won\u2019t charge people who didn\u2019t back the game on kickstarter for it like myself.\n\nAnyways I hope you enjoy the game, I know I did. :) \n\nOn a side note\u2026 The translation was cleaned up since the fan translation a lot so hopefully people will enjoy the Extra part of the game a lot more than previously :)", "timestamp_created": 1468549882, "timestamp_updated": 1468549905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999608", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24326328": {"recommendationid": "24326328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183919711", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480111123}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantasic.

Muv Luv Alternative is amazing and one of my favourite stories ever. I cried many times reading it and bought the physical edition on Kickstarter. On the other hand, this release, Muv Luv, consists of two parts - Muv Luv Extra and Muv Luv Unlimited. Extra is the first part and should not be skipped or you'll miss out on important character and plot development, as well as the interesting contrast with the following parts.\n\nUnforutnately, Extra is overly long for what it is (light romantic comedy) and fairly boring at times. Persevere and enjoy the occasional decent humour and some cute romance. Follow the routes for Sumika and/or Meiya - those are the two main routes and the choices for them are obvious. Then proceed to Unlimited, which is darker and more interesting, but still mostly just setup for Alternative.

TL;DR: this is mandatory reading for visual novel fans even though, by itself, it isn't all too great (yet). Also, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT SKIP EXTRA. Also, FUCK LACROSSE.\n\n===Why does this game matter?===\n\nIf you like visual novels, you pretty much need to play all of MuvLuv. It's one of the most well-respected visual novel franchises ever and is a staple of the medium. It's also the highest-rated VN on VNDB by a commanding margin.\n\nThe problem is that the REASON it's so well-received isn't really present in this chapter of the story. This entire product is pretty much entirely buildup for one of the greatest stories to come out of Japanese anime culture, MuvLuv Alternative. \n\nTo make things clear, there are three main chapters of MuvLuv: Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative. The first two are included in this Steam product and the third, Alternative, is on its way. \n\nThis Steam product is still better than the majority of visual novels on Steam at the moment (though that's more a testament to the shitty state of VNs in the West at the moment) but if you are expecting something as story-rich as Steins;Gate, Umineko, or CLANNAD, you will be disappointed. \n\nUntil Alternative comes out. \n\n===Is it worth it to put in 20 hours into a game just so I can read the sequel?===\nYes. Absolutely yes. There is no doubt in my mind that anybody who is willing to put in the investment will be blown away by Alternative. I mean it. I have never met anybody who finished Alternative who didn't value that experience or ended up regretting sticking with it 'til the end.\n\nIt's fucking amazing, that's why. There is so much I can say WORKS about Alternative, but I don't want to lose focus here. I feel it's worth saying that this is a sci-fi / mech story, but that's not really the focus of the series --- most of the thematic content deals with the human element of warfare, which doesn't sound like a unique concept, but Alternative's spin on things is groundbreaking (at least for the medium and for anime as a whole).\n\n===How is the localization?===\nAltogether it's pretty great, even though there are some changes I found strange or didn't like. The translation is still spot-on, the game is stable, and there are new BGMs which are alright. I wasn't a fan of how they replaced the Unlimited OP, but YMMV. Seeing this game in Alternative's aspect ratio was a little jarring at first and might reduce some of the anticipation for Alternative (since, for me, a huge part of the HYPE was seeing the massive increase in production quality between MuvLuv and Alternative, an effect which will probably be dampened here) but I understand why they did it. \n\nSomething I'm really not a big fan of is how they allow the player to bypass Extra and jump right into Unlimited. For those about to read the VN, you absolutely MUST NOT skip Extra. Play at least one route. Trust me. The entirety of Unlimited is predicated on the fact that you read routes from Extra. I can't imagine it working as well otherwise.\n\nHowever, I can't be too salty, since it's really amazing that this game in particular was able to be localized at all.

It's an introspective epic, full of action, comedy, and pathos. I consider it a masterpiece, not only within its genre, but among all contemporary fiction.\n\nIf you are at all interested in mecha, this is a must-play. If you are enjoy military fiction (e.g. [i]Starship Troopers[/i]), you will love this. If you want visceral drama -- if you want to feel hope, horror, sadness, and relief -- this game will take your emotions for a ride. If you want to read something with intricate detail in military operations and quantum mechanics, this is it.\n\nYet it's difficult to recommend.\n\nMuv-Luv is a visual novel (all story, no gameplay) originally released in 2003. It comprises the first two entries in the Muv-Luv trilogy: Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv Unlimited. The final and most renowned entry, Muv-Luv Alternative, was released as a separate product in 2006, and, accordingly, the English localization will be sold separately.\n\nIf that's confusing: don't worry about it. Point is, this game is only 2/3rds of the full Muv-Luv experience, but it's the entire original game. For the purposes of this review, I'm looking at the series as a whole.\n\nWhy is Muv-Luv difficult to recommend to newcomers? The main reason is its sheer length. Extra and Unlimited together (that is, this Steam product) will probably take an average reader 40+ hours to complete. Alternative is about another 50+ hours on top of that. The whole series is bigger than most other VNs, including Clannad, Fate/stay night, and YU-NO. It has more words than [i]War and Peace[/i] twice over, or all the Harry Potter books put together. It is [b]long[/b].\n\nIf that scares you, turn back now.\n\nStill with me? Of course, the prose is nowhere near as dense as [i]War and Peace[/i], and a very large portion is voiced dialogue that goes at a comfortable peace. The series has highly advanced graphics by VN standards, with moving sprites, traditional animation, and 3D scenes, and a phenomenal soundtrack featuring JAM Project. It's not a dry read by any means.\n\nBut compounding the issue of length is that the game doesn't fully blossom until its final part, Muv-Luv Alternative. The themes that compose its central drama are merely touched upon in Extra, and Unlimited only goes toe-deep into the pool. For that reason, there are some who advocate skipping Extra, or Extra and Unlimited, entirely.\n\nThere's some merit to the idea. Frankly, Extra isn't anything special by itself. It's a generic romantic comedy, albeit a fun and amusing one, with little of import to say. Unlimited is largely the same thing, except with a change in milieu and some minor mecha elements.\n\nHowever, I strongly recommend against skipping straight to Alternative. Not only would you lose out on crucial story, foreshadowing, and character development, it would be missing the entire point of Muv-Luv.\n\nI have been intentionally scant on plot details throughout this review, but I can safely say this: Muv-Luv is about what we take for granted. It's about the duty one bears not only to himself, but to his country and his loved ones. The protagonist, Shirogane Takeru, lives a blissful, unaware life at the story's beginning. By the end, he will be confronted and challenged time and again, forced to evaluate himself and strive toward virtue.\n\nThe banality of Extra, then, is a crucial part of the experience. It grounds ourselves (as readers) in a world similar to our own, if slightly wackier and more harem-centric. When that carefree lifestyle is taken away from our protagonist, we feel the loss too. And when glimpses of it return later on -- fragments of peace amid despair -- we cherish it all the more.\n\nWhat Muv-Luv does is bold and unusual. The first 20+ hours that a reader invests into the series are of enormously different character than its greatest part. Pragmatically speaking, that isn't bearable for most people, especially since it's polarizing content in its own right (being anime-inspired, reliant on Japanese culture, etc.).\n\nMoreover, even when Muv-Luv is at its best, it's not the sort of writing that will appeal to all tastes. Lengthy action scenes are marked by even lengthier build-ups, and there are frequent monologues during periods of reflection. And tangential \u201cinfodump\u201d scenes break up the pace to flesh out the world and explain events in more detail than practically necessary. These aspects make for excellent immersion and worldbuilding (think [i]The Lord of the Rings[/i]), but can be off-putting to a reader looking for nothing more than hot-blooded action and drama.\n\nSo Muv-Luv is not for everybody.\n\nBut I love this game and wish for it to be loved by more. \n\nIf you haven't played a visual novel before, but find what I've said appealing and aren't scared away by the copious amounts of moe, give it a shot! If you are a fan of visual novels but haven't played Muv-Luv, what are you waiting for?

And given how Degica chose to promote this release - by spoiling elements presented later on in Muv-Luv Unlimited in their released media - my review will cover both Extra and Unlimited and the bare story elements contained within each. Excluding that, my review will be spoiler-free. Additionally, I will rarely talk about the final part of the trilogy (Muv-Luv Alternative) in this review which plans to release on Steam in Q4 of 2016.\n\n \n\n[h1]Muv-Luv Extra + Unlimited Overview[/h1]\n\nSince its release in early 2003, the Muv-Luv trilogy has risen to be one of the most well-regarded and popular visual novels (aka VNs) ever released, with its final work, Muv-Luv Alternative, being ranked #1 on the [url=https://vndb.org/v/all?q=;fil=tagspoil-0;rfil=;o=d;s=rating]Visual Novel Database[/url] and ranked in the top three in Japan's VN rankings. Ever since its fan localization, the series has gained worldwide recognition enough to be later be the #1 most funded visual novel and ranked in the top 30 most funded video game on Kickstarter raising over $1.25 million in support. Length-wise, this two-part story spans the length of 25-40 hours varying, especially if one decides to read the extra routes presented in both.\n\n \n\n[h1]UI, Translation, and Aesthetic/Music[/h1]\n\nIn comparison to the original, the UI has dramatically improved, with a beautiful options screen coated in a glorious pink containing a wide range of options. The only change I would like to see is the addition of sliders for text speed and auto-read speed instead of the default Slow, Medium, and Fast.\n\n \n\nAs for the translation, Degica has made a notable improvement in cleaning the rough grammar and wording that the English fan translation lacked. Additionally, there is an option for Japanese text as well (but as an non-Japanese speaker, I have a hard time evaluating it).\n\n \n\nOpinions vary regarding the aesthetic of the game, but in my opinion it\u2019s passable. Although the character designs are quite rough and outdated, they are cute and simple. My feelings are quite similar about the CG and backgrounds.\n\n \n\n[h1]The Story and Thoughts[/h1]\n\nMuv-Luv Extra follows the story of typical high school protagonist, Shirogane Takeru, and consists of a wacky slice-of-life romantic comedy involving a wide array of potential romantic interests the player can romance. Other than having a couple of interesting and absurd plot revelations, ML Extra is a pretty stereotypical romantic comedy with some interesting deviations. Apart from the two main heroines, Kagami Sumika and Meiya Mitsurugi, the other pursuable love interests are uninteresting and tropey. Despite this, ML Extra is still a passable love story with some single tear-worthy and funny moments. Although it\u2019s nothing special, I'd still recommend reading it if one would want to read a cute romcom and for the main purpose of getting to ML Unlimited (and later ML Alternative), as those two pieces are worth the read and reward the player for reading through ML Extra.\n\n \n\nMuv-Luv Unlimited consists of the same group of characters introduced in ML Extra, but setting-wise, is completely different. In this sequel, the player is introduced into a whole new world, one consisting of sci-fi technology and concepts including mechs, aliens, and much more. Originally, Unlimited was supposed to be revealed as a surprise to ML Extra players later on, but with the way Degica promoted this two-part game, any and all elements of surprise regarding this setting were abandoned. In comparison to ML Extra, little is different regarding the characters. Story-wise there's not much to praise or complain about with the bulk of it being so-so. The introduction of mechs and military certainly up the interest though and were fun elements the characters dived into. Fortunately, towards the end, there is a huge spike in quality regarding the story in its attempt to set up the player for the later masterpiece, Muv-Luv Alternative.\n\n \n\n[h1]In Conclusion[/h1] (or TL;DR)\n\nML Extra and Unlimited are passable pieces of fiction, and although are nice in various parts, are average overall. Despite this, the reading experience was still enjoyable, and reading these two pieces are definitely worth it in preparation for reading ML Alternative in the near future, which I believe to be one of the greatest pieces of military sci-fi fiction to have ever released.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1468548451, "timestamp_updated": 1468548451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999608", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24326017": {"recommendationid": "24326017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005605248", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503600811}, "language": "english", "review": "**PA FOR THOSE READING FOR THE FIRST TIME, READ EXTRA FIRST GODAMNIT DOING OTHERWISE RUINS THE EXPERIENCE**\n\nSoooo after a fairly decent wait, however not long at all considering how other kickstarters have worked, we finally have the first two (Technically one) VN's in the muv luv triology, since i have read both of these thrice over or so i'll just do a quick review after skimming sumika's route\n\nFirst up, they have done an excellent job importing this to the Alternative engine, this brings more life to the vn with actual movement and lip animation in the characters and of course a 16:9 resolution over the original 4:3\n\nAlong with that they have also improved the translation quality which is amazing considering it didn't take too long for this to be released, they also added an option to switch between english and japanese image text (and normal text) which is also another bonus\n\nAnyway on to the vn itself\n\nExtra:\n\nThis is a generic romance, not going to hold anything back because this is my favorite VN series of all time, the characters are all cliche as f*ck however they aren't that bad in  terms of writing, the reason why Extra is techinically 'bad' is because the entire setting and such makes the characters act in a typical uninteresting way which is what this triology relies on heavily. You have your main character which can appear as a 'self insert' if you lok at it that way although he generally is a lot more agressive and a lot less, ahem, frgid?, you'll also notice that Extra likes to make fun of typical romance tropes, a lot actually since the bulk of this game is pure comedy which isn't that bad\n\nOverall without spoiling, Extra is a romance with decent comedy, general charcters and settings, nothing is surprising and it's fine that way, how much you enjoy extra will be based on your experience with the Romance/SoL settings in general\n\nNext up is:\nUnlimited:\n\nYes, this is where the story takes about a 90 degree turn (180 is alternative) and thrusts our poor Shirogane in to an entirely different world, or is it?\n\n*SPOILERS START HERE*\n\nThis is where everything starts to get interesting, the entire world has been at war for over 50-60 years with an alien race codenamed BETA [Beings of Extra-Terrestrial origin that are Adversarys of the human race) and the town he had lived in was now a crumbled mess and he 'spawned' in his house in the same location as his house in the previous world, a quick walk around town still leads him to believe it to be a dream, it's only when he approaches a seemingly miltaristic base where his school used to be that he starts realising it's a reality, or well, kind of\n\nUnlimited largely relies on your familiarity with the cast as they all appear in Unlimited (MINUS ONE), while yes it does rely on slice of life and romance genres like Extra, the setting and events all push it out differently, All the characters still retain their personalities of the previous world however due to their experiences and such in this world their ideologies and such differ a little and Takeru realises this quickly, however there's no point to dulging in to this quickly as Unlimited just scratches on the surface at what will come in to Alternative\n\nAnyway, Unlimited is quite a bit more enjoyable than alternative, it does delve in to much deeper themes and many serious events occur which start to flesh out these counter-parts of the characters you experienced in the dream world of extra whilst still retaining the dreamish feeling by avoiding any drastic or downright dark events, keeping unlimited still in the realms of a slice of life, it also exists to familiarise you with the BETAVERSE, how the political structure is working, how the civilians and the military think and work, all of this incredibly strong worldbuilding exists here and should not be skimmed over, while it isn't shown a full timeline exists showing every single event since the beta landed over 60 years ago.\n\nThe VN ends off at a point which makes you ask questions, i'm not going to lie as this is not a VN with a 'happy' ending, the ending is supposed to make you anticipated for the sequel, in the end there is nothing that could be done and the dream is shattered, it's definitely an ending that will hit you if you have actualyl read Extra + Unlimited\n\nI'll post a suggestion on the routes here:\n\nExtra: \nSumika - REQUIRED\nMeiya - REQUIRED\nAyamine - Largely Suggested\nClass Rep - Choice, though it's similarity to Ayamines \nTama - Complete choice as this route doesn't explore much\netc\n\nUnlimited:\nComplete choice since all the routes are the same except the ending is different\nAs in it's the same event but different heroine etc\nHowever i suggest doing Meiya's (I did Ayamine the first time around, Meiya second)\n\nAnyway that's my, ahem, quick review of this VN, probably just sounds like ramblings to most people\n\nSuggestion status:\nREAD IT AND WAIT SHIVERING IN YOUR TSF FOR ALTERNATIVE\n\nOoooor go read Alternative Projects translation of it, your choice\n\nEDIT:\n\nAfter finshing the vn 100% (all achievements) i can say they did a great job in localisation, other than renaming Eishi to their proper name Surface Pilots\nAlong with that they added voice lines and extra animations in as well as additional CG's which bring everything together nicely\nNo issues with it after being made on to the Alternative engine\nOnly thing i found weird was that whilst the marimo scene was still in there, there was no 'bad end', also the unlimited\ncommon route isn't there either\nAnyway, go read now!", "timestamp_created": 1468548297, "timestamp_updated": 1468548297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999608", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24326014": {"recommendationid": "24326014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049848661", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481434080}, "language": "english", "review": "I consider this game (and its sequel, Muv-Luv Alternative) to be the best piece of fiction I've ever read.

Imagine Extra and Unlimited as Frodo's time in the Shire up to Rivendell and the journey ends just before the fellowship is formed. Seems a bit lame right? Though enjoyable, it's unfullfilled, it had potential, but didn't go as far as it could. However, Muv-Luv Alternative comes along and finished up the Fellowship of the Ring, Twin Towers, and Return of the King. The beginning of the fellowship is damn good, but it wouldn't be good if that was it. That's muvluv. But its alright, because you're reading this for Alternative. You're reading the trilogy. I may seem like I'm underplaying how good extra and unlimited are, but I don't want you to go in with high expectations and not have them met.

Yes most definitely. If you enjoy Sci-Fi stories with great characters that have depth, then this game is for you. Muv-Luv is a visual novel so that means it's basically a virtual book with some light choice making that puts you on different story paths.\n\nBefore you start there's a pretty big change from the original, it lets you choose which story arc you want to start with. While it may be tempting to immediately jump into Unlimited, the one that seems the most interesting. However the best way to play it in my opinion is to crack open Extra and play through Sumika and Meiya's routes.\n\nThe reason being is that playing through those two routes will establish characters and events that the other will constantly flash back to. \n\nIn terms of this port, it's fantastic. The original version was notorious for crashing and glitching out and that is completely absent from this version. The updated UI looks way better than the cumbersom 90's visual novel UI that the original has. And finally the presentation was updated to match Alternative's, with no text boxes and animated sprites.\n\nOverall this game is great and and the story is fantastic. I'd recommend getting it as soon as you can before Alternative comes out so you can jump immediately into it.", "timestamp_created": 1468548131, "timestamp_updated": 1468548131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553581", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24325976": {"recommendationid": "24325976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077105674", "num_games_owned": 581, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468514232}, "language": "english", "review": "Muv-Luv is a franchise that first began as a visual novel way back in 2003, THIRTEEN years ago. It is only now that the game is officially available in English for the first time and on Steam. The Steam store page for Muv-Luv claims that it is the \"most highly-acclaimed visual novel series of all time\" and to be honest, that is actually possible. No VN series gained as much acclaim as Muv-Luv did, especially considering the age of the original VN. Muv-Luv to visual novels is like what Star Wars is to movies. It has gained sequels and spin-offs in the form of other VNs, manga and anime.\n\nThe Muv-Luv VN that you can purchase here is a story that comprises of two arcs; Extra and Unlimited. Extra starts out as what you can call your \"basic VN love story\" where the hero has to choose between girls but when the Unlimited arc starts, things kick into high gear. The series explores storytelling elements like timelines or alternate realities but what is prominent in all Muv-Luv media since the Unlimited arc is the fight of the human characters against aliens called the BETA (Beings of the Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of human race). And fans are drawn to the franchise's own spin on giant robots called TSFs (Tactical Surface Fighters). Unlike many other Japanese franchises, TSFs are named and based on real-world military aircraft. My favorite for example is the F-22A Raptor.\n\nSince this is a VN, the gameplay (or lack of, if you're cynical) is what you would expect. Muv-Luv follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the differing scenarios of the female main characters. Personally, I think Muv-Luv has a lot more choices than most visual novels and the game has multiple plot lines that the player can follow, one for each heroine in the story, and there's supposedly nineteen possible endings. The game even fails you for making the wrong decision. To view all the plotlines, it is highly recommended to replay the game and make different decisions.\n\nAll in all, if you're into VNs, Muv-Luv is more than worth it to purchase and play through many times. It has an interesting world, characters and plot. You won't regret getting invested in the story. However, if you're not the type that plays visual novels or can't stand that much reading, then obviously it's best that you move on and play something else. If you play it and enjoy it, the story doesn't end there. Unlimited is followed by Muv-Luv: Alternative which should be released by the end of the year. And yes, there's going to be a R18+ patch, apparently. You can never have enough \"plot\". \n\nP.S. Despite what you hear from some people who already know the story, DON'T SKIP EXTRA!!! Yes, the game gives you the option of going straight into Unlimited which is the more \"exciting\" arc but if you truly want the full experience, play Extra first, ESPECIALLY if this is your first time playing Muv-Luv.

That said, its legendary status is only made apparent after reading all three games: Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative (note that this Steam title includes both Extra and Unlimited). While I would be cautious to recommend only Extra and Unlimited, I wholeheartedly recommend them in the context of the entire trilogy. Extra is redeemed by Unlimited and you will be thoroughly rewarded with Alternative.\n\nThis is a difficult game to explain without spoilers. So difficult, in fact, that the official Steam description and preview video delve into spoiler territory. Regardless, I will try to stay spoiler-free.\n\nMuv-Luv is a visual novel trilogy and franchise that is highly celebrated in both Japan and the west. On EGS (Japanese), Alternative is ranked the #3 VN of all time. On VNDB (English), Alternative is ranked the #1 VN of all time by a significant margin (July 2016).\n\nThis Steam title, Muv-Luv, includes the first two parts of the trilogy: Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv Unlimited.\n\nI implore you to not skip straight to Unlimited (Part 2). Extra (Part 1), despite being slow, is a requirement to fully set the characters and tone for the sequels. This series truly is something special, but only when read in full.\n\nMuv-Luv Extra is your generic anime high-school rom-com. The MC, Takeru, is your generic self-insert protagonist. Meiya is the generic affluent ojou-sama. Sumika is the generic short-tempered childhood friend. Ayamine is the generic Rei expy. I could go on.\n\nWhile Extra is not terrible, it's nothing special on its own. It's leagues better than many VNs on Steam, that's for sure, but its real purpose is to build up the characters and set the scene for the remaining two games.\n\nUnlimited--which is included in this release--is where things start to get unique and interesting (sci-fi, mecha, drama) but you must read Extra to fully appreciate it (and also to eventually appreciate Alternative, which is god-tier).\n\nART: Despite being an old game, Muv-Luv's art holds up surprisingly well. The rUGP engine was ahead of its time, and that helps breathe life into the visuals for Muv-Luv. The artwork itself, while aged, has an undeniable charm that keeps it fresh even in the age of perfectly polished HD assets.\n\nMUSIC: You may have heard that Muv-Luv has an incredible soundtrack. Anyone saying that is referring to Alternative, which does have a phenomenal OST. Unfortunately, this is not true for Extra nor Unlimited. The slice of life soundtracks are repetitive in the worst way and there's not a wide variety of them.\n\nVOICE: The voices, overall, are pretty good. I would prefer to have a fully voiced MC, but the performances from the rest of the voice actors make up for it.\n\nANIMATION: Muv-Luv was made long before the Live-2D or e-Mote systems were implemented and stood out as having brilliant animation for its time. The animation, especially in this renewed edition, still stands strong. You won't see most of the animated scenes until Unlimited (and only then ultimately polished in Alternative), but these scenes further down the line make you feel like you're watching a well-choreographed cutscene.\n\nSTORY: The series is praised for good reason. Unfortunately, it doesn't shine until Unlimited and doesn't fully blossom until Alternative. You will have to trust me on this one: Extra is a slow trudge, but you'll be happy to have not skipped it when reading Alternative.\n\nThis ended up longer than I expected. Should you buy this game? Yes, absolutely. But you must also buy and play Alternative for the full experience.", "timestamp_created": 1468548047, "timestamp_updated": 1480351255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 293, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.908928", "comment_count": "29", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24325957": {"recommendationid": "24325957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077095584", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482679999}, "language": "bulgarian", "review": "The first two parts of the highest rated visual novel in the visual novel database.It might start a little slow,but every second of this grand adventure is really worth it.

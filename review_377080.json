Also,[/spoiler] I played Team Fortress 2. Also played Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star.\n\nThis is a visual novel game, being more on the \"novel\" end of the spectrum with all the reading involved. There are still opportunities to make decisions, and said decisions can still have consequences. So make sure you save when you need to. \nThere are 4 main episodes, with about 6 mini-episodes and about 6 radio episodes. Each are fairly independent from each other, though there are some occasional small references to other episodes. I also find that the game makes some rather obscure references to Japanese culture, birds and the visual novel genre itself, so it helps to have an internet browser open to look up anything weird you come across like \"manyoshu\" or \"moe\". \n\nThe storyline is as ridiculous as you would expect it to be, especially with the introduction of Miru+Kaku (comedy relief), Tohri [spoiler](self-proclaimed villain?)[/spoiler] and The King [spoiler](the true villain!)[/spoiler]. Much like the first game, things start off with a simple plot, and then escalates to a bigger scheme and then finishes with a final punchline. \nSometimes the main episodes can feel longer than you'd expected, and I think it took me about 15 to 30 minutes per episode, since I try to read the story and all.\nI liked the Picture Book sections in the last two episodes. They can be rather abstract stories, but really set the transition well for the last episode because of the tone used and the stakes in the storyline at those key moments.\nThe last episode was certainly a real gut buster. Not only because of the inherent shift in storyline tone, but also because of the feels that each character struggles with and how to overcome themselves. I mean, I sort of felt bad for The King at that point of the story, but you know enough of the truth by then.\n\nThe mini-episodes are tremendously shorter than the main episodes. They revolve around little non-canonical adventures, like Legumentines with Okosan, and the Kyoto field trip. Nothing too serious but still moderately entertaining, sort of like the filler episodes from your favourite anime show. \n\nThe radio episodes are essentially Q&A sessions with Ryouta and other characters to answer fan mail...apparently. Some of the episodes reference the secret BBL ending of the first game, so be aware of that. Otherwise, nothing too serious there and moderately entertaining.\n\nThe music is nice, I still can't believe Yuuya gets his own theme played whenever he enters the scene. It's a groovy tune, admittedly. Sound is used occasionally, and is usualy just for simple things like plates being smashed or Okosan running off. \n\nAchievements are fairly easy. Just watch the episodes and their variants, and that's basically that. \n\nIn conclusion, I'd say this is a good 9/10.\nIt would help to have an autosave feature after certain segments of the story so I don't have to skip through everything [i]again[/i]. Also, I miss the option to have human versions of the characters (this is only available in the Shrine Visit mini-episode).", "timestamp_created": 1498480878, "timestamp_updated": 1498480878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.729714", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32679943": {"recommendationid": "32679943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096885327", "num_games_owned": 597, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462825807}, "language": "english", "review": "liked the first one? then, what are you waiting for? get this already! \n\nnote, this is an alternate universe. which confused me for a moment. but it's really good too, even if quite shorter.", "timestamp_created": 1498222813, "timestamp_updated": 1498222813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31996399": {"recommendationid": "31996399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347270414", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509443278}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved it!

And, it's fixed by just exiting to the main menu and reloading a save.\n\nThe progression of the story itself is similar to the previous game, in that it starts out cheerful and silly, then slowly becomes more of a heavy experience.

And by played, I mean finished (yes, THAT ending.) You may get routes from the first game spoiled if you play this one first. Also, this one probably just won't do much for you if you don't already know the characters and scenarios.\n\nA fair amount Holiday Star is fanservice for people who liked the first Hatoful Boyfriend (and how could you not?) When I first started Holiday Star, I was a bit disappointed that it didn't seem as substantive at the first game. It doesn't follow the typical branching-path format of visual novels like the first game; rather, Holiday Star has a main menu with many options, which take you to the four core stories and some shorter bonus stories. None of these stories have a very large amount of choices or endings. Imagine that if the first Hatoful Boyfriend's story structure is a tree, Holiday Star's is a hedge. The advantage of this is that there's less repetition and less trial-and-error than the first game, at the cost of feeling more episodic rather than like one cohesive plot.\n\nWith that said, there is some VERY GOOD content in Holiday Star. The first two of the four main stories are pretty silly (but the premise of the games is pretty silly on the surface, so what was I expecting, I guess.) One is about some thieves stealing Christmas trees, and the other involves magical girls and a fashionable supervillain. They're fun, short-ish romps that fans will probably get a kick out of, but no tears. The side stories are also pretty cute, and you can play some of them using art of the birds' human appearances, which are more expressive.\n\nThe real meat, though, is in the third and fourth main stories, which center around the cast going to a dream-like world called the Holiday Star, where they meet a very important new character called The King. If you've finished the first game (yes, THAT ending - I can't figure out how to do the spoiler tag thing here, but the letters BBL should ring a bell) I think you'll have an idea of what to expect here in terms of depth and emotional impact, although the feel is quite different. These stories are significantly longer than the first two, and directly follow one another, as well. They have really pretty, storybook-esque art that fits with the weird fairytale atmosphere of the Holiday Star itself. They explain some backstory not revealed in the first game, and may make you view one or two of the characters is a new light. They are also maybe MORE depressing than anything in the first game. No kidding.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you finished the first game and the idea of getting more content like that interests you, do yourself a favor and throw a few bucks at this. You can finish everything in under 10 hours. If the first game didn't appeal to you, don't bother with this unless you go back to the first game and realize it's been great all along.", "timestamp_created": 1480414797, "timestamp_updated": 1480415005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503220", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27729518": {"recommendationid": "27729518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094623251", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482001019}, "language": "english", "review": "Better paced than the original and good OST.", "timestamp_created": 1480193192, "timestamp_updated": 1480193192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27683660": {"recommendationid": "27683660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199563637", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480174666}, "language": "english", "review": "I love birds and suffering", "timestamp_created": 1480175001, "timestamp_updated": 1480175001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27456400": {"recommendationid": "27456400", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997874090", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467558830}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked the first one, you'll enjoy this.

I got every achievement, and enjoyed getting them. Some parts dragged, but overall it was incredibly enjoyable, which is why I bought Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star. I'll preface the rest of the review by saying this isn't a bad game. That being said, because there was so much user interaction in the first game, I expected the same here, and was sorely disappointed. I think had I gone into Holiday Star knowing it was mostly just stories to read, I would have appreciated it more, and I'm hoping that reviews like this one can keep other people from making the mistake I did. \n\nMy pet peeve in regards to sequels to games are continuity errors, and this one definitely has a few. Nothing game-breaking, just a couple things that, if you've played through all of Hatoful Boyfriend, you'll kind of pause and go \"that doesn't seem right.\" \n\nFor me, because this is a primarily story-based game, it doesn't have any replay value. Once you've read the stories, you're not going to get anything else out of it. It's not like there are multiple endings like in Hatoful Boyfriend; unless you forget the stories, you're never going to have a need to reread them. \n\nAll of that being said, for what it is, Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star is an enjoyable game, and a fun sequel to Hatoful Boyfriend. It gives you an opportunity to interact with all of your favorite birbs again, and experience some fun and weird stories with them.

It takes place in an alternate timeline from the previous game (ignoring the events of what [i] Hatoful [/i] players call \u201cthe BBL route\u201d), and assumes that the player already has some basic familiarity with the characters.\n\nMost notably from a gameplay perspective, [i] Holiday Star [/i] abandons the dating-sim structure of [i] Hatoful Boyfriend [/i] in favor of a straightforward visual-novel approach.  The player is given a few choices to make over the course of the game, but most of these either advance the plot or result in insta-death, rendering the choices essentially false.  In other words, it\u2019s basically what fans of the genre call a \u201ckinetic\u201d (i.e. choice-less) story.  This is a game for people who love the characters of [i] Hatoful Boyfriend [/i] and just want to tag along with them on some silly holiday-themed adventures, rather than control the story from the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nI use the word \u201csilly\u201d deliberately.  Although there are a few genuinely touching moments (a conversation between Ryouta and Yuuya about love and the possibility of rejection comes to mind), most of the game is taken up with deliberately absurd, even surreal humor.  For example, in one chapter the nefarious villain (a flamboyant scientist with a score to settle) tries to destroy St. PigeoNation\u2019s Academy by blasting it with a cannon powered by female manga nerds. (\"I have heard that the fantasies of fangirls surpass those of any fanboy. Observe, and be destroyed!\").  There\u2019s also plenty of fourth wall-breaking moments, including radio interludes where the characters respond to questions from real-life fans of the series about their taste in underwear, etc.  [i] Macbeth, [/i] this ain\u2019t.\n\nCynics might say that the developer just wanted to milk [i] Hatoful Boyfriend\u2019s [/i] surprising success for more money, but I disagree.  [i] Holiday Star [/i] feels like it was made with genuine affection and inspiration.  Certain plot details might be head-scratchingly inconsistent between the two games, but it\u2019s still an endearing and sometimes hilarious experience, and I would recommend it to [i] Hatoful [/i] fans who don\u2019t mind losing control over the story in order to spend more time with Hiyoko and friends. Nearly all of the characters get a moment in the spotlight, with extra attention paid to Anghel, Nageki, and my dude Yuuya this time around.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible to play [i] Holiday Star [/i] as a standalone experience, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.

We cross the glowing river. We follow the obsidian map into the world of shadows.\"[/h1]\n\nFor the ones who already played [i]Hatoful Boyfriend[/i], enjoyed it through its genuine absurdity and mind-wrecking revelation that takes place during the BBL route, [i]Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star[/i] is the collection of some side stories hailing from an alternative universe where BBL route never took place. The game serves to be both some ridiculous fan service and some fourth wall breaking story interaction. For the ones who are yet to play the original game: drop this supplement and play [i]Hatoful Boyfriend[/i] immediately to avoid spoilers!\n\nIn the Holiday Star continuation, the shocking yet gruesome BBL route never occurred. All students of St. Pigeonations live happily and obliviously, approaching the end of yet another school year. Here around this time, we observe a series of short side stories from our usual heroes' daily encounters that will enrich both character backgrounds and answer some questions unanswered in the original game. Aside a handful of irrelevant comical situations Holiday Star also includes one genuine storyline which would foreshadow the events of BBL route and introduce unnerving new characters: The Day the Night Slept. Even for that story alone, you are in for a treat everybirdie!\n\nGameplay is not that different from the original. You are Hiyoko Tosaka, the young human girl who attends St. Pigeonations alongside her bird class mates and teachers who will witness casual - and not so casual - random ongoing in and about the school. This time, gameplay is fairly straight forward with little to no choice options at all. As I described before, Holiday Star is more of a supplement to the original rather than a stand-alone game. It consists of 4 storylines, 6 short chapters and a fairly interesting radio program section where Ryouta will answer fan mails.\n\nIt's cute and short - aside The Day the Night Sleeps storyline, which is heart and mind-wrecking as expected from any game coming from Hatoful universe. I sincerely recommend the experience to the fans of the series, and the ones who'd still have some questions within their minds after completing BBL route.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1454794132, "timestamp_updated": 1454836556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781780", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20948568": {"recommendationid": "20948568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047231004", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451439383}, "language": "english", "review": "I talked so much within this gae", "timestamp_created": 1454588263, "timestamp_updated": 1454588263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20825943": {"recommendationid": "20825943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045174849", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481631556}, "language": "german", "review": "Hatte richtig Spa\u00df mit meinen V\u00f6gelchen \u2665", "timestamp_created": 1454074611, "timestamp_updated": 1454074611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503892", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20799375": {"recommendationid": "20799375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129165991", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483390248}, "language": "english", "review": "We recieved yet another edition of our favorite cast of burbs from Devolver Digital.

The lack of options reminded me of the BBL route minus the tension and atmosphere so I was a little unhappy, but I kept going and managed to discover that the way that these games work is consistant. It gets good at the end. Sure, it is also largely up to personal taste if you like the sort of story it presents when it \"gets good\" but for me it was certainly worth the patience.\n\nIf an upgrade to \"Dove, Actually\" becomes possible from having the normal edition, I'll be putting it on my wishlist.\n\nTIP: During chapter 4 save your game when you remember!

Since the previous game had wrapped up just about everybirdie's character arc, there wasn't much room for expansion in the characters. Holiday Star abandons the \"pigeon dating simulator\" thing for a more linear story. That's not to say it's bad, in fact it reduces the redundant dialogue from replaying the game. But with the branching story gone, it's hard not to feel something was taken.\n\nSadly, if you've already played the previous game Holiday Star doesn't give you that morbid curiousity that makes you say \"this is a weird dating sim\"; since the previous game perfectly elaborated the backstory. And without that sense of curiousity, Holiday Star just isn't as mind-blowing as the first game.\n\nWhile Holiday Star's writing isn't as good as the previous game's, it does make it up with the story. Since Holiday Star has almost no pretenses of being a \"pigeon dating simulator\", the story focuses less on the character and instead on your bizarre adventures in St. Pigeonations. What Holiday Star has a hard time doing compared to the previous game is to subvert expectations, since the first game blew it's load on that department; there wasn't much Holiday Star could do in that regard.\n\nAlso, Holiday Star has the nasty habit of giving you a choice that actually could give you a bad ending and makes you restart the game. This would be fine if Holiday Star was closer to a dating sim, but given the linearity of the game it's easy to forget to save and end up repeating an entire episode.

Tuvo tanta repercusi\u00f3n y \u00e9xito por all\u00e1 en el 2011 que los desarrolladores decidieron realizar una nueva versi\u00f3n para las fiestas. No se trata de un DLC ni nada por el estilo, sino mas bien un juego aparte y en plena epoca navide\u00f1a paso a coment\u00e1rtelo.\n\n\nEl juego se divide en cuatro episodios y una serie de cap\u00edtulos extra mas cortos, adem\u00e1s de otros extras que simulan ser un programa radial conducido por las mismas palomas y est\u00e1n referidos a la historia del juego.\n\nAl comienzo de cada episodio tenemos la posibilidad de elegir nuestro nombre y apellido, que es el que utilizar\u00e1n el resto de los personajes para referirse a nosotros. Podemos tener diferentes nombres en cada uno de los cap\u00edtulos ya que no afecta la experiencia de juego.\n\nSin spoilearte nada te cuento que le primer episodio se centra en las festividades navide\u00f1as y nosotros, unos simples humanos, junto con otras palomas, tenemos que descubrir qui\u00e9nes son los ladrones de la Navidad que se est\u00e1n robando los \u00e1rboles del vecindario y del instituto al cual aparentemente concurrimos. El segundo se aleja un poco del esp\u00edritu navide\u00f1o y nos sit\u00faa en una convenci\u00f3n de manga y anim\u00e9 en la cual tenemos que evitar que nuestro amigo paloma se involucre en la edici\u00f3n de su manga con un villano que planea destruir todo con su rayo laser *inserte gif de Monsters Inc.*. El tercer y cuarto episodio est\u00e1n enlazados y transcurren en un sue\u00f1o que todas las palomas tienen en conjunto.\n\n\nSi a\u00fan no te diste cuenta lo bizarro que es desde el t\u00edtulo, tambi\u00e9n hay tanques de guerra, rayos laser como mencion\u00e9 anteriormente y algunos otros artefactos propios de un villano de pel\u00edcula como para darle vida a la historia, la cual no es tan divertida como parece.\n\nSiendo un \u201cjuego\u201d estilo visual novel no est\u00e1 muy bien realizado ya que en cada uno de los cap\u00edtulos tenemos solo una oportunidad en la cual elegir una opci\u00f3n que cambie el resto de la historia, por lo tanto se torna aburrido y pesado esperar hasta ese momento para ver si nuestra opci\u00f3n es la adecuada o no.\n\n\nOtro factor que juega en contra es la calidad visual de los p\u00e1jaros. Se ven pixelados, y si bien no es un juego en donde los gr\u00e1ficos tengan que ser excepcionales, molesta estar jugando con tu personaje en una calidad m\u00e1s baja que la escena de fondo.\n\nA todo esto, si le vemos el lado positivo podemos rescatar la personalidad de las aves. No solo hay palomas, sino tambi\u00e9n hay otro tipo de p\u00e1jaros similares y no tanto, que se diferencian por sus plumajes. Son personajes bastante estereotipados pero al ser animales, resulta mucho mas divertido que en cualquier otro contexto.\n\n\nLa m\u00fasica es algo que sobresale, no solo porque muchas veces no concuerda con la situaci\u00f3n y en este caso sobresale literalmente, sino que es muy buena. Como es una versi\u00f3n navide\u00f1a, muchas de las canciones est\u00e1n relacionadas con \u00e9sta tem\u00e1tica, como por ejemplo los t\u00edpicos villancicos o El cascanueces; pero por otro lado puede pasar a tener temas al mejor estilo instrumental de Metallica o Linkin Park que nada se relacionan con las escenas pero es una de las cosas mas disfrutables.\n\nMuchas veces se torna inc\u00f3modo jugar a ser un humano en d\u00f3nde una paloma te est\u00e1 tirando palos y te gusta, y lo peor es cuando no sab\u00e9s ni siquiera el g\u00e9nero de la paloma con la que est\u00e1s hablando porque las se\u00f1ales son muy pocas, incluso los nombres japoneses son dif\u00edciles de predecir.\n\nNo es un juego que recomiende incluso si sos muy fan de las visual novels. Las historias no son divertidas, los chistes no logran hacer reir, es muy corta y graficamente no es un buen producto.

If not, you won\u2019t quite understand everything, and the story will be much less impactful.[/h1]\nI'm not sure what I was expecting coming into this. Hatoful Boyfriend had me pleasantly surprised with its profound and compelling storyline ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Welokay/recommended/310080]my review[/url]). I wondered if the Christmas edition would offer something similar, or if it would be short and cheery for the holiday season. I was not disappointed when I was given a sweet story with the perfect amount of humour and darkness to keep it interesting.\n\nHatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star is divided into 4 chapters, and includes 6 short episodes and 6 radio episodes.Everything is well divided into bits, so you can have short, sweet doses of your favourite bird hubbies. \n\n[h1]The Main Story[/h1]\nThe main story is straightforward and linear, rather than being a dating sim with multiple endings.\nI won\u2019t reveal much, to avoid spoiling the plot, but I honestly do recommend this sequel. Beyond the charming hilarity of every character being a bird is a genuinely enjoyable visual novel. Had the characters not been birds, I would still recommend it, purely based on the story. It\u2019s nothing groundbreaking, but it is worth praising.\nHatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star will give you everything you could ever want for the holidays; romance, sacrifice, mystery, and murder. It explores the weaknesses of everybirdies\u2019 hearts, and is amusingly self aware with its humour, poking fun at itself on multiple occasions.\nIf you loved the first one, don\u2019t hesitate to buy this one. It has some mysterious notes, leaving you wanting more, but it doesn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s lacking. If anything, it sets itself up for another Hatoful Boyfriend VN ([b]HEAR THAT? WE WANT MORE[/b]).\n\n[h1]Short Episodes and Radio[/h1]\nIn the short episodes, you get to go on dates with your birdy boys. Choose to view their bird models, or their humans models, and enjoy! Each of the dates are short and sweet. \nThe radio episodes are filled with humour, and will answer important questions for the viewers (what is everybirdies' underwear colour?????)\n\n[H1]The bad[/H1]\nI have plenty of praise, but if I have to state some negatives, here they are:\n[list]\n[*]The editing could use a little more care, as I picked up on a couple grammar/spelling errors. It\u2019s nothing serious, but it\u2019s worth noting.\n[*]It\u2019s easy to get confused sometimes, considering the different routes and timelines that everything takes place in.\n[/list]\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s good fun. Pick it up and enjoy your handsome bird boys. Make an excessive amount of bird puns when friends message you to question what you\u2019re playing, and then force them to play it too. \nIt\u2019s a coo\u2019 game. \n\nsorry", "timestamp_created": 1450877154, "timestamp_updated": 1455447817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611765", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19861450": {"recommendationid": "19861450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065643817", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511393052}, "language": "english", "review": "There's an option to romance with the birds in human form. \n\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1450843875, "timestamp_updated": 1511392787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19860480": {"recommendationid": "19860480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124709924", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451076421}, "language": "english", "review": "On the twelfth day of Holistar, Hatoful Moa gave to me\u2026\n\nTwelve shrine visits,\nEleven trials to face,\nTen stories to read,\nNine Christmas trees,\nEight fangirls a-fighting,\nSeven dreams a-dreaming,\nSix hours a-playing,\nFive cracking eggs,\nFour cooing birds,\nThree-nine reference,\nTwo almost-doves,\nAnd a murderpartridge in a pear tree!", "timestamp_created": 1450840967, "timestamp_updated": 1450840967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19857111": {"recommendationid": "19857111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114129928", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453088721}, "language": "english", "review": "As fun as the game was, it glitched out halfway through, now I can't play the final episode :/\n\nUpdate: they updated the game and fixed the problem I was having :D", "timestamp_created": 1450831285, "timestamp_updated": 1452735321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19855246": {"recommendationid": "19855246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031152798", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495600646}, "language": "english", "review": "He who does not celebrate Christmas is no true bird", "timestamp_created": 1450826241, "timestamp_updated": 1450826241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19845199": {"recommendationid": "19845199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120498361", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451066681}, "language": "english", "review": "MERRY CHRISTMAS!

There were loads of really nice royalty-free music tracks (I believe by Sentive and TAM) in the original game which for some reason aren't in this version. I was really hoping a particular track (end of chapter 2) would be there but when it wasn't I was kinda sad, and I'm worried that some really emotional songs later on in the game in heart-wrenching moments are just going to be replaced by awkward silence. Music really adds a lot to a game, even if it's just pigeons talking in a dialogue box, so when there's nothing there it just makes the game feel a lot emptier. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but I hope Moa can see these reviews and maybe try to get the same music back on becuase some of those tracks fit so beautifully to the game. \n\nBesides that, I love this game so much and the steam rework got me hyped to replay it! 10/10 would get pigeon feels all over again", "timestamp_created": 1450656212, "timestamp_updated": 1450656212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19810450": {"recommendationid": "19810450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200513934", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450645723}, "language": "english", "review": "Play this ONLY after you've played through the first game, hence it won't seem so dramatic and awesome to you.

I feel like after establishing the characters and dynamics among the cast, they game is right to focus on telling interesting stories with them. And the stories in this game are all indeed fun, heartwarming, and sometimes tragic, just like in the original Hatoful Boyfriend.  \n\nHowever I take issue with the Steam release of this game specifically. See the first game's Steam release had all the content from the original game and more alongside the prettier backgrounds.  This game doesn't add anything as far as I've seen so far, but that doesn't honestly bother me the increase in visuals is very noticable in some areas.  What DOES bother me is the fact that they've hacked this games soundtrack to bits.   Like 40% of scenes don't have any music in them, not for atmosphere but due to the fact that for whatever reason the Steam release lost a good chunk of the songs that filled the original version of Holiday Star.  The loss of these songs makes the game feel a lot emptier especially in moments where the music added a lot to the tone of the scene.  I hope this is a technical error of some kind because if they couldn't use some of the (royalty free) music from the original release then they should have replaced those songs with songs they still had permission to use.  \n\nSo I can say this is still a good game full of interesting and hilarious stories, but it's really dissapointing that they were so lazy with this port in terms of the music.  I would reccomend the original version of Holiday Star, but that is tied to Famous Writer, which I beleive is no longer functional on fully updated Windows 10 computers, and must be patched for it to be understandable in English.", "timestamp_created": 1450394253, "timestamp_updated": 1450394253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19752282": {"recommendationid": "19752282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032201862", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450580635}, "language": "english", "review": "Much more linear than the first game, but it has much more content as well, and the story is really good.", "timestamp_created": 1450383937, "timestamp_updated": 1450383937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531831", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19750836": {"recommendationid": "19750836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044289813", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451254640}, "language": "english", "review": "A so far good game.

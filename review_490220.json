Chess comparison comes from the fact it has 0 RNG of any kind and no hidden info so the game is deterministic i.e. one of the players has a guaranteed win based on the starting positions. But just like Chess, Prismata is incredibly complex where solving it is impossible.\n\nPlayers start with 6 or 7 Drones that harvest gold (2nd player starts with 1 extra drone to compensate), gold buys you technology structures that produce blue/red/green resources (not official names, but that's the accepted naming convention in the community). Subsequently gold and tech resources buy attackers/defenders and your goal is to kill opponent's units while protecting your fragile drones and attackers. Sounds simple at its core.\n\nThe biggest draw to Prismata IMO is the fact that even though it is deterministic, games play out completely differently each time and you aren't required to memorize openings like in a game like Chess. This is achieved by giving players random units each game (There's about 100 units in the random unit pool right now and each game you get 5-11 random ones, 8 being the number for standard 'tournament' mode). \"Wait, didn't you say there is no RNG?\". Yes and I wasn't lying - even though the units change, they are mirrored for both players! Once the game starts, nothing will depend upon RNG determining the outcome, it's up to your and your ability to come up and execute a superior strategy. A unit may be super good in a particular set of units, but get completely countered in another - figuring out which strategy to choose is a challenging but fun task. \n\nAnother cool part is that players don't own the \"cards\" (units), all the units are available to everyone in competitive PvP mode so there's absolutely 0 gameplay advantage to paying players (they can get some sweet cosmetics though!). This also means that devs have no qualms about balancing units - no one can complain that their cards got nerfed so devs can act swiftly and keep the balance at the top notch state.\n\nIf talking about the cons of the game graphics definitely stand out - the art may seem a bit \"cheap\" and the play screen may seem bland and generic. It obviously has a lot to do with the fact that developing team is small (3-5 people) and don't have a huge budget, but it's also because devs favour functionality and clarity over flashiness. The gamestate in Prismata can get rather complex with nearly 100 units on each side in some cases so unnecessary animations/flashy effects would slow down the game and clutter the screen.\n\nAnother downside to a lot of players may be that the game has no comeback mechanics, if you fall behind and your opponent overwhelmed you, you dont have a path to counter him most of the time - the game snowballs. So an early mistake or inefficiency in your build may easily get punished down the line by good players. The upside of this though is that if you see you are clearly behind, there's no need to wait until you \"bleed out\", you can concede and move on to the next game, trying not to repeat the same mistake again in the future. In some games with uncertainity/hidden info sometimes you know you have only 5% chance to win, but you sort of have to stick around for another 15-20 minutes just in case opponent makes a mistake which can be incredibly frustrating.\n\nThe game also has a lot of great features. Replays seems like no brainer in a competitive game, but there's also a super easy way to share replays with other players through a replay code. This coupled with the fact that the game has 0 hidden info means there's no secret strategies to hide, you can very easily find replays of top players and see how they played a certain set. You can also spectate games very easily, like the top players playing on the ladder live. Another amazing feature is the ability to analyze a game - if you think you made a mistake at some point, you can go to that part of the replay and open it in analysis mode to play out the game from both players sides and see whether a different line of play might have changed the outcome.\n\nOverall Prismata is a unique strategy game with very deep and challenging gameplay if you decide to see past the bland exterior and decide to actually try it.", "timestamp_created": 1521213851, "timestamp_updated": 1521213851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40842665": {"recommendationid": "40842665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005395829", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1143, "last_played": 1521243670}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing this game 4 years ago.\nIt still messes with my head.", "timestamp_created": 1521179848, "timestamp_updated": 1521179848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40840147": {"recommendationid": "40840147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030783548", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1613, "last_played": 1521745853}, "language": "english", "review": "Very unique and fun game.

It only took me about an hour to get all the basics of the game, and I've been learning and improving every match since. The game is meticulously designed, from the balance of the over-100 units to the onboarding through the Campaign mode. Don't let the seemingly-complex UI fool you, it's very simple and made to be easy to reason-about even in complex game states. It's extremely fun, and virtually every feature I've wanted that was lacking in other similar games is in here:\n - Time bank for turns so you can take more time on complex turns and there's a reason to play quickly on simple turns.\n - Once you are in, there's no $$ commitment to stay competitive. The only thing you can pay for is cosmetics and single-player content (puzzles, campaign missions)\n - Options to change the UI for streaming purposes\n - Fantastic replay system\n - Spectator mode built in from day one\n - In-game automated tournaments with interesting rulesets\n - Well thought-out hotkeys\n\nFrom the gameplay to everything surrounding it, Prismata is amazingly well-designed.

Once you look past it's average UI, you'll find a game that's not quite like anything that's come before.\n\nThe game is very complex, with a fairly steep learning curve, and an incredibly high skill ceiling.

Takes the fundamental game-theoretic idea of RTS and 4x games -- choosing whether to reinvest your resources, or to apply them to disrupt your opponent -- down to a tight, minimal core, turning it into a sharp contest to calculate the most efficient variations and exploit commitments made by your adversary.\n\nDegree of elegance and strategic depth is very similar to Dominion -- numerous \"general principles\" to learn about with an incredible number of subtleties, plus a wealth of individual unit and unit combinations to build an specialized understanding of. Hundreds of hours worth of insights await.\n\nSuggestion to new players: the campaign is a very gentle introduction to the rules that might seem tedious and isn't very similar to the experience of the proper game.

I'm also a top50 player of Dominion (the card game), so I'm going to be reviewing Prismata mostly from my very competitive point of view.\n\nPrismata is a combination of all of the strategy games I love without any of the aspects I hate. It has the variety and replayability of Dominion without the noticeable first player advantage or deck tracking/memorization requirements, it has the build orders and resource management of Warcraft without the dexterity requirements, it has the card interactions and combat management of Hearthstone or Magic without the grinding or pay-to-win. \n\nOn the surface, that sounds incredible, and Prismata really turns out to be almost as incredible as it sounds when it comes to gameplay. The strategic and tactical elements of Prismata (i.e. the entire game) are very fascinating and refreshing, and there's enough depth in the game that it's practically impossible to solve. Despite the unusual combination of mechanics, it all comes together really well and the gameplay flows very smoothly.\n\nDue to the lack of RNG, it lacks the really memorable RNG moments when something super unlikely happens against all odds, as well as the skill element of managing the RNG in your favor. This is seriously the only reason why I'm not immediately dropping all other strategy games in favor of Prismata, because I can appreciate those elements in moderation, but obviously you also get rid of all the frustrating RNG losses that I'm sure we're all too familiar with. There is the \"Events\" game mode though, which is kind of like tournaments with all sorts of crazy variant rules, and I've really been enjoying the ones that introduce some kind of an RNG element into the game.\n\nAs far as the client is concerned, it may not look amazing, but don't let that fool you because it FEELS amazing. You have a hotkey for everything, you don't have to wait for any animations to finish, you can undo if you misclick, in general it just works super fast and smoothly for actually playing the game. When you get experienced enough with the game that you can really start to utilize the full potential of all the hotkeys and stuff, it feels great. I'm sure new players will be able to find their way round the interface just fine, but the pro player experience is in a league of its own. There are a couple of settings that you should turn on (they're disabled by default and I don't have any idea why), namely the \"Show Gold Estimate for Next Turn\" and \"Show Opponent's Unit Supply\" ones. \n\nFor anything else in the game, be it music, graphics, or the story in the campaign, I have to say that it's good enough, but not particularly exciting. Sometimes I keep the Prismata music enabled, sometimes I disable it to listen to whatever music I want, that kind of thing.\n\nThe bottom line is that I think the game is really good, especially for competitive strategy gamers, and I definitely recommend you try it out.", "timestamp_created": 1520564286, "timestamp_updated": 1520564286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40670543": {"recommendationid": "40670543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040847386", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 260992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10672, "last_played": 1521700347}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first saw an ad for this game I wasn't hooked. It looked simple and dull and I wasn't able to play right away because it was in closed alpha. I definitely didn't want to put forth the effort needed to get in. Some time later I see a video with gameplay so I decided to take a look at what playing the game actually looked like. At that moment I knew I needed to play the game.\n\nNovember 26th 2014 was the date of my first game. I am more than three years into it and more excited about Prismata than I was when I first got my hands on the game. The game has very simple rules but very complex gameplay. There is no end in sight to how good at Prismata people can get.\n\nIn a standard pvp game, 8-11 units are randomly chosen from a pool of 97 units to make the set that the two competitors will play. More units will be released soon after Steam early access launches and throughout the future. As the game countdown starts your job is to assess the different strategies available that game, how these strategies will interact with each other, and form a concrete plan to achieve your goals. As the game progresses you will have to react to what your opponent decides to do, manage how you spend your resources, and plan out future turns.\n\nIf pvp action isn't what you are into Prismata is still the game for you! Prismata's simple rules and complex interactions makes for a great puzzle medium. With great puzzles already in the game and more to come in the near future, you would be doing great if you just looking for a puzzle game. There are also bots that are a good challenge level for people who don't quite want to get on the ladder but still want to experience the pvp game.\n\nEverything about this game is of the highest quality. Playing the game is made extremely easy. Your turn is made up of several actions. You can undo those actions in any order with a single click of your mouse. Hotkeys are customizable but the units were named so that the first letter in their name can be with the perfect hotkey already. Every game you play is saved as a sharable replay. That replay can be played in real time or can be scrolled through to find the spot you want. The analysis mode lets you change a turn and see how the game would have played out. Spectating live games is as easy as a click of the mouse.\n\nI strongly recommend both the two player game and the single player puzzles.

It takes influences from card games, board games and RTS to seamlessly integrate the best aspects of those genres into a monster of a turn based Hybrid which stands head and shoulders above its forebearers with an infinite skill cap and near infinite depth and complexity.\n\nIf you\u2019re even passively a fan of strategy games, card games, chess, or any game that needs even a single neuron to play, this game will hook you and never let you go! (Just ask the streamers, kickstarter backers and other new players who've been hopelesslt trapped)\n\nI\u2019ve been watching Lifecoach stream this for nearly a week. he\u2019s been doing over 8 hour long streams with barely any sleep. So naturally I ended up buying the game out of curiosity and PLS SEND HELP, I\u2019VE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY THIS MONSTER. \n\nGameplay: The game has a very simple formula\n\n1. You build resource gathering units (the resources are gold, blue, green and red)\n2. You build an army using those resources\n3. You deal damage to the enemy\u2019s units to destroy his fleet\n4. You defend against enemy\u2019s damage.\n\nThat\u2019s it!\n\nAll the depth and complexity comes from your decision making according to circumstances, and how you think the game will play out. Another factor is the HUGE variety of units (there are around 100). 11 of them will appear every game, and an additional 5 to 10 are randomly selected out of the pool. Both you and your opponent must play the same pool, so there\u2019s no deck-building involved. Rather, you\u2019re tested on your ability to adapt to the firepower you\u2019ve both been provided. More importantly for card game players, there is no net-decking! Every game is decided on player knowledge and skill! \n\nZERO RNG!  PURE STRATEGY! The only RNG that exists purely adds to the strategy and makes for a much more interesting and exciting experience.\n\nFeatures: This game has nearly everything:\n\n1. Casual and ranked online (match making is poor due to low player numbers, but that will improve as player count increases)\n2. Excellent Tutorials!\n3. regular events\n4. Custom matches vs players\n5. Strong Bots\n6. Spectator mode\n7. Replay analysis\n8. Single player campaign (1st chapter is free, rest is paid)\n9. MOST IMPORTANT : HATS!\n\nPrismata is going to be Free on release. NOT F2P-P2W, but FREE like DotA2. Only things you pay for are cosmetics and single player campaign! Paying money does not provide any gameplay advantage, nor does it unlock units faster. It\u2019s just for looks. So, if you\u2019re willing to wait for the end of Early Access, you can play this masterpiece for free, for the rest of your life. Or, you can buy it now for a very reasonable price of US$ 25 (for the mileage you get out of the game, this price is a bargain) and play it sooner!\n\nConsidering the highly skill based nature of Prismata, I wouldn't be surprised if the E-sports scene blossomed. This is just begging to happen, and I personally think it would be a crime if this game doesn't make it to a big stage.\n\nP.S: If you cant afford the game, but want to desperately get in on the action, consider asking the devs for a key on discord or the subreddit!\n\nNow, I must get back to playing.. this review wasted too much of my time", "timestamp_created": 1520554777, "timestamp_updated": 1521101535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40667867": {"recommendationid": "40667867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060775063", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1474, "last_played": 1521512005}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my first review ever.\n\nPrismata is the ultimate skill based game. \n\nNo luck.

Both players purchase units from this supply during a game by using resources obtained in a manner similar to an RTS. Some resources carry over from turn to turn, while others only exist for the current turn. Using these resources while understanding how the set of units synergize is a major factor of the game. Unit mechanics have such things as 'time to build', 'attack', 'defence', 'hit points', 'lifespan', 'consuming other units to produce new units' and more, which makes calculating future turns quite involved if you want it to be.

Not everyone will like the game as it is pure strategy and it takes a long time to get good at, but the ones that enjoy this type of game will love it. \n\n     This game is absolutely fantastic. I have been playing on browser since the Kickstarter days, and this game never ceases to amaze me. Every match is different and unique because of the random unit set that is determined at the beginning of it, and this allows for infinite (well not really but close) possibilities in games. That scope of strategy and planning based on the unit set is really what makes it fun and unique for me. Another key part that really pulls me in is the puzzles. The puzzles and challenges are extremely addicting and rewarding to me. If you tend to like strategy games, give this one a go. \n\tGameplay is refined and polished. Prismata is a turn strategy game based on creating economy and gathering resources, as well as attacking and defending from attacks. The skillcap of this game is through the roof high, and I would say that it is impossible to reach it. It is not completely fair though, as there are unit sets that favor either going first or second, but that only affects very high level play where both players are making almost optimal plays. 99.9% of the time the better player wins, with that 0.1% being favored sets. This game is highly competitive, so if you want to get good you will have to put in the time. I would say that it is most comparable to the game Dominion, but they really aren't that close. I've also heard it is similar to Gwent, which I have not played. There is nothing wrong with gameplay so far except for when the bots crash. There are no ways to pay to win, all winning comes from personal skill. You can buy \"shards\" which are the games in-game currency, which allow you to buy skins. You can also aquire skins through daily rewards, playing games, winning the raffles on events. If you want skins but can't buy them, there are plenty of ways to get them, but the rare ones would take a long time. \n     The community is amazing, at least right now (launch). There weren't too many people playing in the alpha, but they were absolutely amazing. The reddit page got posts almost every day, there are twitch streams every day, the discord is extremely active, and there are already many strategy guides. The people who have been playing the game are absolutely amazing, and I thank them for keeping the game alive. Next, moving on to the devs. Lunarch studios has some of the best game developers I've ever seen. The game has great art and skins, fabulous gameplay, a fantastic AI, all thanks to the devs. Elyot, Lunarch's founder, is amazing. He is constantly taking in feedback from reddit and discord and trying to make the game better. If I wanted to know anything about game making, I would call up the Prismata devs.  \nI could go on about other things, but this is getting long so I'll finish up. I do have a few negative things to say. (these are my opinion and others may disagree). I don't really like the story of the campaign. The concepts doesn't really appeal to me, and I don't particularly like the visual-novel-esque type of campaign. The missions in the campaign are fabulous and necessary, especially the early ones. The single player content is amazing too, I just don't like the flavor that comes in the middle. I'm really here for the gameplay and that is all, but others might really enjoy the story and the characters. Also a note to take, I don't think that the campaign has any problems, I just don't enjoy the style of it. Also, the game is very difficult and it takes a long time to understand and get good at. They do a good job of introducing units and strategical concepts slowly as you level up, but it is still difficult. If you don't like a decently steep learning curve, you may not like Prismata very much. On the other hand, If you are a veteran of this type of difficulty in games, you won't even notice it. I personally already knew that I liked this kind of game, and the difficulty that came with it was what I expected.", "timestamp_created": 1520538580, "timestamp_updated": 1520538580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40663219": {"recommendationid": "40663219", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984883519", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1452, "last_played": 1521695446}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games I have ever played.  It is a strategy game that has endless potential in expansion and player improvement.  The game is essentially Starcraft if you remove the technical barrier (APM requirement) and give both players perfect information.  \n\n[u][b]Description[/b][/u]\nIn Prismata, you build units each turn and manage a pool of resources to build an army.  Each turn, players are trying to maximize the efficiency of their resources and attacking their opponent to get an edge.  There is a set of base units in every game, including some basic attacking units and economy boosting units, such as drones and conduits to gather resources.  The meat of the game is in the extra units that are randomized each game and shared between both players.  These units dictate what is important in each game.\n\nThere are several mechanics that make the game stand out and make it so engaging to play.  Each game, the shared unit pool that both players use is randomized to make each game feel different.  There are enough different units that you do not see the same combinations come up very often, so each game is a new experience.  In addition, there is no random element in the game outside of who plays first on turn 1.  You can see everything your opponent is doing and plan accordingly.  \n\nThe attacking and defending mechanics are also unique to the game, although they are surprisingly simple.  At the end of your turn, you sum the total attack of all of your units, and the opponent totals the sum of their defense.  If the defense total is higher, the opponent chooses where the damage is assigned, and is able to absorb some amount of the damage on one unit.  If the attack total is higher, the attacker decides where the damage goes.\n\n[u][b]Game Modes[/b][/u]\nPrismata offers multiple different ways to play.  There is a single player campaign and challenges which are essentially puzzles.  These teach you the basics of the game step by step so you aren't overwhelmed when you are ready for a real game.  You can also play offline against bots of multiple difficulty levels.  The AI is surprisingly challenging; it will be a while until you can beat a master bot.  Lastly, the meat of the game lies in the online multiplayer mode.  There is a ranked ladder as well as private custom games available to play.  In addition, you can set your game play preferences.  You can play games with 5 or 8 random units in a game to manage complexity, or more!  You can also set player turn length from 90 seconds per turn to 6 seconds.  This functions like a chess clock in game.\n\n[u][b]Learning the Game[/b][/u]\nThe game is very addicting and engaging to play.  The games play out pretty quickly, usually taking anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes to play a game.  Prismata has a very gradual learning curve.  You can learn the basics of the game while playing, and you don\u2019t need to know everything to play a full game.\n\nEach game offers something new to learn about unit interactions or build timings.  Prismata has a robust replay system so you can analyze your games and determine where you went wrong.  You can even enter analysis mode in your replays to take control at any turn in the game and try out an alternative strategy.  \n\n[u][b]Summary[/b][/u]\nPrismata is a strategy player's dream.  I can't say enough good things about this game.  I've been playing strategy games my whole life, and this is one of the absolute best.  You have so many choices to make every turn.  There is so much variety from game to game that it never gets old.  Most strategy games use either get stale with predetermined moves like Chess or Puerto Rico, or they have a large element of luck to increase variability in their game.  Prismata manages to avoid both of these crutches to deliver a game that is different every time you play without introducing an element of luck.  To summarize, I'll list some of the key features that set the game apart:\n\n- Randomized shared unit pool each game\n- Large expandable unit pool ensures new interactions continually show up in games\n- No element of luck\n- No pay to win, you don't have a collection outside of cosmetic skins\n- No grinding, you have an ELO for ladder that does not reset\n- Prismata has been tested and rebalanced for several years already\n- Passionate, supportive, and helpful community and dev team\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1520538488, "timestamp_updated": 1520538488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40663048": {"recommendationid": "40663048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134938177", "num_games_owned": 651, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3323, "last_played": 1521717217}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u201c\u7535\u5b50\u5361\u724c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u56f4\u68cb\u3002\u201d\n\u6211\u4f1a\u52aa\u529b\u4e89\u53d6\u65e9\u65e5\u6c49\u5316\u7684\u3002\u524d3\u4f4d\u6253\u901a\u6559\u7a0b\u548c\u6218\u5f79\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u5404\u900172RMB\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u52a0QQ\u7fa4\uff1a172781323\u3002\n\n\u606d\u559cGUA2017\u3001\u6298\u68d2\u5927\u72fc\u3001\u7e54\u6c34\u4fe1\u592b\u5148\u540e\u5168\u901a\u6218\u5f799+4\u548c\u8bad\u7ec356\u5173\uff0c\u9886\u53d672RMB\u3002\n\u6e38\u620f\u7d20\u8d28\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5927\u5bb6\u4e0d\u8981\u592a\u809d\uff0c\u4f24\u8eab\u4f53\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u5173\u5207\u90fd\u6709\u9690\u85cf\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u7279\u6b8a\u89e3\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u7a7a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u3002\n\nSteam\u4e0a\u7684Prismata\u9ed1\u5c4fBUG\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5728Steam\u91cc\u5378\u8f7d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5728steam\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u5220\u9664\u6240\u6709Prismata\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u5b89\u88c5\u8bd5\u8bd5\uff0c\u6709\u4eba\u8fd9\u4e48\u4e00\u5f04\u5c31\u597d\u4e86\uff0c\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662fSteam\u5b58\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u635f\u574f\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u7f51\u9875\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u627e\u6211\u7d22\u8981\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7801\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1520538071, "timestamp_updated": 1521718749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770992", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40663041": {"recommendationid": "40663041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030515801", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5968, "last_played": 1521728453}, "language": "german", "review": "Hallo zusammen, \nendlich ist es soweit. Nach einigen Jahren, insgesamt acht in der Entwicklung und vier Jahren seit Kickstarter, ist Prismata nun im Steam EarlyAccess erh\u00e4ltlich! Ich kann kaum in Worte fassen wie gespannt ich auf die kommenden Tage, Wochen und hoffentlich Jahre bin. Ich habe in den letzten vier Jahren sicherlich mehr als tausend Stunden in das Spiel investiert \ud83d\ude0a\nZun\u00e4chst m\u00f6chte ich euch m\u00f6glichst kurz erz\u00e4hlen worum es in dem Spiel geht, welches Genre etc\u2026\nZum Thema Genre gibt es sehr sehr viele unterschiedliche Meinungen zu welchem Prismata zu z\u00e4hlen sei, am h\u00e4ufigsten fallen wohl die Begriffe Echtzeitstrategie, Rundenbasiert, Kartenspiel, Deckbilder und Strategie. Jeder hat hierzu nat\u00fcrlich seine ganz eigene Meinung aber eines sei von meiner Seite aus gesagt: Ein Kartenspiel wie Hearthstone, Gwent ist es nicht, es fehlen dazu grundlegende Elemente wie ein Deck, Kartenziehen und Karten sammeln. Wie hier raus ersichtlich handelt es sich auch um keinen Deckbilder da wir kein Deck bauen, Strategie ist in Prismata g\u00e4nzlich anders zu verstehen. Weiterhin f\u00e4llt der Punkt Echtzeit unter den Tisch da es, tats\u00e4chlich, rundenbasierend gespielt wird. \u00dcbrig bleiben also \u201eRundenbasierend, Strategie\u201c \u2013 meine Sicht auf dieses Thema. Ihr werdet sicherlich andere Meinungen finden welche auch gute Gr\u00fcnde haben.\nUm eine klarere Vorstellung von dem zu bekommen was auf euch in Prismata zukommt versuche ich jetzt, in eigenen Worten, eine \u00dcbersicht zu geben. \nPrismata spielt sich wie ein Starcraft Brettspiel, wir bauen eine Wirtschaft auf kaufen Technologien und bauen Einheiten um schlussendlich unseren Gegner zu besiegen. Aus dem SC Repertoire fallen Echtzeit und Schatten des Krieges weg. Dies bringt mich zu einem weiteren wichtigen Punkt welcher Prismata besonders macht. Es handelt sich um ein Spiel in welchem wir jederzeit alle Informationen haben und alle Optionen berechnen k\u00f6nnen. Dies erinnert an Spiele wie Schach oder GO. Nun m\u00f6gt ihr denken, \u201edann gibt es immer eine perfekte L\u00f6sung und das Spiel ist \u201esolved\u201c\u201c. Diesem Trugschluss viel schon so mancher zum Opfer. Eine Eigenschaft des Spiels greift hier was selbst nach vielen tausenden Spielen immer noch f\u00fcr Spannung in jeder Partie sorgt: Jedes Spiel besteht aus 11 Basis Set-Einheiten welche jedes Spiel gleichbleiben und einem Zufallsset welches zuf\u00e4llig bestimmt wird ABER f\u00fcr beide Spieler dasselbe ist. Es gibt derzeit \u00fcber 100 Zufallsset-Einheiten, bei 5-11 pro Partie sind dies einige m\u00f6gliche Kombinationen \ud83d\ude09. Nun komme ich zum letzten, in meinen Augen wichtigen Punkt: Kein (kaum) Zufall! In Prismata gibt es keine W\u00fcrfelw\u00fcrfe, zuf\u00e4lligen Zugreihenfolgen usw. Letzten Endes bleibt es nur die Frage, wer ist Spieler 1 und welche Einheiten sind im Zufallsset.\nNun kurz zu den Spielarten. Bis heute gab es quasi nur eine Art Prismata zu spielen und zwar Mehrspieler. Meiner Meinung nach das Herzst\u00fcck des Spiels. Zwei Spieler spielen 1v1 in diversen Zeiteinstellungen gegeneinander. Prismata wird im Mehrspieler nie langweilig und je weiter man in der Ladder kommt desto mehr Tiefe im Spiel entdeckt man. Mehrere Alphaspieler haben schon \u00fcber 10000 Spiele gemacht und lernen immer noch stetig dazu. Weiterhin gibt es im Mehrspieler auch \u201eCasual Matchmaking\u201c f\u00fcr diejenigen die keine Lust auf Wettkampf haben und zahlreiche sehr kompetente Bots zum Spielen. In der Alpha gab es auch schon ein Puzzlepack welches, auch f\u00fcr Veteranen, eine gro\u00dfe Herausforderung darstellte. Im EA Release kommt jetzt noch die Kampagne hinzu welche tendenziell eine Mischung aus normalen 1v1 Szenarien und Puzzeln darstellt und mit einer spannenden Science-Fiction Geschichte unterlegt ist. Die Kampagne kommt in einem normalen Schwierigkeitsgrad welcher sehr moderat ist und einem richtig hartem welche einem Kopfzerbrechen bereitet und jedes Puzzlerherz h\u00f6herschlagen l\u00e4sst. Die Szenarien werden Einheiten beinhalten welche nicht im Grundspiel zum Spielen zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen.\nNun zum wichtigstem, dem Geld. Leider ist auf der Steam Seite nicht wirklich ersichtlich das es sich bei Prismata um ein weitestgehend kostenlosen Titel handelt. Die erste Episode der Kampagne sowie das erste (derzeit einzige) Puzzlepack und der komplette Mehrspieler Teil inklusive aller Einheiten wird kostenlos sein und bleiben. Kampagne 2 - ???? werde allerding bezahl Inhalt werden. F\u00fcr sp\u00e4ter geplante Puzzlepacks wird auch eine Bezahlung erforderlich sein. Die EA-Kaufoption von 25\u20ac beinhaltet nun einige der Kaufelemente, sp\u00e4ter k\u00f6nnt ihr die oben genannten Dinge aber auch kostenlos spielen. Wer jetzt schon kauft wird Lunarch Studios unterst\u00fctzen und bekommt Kampagne 2-4 dazu sowie Zugang zum Spiel. Weiterhin gibt es einige Dinge, die das Ergattern von kosmetischen Erweiterungen f\u00fcr Einheiten (KEINE EINHEIT WIRD DADURCH BESSER) erleichtert/beschleunigt. Wer Geduld hat kann aber auch warten bis es den Multiplayer f\u00fcr Umme gibt.\nEin weiterer wichtiger Punkt mit welchem ich schlie\u00dfen m\u00f6chte: Lunarch Studios ist ein vor einigen Jahren gegr\u00fcndetes Unternehmen. Die Jungs haben ihr Studium geschmissen um Vollzeit am Projekt zu arbeiten. Dadurch begr\u00fcndet sich auch die lange Entwicklung. Die Entwickler waren STETS bereit auf die Community zu h\u00f6ren, n\u00f6tige Updates wurden immer so schnell wie m\u00f6glich umgesetzt.

I played both hearthstone and gwent but got bored of them because of the amounts of RNG these had, this one I\u00b4ll never quit.\n\nIf you like turn based strategy games then you\u00b4ll LOVE this game! There is no RNG, no deckbuilding, no fog of war. As a game of full information it is more comparable to chess. However, it\u00b4s not as repetitive, since in every game there is a random set with 8-11 out of 100 units that is available to purchase.\n\nAlso, once you got into this game it is completely free to play, all units are unlocked right away! The only thing you can buy with money are the single player campaign and skins, which don\u00b4t change gameplay.\n\nThis indie game was made by a team of three people, so if you want a game that has amazing graphics then this is obviously not the right game for you. But if you are sick of RNG card games and are searching for a turn based strategy game with amazing gameplay then you have to try this!

There is absoultely 100% no RNG involved as you create your perfect strategy to battle AI through the campaign, quick battles, events, and of course PVP in casual and ranked play! I deinitely recommend anyone check this game out if you're looking for something to really challenge your mind!\n\nIf you're interested in seeing some Gameplay here is my Prismata First Impressions/Thoughts/Review video for even more information regarding how the game works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwYcUhvpe20", "timestamp_created": 1520536541, "timestamp_updated": 1520536541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40662174": {"recommendationid": "40662174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046377214", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 811, "last_played": 1521500704}, "language": "english", "review": "I spent $250 on Prismata's Kickstarter and consider every dollar well-spent.\n\nPrismata is a hybrid of several different genres: imagine the strategy of an RTS like StarCraft combined with a turn-based perfect information structure like chess; now add the look and feel of a collectible card game like Magic the Gathering; finally add some mechanics inspired by tabletop strategy games like Dominion. You get to experience the fun of all the different genres...\n\n...without any of their classic drawbacks: you *don't* have to be capable of 300 APM like in an RTS (because it's turn-based); you *don't* have to grind or pay to win to beat your opponents like in a collectible card game (because there are no pvp advantages of any kind in the game); you *don't* have to deal with RNG like in most games (because the devs have deliberately created a game of pure skill); you *don't* have to spend hours memorizing openings or dealing with the game getting stale like chess (because the pool of available units to purchase changes every single game, and every single game is different).\n\nIt has pretty much everything you could want in a strategy game: an extremely high skill ceiling; a competitive ladder; regular events and tournaments; single-player campaigns and puzzle packs; wide-ranging time controls; fully-integrated live spectating/replay/analysis features; devs that are extremely active and responsive to players; units that are actually balanced; a good AI; etc...\n\n...honestly, if I was reading my own review I would think it had to be bs. I would think \"this is too good to be true, there has to be some kind of catch\", etc. But there isn't, which is the entire reason I put so much money into the Kickstarter.

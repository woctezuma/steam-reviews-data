After the nice and relaxing Zenge, Michal Pawlowski rises to excellence with Art of Gravity.\n\nAs the game summary says, Art of Gravity is a voxel / physics puzzle game - and good physics puzzles are surprisingly hard to come by. Either the physics are clunky, or the level design is weak, or, most frequently, both. Michal elegantly solved both problems in one go - he built a sandbox game where the physics are taken very seriously, and chose a visual implementation that makes watching the mechanics in action a real pleasure. \nYour task is to launch balls at cubes. Balls cause cubes to disintegrate into small cubes, which fly all over the place, damaging or destroying other cubes as they go. This is already fun - the kinetic energy of the action is really visceral. Then, the demolition becomes more and more difficult as new blocks with different properties are introduced (read: they become tougher and tougher), and you'll have more elaborate balls to wreak your havok as well.\nWith all the enjoyment of wanton destruction going on, I have to touch on one the game's only weakness - it's rather easy. Experimenting with new materials is superb, but then the solution just presents itself. 60-65 of the 75 levels flow by pretty self-evidently - only the last 10-15 were decent headscratchers.\n\nAh, I wanted to write a short review, but obviously couldn't :) I loved Art of Gravity, and while these games are short, they're excellent value for money at the low asking price.

As you can see in the trailer, the animations when you destroy blocks are mesmerizing. The game is fun in itself and is fun to solve, but truly the animations are what makes the challenges so satisfying to overcome, and what will hook you and get you to finish it. Also, the rules are not explicitly taught, which in my opinion makes a puzzle game more enjoyable and shows it is well designed.\n\nThe one criticism I have is that sometimes, the physics are a bit unpredictable, and therefore it makes some puzzles harder to solve for the wrong reasons. However, I still managed to beat the game in around 2 hours, so it's not really that big of a deal: just be aware that some puzzles will feel a bit random.

That being said, there are only maybe 5-10 puzzles that will take you more than a couple minutes to plan out. I had high hopes for a few of the achievements that sounded like they\u2019d bring a second life into a few puzzles. However, the puzzles that do leave you with the option to use less orbs on them are usually really forgiving. You\u2019ll bumped into each one without breaking a sweat. \n\nAlso, that damn jingle sound effect is back from Zenge and it still clips itself and is as cheesy as ever. Thankfully, you can disable the sfx and bgm if you\u2019d rather listen to music or a podcast.\n\nCan barely recommend it on its own, although it\u2019s a killer deal as a part of the steam \u2018Relaxing Puzzle Box\u2019 Bundle which also includes several other games by Michal Pawlowski.\n\nThe game does hold a lot of potential however. A few more types of orbs or bricks or portals could create some more engaging puzzles. Sadly, like all the other Puzzle Box games, it ends rather quickly, has no steam workshop and is more of a tech demo/mini project that displays an interesting puzzle idea that the devs had.\n\nStill, Art of Gravity is a good way to loosen up while mulling over some straightforward puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1512097674, "timestamp_updated": 1512097674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37844883": {"recommendationid": "37844883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082259989", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511836782}, "language": "english", "review": "A small puzzle game involving throwing balls at blocks in order to break all of them.

Although I know its hard, given the nature of the game.\n-I will definitely have to concur with some of the other reviewers. More levels! The experience was awesome and left me wanting for more. \n\nOverall: 9/10 Because I thought it needs more levels. It would be great if they actually added more to it. \n\n\nIf you like the puzzle genre this game is a must, and if you don\u00b4t like it then you sure as hell should give it a try!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507084984, "timestamp_updated": 1507084984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35380988": {"recommendationid": "35380988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119943103", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506863163}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc608\uc2a4\uc7bc\uc778\ub370 \uc880 \ud5c8\uc220\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1506863195, "timestamp_updated": 1506863195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35244040": {"recommendationid": "35244040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036328736", "num_games_owned": 2341, "num_reviews": 203, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506525271}, "language": "french", "review": "Des objets en 3D qui flottent dans l'espace dans une ambiance visuelle et sonore ad\u00e9quatement minimaliste.\nOn choisit la bonne trajectoire pour propulser un certain nombre de boules \u00e0 disposition pour tout d\u00e9truire.\n\nJ'aime les gratte-ciels qui s'effondrent dans des gerbes de b\u00e9ton, j'aime les feux d'artifice qui font briller les yeux des enfants, j'aime les explosions pas uniquement de joie, j'aime voir des murs qui se disloquent en petits morceaux et s'\u00e9parpillent fa\u00e7on puzzle, j'aime l'odeur du napalm le matin, j'adore pouvoir arborer avec fiert\u00e9 mon petit sourire sadique quand j'ai trouv\u00e9 le moyen de tout bousiller et de ne laisser derri\u00e8re moi qu'un petit tas de confettis.

The concept is simple and beautifully executed. You launch different balls at a variety of different boxes, bombs, and launchers and try to remove all pieces from play. There's a limited amount of balls at your disposal, but each level is easy to complete, including earning all achievements (they all require you to complete a particular level with at least one ball left in store). At first, there is a little bit of a learning curve as you learn what each type of ball does and how it interacts with the other puzzle components, but its not terribly difficult and if you mess around a bit, you'll quickly learn. There's an undo button in the event you launch in the wrong direction and each puzzle presents a unique challenge.

qui se cache derri\u00e8re [i]Hamster on Coke[/i] nous livre ici [i][b]Art of Gravity[/b][/i], un puzzle-game \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation impeccable et fun au point que vous risquez fort d'en redemander, sit\u00f4t le jeu termin\u00e9.\n\nIci, l'objectif est de d\u00e9truire une figure en trois dimensions, constitu\u00e9e de cubes de couleurs diverses et de boules, qui sont au nombre de trois : la bombe, grise, dont l'effet ne vous aura pas \u00e9chapp\u00e9 ; la verte, qui renvoie dans la direction oppos\u00e9e un projectile de m\u00eame nature que celui qui l'aura percut\u00e9e ; enfin, la jaune, qui r\u00e9percute le coup re\u00e7u, \u00e9ventuellement dans plusieurs directions (comme au billard), en conservant l\u00e0 aussi les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de ce qui l'aura frapp\u00e9e. A cela s'ajoutent deux m\u00e9canismes : le premier vous permettra de d\u00e9placer certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments du d\u00e9cor selon des axes pr\u00e9d\u00e9finis ; le second de les faire pivoter. Vous suivez jusque-l\u00e0 ? Parce que ce n'est pas termin\u00e9 !\n\nEn effet, pour d\u00e9truire cette figure, vous disposerez d'un certain nombre de projectiles - des boules - eux aussi de couleurs variables : blancs, rouges ou bleus. Quel int\u00e9r\u00eat, me direz-vous ? C'est tr\u00e8s simple. Disons que les blancs sont les projectiles de base. Les rouges, plus robustes, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'une capacit\u00e9 de destruction accrue. Quant \u00e0 eux, les bleus ont deux effets notables : d'une part, ils peuvent briser des sortes d'\u00e9crans obstruant le passage ; d'autre part, ils sont encore plus efficaces que les rouges, \u00e0 ceci pr\u00e8s qu'ils d\u00e9truisent les blocs sans laisser de fragment. Comprenez par l\u00e0, pas de d\u00e9g\u00e2ts collat\u00e9raux ; lesquels sont par ailleurs tr\u00e8s bien g\u00e9r\u00e9s, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une physique irr\u00e9prochable.\n\nSachez en outre que vous pourrez choisir l'orientation du lancer, du moins dans une certaine mesure, et que celui-ci aura, il va sans dire, une importance cruciale. Autre d\u00e9tail significatif, la couleur des cubes qui composent le d\u00e9cor leur conf\u00e8re des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de solidit\u00e9 similaires \u00e0 celles des projectiles. Ce qui donne, par ordre croissant de robustesse : blanc ; rouge ; vert - ce dernier m'a sembl\u00e9 plus sensible aux explosions, mais je ne saurais l'affirmer avec certitude.

In each of the 75 levels your goal is to clear out all the cubes by shooting balls into the play area. The cubes are actually built of voxels and will shatter into smaller pieces when hit. These voxels will fall down and can break other cubes leading into impressive chain reactions.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe minimalistic visuals work quite well for a game like this. Shattering a large number of cubes into voxels at once actually looks quite impressive.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe sound effects and music are both pretty basic, but they get the job done. There is no voice acting.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay is pretty simple. You have few different types of cubes and balls, which interact with each other in slightly different ways. Many of the levels also include additional elements such as glass walls or objects you can move along a track. Many of the more complex levels require you to set up impressive chain reactions that take care of lots of cubes with a single ball.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are generally well-designed and fun to solve. The core mechanics are quite simple but the game does a good job of introducing new gameplay elements to keep things interesting. Some of the levels also have achievements for solving them without using all the balls, but these bonus goals are purely optional.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nPersonally I felt that the game was too easy. Most of the early puzzles are quite simple and even towards the end there are only a few puzzles that provide any real challenge. I would have loved to see some trickier puzzles myself.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nThe controls work quite well with a mouse and keyboard. A few times I did have some trouble lining up the exact shot I wanted, but this is not a big problem as none of the puzzles require precise timing.\n\n[h1]Story and Writing[/h1]\nThe game does not really have a story or any writing for that matter.\n\n[h1]Bugs and Glitches[/h1]\nI didn't encounter any major bugs or issues.\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nArt of Gravity is a fun and creative puzzle game. It is quite short and most of the puzzles are rather easy. Still, at this price point it's easy to recommend the game to any puzzle game fans.\n\nIt took me little under 1.5 hours to solve all the puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1502198020, "timestamp_updated": 1502198020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34088019": {"recommendationid": "34088019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013772911", "num_games_owned": 645, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502133743}, "language": "polish", "review": "\u015awietna gra logiczna!

You start out with a floating bundle of cubes, and then proceed to throw balls at them until they break. I think it might be some sort of metaphor for my high school years.\n When hit most cubes will shatter in a shower of voxels, which will in turn cascade down and possibly cause more damage. Your goal is to get rid of all the floating elements with a limited number of balls.\n As the game goes on you get cubes and balls of different colors, which behave in different ways, and on some levels you get the ability to arrange the board to facilitate your virtual vandalism.\n And it\u2019s really satisfying! The sight of cube fragments interacting against each other and other elements never really gets old, and that\u2019s as fine as any reward a computer game could give. Most of the puzzles are very simple, though some on the last stretch require a bit of thinking (or a lot of trial and error).\n You can only throw at fixed angles, so it\u2019s not too fiddly - though being physics-based, a little unpredictability is unavoidable. If it sounds at all like your sort of thing, it\u2019s an easy recommendation at slightly less than a quid (or whatever heathen money is used outside of the empire).", "timestamp_created": 1501599768, "timestamp_updated": 1501599768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33945487": {"recommendationid": "33945487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332326238", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501579428}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u56e0\u4e3a\u5e73\u65f6\u5c31\u6bd4\u8f83\u559c\u6b22\u73a9\u70e7\u8111\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u6240\u4ee5\u82b1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u5c31\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\uff0c\u53ef\u559c\u53ef\u8d3a\u53ef\u559c\u53ef\u8d3a2333\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u8bba\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fd8\u662f\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u201c\u7206\u70b8\u5c31\u662f\u827a\u672f\u201d\u90fd\u662f\u8ba9\u4eba\u8033\u76ee\u4e00\u65b0\u7684\uff0c\u770b\u7740\u6ee1\u5730\u6563\u843d\u7684\u65b9\u5757\u771f\u7684\u7279\u6709\u6210\u5c31\u611f\u3002\u8c1c\u9898\u7684\u8bdd\u4e2a\u4eba\u611f\u89c9\u96be\u5ea6\u9002\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6478\u6e05\u5957\u8def\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u7b97\u96be\u76842333\u6700\u540e\u51e0\u5173\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8def\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8f83\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6709\u70b9\u50cf\u73a9\u591a\u7c73\u8bfa\u9aa8\u724c\u90a3\u6837\u7684\uff0c\u81f3\u4e8e\u7b2c11\u5173\u7684\u6210\u5c31\uff0c[spoiler]\u9700\u8981\u7b49\u67d0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7403\u5f39\u8d77\u540e\u843d\u4e0b\u6765\u518d\u7838\u4e2d\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea2\u65b9\u5757[/spoiler]\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u5b98\u65b9\u53d1\u73b0bug\u61d2\u5f97\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u4e8e\u662f\u5e72\u8106\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6210\u5c312333\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4e2a\u5f88\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4ef7\u683c\u4e5f\u8fd8\u7b97\u767d\u83dc\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u5165\u624b\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1501580277, "timestamp_updated": 1501580277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33941687": {"recommendationid": "33941687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308675376", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500946523}, "language": "english", "review": "Very unique idea for a puzzle game.

Many thanks!)\n\n[h1]A pleasant puzzle game about destroying blocks with balls.[/h1]\n\nNot often is it that a new innovative game using a simple concept lands on my lap.  Much to the nature that was [i]Portal[/i], you'll be introduced to new concepts through simple puzzles before being thrust into some of the more advanced puzzles.  That said, I originally thought that [i]Art of Gravity[/i] was going to be a pretentious art game.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw what [i]Art of Gravity[/i] had to offer.\n\nIn your arsenal are white balls (the weakest), red balls (which are more durable and stronger), and blue balls (which phase through all blocks in its bath and can destroy glass).  Against you are white blocks (weak), red blocks (strong), path balls (which spit out balls in directional paths after being struck), and teleportation balls (which are green), which must ALL be destroyed..and are occassionally surrounded by glass.\n\nThere are 75 levels and most of the puzzles.  Again, they are mostly simple, though there are a few that will have you scratching your head as you ponder about the solution.  You'll be able to figure out the solution, though...if you give each puzzle enough time.  A single playthrough ended up taking me 2 hours, though each playthrough now may take much less time.\n\nIf I have any complaints about [i]Art of Gravity[/i], it's that the replayability is low.  For only $1, you'll find approximately 2 hours worth of gameplay...about the length of Portal.  It's nice to see cubes explode, but like with most puzzle games, you'll figure out the solutions and have less reason to come back to it...unless you want to relive a relaxing puzzle game, that is.\n\nDo I recommend [i]Art of Gravity[/i]?  To be honest, I'd say that for asking price, it's worth it.  Though if you want to wait for a sale when this game is discounted, I wouldn't blame you for it, especially since it's essentially 50 cents per hour.  If you're looking for a casual puzzle game with a new, but simple concept involving balls, trajectory, and gravity, I'd say to consider giving this game a try.\n\n9/10  Circular pegs don't fit into square holes....but in this case, they do!", "timestamp_created": 1499315845, "timestamp_updated": 1499621024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575442", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33293998": {"recommendationid": "33293998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037245157", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499294853}, "language": "english", "review": "It's great fun smashing up a puzzle like this, leaving only what still needs solving standing.\nOne MAJOR downside though is that, because the game is physics based, solutions occasionally  fail.

Those games that like to focus on more things at once, tend to stress gamers to a certain degree. And if you test them out + write about them on a regular basis like I do, well, you definitely need gaming\u2019s equivalent of a pause. Without racing towards the other extreme: casual, mobile \u201cgames\u201d. Irony has it, that Art of Gravity is also on mobile platforms, yet it cannot share the shame of any pathetic cash grabs as it sadly has to share space with them on smartphones or tablets. Unless you buy the PC version, of course.\n\nLucky for us Steam gamers, we have literally hundreds of options to choose from. The one I\u2019m reviewing today, is among the better ones on the Store and its small price tag, really doesn\u2019t do this game justice. On both PC and iOS, Art of Gravity\u2019s asking price is still one single buck. Its developer/publisher is by no means, a newcomer. Hamster On Coke Games (creative title, I know) have already graced gamers with other affordable brain teasers such as, Hook, Zenge or klocki.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story in Art Of Gravity features the complex system adopted primarily by puzzle games. No story here, buddy! What, you really expected a plotline to these abstract & physics-based gameplay mechanics? It plays perfectly well without needing so much as a flimsy explanation or context. Not even a tutorial and this slightly annoyed me. Nonetheless, I don\u2019t blame the devs for wanting players to dive right into the action though. Art Of Gravity has so many levels of various length in terms of completion time, that you won\u2019t feel left out or bored. As with any similar titles from this genre, playing in short gaming sessions is the rule of thumb.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nIf you played enough Steam indie titles so far, you\u2019ll recognise Art of Gravity as being Unity-powered, right from its launch menu. What\u2019s a certainty to me in such fortunate cases, is the stability which Unity Engine provides to all titles which feature its assets. While it isn\u2019t by any means a pretentious game, Art of Gravity does looks great and I really enjoyed its minimal looks mixed with the voxel-style. You won\u2019t have any trouble running this title, even on an older PC or low-end laptop.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe soundtrack is severely limited but the sound effects are balancing that issue out, at least partially. I\u2019d still recommend you listen to any tracks you might prefer and simply mute the repetitive tunes from in-game. Your choice, as always.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nArt Of Gravity might lack a story or sound diversity, yet its gameplay is the perfect combination of eye candy and seemingly-simple puzzle design. I assure you that this is not the case. Sporting 75 levels of increasing complexity, you\u2019ll definitely learn to play efficiently as you spend more time with it. The dev team prides itself on the fact that players are left to discover the gameplay mechanics by themselves. I guess, it\u2019s part of the charm. Even the title screen appears after you\u2019ve complete the first level quite out of the blue. Or purple to be more exact.\n\nColors play an important role and are used to distinguish between the several types of \u201cmaterials\u201d you\u2019ll need to break apart with the balls you control. The spheres in question can be set on predetermined trajectories (collision courses, more likely) and Art of Gravity\u2019s ultimate goal is to smash through the colored blocks, until they crumble to small pieces which fall from suspension. I might have phrased this more complicated than it truly is. In any case, it won\u2019t be straightforward since various \u201cwalls\u201d or block types can take multiple ball collisions until they are finally crumbling.\n\nThe bonus objective on some levels (and prerequisite for unlocking some of the game\u2019s Achievements) is to crush all the blocks with as few balls as possible. You\u2019ll be saving only one, in most cases. And even then it shall take some creative thinking, not to mention patience. You probably knew already, that puzzle games shouldn\u2019t be treated with haste. Half of the fun is just the part where you figure them out. The rest is reserved, just for watching it play out. Seeing those small, colored pixels crumble and fall from considerable height, it reminded me of the late Lionhead Studios\u2019 Black & White 2 logo.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OPnZEXoVGs\n\nSad pandas right now, eh? Much like the (proper) god game genre itself, interactive logos are also a thing of the past.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nArt Of Gravity wasn\u2019t discounted so far, mainly because it is more than decently priced. If you\u2019re still uncertain, wait  for a bundle offer perhaps. I have no idea if the game\u2019s lacking Trading Cards because the developer didn\u2019t implement them, or if Valve is enforcing their new policy on these Cards and no new games receive them until they sold a certain number of copies. I do hope they shall surface for this title eventually. For now, collectors shall have to contend with Steam Achievements. \n\n[h1]Strong Points[/h1]\n+ Relaxing gameplay.\n+ Pleasant visual style.\n+ Steam Achievements.\n+ Plenty of levels to choose from.\n\n[h1]Weak Points[/h1]\n- Lacking even a barebones tutorial.\n- No Steam Trading Cards.\n- Limited sound selection.\n\n[b]Rating 75/100 [/b]\n \n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ReviewExperts#]ReviewExperts[/url], through the generous contribution of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/danielbink]Dani\u00ebl - REX \u2665 Gaming[/url].[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1499279113, "timestamp_updated": 1499282122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680246", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33268998": {"recommendationid": "33268998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033107016", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 251, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499798803}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f", "timestamp_created": 1499250087, "timestamp_updated": 1499250087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.397131", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33254980": {"recommendationid": "33254980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119209886", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510681164}, "language": "english", "review": "I would like more content for this game cause i thought it was too short.

The game isn't super difficult, and I never found myself taking more than 5 tries on each level. The levels are designed to be easy to complete and make you feel smart after you beat them.\n\nThe graphics are also simple, not making use of flashy or particularly great art, but the ambient sounds and associated music are fairly chill and fun to listen to while you solve simple puzzles.\n\n\n\nThe physics in Art of Gravity isn't anything new, and we have no shortage of physics games, that being said, these physics are pleasant to watch. I'm not sure if it's the slow motion, or the pretty patterns the voxels create; but either way, it is incredibly fun to watch. This alone helps the game be fun, as it helps you gain a sense of completion after you beat each stage.\n\n\n\nOverall, Art of Gravity is exactly what it says, it's all about gravity. It is an entertaining game that gives you a solid stream of content throughout its levels. The art is basic, but the music and sound effects are good, and the levels are all unique, and I can see myself coming back to this game.

To find diamonds in the rough like this little gem here.  It's a pleasure for me to experience this game and to livestream it and shout it out and share with my viewers.\n\nSimple enough game where the object is to use the items given to you on each level shown in the upper right of each screen to destroy all voxels on each level.  Using trial and error and strategy as well as what you've learned from previous levels, your objective is obvious.  When you succeed, the explosion of the voxels on your screen offers a super satisfying sense of accomplishement.\n\nWatch my video above (or the end of it where I score this game) to see how I came up with my \"MUST BUY\" recommend for this awesome and super unique strategy puzzler voxel game, but this game has earned my highest indie game score of 2017 so far with an impressive 96% score.\n\nThanks again to this developer who showed up in my livestream, be sure you check it out to see me personally thank and praise him as well as ask him why he undersold himself with such a low price tag on this little diamond of a game!", "timestamp_created": 1497380163, "timestamp_updated": 1497380683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475636", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39493370": {"recommendationid": "39493370", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993502256", "num_games_owned": 832, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 111, "last_played": 1516478000}, "language": "german", "review": "Kaputt machen! Yay!\n\nArt of Gravity ist ein kleines Denkspiel mit 75 interessanten Leveln. In dem Spiel geht es darum, Bl\u00f6cke kaputt zu machen, indem man B\u00e4lle gegen sie wirft. Das passiert aus einer direktionalen Richtung, die immer einer Seite des Blocks zugewandt ist. Es gibt dabei verschiedene Arten von B\u00e4llen und sozusagen Power-Ups, die direkt in das Spielgeschehen eingreifen.\n\nGrafisch ist das Spiel dabei sehr minimalistisch gehalten, sieht aber stimmig und rund aus. Auch der Soundtrack und die Effekte klingen gut und sehen sch\u00f6n aus. Vor allem die Physik hinter dem Spiel hat etwas angenehmes und es ist schon fast beruhigend, den Bl\u00f6cken beim Fallen zuzuschauen.\n\nViel mehr ist auch nicht zu sagen. Wer ungern Dinge kaputt macht und nicht so gern \u00fcberlegt, der sollte nach einem anderen Spiel Ausschau halten.

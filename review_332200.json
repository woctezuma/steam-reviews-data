I love Metroidvania titles, but sadly by the end of this game, I actually hated it.\n\nThe first of Axiom Verge's problems is that while it has all you would expect from a Metroidvania game, it feels like it does everything it does only because that's what a Metroidvania does. By comparison, in something like Super Metroid or the more recent Hollow Knight, each location or screen justifies its existence with a unique challenge or sense of purpose. So while those maps are filled with shafts, corridors and rooms, each is unique and purposefully designed enough to confer a real sense of adventure and discovery. Axiom Verge is also full of shafts, corridors and rooms, but most fail to carve out an identity. As you backtrack in the best Metroidvania games, it's a fun journey back through places previously explored, but in Axiom Verge, it's just a trudge.\n\nThe game has numerous procedurally generated secret areas, but sadly these highlight the map design's shortcomings. I was braced for something that came with the hallmarks of procedurally generated areas - the repetition, comparative lack of identity and so on. Yet they feel no different to the game's other locations to traipse through. And not because of any particularly impressive procedural work, but simply because the bulk of the game's main locations feel so lacking in gameplay spark themselves.\n\nThis isn't uniform - locations like Kur impress more than any other area in the game, and it's a shame there isn't more like it. Another area which tries something more different is Edin, but sadly that brings me to the game's major flaw.\n\nUp until you reach Edin, the game is a solid but unspectacular Metroid alike. However, two things happen once you reach Edin. The first is that several incredibly annoying enemy archetypes become the predominant form of adversary in the game. It turns the last few zones of the game into an agonising crawl. It completely drains any fun out of the game. You can eventually find one of three weapons which deals with these enemy types more easily. However, these weapons can only be found in \"hard\" secret areas, of which only one will spawn per save file. In my case, the area was located essentially a few steps from the final boss door and was of no use whatsoever to me by that point.\n\nThe second thing which happens in Edin is what I can only describe as the most awful boss fight I've ever seen in a video game. The bosses are mostly ok up until this point. Easy and bullet spongy, but at least involving and visually impressive. However the boss of Edin will haunt my gaming nightmares forever, and was so hideously frustrating I almost put the game down and never returned to it. The subsequent bosses aren't a lot better.\n\nIt's a shame and I appreciate the huge undertaking this project must be for a lone developer, but I just didn't like this game at all by the end of it. It looks stunning, and had it ended 1/3 earlier I might be writing a tentative recommendation here.

With excellent presentation, memorable locales, and a fun exploration loop. If you like the genre, you'll like it. That being said, it's important to note one thing: Axiom Verge falls ont the Metroid end rather than Castelvania. As such, you on't be exploring one giant area with one theme, but rather separate ones connected together.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind with Axiom verge is its visuals direction. The game does an excellent job at the retro aesthetic while still having its own identity. Some parts of the game aree very Giger-esque as well, which is something I really love. And obviously, the soundtrack; rather than going full-on chiptune like some, Thomas Happ ombined that with modern electronic musi to create this very catchy and atmospheric soundtrack. Sometimes I would just stop to take it all in. This also blends into the presentation, as everything feels like it's moving to the beat.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's the usual metroidvania. You go around, platform for a bit, kill enemies, find stuff, etc. It doesn't break new ground, but for what it does it does well. The game does a good job at making oddities stand out, so you always go \"wait a minute\"and rush bak to a location. Of course, there are some issues with clarity later on, so one might wander around for a bit. The boss fights are visually impressive and can be somewhat overwhelming at first, but unfortunately half of them don't feel like that much of a challenge and more of an extreme annoyance. This kinda reaches its logical conclusion with the final boss that has some rather redundant combat sequence. \n\nThe abilities, however, are really fun. The glitch mechanic is pretty clever and it's always great to try it out. Each weapon feels useful, altho you might get a \"weapong of choice\" as you go on and never use the others that much. My favorite abailites were the grapple hook and the dash, it feels great to speed through previously visited areas.\n\nAxiom Verge is ultimately an example of how a presentation and direction can greatly improve the experience of an already solid game.

Also the game difficulty isn't as challenging as many claims but quite easy. \n\nNow how the game regressed, for one there is not fast travel system like castlevania, they have this vehicle that lets you travel to shortcuts, but not as efficient as a fast travel system. Also there's no item indicators like metroid making item searching a real pain sometime as I have to retrace my steps which isn't challenging but a waste of time. The games secret isn't as rewarding as metroid as that game have well hidden secrets.\n\nThe story and lore is very interesting but the ending just gave more question rather than answers, which could lead to a sequel.\n\n\nOverall it's worth playing the game, as it is a worthwhile experience, but it isn't as good as many claims, as they didn't do much to elevate or streamline the metroidvania genre, the powerups are unique though like glitch powers is very well integrated in the game play, but things such as no treasure indicator could make some people less motivated the 100% the game.\n\nFor a better metroidvania game imo, try shantae and the pirate's curse, salt and sanctuary, rabi-ribi, and especially ori and the blind forest, Outland AND guacamelee. \n(NOTE) Im a huge fan of the metroidvania genre and this game is not one of the best I seen the above I mention are better", "timestamp_created": 1515532984, "timestamp_updated": 1515572123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39194938": {"recommendationid": "39194938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005413139", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 417, "last_played": 1515427019}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like platformers in the vein of Metroid with a good story, you're unlikely to be disappointed. \n\nMe, I must have spent 4 hours all in all trying to find where the heck I was supposed to go next, finding secrets instead.", "timestamp_created": 1515456420, "timestamp_updated": 1515456420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503968", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39193986": {"recommendationid": "39193986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009056934", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 614, "last_played": 1515446297}, "language": "english", "review": "Axiom Verge is a fairly traditional Metroidvania in terms of gameplay.

This is quite easily the best metroidvania I've played, possibly ever, even going so far as to include direct references to both titles of the genre's namesake.\n\nThe first thing that strikes me is the graphics and soundtrack. Upon first starting the game you're treated to dazzling pixelated graphics and animations, and a score unique in its own way while never, ever distracting from gameplay. Throughout the game you're treated to nine named areas (I'm not counting the boss area), but within even those you get anywhere from two to four separate biomes, each unique and beautiful in its own right. The enemies are well designed and each unique as well, which brings me to mechanics.\n\nOne of the most blaringly unique mechanics is the address disruptor. Without spoiling too much, it essentially allows you to corrupt enemies, turning them into either a different enemy, a health well, or some other odd thing that invariably helps you. The other obvious unique mechanic is the lab coat, allowing you to [spoiler]essentially glitch through walls[/spoiler]. Beyond that, the weapons are all inspired and creative, and the other mechanics are equally exciting. Every time you get one it feels worth the effort.\n\nLast of all, the story. The story, I think, is where this game has its downfall. It was confusing at times, left holes at others, and was completely nonsensical the rest of the time. Ultimately, the story was unsatisfying. But knowing the story had nothing to do with playing the rest of the game. I think, while it maybe doesn't compare to some other games, the poor story kind of falls on the sidelines.\n\nAs an ending note, I want to mention that there were three unique scripts created for this game, and once again bring up that this entire game was programmed, drawn, and composed solely by the man named Tom Happ.\n\ntl;dr\nGood game, go play it, but don't expect much from the story.", "timestamp_created": 1515192729, "timestamp_updated": 1515192729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39092061": {"recommendationid": "39092061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054738517", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "last_played": 1516421175}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're interested in this game, you probably like the Metroid series, or at least the Metroidvania subgenre. If that's true, look no further. Axiom Verge is probably the best Metroid game that doesn't have Metroid in the title. It pulled me in, compelling me to keep playing. Exploring its manifold areas feels fresh and exciting in a way that, again, few games besides Metroid manage to do.\n\nThat's not to say that its a copycat, though, at least aesthetically. The world of Axiom Verge is bizarre and alien, both a thriving ecology and a technological wasteland. Even the design of the weapons and items factors into this, many of them being wholly unlike ones from other games, both visually and in how they work. And the music... it's very good as well, and despite being electronic, doesn't immediately remind me of anything else. most of the time it's a well-crafted mix of energetic and ethereal ambience, but the boss themes take a cue from Streets of Rage and are straight up danceable.\n\nBesides the standard weapons, movement upgrades, and health/damage, etc collectibles, you'll find interesting non-standard items that bring back the spirit of retro games in an interesting way. I'm talking, of course, about the address disruptor and passcode tool. I suppose the address disruptor is essentially just another way to get around the world, but it does it by \"glitching out\" enemies and certain blocks as if the game's data had been corrupted. Then there's the passcode tool, which obviously is not used to restore a saved game like on the NES, but rather alter aspects of the game with passwords you'll find in notes scattered across the game. Hint: when you first get it, enter \"JUSTIN-BAILEY\". You won't regret it.\n\nAll of this combines to create a highly polished, very fun game that, yes, is building off of an established formula, but doing it in a uniquely stylish way.

My only critique that holds it back from beating out super metroid is that the later bosses (looking at you bee boss) spend a little too much time floating around being invincible.\n\nConsidering that this is an indie game, beating out every other metroidvania bar one is an incredible feat.

For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws.

Do you enjoy platforming shooters? Do you enjoy exploration in general? If yes to any of these, then play Axiom Verge.\n\nThis game had much more fun for me than I figured it would!\n\nAxiom Verge seems to follow a recent trend of pixel graphics in the past couple of years, which might throw people off if they are annoyed by it. But in my opinion, I feel like the developers did it just right for Axiom Verge. The pixel graphics style definitely fits the abnormal, futuristic world you are on, especially with some of the crazy and awkward scenes you encounter, and some of the obstacles and weapons you get to use later in the game. I cannot go into much detail without spoilers, but it was a great decision and executed well.\n\nThe premise of the game is that you awaken in an alien world and, unsurprisingly, need to navigate your way around it and find a way home. Pretty quickly you reach some NPC's and start learning more about the world and what steps you need to complete in order to return home, so you are not left in the dark for too long. The story actually develops pretty nicely, and gives some interesting quirks as you go. I was very satisfied with the progress and conclusion.\n\nAxiom Verge's gameplay is as mentioned in the questions at the beginning of my review. You are exploring the world using platforming as well as shooting weapons (from bullet guns to lasers to bombs to many other things), with the actual mechanics of getting around being the primary puzzle for the game, as you will need to find upgrades for new abilities.\n\nThis sort of game style has again been very common for decades, and while some games can make it tedious and boring, I found that Axiom Verge yet again was well-developed and made the world interesting enough to explore, and I never felt like I was getting tired of it.\n\nNote that the game does have a handful of hidden collectibles and upgrades in the game, as is sometimes expected in this \"Metroidvania\" genre, but they are not extremely common and sometimes the game will give you obvious hints if you pay attention to what happens on the screen. For instance, you might notice an enemy walking at the top edge of the screen and then suddenly disappear, meaning that there's likely a wall to break up there leading to another screen.\n\nFurther, though a slight spoiler (even though you can see it in the trailer), you obtain a Remote Drone a bit of the way into the game, which allows you to explore more safely. It is a mobile robot (that almost looks like a headcrab from Half-Life) that you can shoot into the air and then start controlling whenever it lands. While you control it, your own character is shielded and cannot be hurt by enemies, though note that the drone has its own health bar too and can temporarily die. The Remote Drone allows you to reach awkward places or simply navigate a little bit without having to leap off cliffs yourself, meaning that it will save you from having to climb all the way back up with your own character.\n\nThere is also a ridiculous amount of weapons to be found in the game, and even though I only ended up using about 5 of them for most of my gameplay, there is more than enough variety for people to find what they like to use.\n\nMy last detail is the music and sound of the game, which is underrated in my opinion. The music is phenomenal, even for the retro style, and each sub-world inside the map has their own interesting songs that definitely mesh with the vibes from their own graphics.\n\nAll in all, Axiom Verge is well worth it in my book.", "timestamp_created": 1514949602, "timestamp_updated": 1514950162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38994048": {"recommendationid": "38994048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260696920", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511632862}, "language": "english", "review": "As a Metroid fan I can say that this is one of the best indie games ive played in recent years.

The game then takes on a very linear feeling as to what exactly you can actually explore. \n\n[u][i]Visual Cues/Language:[/i][/u]\nComplicating this linear exploration is an inconsistent and obnoxious design language. Is shooting everything in sight with several different types of weapons and tools (without nearly any visual hint of where a secret might be hiding) fun? Axiom Verge thinks so.  This again breaks one of the key axioms of any metroidvania. Creating a consistent visual vocabulary to indicate where an ability or weapon might be used. This creates a sense of mystery and anticipation when a new ability or weapon is uncovered to then be able to test out on previous locked areas. \n\nThere are many examples of this type of inconsistency and lack of thought when it comes to setting up the rules of the world and the visual language that follows. There is a part of the main quest that is impossible to pass without shooting an area of liquid with a \"glitch gun.\" The problem is this is never set up as something you can do within the world. No other liquid will react to your glitch gun - not before or after. \n\nSimilarly there is a tool that allows you to open secret areas if you type in a password within the menu. At first these passwords are found on notes scattered in the world. The problem here is again the inconsistent design, there are litterally only 2 notes that do this. The others take on their own individual solutions that are found by other means and each is different from the other. There is case after case of this that I won't drone on about. \n\n[u][i]Color Palette:[/i][/u]\nWhen you have red-ish creatures jumping from pink-ish liquid shooting red-ish orange dots at you against a dark red/maroon backdrop with a brownish figure that needs to dodge them you might want to rethink your color choices. After playing this game for 20+hrs I definitly think the strain on my eyes lowered my vision. Nostalgia is fun until someone loses an eye.\n\n[u][i]Risk & Reward:[/i][/u]\nThere aren't that many bosses in this game, so you would think each time you beat one you get something awesome right? Wrong. There are a few items of interest after you defeat some of the bosses yet for others there is nothing. Literally nothing. 'Hey you get to progress to the next part of the game - isn't that reward enough?' \n\nWhat's worse is that for extremely important items there is no build up to receiving them. They're simply laying on the floor of some room you enter. Just for comparison [url=https://www.gamelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/oy3.jpg]this[/url] is what a Metroid item usually sits in and [url=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yUonnTtrpmY/maxresdefault.jpg]here[/url] is where you find one of the most important abilities in Axiom.\n\nAxiom Verge also smothers you with a seemingly endless assortment of weapons. I thought I had reached the end when I found 10. There are more than 20. Finding a weapon is less of a thrill and more an annoyance (since you didn't find a cool new ability) given you're likely to stick to one or two weapons to use 90% of the time. On top of that abilities you do end up receiving feel clumsy (grappling hook) making your power-up feel anti-climatic. Again for comparison look at Super Metroid where you unlock sprint or super jump that earnestly make you feel more powerful.\n\n[u][i]Character Design[/i][/u]\nAs a scientist there couldn't be a more generic and uninspired figure than looking at [url=https://static.squarespace.com/static/4f7c8818e4b000a129e38a56/52e73659e4b090f501f6fe06/52e7365ae4b090f501f6fea8/1363913002747/1000w/TraceCoats2.png]this [/url] for 10-20+hrs.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story is largely flat, uninspired and boring. I didn't buy the game expecting much, if anything in terms of story but when the dialogue and cutscenes actually detract from the game experience it becomes a drag on the overall enjoyment. If the story were short and bad it wouldn't be worth mentioning and sci-fi is tyipcally filled with jibberish words but none so terribly constructed as here. \n\nPart of the problem is that the characters are computers without personality, and a scientist that offers little interest or character. Dialogue is tedious often without story purpose or emotional intent. You will likely find yourself tuning out fairly often & early on. \n\n[h1]Technical [/h1]\nZero problems. To the developer's credit the game is polished on a technical level in terms of its options and stability.\n\n[h1]Bottom Line[/h1]\nThere's no question Axiom is a flawed game.

And the super weapon also random from 1 of 3 for each newgame, which means u can't collect all of them in one playthrough.\n-passcode system, the game requires player to get a clue from the game to retrieve the codes.

They are all indeed right and I can't add too much more of it. If Metroid-like games are your thing or you just want something while we all wait for Nintendo to give us another one (Prime 4 as of this writing), you won't go wrong here! Grab the soundtrack, it's excellent!\n\nI do want to touch on a few things that I noticed that I didn't see mentioned in many reviews.\n\n[list]\n[*] Probably the best thing Axiom Verge has over any other Metroidvania that I've seen is it's approach to movement. With some very few understandable exceptions (Labcoats), I found myself using EVERYTHING, even at the very end of the game, especially your glitch powers! They all feel great with practice and you can pull off some impressive skill based manuvers.\n[*]I did find the number of weapons a bit excessive, while I did get some use out of them all. I felt like they were cumbersome to select, especially at the end. This is not a problem unique to this game.\n[*] On one hand I do love it's hands off approach to progression, on the other hand there are times where it does expect you to go one way, but you feel more compelled to go another. (I'm looking at YOU [strike] enterance to E-Kur-Mah![/strike] After your first trek through Ukkin-Na!). If you are lost, there's no shame in using a guide.\n[*] The Story is VERY much a Your mileage may vary. I think its pretty good though more obtuse than it probably should be. One sequence in particular, while kind of frustrating IMHO was a highlight (\"Fever\" that's all I'll say)\n[*]  Some endgame foes that are very tough! As for common enemies, you'd be suprised at what the Address distruptor can do (or perhaps a different gun?), bosses usually have some kind of trick to them, just keep your head on your shoulders, and if all else fails, find a new gun. In fact I had more problems dying to get to my location/beat a tough boss rather than getting lost.\n[*] I do feel like a lot of the early game art is a bit too samey, but once you break out of Kur into the upper regions...completley different story!\n[/list]\n\nAnything I didn't mention (and a few that I did) have been mentioned a million times before.

I've played this game offline during my daily commute to and from work).\n\nIt's an excellent metroidvania, not much else to say there.\n\nThe plot is confusing but in a good way. It manages to surprise you without losing you. The characters aren't exactly deep but serviceable to the story.\n\nAlthough I have a few gripes with the gameplay, it's overall well done. The various upgrades you get bring variation to how you progress throughout the levels, but the variety of weapons feels forced. I swear I must have collected a dozen different weapons but in the end only really needed to use 2 or 3 of them because the rest felt like underpowered variations of those. At the very end of the game I even ended up only using one very strong weapon that rendered the rest completely useless.\n\nThankfully these downsides weren't enough to ruin the game for me. Far from it. I had a blast from start to finish and I definitely recommend it to anyone that likes the genre.\n\nOh, also the fact that it runs smoothly on a weak tablet is another plus (x5-Z8300 with 2GB of RAM in my case, at 1280*800).", "timestamp_created": 1514556849, "timestamp_updated": 1514556957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38814342": {"recommendationid": "38814342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095924054", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514545191}, "language": "english", "review": "A indie Metrovania game that can be fun at times. \n\nThe last boss fight was ridiculously unfair but its still a nice addition to the metrovania genre.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514544891, "timestamp_updated": 1514544891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38803545": {"recommendationid": "38803545", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964147328", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "last_played": 1515298402}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good metroid-style game.

Also it's a nice touch that the earlier areas of the game aren't just some random parts that you run through and never see again, but rather you can (and should) return at later points.\nOne thing to note here is that although the levels are well put together, in some places it's inevitable to take damage and in others you get hit by enemies or projectiles that come from off-screen (out of screen? you get the point).\nI played on hard difficulty - it's challenging but not ridiculous. Maybe if you're not a pleb like me, you won't die 100 times.\n\nThe graphics are top notch (if you're into pixel graphics, that is), they do feel somewhat nostalgic, but also have some tasteful elements of new (like when a Data Bomb explodes). The music likewise, although I do feel like some of the sounds are a bit too harsh, like the ghouls or when a boss appears, but that's really just a minor pet peeve - all in all, most of the sounds fit their purpose well.\n\nFinally, the story is great.

Some unique concepts here that I seen.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Too much weapon selections for a limited octoganal aiming direction and tasking in switching between them. The circular menu tries to alleviate this, but one can accidentally hit the left stick in accidentally triggering weapon changes on the default controller setting WHILE trying to move and lock my aiming in movement.\n\n- Could use dual stick aiming. Many times I had to break in holding a modifier shoot-in-place shoulder button with the default controls. This limits strategy in movement and strain in dexterity in control along with strict diagonal, straight forward, or up aiming. This is a drawback even on those 2D Metroid insipired games.\n\n- Save points. With the lore of the game, one can easily facilitate the fast travel to previous spots in the game, saving having to do past exploration tedium for completion. I would like for this to be an option - and for those speed running to be able to have this disabled for strict adherance to the spirit of the run in discipline. It would be a nice casual feature if there is fast travel between the egg capsules.\n\n- Guess and shoot graphics. The breakable terrain isn't as straight forward as it is in say Super Metroid in discovery and built intuition. Many times I would simply find myself just holding down my fire button with a preferred weapon.\n\n- The fire button. It is painful to continually repeatedly press fire for differing shots. It would simply be nice if some of the weapons call for a toggle switch, allowing to then focus using the awkward standing lock aiming and directional movement. Or... well have the right stick aim separately from the movement controls and allowing the triggers for jump and manual fire. This would alleviate the XABY buttons for item usages and the drone use as intended.\n\n- Locked dedicated map button. Many times I hit the left controller menu button and it would take me to the previous menu screen I last left off at - and if I wanted to keep that button as my quick map, I have to exit the menu screen at the map section. The only other reason for quickly going into the quick menu, is for weapon selection of which the left stick already can take care of this in selection on demand - if I did not hit it accidentally while trying to duck and diagonally shoot.\n\n- Weapon variety is also a double edge sword in detriment. Most are situational. Some will mostly be had in simply of ease in handling. That default Axiom Disrupter will quickly get disregarded and take up UI space. And because of the potential enormous selection, it is a burden to switch between the intended weapons for situations OR overshooting past a selection OR accidetnally switching weapons with the left stick in press.\n\n\nThe Strain:\n\n- Unless I have to get all 100% of the items (for a good ending), there are some areas that aren't clear with the weapons and tools in determining access to those \"bugged\" areas in reach. There are also red herrings of terrain to also confuse the player. This would detract a player in wanting to fully complete the game compounded with lengthy backtracking in manual traveling to already discovered save points. This is in consideration of already \"beating\" the game the first time around.\n\n- The music, while provides an out of world parallel for the experience, will quickly add and compound to the chore in retreading old ground. Sure one can mute it, but the music is already not considerate in repetition, and will add an additional setting chore one has to do, even on a potential first go around and then unmuting again for those boss battles.\n\n- The aiming. This could have easily been a dual stick 2D shooter Metroidvania game. The weapons variety can certainly use this in many situations of expanded boss room fights. But far too many times I have to red-light, green-light, my hold position AND D-pad lock my diagonal in controller strain.\n\n- Weapon selection is a chore. Even with \"Secret of Mana\" circle menu in serialization. Coupled with the left stick in selection PLUS the enormous weapon variety one collects over the game, one can easily overshoot one's intended selection in the heat of battle or as mentioned, accidentally select away from the current weapon in use.\n\n\nOverall, a good game with very much a telling of existential deconstructions and thinking of \"axioms\".

Non esagero, credetemi, quando dico che questo gioco \u00e8 attualmente l'esempio pi\u00f9 brillante di retro-metroidvania in circolazione, un vero e proprio gioiello indie confezionato con una cura e attenzione ai dettagli che lascia di stucco - soprattutto se si pensa che \u00e8 stato concepito e realizzato da una singola persona, il programmatore britannico Tom Happ. \n\nIn via del tutto eccezionale, questa volta vi risparmier\u00f2 accenni anche solo parziali alla trama. Finirei col rivelare troppi dettagli, togliendovi il piacere di ricostruire pezzo dopo pezzo la serie di eventi che coinvolgono Trace, lo scienziato protagonista della storia. Il copione dal taglio sci-fi offre spunti interessanti, trattando in particolare il tema della realt\u00e0 e della percezione, e sa regalare diversi \"coup de th\u00e9atre\" spettacolari, culminando in un epico confronto finale.\n\nCome metroidvania, Axiom Verge non nasconde la predilezione per il taglio futuristico delle avventure di Samus Aran; ci\u00f2 nonostante si avverte per tutto l'arco del gioco un impalpabile quid di mistico estraneo all'universo di Metroid, che trova parziale spiegazione nei dialoghi e nei vari frammenti di scritture che potremo recuperare nel nostro viaggio. Come da tradizione, il mondo esplorabile \u00e8 suddiviso in diversi biomi molto ben caratterizzati a livello ambientale, talvolta accessibili solo se provvisti di determinati power-up o particolari armi (ne esistono pi\u00f9 di 20 tipi differenti).\n\nLa mappa del mondo \u00e8 piuttosto ampia, bench\u00e9 forse leggermente pi\u00f9 piccola di quelle viste nelle diverse incarnazioni di Metroid su console Nintendo. Non vi \u00e8 alcun meccanismo di teletrasporto per accorciare i tempi di spostamento tra le varie zone: a tratti potrebbe risultare noioso passare diversi minuti ad attraversare aree gi\u00e0 esplorate, ma in linea di massima questo aspetto non inficia sulla qualit\u00e0 dell'esperienza di gioco [spoiler](e pi\u00f9 avanti troverete comunque un modo per spostarvi pi\u00f9 agevolmente tra i vari biomi)[/spoiler]. \n\nIl gameplay \u00e8 semplicemente impeccabile. I controlli sono semplici ma estremamente precisi, il gunplay arcade a la \"Contra\" (con la possibilit\u00e0 di far fuoco in 8 direzioni) \u00e8 molto soddisfacente, e nelle fasi avanzate del gioco ci troveremo spesso a dover affrontare delle sezioni di platforming non banali (due parole: [spoiler]BIONIC-COMMANDO[/spoiler]) che metteranno alla prova la nostra coordinazione e reattivit\u00e0. Le boss battle sono ben strutturate, avvincenti e impegnative, senza mai risultare frustranti; talvolta la visuale subir\u00e0 uno zoom-out per permetterci di apprezzare le dimensioni titaniche dei guardiani, rendendo lo scontro ancora pi\u00f9 epico ed emozionante.\n\nParlando di grafica, Axiom Verge sfoggia la pixel-art 8bit pi\u00f9 fedele che io abbia mai visto: semplicemente deliziosa. La modernit\u00e0 del gioco \u00e8 tradita solo dalla complessit\u00e0 di alcuni fondali (difficilmente riscontrabile nei titoli vecchi), mentre per il resto il gioco potrebbe tranquillamente essere il prodotto di punta del catalogo NES negli anni '80. Sul versante audio, la soundtrack non \u00e8 da meno: se quando si parla di chiptune indie l'OST di Hotline Miami rimane un modello difficilmente avvicinabile, le melodie dissonanti di Axiom Verge (senza tralasciare gli effetti sonori) vanno ad occupare di diritto il secondo gradino di un ideale podio.\n\nNota doverosa su una questione delicata che ho gi\u00e0 affrontato sul mio activity feed. \nDopo l'approdo su PC, Axiom Verge \u00e8 stato pubblicato qualche mese fa anche su Nintendo Switch: il 75% dei ricavi delle vendite su questa piattaforma verr\u00e0 donato al fondo per le spese mediche di Alastair, il figlio dello sviluppatore Tom Happ che ha riportato danni neuro-motori permanenti a seguito di una forma di ittero neonatale non affrontata tempestivamente. Da padre prima che giocatore, consiglio a tutti i possessori di Switch di acquistarlo su console portatile, che tra l'altro per via del fattore mobilit\u00e0 a mio avviso rappresenta l'habitat ideale per questo tipo di giochi. \n\nGodersi un gioco eccezionale ed accumulare karma positivo - non potremmo chiedere di meglio!\n\n[i][b]Se questa recensione ti \u00e8 piaciuta clicca \"Segui\" sulla [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/retrogamingcafe/curation]pagina del Curatore[/url] del mio gruppo: sarai sempre aggiornato con i miei personali consigli e le recensioni dei migliori titoli indie/retro/roguelite in circolazione![/b][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1513689004, "timestamp_updated": 1513696132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765569", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38427400": {"recommendationid": "38427400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012848909", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462766328}, "language": "english", "review": "It was nicely paced.

It's simple, do you like Metroidvanias? Do you prefer ones that have less 'vania' in them? Then you will probably like this. Hell, I wasn't a big fan of the original Metroid games and I still love this game.\n\nThe artstyle is definitely what is most offputting in this title, and that's very intentional. Landscapes are garish and bright with clashing colors that, fittingly, are very alien. Key parts of the map are covered in corruption that looks like the kind of graphical glitching you'd see on an old NES or Master System game. Ugly, but with purpose. The soundtrack is all over the place in terms of inspiration. Tracks are definitely memorable, and they fit with the game, but I'm not sure its something that I would ever just listen to. \n\nThat said, when the game decides to make some detailed art (namely the bosses, and the only other friendly NPCs you meet), it looks great, and has a unique style. Like a weird art-deco/H.R. Geiger crossover.\n\nThe actual gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from a Metroid game. Explore an area, get the powerup in it, use that powerup to get to new areas, get more powerups, backtrack and find more areas, rinse, repeat. The game gets creative with the movement powerups though, and it think that's what sets it apart from Metroid. To go into too many details would be spoiler territory though, so I'm going to avoid that. The platforming is good, and there weren't too many bullshit enemies to annoy you.\n\nIts not a long game, but it also doesn't overstay its welcome. And if you find yourself wanting more, there are plenty of hidden rooms and secret maps to discover for the completionist in you. \n\nIf you have any interest in these styles of game, this is a great example of the metroidvania genre, better (I think) than the genre's namesake.

Super Metroid erinnert (was bei dem Genre nicht un\u00fcblich ist, ich wei\u00df). Ich werde hier kurz und knapp auf einige wichtige Punkte eingehen, kann aber schon im Vorfeld sagen dass ich gro\u00dfer Fan des Spiels bin.\n\nDie [h1] Grafik [/h1] ist Metroidvania typisch, und sehr h\u00fcbsch umgesetzt. Gro\u00dfartige Pixelarts, eindrucksvolle Level, klar erkennbare Themen in einzelnen Bereichen. [b] 10/10 [/b]\n\nDer [h1] Soundtrack [/h1] ist in meinen Augen mit das Beste am Spiel, ich empfehle sehr diesen direkt mit dazuzukaufen. Hier erwarten einen Synth Wave typische Tracks, ebenfalls zum Teil an alte Metroid Teile erinnernd. Immer passend zum aktuellen Gebiet in dem man sich befindet, ziehen sie einen immer mehr in die Welt von Axiom Verge. [b] 11/10 [/b]\n\nApropos Welt, das [h1] Leveldesign [/h1] ist, gro\u00dfe \u00dcberraschung, ebenfalls typisch f\u00fcr ein Metroidvania. H\u00fcbsch gemacht, mit vielen Secrets. Sehr gro\u00df angelegt, f\u00fcr das Erkunden kann man viel Zeit einplanen, in der einem nicht langweilig wird. Einige passagen sind allerdings zugegebenerma\u00dfen schon ein wenig.. abgenutzt? Schon oft in Metroidvanias gesehen zumindest. Dies ist nicht zwingend schlimm, aber etwas neues h\u00e4tte nicht geschadet. [b] 7/10 [/b]\n\nLangweilig wird einem allgemein nicht, was auch an dem [h1] Gameplay [/h1] liegt. Viele verschiedene Waffen und F\u00e4higkeiten erwarten einen, wenn man genug erkundet. Doch trotzdem muss ich sagen, dass ich gewisse Probleme mit der Steuerung hatte. Sie funktioniert soweit, ganz klar, aber sie f\u00fchlt sich f\u00fcr mich nicht besonders fl\u00fcssig an. Dies kann eindeutig auch an mir liegen, aber trotzdem hielt ich es f\u00fcr erw\u00e4hnenswert.  [b]7/10[/b]\n\nZu guter letzt sei noch kurz auf die [h1] Story [/h1] eingegangen (keine Sorge, ohne Spoiler!).\nIch muss sagen, ich mochte die Story, und die Erz\u00e4hlweise. Sie ist nichts besonderes, keine Frage, aber sie war passend und stimmig, oft auch im Einklang mit Grafik und Ton sehr eindrucksvoll r\u00fcbergebracht. [b] 8/10 [/b]\n\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1] Alles in allem empfehle ich jedem, der ein Metroidvania zu sch\u00e4tzen wei\u00df oder gerne mal eines ausprobieren m\u00f6chte (der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist nicht niedrig, aber durchaus einsteigerfreundlich), dieses Spiel zu spielen. Besonders f\u00fcr den Kaufpreis lohnt es sich meiner Ansicht nach sehr.\nGesamtwertung: [b] 9/10 [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1511720705, "timestamp_updated": 1511720705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37688479": {"recommendationid": "37688479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148313257", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514752455}, "language": "english", "review": "A true tribute to the 90's classic.

hackers. it's really fun. nothing short of amazing for a game made almost entirely by one person, though it has some inevitable lopsided design here and there that you might anticipate from such a thing. but really a game's amount of imperfections are secondary and often not necessarily related to just how fun the game is, and axiom verge is a lot of fun. the metroid comparisons are on-point, and aesthetically the game is far too indebted to that series for my tastes, but it does make some attempts to distinguish itself. for starters, it has this glitch theme going on throughout the entire game both mechanically and visually, but it often feels like an overlay to the overwhelming Alien/metroid esque art design. there's a focus on the joy of blasting more than range of mobility unlike metroid, and while this doesn't make for a crazily acrobatic platforming game it's incredibly satisfying to play with the game's huge amount of weapons. they're not even close to balanced, but the game is just hard enough and just forgiving enough that you'll feel inspired to experiment with your \"toys\" so the game finds a happy medium between situational use and enough room to allow you to stick your personal favorites. the drone mechanic was a really cute idea, and the obstacle courses designed around it are even cuter. the clever movements you can make with the combination of dashing and drone shooting make exploring for secrets always satisfying even when the methodology to find them gets repetitive. the power ups also feel substantial. while this isn't a very difficult game in my opinion, the difficulty on normal sits just right to make your power ups feel like a nice boon rather than something that just feels nice to get. that's a leg it has up on some metroids, where getting power ups feels good but their helpfulness isn't always tangible if an area's difficulty is too low. also the projectile size increasing power ups are a really cool idea. you get a constant visual representation of how much stronger you've become rather than values being changed under the hood. i'm getting tired of writing this, but really axiom verge is just pure action game fun. if you like blasting, you'll be satisfied. if you like filling out maps and getting items, you'll be satisfied. you can just get into the zone and have a good time. the story is too ambitious for this format and it failed to ever make me care about the amount of hidden lore to the world, but despite this the designer doesn't force so much story on you that it's ever a distraction. so it's no flaw. tom happ is clearly a passionate gamer and designer, and the sales of axiom verge have helped him with real life struggles like his child's severe health issues (look it up, it's too important for my stupid steam review). so if you're on the fence about this purchase know two things, you will almost certainly enjoy it enough, and you'll be helping out the kind of guy that the industry thrives

The soundtrack fits very well with the atmosphere the game is making and keeps to the retro feel\n\nThe things I didn't really care for was the double tap mechanics for one of the moves, It just didn't feel right and made certain jumps feel awkward and i would of prefered to have the ability on a hot key or something. The other issue I had with the game was while there was tons of weapons you could pick up and use I found myself only really caring to use 3-4 of them and the others just sit on the wayside. Honestly I think there was too many weapons, and would of probably preferred a system where the weapons upgraded and changed as you progressed or had more powerful versions. \n\nOverall though I would highly recommend Axiom Verge to anyone who enjoys metroidvania and is looking to kill a few hours. \n", "timestamp_created": 1509265099, "timestamp_updated": 1509265099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526864", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36097183": {"recommendationid": "36097183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041288643", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451216973}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc218\uc791\n\n\uaf2d \ud560\uc778\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uae38 \ubc14\ub780\ub2e4\n\n\uba54\ud2b8\ub85c\ubca0\ub2c8\uc544 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c RPG \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ube80 \uc561\uc158\uacfc \ud37c\uc990\ub85c \ucc44\uc6cc\uc9c4 \uac8c\uc784\n\n1\uc778 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc598\uae38 \ub4e4\uc5c8\uc744\ub54c \uc81c\uc791\uc790\uac00 \uc678\uacc4\uc778\uc778 \uc904 \uc54c\uc558\ub2e4\n\n\uadf8\ub9cc\ud07c \ub3c4\ud2b8\ud004\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc640 \uc0ac\uc6b4\ub4dc \ud004\ub9ac\ud2f0\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud558\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1509246204, "timestamp_updated": 1509246204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36068016": {"recommendationid": "36068016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024738909", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512855402}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing Metroid: Samus Returns on my 2DS XL lately and I must say this game is on par if not slightly cooler in my opinion.

In den ersten zwei Spielstunden habe ich das Spiel gehasst! Ich bin dauernd gestorben und bin immer wieder zum Spawnei zur\u00fcckgekehrt. Dann hat es bei mir Klick gemacht. Ich spielte das Spiel falsch. Man macht sich das Spiel deutlich leichter, wenn man alle Gegner langsam t\u00f6tet und diese austrickst. Selbst manche Bosse kann man austricksen. Nachdem ich diese Einsicht hatte hat mir das Spiel pl\u00f6tzlich viel mehr Spa\u00df gemacht. An sich finde ich es jedoch nicht so toll, dass ich gezwungen wurde einen gewissen Spielstil zu nehmen, da ich finde, dass der Spieler stets die Freiheit haben sollte, wie er zu spielen hat.\nViele meinen, dass der Grafikstil h\u00e4sslich sei. Ich pers\u00f6nlich habe die Sch\u00f6nheit in diesen Pixeln gefunden und manche technologischen Dinge, wie die gro\u00dfen Roboter (die haben auch einen Namen, nur f\u00e4llt er mir gerade nicht ein) sehen aus als h\u00e4tte H.R. Giger also der Alienerfinder daran mitgezeichnet. Wenn sich Thomas Happ nicht daran orientiert hatte wo sonst frage ich mich.\nJedoch sollte man auch die Schw\u00e4chen des Spiels nicht vergessen. Faszinierenderweise treten die eher am Ende des Spiels auf. Mit der Steuerung habe ich mich mit dem Gamepad zurecht gefunden, nur ist das teleportieren derma\u00dfen umst\u00e4ndlich... unglaublich so etwas. Um zu teleportieren muss man den linken Stick auf dem Xbox 360 Controller zweimal in dieselbe Richtung bewegen. Dies funktioniert auch mit dem Steuerkreuz, nur diejenigen die den 360 Controller kennen, wissen, dass das leichter gesagt als getan ist. Der 360 Controller und dessen Steuerkreuz sind nun mal nicht so pr\u00e4zise. Eine Tatsache, welche Thomas Happ wohl vergessen hatte. Jedenfalls am Ende des Spiels muss man Bosse und auch den Endgegner mit der Teleportationsf\u00e4higkeit besiegen. Zumindest ist es dann einfacher. Und das ist eine derartige Finger\u00fcbung + unpr\u00e4ziser Steuerung ist dann einfach nicht mehr sch\u00f6n. Ich musste f\u00fcr einen Boss sogar kurzzeitig mit der Tastatur spielen um ihn endlich besiegen zu k\u00f6nnen!\nDes Weiteren ist die Orientierungslosigkeit in Axiom Verge derma\u00dfen \u00fcbertrieben... Klar, das ist nun mal der Sinn in einem Metroidvania. Um sich dort zu verlaufen. Nur w\u00e4re es - meiner Meinung nach - besser gewesen man h\u00e4tte wenigstens kurz erw\u00e4hnt wo man hin m\u00fcsste. Also per Textform w\u00e4hrend einer Diskussion zwischen Charakteren. Es muss ja nicht gleich der spezifische Raum sein wo ich hin muss. Mir h\u00e4tte das Areal schon gereicht. W\u00e4re dann bei weitem besser gewesen. Schlie\u00dflich waren die besten Momente des Spiels bei denen ich wusste wo ich hin musste. Dieses Gef\u00fchl nach Stunden der Orientierungslosigkeit endlich den weiterf\u00fchrenden Weg gefunden zu haben ist so erf\u00fcllend. Ich sags euch! Nur ist das einfach echt umst\u00e4ndlich wenn man von Areal zu Areal l\u00e4uft, ohne Schnellreise, au\u00dfer vielleicht dem Kopf in \"Indi\", welcher noch einer Schnellreise gleicht, und ohne M\u00f6glichkeit schneller zu sein. Klar, man hat das Teleportieren, nur ist dieses dann wieder so umst\u00e4ndlich, dass man lieber l\u00e4uft.\n\nKommen wir f\u00fcr die Schnellen unter uns einfach mal zur Pro-Contra-Liste:\n\n[u][b]Pro:[/b][/u]\n\n+ Grafikstil ist zwar recht trist, sieht aber dennoch recht gut aus. Es ist allerdings schon einmal in einem Areal vorgekommen, dass alles aufgrund des Grafikstils un\u00fcbersichtlich war. (Shopseite 4. Screenshot von rechts)\n+ Soundtrack ist recht gut. Dieser wechselt auch von Areal zu Areal. Insofern etwas schade, da in \"Indi\", einem Areal, keinerlei Musik gespielt wird und diese auch oft durchquert werden muss um zwischen den Arealen hin- und herzureisen.\nBei manchen Tracks innerhalb eines Areals k\u00f6nnte man auch glatt denken, dass Daft Punk selbst beim Soundtrack geholfen hat!\n+ Sollte man wenig Leben haben, so piepst es dauerhaft. Man glaubt es kaum, aber dieses Piepen passt oft zum Soundtrack! F\u00f6rdert schon fast mit wenig Leben durch die Welt zu schlendern nur um die Musik noch besser genie\u00dfen zu k\u00f6nnen! Jedoch ist dies nur in manchen Arealen der Fall. In \"Indi\" (Ja, ich hasse dieses Areal, nicht weil es schwer ist, es ist nur furchtbar langweilig) piepst es einfach nur nervig bis man sich wieder geheilt hat.\n+ Bosse sowie normale Gegner kann man austricksen durch die Umgebung\n+ Viele verschiedene Waffen und F\u00e4higkeiten. Es sollte eigentlich jeder seine Lieblingswaffe finden.\n+ Die F\u00e4higkeit Gegner zu hacken, oder umzucodieren ist genial! Manche Gegner sto\u00dfen statt giftige Gase, dann Lebenspunkte f\u00fcr dich aus!\n+ Der Abspann war witzig und einfallsreich.\n\n[u][b]Contra:[/b][/u]\n\n- Spawnanimation ist zu lang. Ich pers\u00f6nlich bin jemand der nach einem Tod sofort es wieder probieren m\u00f6chte. Nur ist dieses angespannte warten vor dem Bildschirm, w\u00e4hrend sich erstmal langsam das Spawnei \u00f6ffnet einfach nur derma\u00dfen \u00e4rgerlich.\n- Normalerweise bin ich ein Fan von Orientierungslosigkeit und Selbstfindung seitens des Spielers, nur hat dies in Axiom Verge keinerlei Spa\u00df gemacht. Man rennt von Areal zu Areal um mit seiner neuen F\u00e4higkeit hoffentlich eine T\u00fcr aufzubekommen. Meiner Meinung nach ist es etwas zu extrem geworden.\n- Zum Schie\u00dfen muss man den X-Knopf auf dem Gamepad mehrmals dr\u00fccken. Dies macht erstens keinerlei Spa\u00df die ganze Zeit einen Knopf zu dr\u00fccken und zweitens schmerzt irgendwann mein Daumen. Gl\u00fccklicherweise ist dies nicht bei allen Waffen so. Wenn man jedoch manche dieser Waffen nicht gefunden hat, da diese n\u00e4mlich nicht Pflicht sind um das Spiel zu beenden, hat man halt echt Pech und Daumenschmerzen...\n- Es ist mir unerkl\u00e4rlich wann ein Gegner Lebenspunkte droppt und wann nicht. Es scheint willk\u00fchrlich zu sein. Insofern idiotisch, da manche Gegner deutlich mehr Schaden machen, w\u00e4hrend manche mich \u00fcberhaupt nicht aktiv angreifen oder verfolgen, w\u00e4hrend die starken Gegner dies tun und keinerlei Lebenspunkte droppen. Manchmal kommt es auch vor, dass man die Lebenspunkte erst gar nicht erreichen kann. Bei manchen Bossarenen war dies der Fall, oder auch bei diversen fliegenden normalen Gegnern.\n- Gegner spawnen oft gleich nach dem Verlassen des Raumes wieder. Sehr, sehr, sehr nervig w\u00e4hrend man mit Backtracking besch\u00e4ftigt ist!\n- Das Spielm\u00e4nnlein sammelt auch gedroppte Lebenszellen ein, selbst wenn die Lebensanzeige komplett gef\u00fcllt ist. Das Daliegen der Lebenspunkte und die sp\u00e4tere Verwendung dieser ist also nicht m\u00f6glich, wenn man diese zuvor aus Versehen einsammelt.\n[spoiler]- Der Spieler selbst kann nicht entscheiden, ob er Athetos leben lassen m\u00f6chte, oder nicht. Nein, Trace beleidigt ihn erstmal als Trottel und f\u00e4ngt an zu k\u00e4mpfen...[/spoiler]\n\n[u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u]\n\n+- Die Story ist etwas, nun ja, uninteressant, aber wenigstens hat Athetos ein nachvollziehbares Motiv.\n+- Backtracking macht einerseits Spa\u00df, da man dann die vorher beschrittenen Wege mit neuen Augen sieht, dank der neuen F\u00e4higkeiten, nur gibt es komplette Passagen, welche auf dem Weg zur \"F\u00e4higkeitsnutzstelle\" einfach nur langweilig sind.\n+- Eine deutsche \u00dcbersetzung ist zwar vorhanden, nur ist diese stellenweise bei Dialogen und bei einigen zu findenden Notizen fehlerhaft.\n\nAxiom Verge ist eines dieser Spiele, bei denen ich empfehle sie einmal gespielt zu haben und danach nie wieder. Sehr schade eigentlich. Ich verstehe nicht wie Thomas Happ diese M\u00e4ngel einfach komplett \u00fcbersehen hat. Dennoch empfehle ich dieses Spiel. Selbst f\u00fcr den Vollpreis ist das Spiel sogar zu empfehlen. 17,99\u20ac scheint ein fairer Preis zu sein.\nZuletzt m\u00f6chte ich noch erw\u00e4hnen, dass ich urspr\u00fcnglich etwas anderes vom Spiel erwartet hatte. Ich hab mich eher auf einen Shoot \u00b4em up eingestellt und stattdessen Daumenschmerzen erhalten. Danke daf\u00fcr!\n\nIch danke f\u00fcrs Lesen und w\u00fcnsche sehr viel Spa\u00df beim Spielen! ;-)\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/332200/Axiom_Verge/", "timestamp_created": 1508065514, "timestamp_updated": 1513361645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35735344": {"recommendationid": "35735344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025622980", "num_games_owned": 543, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505944584}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent metroidvania.

I'm not sure that's entirely fair. Yes, it's a Metroidvania, and yes, there are a ton of similarities. But I think the things that make it different are pretty vast.\n\nI think the one thing that surprised me the most is the story presentation. It's a pretty typical sci-fi where a lot of philosophical questions are asked about ethical situations that would arise from advanced technology, but I think Axiom Verge proves that the Metroidvania format is a great way to tell that kind of story. You can explore post-disaster aftermath and learn from the environment details what might have happened. This makes it fun to theorize about anything the story doesn't tell you blatantly, but even if you're completely blind to these things the story told through dialog and cutscenes is quite interesting - at least it was to me. I don't think it's quite as masterful at the environment-based story telling as a few other games, but I think it still does it well.\n\nThe graphical presentation may be one of the weaknesses that keeps it from being on top with the likes of Dark Souls and Hollow Knight in this regard. At points the art is beautiful and I was awed by it. Other times it's only the chipset tiles the likes of which you might have seen in the original NES Metroid. Occasionally the color pallet causes the background to mesh with the foreground, but it wasn't common enough to make it a major complaint.\n\nWhere there are no flaws though is the music. It's perfect. It captures that feeling of disturbing loneliness that Metroid 2 and Super Metroid had. Sometimes it's upbeat techno, but at appropriate times it gets dark and unnerving. It really hit home on the final stretch to the end of the game, sending chills down my spine for that last confrontation the game had been building up to.\n\nFor the most part, controlling the main character Trace feels good. It's maybe not the best sidescrolling shooter I've played, but there are a ton of weapons to play with and they all have infinite ammo. This is one of the things that sets it apart from its Metroidvania forefather (er.. foremother...brain?) I played the game on Hard Mode, so I drifted back to the first and third weapons you find for most of my playthrough simply because I favor burst damage as part of my playstyle. But I did give most of the weapons token usage as I came across particularly tricky enemy types to deal with.\n\nA lot of enemies - especially in the endgame - it seemed like the best strategy was to trick them into a corner and hit them while they couldn't reach me. The game has a signature mechanic that lets you change the nature of enemies though so there is a decent amount of strategy involved.\n\nI think my biggest complaint about the gameplay and combat is the dashing mechanic you get later in the game. You control it by double tapping in specific directions and there doesn't seem to be a way to map this function to a button. I discovered that I apparently double tap a lot when I'm moving around, so I found myself accidentally crashing into enemies as a result. If you mastered this movement though you could theoretically dodge most of the attacks enemies can throw at you, making the combat a lot deeper than I had the skill to play it. But, I was always able to find a way around the need to dodge thanks to the arsenal I mentioned. Every boss has a \"Trick\" to them similar to Zelda bosses (though less dependent on found items.) I found basically all of them - and the combat in general - pretty fun as a result  (complaints about the end-game enemy strategies aside.)\n\nWhat makes this game the most joy to play is how masterfully it uses the Metroidvania format.

games for the same reason.\n\nGuess that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like Axiom Verge.\n\nI decided to give the game a second chance and actually try to finish it after the hour or so that I played in the past (a couple of months, maybe a couple of years ago) at the start, everything started \u201cclicking\u201d so to say, everything became comfortable, and enjoyable for me to play, the movement, the combat, the upgrades, even the complex, yet comprehensive traversal through a massive \u201cmaze-like\u201d map.\n\nI even enjoyed the fact that the game instead of having checkpoints, had a series of save points formed by \u201ccapsules\u201d in which the protagonist could rest and refill it\u2019s health.\n\nThis however didn\u2019t last for more than a couple of hours until, maybe, halfway through the game things started becoming gradually more, and more tedious, and started being a bit more like what the early Super Metroid was like, and just like some of the \u201carchaic\u201d aspects of that game drew me far away from it, with Axiom Verge, they did the same.\n\nFor starters, the game becomes incredibly difficult as you keep playing along, at the start it\u2019s difficult, but fair, balanced so to say, playing at the easiest difficulty available (that being \u201cnormal\u201d) the game keeps changing simple core mechanics of some enemies, whilst from time to time, introducing new, and unique type of enemies as well.\n\nProblem is eventually the game creates new and more difficult enemies that attack the player in the form of swarms that rush him (or her).\n\nIn other cases the game simply doesn\u2019t offer nearly as frequent save points, making the constant \u201cact\u201d of dying a chore, a tedious activity that will keep making you repeat a certain given sequence plenty of times.\n\nThen after a while the game simply becomes too \u201ccryptic\u201d, I had to look at plenty of guides while other times I just had to explore as much as possible, finding myself getting collectibles and upgrades, that really didn\u2019t satisfy me in the least, given that I just wanted to keep progressing and discovering new areas.\n\nAt times some of them are hidden in sections that are incredibly further away from where you are, it goes beyond just finding the right path, at times it\u2019s simply tedious to get to a particular area only to have to backtrack to the next.\n\nWith that being said, I think the main reason as to why people enjoy the game so much it\u2019s specifically for the same reasons I dislike it, the game in itself it\u2019s not bad, considering it was made by such a small team, it\u2019s an incredible achievement.\n\nBut for me it was simply just such a jarring, frustrating, and tedious experience to play through, the more and more I progressed the more, and more it seemed to me as if the game was trying it\u2019s hardest to become more difficult, and complex, up to a point where I simply didn\u2019t have the will to continue playing it anymore, if I wasn\u2019t such an obsessive, neurotic, I probably wouldn\u2019t have finish it.\n\nSome of the elements of it are fine, some of them are excellent, the music is great, nothing to special, to me at the very least, either way, it\u2019s all relative.\n\nThe aesthetic it\u2019s incredibly unique, dare I say, even beautiful at time, although quite a bit bizarre.\nIt retains a massive amount of individuality nonetheless.\n\nIt\u2019s a game that wanted to clearly pay an homage, or even be a direct sequel to the way not only Super Metroid was at the time, but also to the way videogames were at the time.\n\nThere\u2019s secrets, upgrades, and heart put in here, I love it because of that, but sadly it also brings back a lot of the worse things, that I\u2019ve come to dislike over the years about gaming as a medium from that time.\n\nI guess if people have gotten this far into the \u201creview\u201d or the \u201ccritique\u201d or whatever the hell this is\u2026\n\nSome of them might be asking, \u201cWell what did you expect?\u201d\n\nAnd honestly, I think I expected a game that understood what was \u201cgood\u201d from gaming before, brought it back, and mixed it up with some of the elements that current games have, and if not, at the very least a game that brought back what was good, even if it was through the idealization of whatever it was, while at the same time, it detracted a lot of the more frustrating, and tedious elements from the games it was trying to emulate, and if not, be inspired by.\n\nIts a nice game, just not for everyone, a very niche type of game, I don\u2019t regret it\u2019s creation, I love the fact that other people enjoy it.\n\nIt\u2019s just certainly not the game for me.\n",

Similarly, Axiom Verge casts us in the role of an otherwise regular dude scientist guy, Trace, who is flung abruptly to a strange and unfamilliar world after an experiment goes awry.\n\nI personally liked the way that the overarching plot was revealed through a combination of exploratory discovery and linear narrative, in a rare triumph of  complex storytelling. Without spoiling any details, Trace is party to different components of the complete story than the player is at certain points during the game's run time. This makes the game feel like a journey that the player takes along with Trace, instead of just a story that happens as the player pilots him around, blasting weird monsters.\n\nThe run and gun game play is pretty good overall, with only a slight drawback in that getting used to some of the more unusual weapons can be a little confusing at first. Boss fights and normal enemies alike run by set, non-randomized behavior patterns, which means that with enough attempts it's possible to learn how to defeat any given room without being damaged.\n\nAxiom Verge really shines in its exploration elements. New sections of the map are unlocked organically with the acquisition of movement enhancing power ups. Few, if any, new abilities are functionally just a \"key\" which removes a specific obstacle to progress, rather granting some kind of new jumping or teleporting power which the player is then encouraged to scour the environment for places inaccessible before. It's an extremely satisfying and, incidentally, exciting format.\n\nThere are only two real shortcomings to Axiom Verge. Firstly, there are a few weapon powerups which are only available via semi-randomized sections of the map, which themselves are only accessed through randomized sections of glitched graphics. Searching for even one of them is exhausting and even a little tedious, so it's fortunate that it's exlusive to these very optional upgrades.\nThe other thing that deserves some mention is the game's ending. I'll spoiler this section, though it won't contain any really specific details.\n[spoiler] The game's ending very clearly sets up a much larger story than the narrative of the game actually tells. There are still a lot of questions which are unanswered by the end, even going to far as to suggest that Trace might even be an unreliable narrator, and the final cutscene is practically a \"to be continued!\" screen. Whether or not a sequel was planned, it left me feeling that the author was holding out details on a mystery that I could have otherwise solved, and it made the finale less satisfying as a result.\n[/spoiler]\n\nAxiom Verge was a lot of fun for me, in both gameplay and story, and I'd recommend it to anyone who isn't bothered by the retro-era graphics or bizarre visual design.

I remeber watching the first trailer to the game wanting to uncover the mysteries that it was advertiesd to having, and while said mysteries are answered during the game, several more questions arose for each one,  and the game leaves unsolved these unsolved, hopefully to be answered in a sequal that fixes some of the problems in the game mentioned earlier. \n\nIn conclusion, Axiom Verge leaves me wanting a continuation of the story and a more varied visual design but nails the exploration and rewards system in metroidvanias", "timestamp_created": 1507135154, "timestamp_updated": 1507135154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35475719": {"recommendationid": "35475719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022717686", "num_games_owned": 840, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507131031}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La verdad es que no se qu\u00e9 decir de este Axiom Verge.

I was drawn in and couldn't put it down until I beat it. The artwork is gorgeous and a lot of creativity went into the weapons. The story was interesting as well, a bit more thought out than you normally find in these types of games.\n\nI did have some discrepancies, however.\n\nMany of the guns, even some later into the game, feel very weak and they never really gives you a reason to use half of them. For a good portion of my play through I stuck to using the Kilver. Which I would describe as a shotgun but instead of buckshot it's a short electrical blast. You get it early on and even towards the end I still found myself using it more than anything else. The Voranj was pretty awesome too, like a fracturing lightening strike, making different paths every time you fire it. Of course along with the interesting weapons you had your boring standard arsenal as well. They don't get much playtime.\n\nThe environments tend to get a little drab after a while. They don't tend to switch it up all too much, and there is some unnecessary back traveling as well, which always plagues this genre.\n\nThe sounds/music are great. I'd compare the soundtrack to the quality of older Castlevania games. Ear worms that would get stuck in my head, repeating over and over as I laid down to go to sleep.\n\nIf you're a fan of simple, no bullshit sidescrollers, I'd give this one a try.

Tom Happ, qui s'imaginait au d\u00e9part sortir son jeu sur le march\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendant de la Xbox 360 pour arrondir ses fins de mois, a su avec un g\u00e9nie \u00e9tonnant conjuguer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments classiques que l'on appr\u00e9cie dans les Metroid avec une succession de petites r\u00e9volutions qui renouvellent brillamment le genre.\n\nAxiom Verge multiplie pourtant les signaux n\u00e9gatifs lors de sa premi\u00e8re heure de jeu: son hommage \u00e0 Metroid et \u00e0 Another World (dont le point de d\u00e9part narratif est copi\u00e9 tel quel) para\u00eet alors bien trop litt\u00e9ral, le premier tiers des boss est exp\u00e9di\u00e9 bien trop rapidement lors de combats corrects mais peu stimulants, l'encha\u00eenement de l'acquisition d'outils qui permettent de d\u00e9bloquer de nouvelles zones dans lesquelles on acquiert des outils qui permettent etc. semble trop scolaire et trop pr\u00e9visible... bref, le jeu peut au d\u00e9part donner l'impression d'un jeu amateur, agr\u00e9able mais trop court et trop asservi \u00e0 ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\n\nLe premier signe d'originalit\u00e9 de Axiom Verge provient de son univers: autant Metroid et Another World lorgnent du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la science-fiction [i]\"pulp\",[/i] autant Axiom Verge est plus sombre et glauque voire cauchemardesque, avec un bestiaire digne de La Plan\u00e8te Sauvage de Ren\u00e9 Laloux, une esth\u00e9tique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale inspir\u00e9e par le travail de H.R. Giger (ALIEN), et une histoire complexe qui concerne tr\u00e8s intimement le h\u00e9ros du jeu, Trace. Ce dernier n'est d'ailleurs pas un protagoniste muet: le jeu comporte des dialogues au d\u00e9part maladroits mais qui gagnent rapidement en subtilit\u00e9 et en profondeur et qui aident beaucoup \u00e0 se sentir concern\u00e9 par l'intrigue. Pour couronner le tout, les environnements travers\u00e9s ont chacun leur atmosph\u00e8re et leur logique propres, et l'on peut y d\u00e9nicher de nombreux [i]\"logs\"[/i] fragmentaires, r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par diff\u00e9rentes sources, qui permettent de reconstituer petit \u00e0 petit les \u00e9v\u00e9nements tragiques ayant conduit au ravage de la plan\u00e8te Sudra.\n\nLa seconde surprise de Axiom Verge concerne la gestion des armes: dans les jeux \u00e0 la Metroid, chaque nouvelle arme rend g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente obsol\u00e8te, et leurs caract\u00e9ristiques sont avant tout utilis\u00e9es pour d\u00e9verrouiller l'environnement. Ici, seules les trois premi\u00e8res armes servent \u00e0 progresser au tout d\u00e9but du jeu, et le reste de l'arsenal, une vingtaine d'armes en tout, sert uniquement \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre contre la faune locale: les armes varient beaucoup en d\u00e9bit, d\u00e9g\u00e2ts par impact, diffusion, port\u00e9e, capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 tirer \u00e0 travers les murs, vis\u00e9e manuelle ou automatique, etc. mais peu d'entre elles sont objectivement plus efficaces que les autres, chacune pouvant soudain devenir pertinente au gr\u00e9 des circonstances ou de son style de jeu. L'aspect \"survie\" de Axiom Verge n'est ni tr\u00e8s profond ni tr\u00e8s important, le jeu misant avant tout sur son immersion et son exploration, mais la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des armes pimente tr\u00e8s efficacement les combats, et extraire une nouvelle arme de sa cachette est \u00e9videmment bien plus excitant que d\u00e9nicher une \u00e9ni\u00e8me extension de missiles dans un Metroid.\n\nMais le plus gros atout de Axiom Verge, ce sont ses outils d'exploration et le [i]level design[/i] qui va avec. Un probl\u00e8me r\u00e9current des Metroid en 2D depuis Super Metroid est que leur progression est autant t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9e que leurs outils d'exploration sont rigides: il faut se baisser deux fois pour se transformer en une boule peu maniable avant de se faufiler dans les conduits d'un bloc de haut, le petit d\u00e9lai avant qu'une bombe n'explose est aga\u00e7ant et peu utile ludiquement parlant, on ne peut utiliser le rayon grappin que sur des accroches sp\u00e9cifiques, les blocs destructibles affichent artificiellement une petite \u00e9tiquette indiquant quel outil il faut utiliser pour en venir \u00e0 bout, etc.\nPour que cette \u00e9valuation ne soit pas trop longue et pour ne pas g\u00e2cher la surprise, je n'entrerai pas dans les d\u00e9tails, mais Axiom Verge fonctionne tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9remment: ses outils d'exploration sont tr\u00e8s originaux, s'utilisent de fa\u00e7on beaucoup plus souple et spontan\u00e9e, peuvent parfois se combiner entre eux, et surtout, leurs points d'application se fondent naturellement dans le d\u00e9cor. Il en r\u00e9sulte une exploration qui donne r\u00e9ellement au joueur l'impression de trouver les choses par lui-m\u00eame et non de relier des pointill\u00e9s, au point o\u00f9 l'on se demande parfois si ce que l'on fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu par le d\u00e9veloppeur. Cette sensation de transgression est grisante et met en valeur les autres points forts du jeu, notamment son [i]level design,[/i] tellement vari\u00e9 et stimulant qu'il nous pousse irr\u00e9sistiblement \u00e0 cartographier Sudra jusque dans ses moindres recoins (cartographier le jeu \u00e0 100% est par ailleurs tr\u00e8s intelligemment r\u00e9compens\u00e9 par un [i]achievement[/i]).\n\nEn plus de cela, le jeu rend hommage \u00e0 l'esth\u00e9tique et \u00e0 la logique des jeux 8-bit de fa\u00e7on cr\u00e9ative et surprenante... je suis tent\u00e9 d'en dire plus, mais Axiom Verge m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre d\u00e9couvert par soi-m\u00eame - et si vous voulez en savoir davantage, vous pouvez toujours cliquer sur le lien au d\u00e9but de cette \u00e9valuation pour lire ma critique compl\u00e8te.\n\nAxiom Verge est, tout simplement, une nouvelle r\u00e9f\u00e9rence du genre, un jeu \u00e0 ne pas rater, dont le niveau d'exigence n'a rien \u00e0 envier \u00e0 ses illustres mod\u00e8les.

I will say that this is a good game and very impressive coming from a one-man development team, but I think the general community consensus that this game is better than Super Metroid is a bit of a hyperbole.  I'm going to try out a simpler pro/con format as opposed to my previous reviews to help it be more readable.\n\nPros:\n- Fantastic retro art and music\n- Very unique and weird theme with a decent story\n- Large maps with lots of content and varied enemies\n- Will run at 120 fps unlike many 2D games\n- Several unique mechanics that mix up the experience compared to other Metroidvania games\n- Save points that actually save your progress when you die rather than losing all progress since you visited the save point.\n\nMixed:\n- A huge number of weapons.  There are no damage types of special effects, so they only differ by projectile behavior and whether you can hold down the attack button (not very many.)  Too many end up being very similar and the weapon wheel is clumsy to use with so many options.\n- Many secrets are 100% hidden with no way to find them unless you attempt to do exactly what you need to do to get to them.  Some people may like this, but I think lacking a block type indicator like Super Metroid has it doesn't serve the game well.\n\nCons:\n- The controls for the two movement abilities are just plain atrocious.  It's probably less of an issue playing with keyboard but I used a gamepad.\n- Weak boss fights.  Most of the bosses end up being mind-numbingly simple to beat and don't have any interesting mechanics.  One ends up being rather frustrating instead.\n- Combat design could use some work.  Enemies generally either are easy to kill, cause essentially unavoidable damage to you, or are best cheesed (try to get them stuck so they can't hit you.)  The limited firing speed on weapons doesn't feel very good, and combined with the excessive HP of many enemies, it makes combat tedious.\n- Zero indicators for where to go to progress in the story.  I think this is an especially large problem due to how large the maps are.  The game doesn't need to tell you exactly where to go but even Super Metroid shows you where to find the next boss so you have a general idea of which direction to head.\n\nSo to sum up: It's a good game, but not without significant flaws.

Been a fan since Super Metroid and since, but what [i]is[/i] a \"Metroidvania\"? Simple: it's a game that you go and explore an open world with a limited set of items that overtime you find more items that open up more of the world, it's a bit hard to explain, but the genre was created from the original Metroid...\n\n\"Wait, this is Axiom Verge! How does that relate?\" You may ask, ah but it's the [i]gameplay[/i] that is similar (although not entirely!). Let's get on with this review!\n\n[h1]REVIEW START![/h1]\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nLitterally, it's amazing, the controls are responsive, you only need a keyboard, not a pesky mouse to aim. Although it can get a pain to do some menauvers (Like having to press like 4 buttons at once with a keyboard that only registers 3 inputs), but after a bit you can get through. It's like many other metroidvanias, but it has some extra \"bonus\" gear that's entirely optional for you to collect. With the idea of a 'NES-Like' game in mind, you see glitches, like [i]actual intentional[/i] glitches in the game! They appear as corrupted blocks, but after a while, you get an upgrade that allows you to [i]corrupt the enemies![/i] Each enemy in the game has a unique \"corrupted\" form, with even a special appearance to MissingNo. (Also, use your 6th weapon when he's on Screen too, you wont regret it!) Some corrupted enemies will actually heal you, or become a different enemy al together, or for some of those \"Late Game\" ones, allow them to move with your movements. It's pretty impressive\n\nEDIT:\nI forgot to mention, but the game, especially when trying to 100% it or anything, will take you a while to complete on your first try, the first time took me [i]11[/i] hours! And that's with a guide after the last half of the game!\n\nEven the 'Speedrun' trohpy will take a while, you have to complete the game under 4 hours! Compared to other metroidvanias, that doesn't sound too bad, but trust me. [i]That's a long time with this game[/i]\n\n8.75/10\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nI was quite enjoying the story, it was one of those kind of stories that wont be all \"in your face\" impeding the gameplay, it's quite well done to be honest.\n(Super Duper Short Summation)\nThe story is that you take the role of a Scientist, whom was doing research in his when an explosion has occured and sent to this mysterious world. You have to go and help some mechanical robot from dying from a man named 'Athesos' (Might have spelled that wrong...) Whom is the antagonist of the game. You go through trying to figure out who he is, why you're there and what other fishy things have been going on.\n\n(The secret ending was alright tho but I wont say anything 'bout it)\n\n9/10\n\n[b]Appearance[/b]\n\nDO I have to say it? [i]They're so good[/i], the graphics, the sound design, the [i]music[/i], it's all amazing. The tunes really throw back to the classic era, with little to no \"modern\" intruments in sounds, most of the sounds are chiptune based sounds, and with the \"Secret Worlds\" mechanic, throwing back to Metroids \"Secret\" worlds, the glitchy stuff of blocks and enemies really do there job at being glitchy. Like the palletes of enemies will corrupt, or the graphics of one enemy is jumbled while the behavior switches to that of another, it's really convincing glitch behavior! The Spritework is amazing, the amount of detail in the sprites on the bosses are just awe inspiring beatiful.\n\n9.75/10\n\n[h1]Let's Review...the Review?[/h1]\n\nOkay, let's hope I did this table thing correctly....\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]Category[/th]\n[th]Rank[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Gameplay[/td]\n[td]8.75[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Story[/td]\n[td]9[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Appearance[/td]\n[td]9.75[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]TOTAL[/td]\n[td]9.16/10[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\nGreat Game I Recommend it with a L9M2 rating of 9.1/10!

Categories typically get a base score, followed by pros and cons.\n\n\nGraphics: 8/10\n==========\nStylish NES style pixel-ish graphics that come together pretty darn well for the desired presentation (which I would assume to be a classic Metroid game). They work. +8\n\n\nSound/Music: 8/10\n=============\nAgain, classic NES style sounds and music, similar to older Metroid games. Also works, but nothing memorable. +9\n\nWhoever thinks it's a good idea to add a beeping sound when your health gets low needs to be fired. Don't do that, ever. It's irritating and distracting. Zelda games suffer from this and it still baffles me why it makes it past the creative/testing department of any game. -1\n\n\nStory: 6/10\n========\nStory on the whole is weak, but I don't think this game really needs to have a good story to be a good game. +6 for effort\n\n\nGameplay: 7/10\n===========\nGameplay for the most part is fantastic. You jump around and dodge things, find new hidden optional weapons and upgrades for your health/range/damage, and collect new abilities along the course of the 8+ hour adventure. +9\n\nBoss fights are great fun and require actual skill to beat (with the exception of one certain boss). +1\n\nThe \"dash through walls\" mechanic (double tapping desired direction) is frustrating as hell. You will accidentally be using it constantly throughout the entire second half of the game, running into enemies that will hurt you and kill you due to only being quick with your fingers. You cannot remap it. Another mechanic that should've been tested and fixed. It would've been better to hold say, L1/LB and press the desired direction to dash. This is as annoying as double tapping Up to jump in Minecraft (except that CAN be remapped). -2\n\nSome useless weapons. -1\n\n\nOverall: 7.2/10 (29/40 = 0.72)\n=====================\nIt's good with some annoying quirks that unfortunately drag it down far more than they should. Honestly, if they only fixed the dash mechanic, that alone would've made my entire experience exceptional. It's unfortunate that I was having so much fun at the start of the game, only for that mechanic to be introduced and almost ruining my entire experience. Other players who like to move around quickly (requiring quick button presses) will understand what I mean.\n\nThat aside, it's still a fun metroidvania game that requires anyone who likes the older metroids (or games like Rogue Legacy) to give it a try.

The best part is its story. It hints at one of the most chilling, interesting stories I've ever seen. But just hints -- it's so noncommital that it's not very satisfying. Vagueness or contradiction would be fine, but the sparse details read like the creator is unsure of the story he is telling. They don't read like interesting tidbits from unreliable narrators.\n\nEarly on it differentiates itself from Super Metroid, the biggest inspiration for this game. The start is promising but by the end, gameplay-wise especially, it's more like a(n extremely well made) Metroid ROM hack than a unique game. The gameplay differences matter less as the game continues.\n\nAnd it makes errors that Super Metroid never did. Travelling the world is slow, even with the best upgrades. It doesn't make me want to explore because going from place to place is too time-consuming. In Super Metroid, towards the end you can speed through old areas and shred any enemy in your way. Axiom Verge never gives that catharsis. Making exploring even slower, too many of the items are hidden behind arbitrary walls.

I could not refund the game.  Boy, was I lucky.\nI decided, since I spent $10 on it, I might as well try it, some of the bosses looked cool.\nFrom that moment on, I rarely had a dull moment playing this game.

Axiom Verge[/h1]\n\nMade by Thomas Happ Games, which is just one guy called \u2026 Thomas Happ. It\u2019s sort of a love letter to old school NES platformers like Contra, Blaster Master and such. But beyond any doubt, it has the biggest boner for Metroid. Explore the world to find upgrades, then use those to find more upgrades. All that good metroidvania stuff. You\u2019re Trace, a scientist dude who blows up his lab in an experiment and ends up in Sudra, a barren world devastated by some unknown calamity. I\u2019ll leave it there, cuz spoilers suck. But first, let's list off the good and the bad.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Progression is pretty satisfying with some novel upgrades, like a remote controlled drone and one that let\u2019s you \u2018glitch\u2019 through stuff. Weakens a little in the late game. More in the negatives.\n[*]Controls are precise and responsive. The standard control layout is pretty smartly mapped. Weapon switching is easy through a radial/line menu. Drops off a bit in the late game. More in the negatives.\n[*]Good bosses, mostly. Not too damage spongy and decently challenging,testing pattern recognition skills and found abilities. Some subvert expectations. You\u2019ll remember these. Sudden leap in difficulty about 2/3rds through. Bosses beyond this are just decent in design.\n[*]Great soundtrack! A mix of dark ambient chiptune and melancholy instruments over deep, thumpy basses. Sure, not all tracks are winners, but still, do yourself a favor. Turn it up.\n[*]Nice 8-bit pixel art inspired by Metroid. Sometimes verges on 16-bit & some effects wouldn\u2019t be possible on NES. So, 12-bit? Dark biomechanical aesthetic that reminds of H.R. Giger, more so than Metroid did actually. Also, it can run on a potato.\n[*]Remember those weird graphical glitches in old 8-bit games? Those are a mechanic. An upgrade lets you \u2018glitch\u2019 enemies or bits of level into something less dangerous, harmless or helpful. Shame it doesn't use it more.[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Controls and progression get weaker later on. Late-game abilities and their controls are hard to use in combination with others and this becomes a requirement for progress, making reaching some areas potentially frustrating. No dealbreaker, but worth mentioning.\n[*]It can be a \u201cWhere do I go?\u201d and \u201cGuide Dang It\u201d game. It might be too old school in this respect. You get an objective, but no real idea of where to go. Some items are hidden really, really well. Even Super Metroid told which general direction to go and had the X-Ray Visor to help find stuff. Axiom Verge doesn\u2019t do anything (that actually helps). \n[*]Protagonist Trace is a bore. At first he\u2019s promising. Curious, yet skeptical. Like a scientist should be. That goes away. Later on he turns into a rather generic hero who quietly does what he\u2019s told to. Shame, missed opportunity.\n[*]The story is pretty meh. At first, it\u2019s mysterious and atmospheric. Some plot points hint at something greater going on, but it doesn\u2019t do anything with those, instead playing it pretty straight. Another lost chance.[/list]\n\nAxiom Verge leaves me a little conflicted. It has a lot of strong beginnings and does many things right throughout, but in a few respects, it sort of tapers off. Maybe the developer ran out of ideas or rushed things, but the last third or so doesn\u2019t feel as tightly put together anymore. It\u2019s still plenty good, just no longer great. If you\u2019re looking for a solid metroidvania, Axiom Verge is well worth your time, even if you're not big on the genre and despite some nitpicks. I\u2019d give it a 5 banana rating, but I know it falls just a smidgen short of that. More a 4,5, but I don\u2019t round up nor give half-bananas, so ...\n\n[b]I rate Axiom Verge 4 out of 5 bananas.[/b]\n\nWhat my ratings mean:\n1 bananas - Crap. Turn around & don\u2019t look back.\n2 bananas - Bad. Not really worth it.\n3 bananas - Average. For fans of the genre or a sale.\n4 bananas - Good. Won't waste your time.\n5 bananas - Superb.

My first games were the Metroid Prime games. So I guess I\u2019m not as nostalgic for this genre?\n\n    [*]So the story and setting are very unique here, kind of feeling like you\u2019re in a computer world with the glitch gun, but also very surreal with weird aliens and a cryptic story that has to do with a virus, clones, and hallucinogens. It\u2019s a great mystery and I was pleased with where it went. \n\n    [*]The exploration in a game like this is key to the success, are their good enough upgrades that up you\u2019re power level and mobility. There are a lot of secrets in this game, some are story notes that add more insight into explaining what is going on. There are health and weapon power upgrades. A lot of these are optional with the weapons coming up next.\n\n    [*]So the weapons are a mixed bag, you have so much variety in terms of different effects, I think there are about 20 weapons in total with almost all of them being optional weapons. This rewards you when you find them; it\u2019s cool to try them out. But a lot of them are worthless. They are all pretty much do the same damage except the close ranged weapons. This brings the total number to less than 5 that I found useful.  ) Axiom Disruptor replaced by Inertial Pulse, Voranj, Kilver then replaced by Flamethrower, and Lightning Gun  \n\n    [*]A lot of the weapons are just reskinned and better versions of others. I would have rather seen 6 good weapons with the newer weapons just adding their abilities to arsenal or flatout replacing them. I do want to say the design of the weapons and variety is good and want to thank the dev for making them even if it turned out not as I know he hoped them to be.\n\n    [*]The combat is also not as good as it could have been, All but the flying enemies were a joke with some bosses even offering no challenge. I don\u2019t know why this is, maybe I\u2019m better at games than I think or demand more complexity, but the difficulty of AI attack patterns with bosses and minions alike was overall weak here. (The final boss, I just tanked and killed him without moving. How is that possible?!?!?)\n\n    [*]Overall the game won\u2019t be a classic overtime as the game\u2019s difficulty is too low and lack of a strong core of weapons. Regardless the game will still be fun for anyone that likes Metroidvania style games with a strong mystical story, eerie soundtrack, and exploration rewards a plenty.\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $10[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 12 hours [/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Apotheon\n    [*]Guacamelee\n    [*]Cave Story+\n    [*]Outland\n    [*]Alwa's Awakening\n[/list]\t\n\nHere are the weapons list I would have done to limit the choices and make the weapons more meaningful: (Reduced from 20 to 6)\n[list]\n\n    [*] Axiom Disruptor with upgrades of Inertial Pulse, Hypo-Atomizer, or Multi-Disruptor or all\n    [*]Nova with upgrades of Data Bomb, Orbital Discharge, or Reflector\n    [*]Voranj \n    [*]Tethered Charge\n    [*]Ion Beam with upgrades of Lightning Gun\n    [*]Flamethrower\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1502590965, "timestamp_updated": 1502591039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34195432": {"recommendationid": "34195432", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998473883", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507750560}, "language": "german", "review": "Axiom Verge \u00fcberrascht mit einfallsreichen unterschiedlichen Waffen und Upgrades, einer tollen direkten Steuerung, einer fantastischen futuristischen Storyline und dabei v\u00f6lliger Bewegungsfreiheit von Raum zu Raum.

The pixel graphics were only decent in my opinion but they fit in very well into the whole theme/atmosphere of the game. The same can be said about the music, which was nice, but not very catchy. The game has a good length for a Metroidvania and a good mapsize. Because the game doesn't give you any hints where to go next, if you don't perfectly memorise the obstacles you passed so far, you will probably spend a while with backtracking. \nThe definitely best part of the game were the abilities. The game features very unique weapons and exploration tools, although most of the weapons are optional and didn't seem especially useful to me either... At best, they made a boss or a few enemies easier, at worst they were just a more complicated way to fight enemies, since the main weapon is still decently powerful. Still, they brought an interesting spin to the standard ranged weapons seen in Metroidvanias. And the exploration tools really made up most of the charm of the game for me.\nThe story was ok. It didn't really captivate me, but it made for a few interesting moments.\nOverall, it's a game I would really recommend to every Metroidvania-fan for it's unique ideas on the tools.

A differenza dei moderni Metroidvania, nessuno vi tiene la mano, non c'\u00e8 nessun nav-point per le location utili alla missione, niente indicazioni che facilitino la vita a chi punta al 100% dei segreti (nemmeno un indicatore percentuale), se non qualche misteriosa \"lucina\" in un angolo della mappa (non voglio dire troppo)... e sicuramente non vi verr\u00e0 detto come usare certi ammennicoli che troverete strada facendo.\nL'azione si riassume in un continuo avanti e indietro per zone gi\u00e0 visitate non appena si trova un nuovo potere, esattamente come accadeva negli anni '90. La cosa potrebbe divertire i fan pi\u00f9 sfegatati o coloro che sono abituati al genere, ma snervare chi invece cerca qualcosa di pi\u00f9 \"leggero\" e arcade, o pi\u00f9 in generale al passo coi tempi.\nContinuando coi diifetti, non posso non citare il controllo: per certe mosse avrei evitato l'uso di vecchi sistemi, soprattutto il doppio tap per il teletrasporto. Oggigiorno gli stick analogici non permettono una rapida reazione per questo genere di movimento e la loro eccessiva precisione non gioca a nostro favore. Usando il pad del 360 mi sono dovuto appoggiare alla croce direzionale per andare esattamente nella direzione che volevo e non 10 gradi pi\u00f9 in su o pi\u00f9 in gi\u00f9, come capitava invece con l'analogico. Oltretutto la limitata possibilit\u00e0 di riconfigurare i controlli non migliora certamente le cose... Ma si tratta di farci l'abitudine, alla fine.\nPersonalmente ho trovato AV un'apprezzabile sfida e un bel tuffo nel passato, ma vi do un consiglio: non sottovalutate l'importanza dell'[b]Address Disruptor[/b] per cambiare la \"natura\" dei nemici, e il [b]Passcode Tool[/b] con i relativi codici da trovare! Avrete alcuni indizi nei diari sparsi in giro e la loro scoperta \u00e8 una sorta di sottogioco che aprir\u00e0 passaggi e stanze segrete contenenti nuove armi (ce ne sono una ventina in totale!), bonus vita, ecc. Tutte cose che vi faranno comodo contro i numerosi Boss.\n\n[i]PS:[/i] Per i super nerd, provate a inserire il codice JUSTIN-BAILEY, l'originale cheat di Metroid per NES che permetteva di giocare con Samus Aran in costume da bagno... ;-D", "timestamp_created": 1500163579, "timestamp_updated": 1500214820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505440", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33562767": {"recommendationid": "33562767", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981328872", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500133943}, "language": "english", "review": "Great gameplay, many different weapons, original items and lots of secrets!

While having completely different characters, storyline and mechanics than my beloved franchise, this game managed to seduce me almost immediately and reminded me pleasantly about good old days long gone.\n\nAs with all of my reviews, these are my own opinions and experiences; please check out other reviews too!\n\n[h1][Negatives][/h1]\nThe eight-directional shooting system lets you shoot down and diagonally downwards only after you jumped, are in the state of falling down, or hold a button to lock your movement and shoot in any desired direction. While this might be alright for most of the game, there are some bosses and situations made harder because of this limitation.\n\nThere is only one boss battle theme, played across all of the game\u2019s bosses, making them much less epic than they could\u2019ve been. I\u2019m not asking for one for each boss but a couple of them would\u2019ve been nice to spice things up.\n\n[h1][Gameplay][/h1]\nDiscover 23 different obtainable weapons, each with their own firing arc, range, and damage values. You can also find permanent passive power ups (increased weapon damage, bullet range, health, etc) and there are 16 different upgrades where each one will change the gameplay in some way or another which keeps things fresh pretty much through the whole game. Access previously unreachable places or use them to advance in the story. Two things I want to highlight are the ability to hack enemies to render them harmless or make them vulnerable to your attacks, and an interesting way of glitching through certain walls which opens a lot of opportunities for secrets and hidden paths.\n\nSeveral save points spread across the the map let you save your progress, regenerate health and ammo, while setting a point to revive in the case of death. Dying in this game will not reset your progress but instead respawn all enemies and breakable objects.\n\nAxiom throws over 60 different enemy types at you and new ones will often surprise you with fresh attack patterns and steadily increasing damage. It also kindly invites you to 10 different boss battles that will keep you on your toes, a good mix stationary and mobile designs, and a few of them are quite harsh but still doable.\n\nFinally I\u2019ll mention how well the game utilizes the controller, with each and every button having it\u2019s own purpose for a good variety of gameplay mechanics.\n\n[h1][Graphics/Art][/h1]\nA 2D art style that could be ripped right out of Super Metroid just with a higher resolution. While beautiful to look at, a creepy and mysterious atmosphere is stretched throughout thanks to the eerie backgrounds.\n\n[h1][Music][/h1]\nJust like the graphics, the chiptune soundtrack offers mysterious but energetic vibes that approach frightening at times. Some tracks even feel like they\u2019d fit in a new Metroid game, and the whole thing just fits the game so well, it's unbelieveable.\n\n[url=https://axiomverge.bandcamp.com/releases]Checkout the composer's website for a preview![/url] \n\n[h1][Story][/h1]\nDefinitely the weak point. Not by being lame or cheesy, but just because of how it\u2019s presented. It starts out with a very mysterious premise but loses it\u2019s focus near the middle and tries to grab it back at the end. It barely works but it\u2019s sufficient enough to give the game a passable ending.\n\n[h1][Conclusion][/h1]\nClearly inspired by the Metroid franchise, Axiom Verge is a metroidvania through and through, where one slowly explores a large and mysterious world while finding abilities, weapons and tools that let you access previously unreachable places with each new item.\n\nI recommend this game to fans of the 2D metroid and metroidvania genres. I also highly recommend checking it out if you are drawn in by what you see on the store page.\n\n[code]\nEnjoyed this review?

Seriously, it\u2019s simply beautiful. When exploring the game for the first time or playing a casual run, you can - aside from very few exceptions - swiftly navigate the levels while also safely dispose of your enemies without taking damage, by utilizing proper player placement and shooting angles. At the same time, it lends itself very well for speedrunning, making it possible to blast through levels without stopping, by combining deliberate damage, precise evasive jumps and well-placed shots.\n\nUnfortunately, like so many other great games, the developer doesn\u2019t seem to be willing to listen to the community to turn a really good game into an outstanding one. Here are some of the shortcomings that I wish would be addressed:\n\n[list]\n[*]Boss patterns could be better. They don't necessarily have to become harder or more diverse, but the bosses shouldn't be as static as they are. Being able to circumvent the patterns, by killing bosses from behind while they keep shooting in the other direction, destoys the challenge and makes speedruns less exciting.\n\n[*]Weapon selection is horrible. I don\u2019t actually mind the amount of weapons there are in the game, because it gives the casual players freedom to choose whatever they can handle best. However, selecting weapons from a weapon ring by mapping the positions in the circle to the analog stick angle is just bad. On top of that, the positions change every time you gain a new weapon, which makes for a very inconsistent and sloppy weapon selection, especially when speedrunning. Additionally, speedrunners using a controller have no practical way to switch weapons on the fly without having to confirm the popup or losing time by assigning certain weapons to the two quick select slots (which is too few anyway). I\u2019d like to see an option to assign specific weapons to controller inputs.\n\n[*]Grapple mechanic is clunky. A more refined mechanic would make it less useless and open up alternate speedrunning routes, especially in 100% runs.\n\n[*]Double tapping is annoying. Messing up a personal best because the game decided to register a double tap, while you are in the process of slightly adjusting your jump path, is aggrevating. A modifier key would\u2019ve made more sense, in my opinion.\n\n[*]Respawn animation is way too long. It should be the same animation that is used for saving. The whole panning down the room and the player crouching before slowly standing up sequence is okay for when you start a new game, but not on every death.\n\n[*]Dialog is terrible. I don\u2019t care much for the story in games, but when a game opts to unfold the story during gameplay via cutscenes or dialog boxes, I expect it to at least not be annoying. The developer did an outstanding job overall, but he should've left the writing to someone else. Half way though the game I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore and started skipping all the dialog.\n\n[*]Speedrun mode should have a menu option to respawn at the last checkpoint without having to go to the title menu. Hell, even a two second press on the menu button with an additional confirmation box would be better. Also, the \u201cgame saved\u201d dialog box needs to be removed from this mode.\n\n[*]It would be nice to have a speedrun training mode with features that make it easier to practice certain areas and with ghost support, to be able to compare different routes without having to use third party tools.\n[/list]\n\nAnyway, this is one of the very few true metroidvania games, paying homage to its roots without feeling like a clone.

I thought Super Metroid on the other hand was a masterpiece.\n\nSo I'll just start by saying that if you liked those games, you should pick this game up if it caught your attention. This whole game is heavily influenced by Metroid, from art to gameplay, but that's not to say it's a direct copy.\n\nGameplay: Tight, responsive controls with the exception of the hookshot -- the hookshot/grappling hook was pretty awkward in Super Metroid, but here it's significantly worse (a good 2D grapple hook example for me would be the Worms rope)... you'll make due though, it's not a major part of the game. There are a ton of guns to find (none of them really required to beat any particular part of the game like the ice-mod was in metroid), ton of secret areas, etc... you'll have a lot to explore, and the map is quite large with your typical backtracking to pick up upgrades. I like to think I'm pretty thorough, and often find all the collectibles, but this game had a lot of well-hidden things, I ended with 77% items. The enemies are quick and vicious, and you can find yourself killed quickly if you're not careful (so the challenge is pretty adequate... I played it on \"Normal\") -- as compared to Super Metroid where I'm never close to dying. You never get to turn into \"God mode\" by the end of the game, like many of these kinds of games are (Super Metroid, Castlevania SotN), but you will definitely notice yourself getting stronger as you find more upgrades.\n\nBoss fights: There are plenty of bosses, and I guess they're all \"OK\". None were super memorable, and many could be \"cheesed\" if you found the strategy which I could figure out usually before losing more than half my HP.\n\nArt: It's a mix of Metriod/H Giger (designer of Alien, etc)/\"I have no mouth, and I must scream\" (an old pc title). The art does a lot to tell the story, making you use your imagination (seeing various areas that could have been an ancient civilization infected by a strange fungus, etc). The bosses also are vile mutations of things resembling human body parts (kind of like Binding of Isaac). And the \"Rusalka\", those creepy porcelaine doll masks/Starcraft adjutants that talk to you throughout the game... I don't want to spoil anything, but I'll say I appreciated their design.\n\nMusic/Sound: Mostly good, with some great tracks. One piece was interesting in particular: influenced from eastern themes (Indian). Most other pieces were heavy bass and did well to set the atmosphere. The monsters/gun sounds were also done well (not just a simple \"blip\" like metroid did).\n\nStory: Surprisingly more going on than I expected. Like Metroid, a lot of it is up to your imagination, but if you care to explore, you'll find notes, and ways to translate the 2 alien languages.\nWithout spoiling anything, you start off as a scientist who gets knocked out by an explosion in his lab. You then wake up in some strange planet... do you have amnesia? are you cloned? where are you? why? (that kind of thing)\nThere is a lot that won't be told to you directly, and the ending ends somewhat cliffhanger-y. You'll need to beat it on HARD for the true ending, but even then there's a nice twist (if you like that kind of stuff).\n\n\nOverall: A good game. Smooth gameplay, good music, good length. Plenty to explore if you like that. For an indy game, this is definitely above-par. If I had to rate it, it is better than Metroid (NES), but not quite as great as Super Metriod (a tough game to beat). I'd definitely be interested in a sequel, perhaps one that explored the world of Sutra and the giant Rusalka there that remain.", "timestamp_created": 1498985383, "timestamp_updated": 1498985383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518851", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33112041": {"recommendationid": "33112041", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979550031", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503114152}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing game, and very faithful to the style of Metroid down to the smallest details.

Damn. Good.\n\nIf you liked Super Metroid you'll definitely like this game. It has great atmosphere, fun weapons and tools, and just an overall great game.\n\nWhen you finally get all of the tools and movement techniques it feels like there's so much more that you can do and starts to feel very fluid. I wouldn't be doing my dilligence if I didn't address the negatives.\n\nThe plot is kind of wonky. I don't want to spoil it, but there is a really cool twist in the plot followed by a really cliched one. It askes a lot of metaphysical questions that I frankly don't care for.  There are extra notes you can find throughout your play-through but I found the notes did very little to add to the world and instead made feel that \"What is life?\" smugness that I hate in pretty much every game, even the good ones.\n\nThe other problem I had was that normal was a bit too easy after you get the first couple of health extensions. The bosses didn't really test my reflexes and seemed to be designed around finding a place to exploit cover and just firing from there. I'll try the Hard mode and see if the enemies just hit harder or if the patterns are different.\n\nRegardless, of those two nit-picks the game is just fantastic. I want people to understand that this is only a slightly negative aspect and doesn't distract from the overall enjoyment of it. I marathoned the game to completion, which took about 7 hours and all I could think of was wanting to play more.\n\nJust an excellent, excellent game and a MUST play for fans of Metroidvania.", "timestamp_created": 1498793274, "timestamp_updated": 1498793274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525741", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33006613": {"recommendationid": "33006613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068278980", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498383499}, "language": "english", "review": "The New Metroid for me.

It is definitely a Metroidlike, not a Metroidvania. It has great music, art direction, world building, inventive exploration, etc. If you want a Metroid style game, buy this game without questioning your decision. If you want to hear my complaints, read on...\n\n\n My complaints are:\n\n\nThe drill and drone abilities make an overall swiftly paced game feel clunky. Even Samus's bombs and morphball abilities felt less clunky. Often I notice myself forgetting to drill all the walls because I just don't like doing it. Also, these newer Metroid style games, even Metroid itself, have far too many powerups. This makes the discovery aspect feel incredibly shallow. If you're running into pickups constantly the sense of discovery is dulled. In Metroid, sometimes you find a powerup and it's just an ammo upgrade or an ability you already have. But when the new ability is discovered it always feels like an earned achievement.\n\nAlso,  in the post-Metroid-Prime-and-Ocarina-of-Time-Nintendo-age (whew, too many hyphens), every one of these games seem to have \"pieces of powerups\" or \"mini upgrades\" that are scattered everywhere. These make me miss the good ol' \"You found 100 points of Energy!\" moments. I hate having to find bits of powerups to actually feel like you made some meaningful improvement to your character. It makes these games feel more RPG and Metroid is meant to feel. (I don't remember if Axiom has pieces of powerups per se, but it definitely has beam expansions that only feel significant after you collect a few of them).\n\nAnother issue is that there are far too many weapons. A few are useful, but most aren't. And when you have a huge pile of weapons, you tend to pick the strongest and skip over the rest. So this makes discovering a new weapon feel kind of meh rather than \"yes! I got a new one!\" I like my weapons to give me a definite feeling of empowerment rather than feeling like I found something utterly useless. Most weapons look cool, though, so if you like fiddling with gear then you won't see this as an issue.\n\nAlso, being the world is SO massive in AV, it feels quite tedious to find every item. Especially since drilling walls as I mentioned before is really clunky. And deploying the drone is time consuming.\n\nMy last complaint is the game's story. The more story, imo, the less immersive a Metroidlike feels. Walking into nearly every boss room and having a short dialogue with the boss is really cheesy. And there is only one boss battle song, which is also the only song in the game I didn't like. This makes the boss battles seem less intense than they should. I remember being stressed and creeped out by the bosses in Metroid. And in this game the bosses look cool enough, but the music kind of kills the mood a bit.\n\n\nDespite all of these complaints, I'd give Axiom no less than an 8/10.  It's a great game, but could be so much better.\n\nAnother great looking game that pays homage to Metroid is Nakawak.

If you loved the old school 2d Metroid games, then I would highly reccomend picking this game up. It really captures the \"MetroidVania\" feel very well. However, rather than being a carbon copy of the game it is obviously inspired by, it brings many new and interesting mechnics to the table, such as the modular weapons system and the gun you can use to \"glitch\" enemies, reduccing them to what look like corrupted SNES sprites. The bosses are fun and the game itself is reasonably challanging. There is a huge focus on exploration, with many power-ups and lore notes to collect. The game has a lonley, desolate and surreal atmosphere that is very well protrayed by the art, music, and story. It feels like you are having some weird, halluconigenic fueled fever dream and it's actually really awesome. The art style is extremley reminicent of the origonal Metroid for the NES, with it's reds, purples, blues, and blacks in the environment detail and it's strange alien life. However, it adds a certain trippy, surreal touch to it that make it very interesting. The music is very strange yet extremley fitting, and spritework is gorgeous. The story, although a little hard to follow at times, is very unique and well done, and the characters, although few, are very memorable. \n\nPROS:\n-fun, interesting gameplay\n-absoultley beautiful spritework, especially in the backgrounds and the Russalka\n-unique soundtrack that really captures the feel of the game world\n-challanging\n-lots of secret areas\n-cool and unique gameplay mechanics\n-haunting, lonley, and surreal atmosphere. It's like a bad trip.\n-unique and interesting sci-fi story\n-LORE NOTES :O\n\n\nCONS:\n-The \"glitch\" themed secret areas (forget exactly what they are called) are very unnoticable and difficult to find. Maybe there was a mechanic I was missing for locating them or something?\n-same music for every boss barring the final one (very minor nitpick)\n-a few of the enimies in particular (yes I'm talking about the guys that spew gas out of their backs) are very annoying\n-story is hard to follow at times\n-sometimes I felt like I was lost and could not figure out where to go, especially later in the game.\n\nI, personally would give this game an 8.75/10. It was tremendous fun to play, and really gave me that old school metroid nostalgia. My only nitpicks are what I listed in the cons and that it at times feels too much like Super Metroid. While these flaws are pretty minor, they are just enough to keep me from giving it a 9/10, despite my love for the game and it's fantastic artwork and music. I was actually tempted to tack another point on the rating I gave it just because it was made by one person alone, which really shows his skill and dedication as a game developer.

Let's up some downs.\n\nUPs:\n+ The Atmosphere is just as hopeless and isolated (at first) as known from other Metroidvania titles.\n+++ It brings a lot of innovative gameplay ideas to the table (like the Remote Drone Teleport or corrupting/glitching enemies and walls)\n+ The soundtrack doesn't always fit to the atmosphere, but it kinda fits to the native Sudran culture in my book, at least in my imagination and judgdment of the Sudrans using the text logs found in game\n+ It has a fine story to go after, which actually suprised me, as the 2D Metroid games (except for maybe Metroid Fusion) did not offer that much of a background story to support the characters motives)\n+ I just can't help giving the Drone Teleport and the Scissor Beam their own up.\n\nDOWNS:\n-- The Bosses can be hard, but they are way too easy if you know the trick to them. Even the hardest boss in the game (a giant wasp) can be killed in a mere ten seconds. The final boss is an absolute joke if you go for 100% (or at least get the Flamethrower and a bit of extra health).\n- There are a lot of Health and Power Node fragments. I just prefer well hidden full nodes over having to collect 5 or 6 well hidden fragments. It makes them absolutely useless when not collecting a full set.\n- There is absolutely no reward for 100%ing the game (items and map) except for a short bonus sequence after the credits. That's one thing I hated since I got into the genre. Just don't do it, it's not worth it, and turns the final boss into a joke. \n\nOTHER COMMENTS:\nThere are three weapons in the game that can only be obtained in hard difficulty secret worlds. However, there is only one of them in each playthrough (as they are generated randomly as you start a new game). I would've liked some sort of New Game+ feature in which you keep that one weapon you got on your last playthrough. That way players could've obtained all three of those secret weapons after three playthroughs and give this game even more replayability. Just a thought.\n\nFinal Score: + 7:4 -\nFinal comment: Axiom Verge is absolutely worth the money, even for people that don't have any experience with the Metroidvania genre. I once heard someone saying it's a prime example of a good Metroidvania game.

This is some of the best spritework I've seen in a long time. The music is reminiscent of the Metroid franchise, and while a few tracks stand out, the rest just blend together in their mediocrity, with a few being downright annoying. Sound design is fun and adequate enough and helps to set the otherworldly mood well.\n\nThe first half of this game is absolutely wonderful. As you start to explore the map and find more items, you will slowly learn to maneuver your character around obstacles and make use of your new tools to get around. It's exactly what you want a Metroidvania to be.\n\nBut then about 3/5 of the way into the game, you start to hit the wall, and this is where the game fails to live up to the legacy it's desperately trying to capture. There is NO way to know which of the dozens of passageways you've visited in the past is the correct one, and many times you will find a new path, hoping to progress the story, only to discover that it simply carries some useless collectable. There are no on-screen indicators to let the player know where an item is, and whether they've collected it, making even online walkthroughs fairly worthless unless you follow them from the beginning.\n\nYou will constantly find new weapons to provide a variety of ways to dispatch your enemies, but there are so many and only a few of them are actually necessary to complete the game and unlock new paths. The rest are simply for show, providing a method of killing baddies that is pretty to look at, but fairly useless in the long run. It feels like the developers had too many ideas and couldn't decide which ones to keep in, so they just used them all in hopes of letting the player find one they like. I think once your weapon loadout starts to go past the 1-0 keys on the keyboard, it's time to scale back, guys.\n\nCertain weapons like the ice shard sprayer look impressive, and when you first acquire it, you think it would be useful for freezing water and solving puzzles, but it's really nothing more than a glorified machinegun with a wide spray angle and short range. Many of the weapons are like this, and it really makes the game feel unfocused.\n\nAxiom Verge is also HARD. And for no good reason, either. Enemies have obscene amounts of health, and deal massive amounts of damage, even on normal difficulty, and while they do occasionally drop health restoration pellets, it happens so infrequently you can never count on it when you are desperately low. The only reliable way to restore your health is to corrupt certain enemies and cause them to shoot out health pellets instead of bullets, or find a save point, which will also cause all the enemies to respawn.\n\nEnemies will swarm you constantly, forcing you to stop and fight them at every opportunity. Running through them and tanking the damage is NOT a reliable strategy until much later in the game. And weapon upgrade powerups are almost completely worthless. You would think there would be a noticeable difference in weapon strength after upgrading, but it will simply cause an enemy that once took 20 shots to now take 19.\n\nYeah, it's that kind of game. And for as hardy as the enemies are, the bosses are almost insultingly easy. While they do have unfair amounts of health (sensing a theme?) their attack patterns are predictable, turning the fight into a battle of patience. Some even have areas where you are completely invulnerable, but your attacks can still reach the boss. Once the game realizes that you understand the enemy's attack pattern, it shouldn't still take several minutes of whittling down the boss's health just to move on.\n\nThen of course, it comes time to go for 100% completion, and that is where you really realize this game's failing. I managed to complete the game without any guides, simply through systematic searching and trial-and-error, but trying to get 100% made me give up, because it is F$%&ING IMPOSSIBLE. Each section of the map is separated into a different area, and the game only tells you whether you have uncovered all of the map, or all of the items. This is told to you through two dots that appear in the corner of the map, and no documentation what these dots mean. The only way to get 100% is to check an online walkthrough. There are plenty of these available online, so have at it, but here is a message to the developers:\n\nIt is twenty-god-damn-fifteen. (Going by the game's release date) Stop fetishizing the days of wandering around making no progress. Video games were made like that during the 80s because nobody knew how to make good games yet and they were experimenting. Online walkthroughs exist when a game fails to meet the expectations for what a player is supposed to know. Objective arrows, item markers, visual and sensory clues exist for a reason, and it's about time you learned how to integrate them properly into the games you design. If you want to put puzzles and exploration into the game, go ahead, but you are competing against a fanbase that has an entire encyclopedia of knowledge at their disposal and is not afraid to use it. If your puzzles are unintuitive and asinine, we will NOT care. If you refuse to give us tools to know what items we've picked up and from where, we will find our own. If that's what you want, then by all means, but don't expect us to praise you for giving us a complete gaming experience when we had to do half of the work ourselves.\n\nIf Axiom Verge were more focused, perhaps giving the player only a small selection of weapons and making them all useful, and provided more in-game resources to assist while going for 100%, it could have ranked up there with the great fan Metroidvanias like Xeodrifter or AM2R. But as it stands, it's a game with a lot of dead ends, both in terms of game design and overall concept.", "timestamp_created": 1496723879, "timestamp_updated": 1496756492, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550555", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32179679": {"recommendationid": "32179679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064209679", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "last_played": 1516325611}, "language": "english", "review": "An excelent game, excelent gameplay, excelent environment music, the graphic style is amazing.

And I started off playing Hard mode. I decided to dive straight into hard mode without even knowing the game before hand.\nIf this is what people call a \"metroidvania game\" its got me really hooked into the genre. I have to say this is one of the few true metroidvania games that I really felt invested in. I also played DMC3, Spyro Attack of the Rhynocos and Ninja Gaiden Black which are fairly close to the genre where you gotta backtrack to progress and upgrade. \n\nUsually I play linear platformers but this game does have \"different\" type of platforming. Its just not instant kill mobile buzzsaws, pendulums, moving platforms, unpredictable spikes or etc. Most common enemies act as the hazards themselves rather than trying to kill you (although some types will follow you and jump over platforms if necessary.). \n\nYou definately change as the protagonist is changing. He is getting stronger but so are you. i used to fear those humanoid zombie thingies that jumped and charged at you because my guns tickled them and the enemies were much faster. This game doesn't spoon feed you but spoonfeeding is something I see too much in modern games. Instead you gotta try to stay away from the objective until you grab those upgrades. Now that I explored and found a few extra things, I don't fear those zombies anymore.\n\nThe boss fights don't feel cheap but that doesn't mean that they aren't challenging. They make you platform and jump while managing to aim at the same time. Its easier said than done but their patterns can throw you off and it gets frustrating. They are fair because they show you their weakspots and you can see the whole entire necessary field between you and the opponent. However its up to your instincts and pattern recognition to defeat the boss. I hate it when bosses in other games aren't visible within the screen borders. Its a pet peeve I have with Freedom Planet because if I could see the entire field, then I can assess my positioning. Instead Brevon's mech keeps mowing me down because I didn't see him past the borders. \n\nIf I didn't mention about the creepy atmosphere and the grand scale of the world, well...now I did and its awesome.

Enemies come in two varieties: easy or frustrating. \n\nMost enemies fall into the first category, and can easily be blasted from afar, or by using the second obtained weapon to shoot them without entering into their line of attack. It got to the point where most enemies felt like a bother, as opposed to a challenge. The level design/monster placement did them no favors, either. The game is just begging you to cheese most enemies without ever putting yourself in harm's way. one poor enemy type, that sat on the ground and shot a burst of semi-random projectiles up and out from itself, was bafflingly placed so that you approached them from below, so that you never really entered their area of affect until after you had shot them to death from the platform under them.\n\nThe second type of enemy is much less sympathetic and shows up more and more as the game progresses. These enemies attack in a very similar manner: awkwardly fly into the player, repeatedly bump into/shoot the player until somebody dies. These enemies are frustrating to fight, which led to me just cheesing them whenever possible or just standing my ground and blasting back at them in an attrition tactic that was surprisingly effective most of the time. Trying to actually fight them was generally fruitless, as your aim is determined by the same input that controls your movement, so if you were moving around to dodge them you couldn't simultaneously shoot at them and vice versa.\n\nAnother obnoxious detail about enemies is that some of them have the bad habit of blending into the background. Now, this might have been to have some \"natural camoflauge\" effect, but most of the time it didn't feel intentional. The few cases were it was, the enemies were literally indistinguishable from the background until they pounced on you.\n\nThe bosses are more of a challenge than the mooks, but still feel rather bland, by and large. The only one I even care to comment on is the giant wasp that just felt so awkward to fight that it made me irrationally angry.\n\nThe sound design in the game is also rather poor, with the background music ranging from unoffensively bland to obtrusive. I ended up turning off the bgm and playing my own music in the background after about a third of the way in. Also, two of the more common sound effects (picking up health and hitting an invulnerable enemy) are for some reason much louder than the rest and obnoxious.\n\nEven given its detriments, it's not an awful game. If you're just looking for something to scratch a 16-bit itch, or give you the satisfaction that comes with discovering an interesting new weapon tucked away in some nook, then it's a perfectly servicable game. All in all, I wouldn't recommend it at full price and I wouldn't recommend it unless you love metroidvanias, but if those requrements are met, then there are worse ways to kill a few hours.", "timestamp_created": 1495427179, "timestamp_updated": 1495427179, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588348", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31889794": {"recommendationid": "31889794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358855573", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505367538}, "language": "english", "review": "Remember Metroid?

However, like the best \"retro\" games, it takes some creative liberties with its source material and does things that devs in the 90s probably would not have thought of, and If they had, the tech level wouldn't have been able to keep up. It also has a level of mystery and worldbuilding unrivaled in the genre.\n\nFirst, I have to address some personal issues I had with the controls. Axiom Verge handles well enough to be quite playable, but it also rather noticably doesn't handle as well as Super Metroid or other games of the era, or even some of its own contemporaries: the Shantae games have much more fluid movement, for example. I found myself switching between the keyboard and an Xbox 360 controller on the fly depending on what I was doing, not wholly comfortable using either. In particular, aiming and firing felt much more natural on the controller, but grappling was far easier using the keyboard, thanks to what might be the shortest and most awkward grapple in gaming. It's like nobody but me played the 2009 Bionic Commando remake. It also has curiously easy boss fights for the genre, especially considering how dangerous some of the regular enemies are.\n\nThat probably isn't a fair assesment of it, considering it was developed by one guy, unlike any of the other titles I just mentioned. With that in mind, Axiom Verge is an impressive work. It has a staggering variety of weapons that reads like a greatest hits list of shmup weaponry, everything from a basic linear projectile to a three-way spread, enemy-tracking lightning, R-Type-style curving lasers, Castlevania's fire vials, Ninja Gaiden's windmill stars, projectiles that bounce or travel along the ground, continous-fire lasers, an ice-shard spreadfire weapon and more. \n\nWhere Verge really shines is in its setting. You are Trace, a nerdy laser scientist who, following an accident at his lab, awakens in a bizarre, otherworldy place filled with fantastic things that want him dead. Like the many dead worlds Samus Aran has set foot upon, what happened to the world of Axiom Verge happened long ago. But this is different. You are not a power-armored, alien dna-infused super-warrior. You are a dazed and confused everyman lost in a nightmare. You are treading among the bones of giants and the game's foreboding, H.R. Giger-esque artwork and eerie soundtrack heavily reinforces this. It reminds me vaguely of Xargon, an old Epic Games platformer from 1993.  A central theme of the game, without going into too much detail, is the idea that things are not always as they appear. As one reviewer put it, you think you know how Verge will end, but you don't. It may not even make very much sense to you when it does, so I suggest you hunt down those notes and pay very close attention to their wording.\n\nThe game makes clever use of \"glitchy\" textures to represent areas of the world where reality has gone a bit fuzzy, when it is being re-written. What would indicate an error in any other game is a feature here, a potential gateway to elsewhere. With enough items, the world opens up in ways you probably woudn't have anticipated going in- where the journey of many other platformer protagonists would end, Trace's is only beginning. The esotericism of its backstory is even reflected in gameplay- some items are so well hidden that there is no possible way to discern their location without literally shooting and probing every wall with every ability, a questionable design choice, I'd say, but easily remedied by a guide and quite in keeping with the games' overall feel. There are even \"secret\" worlds whose placement and contents are randomized in each playthrough, that are implied to exist outside of the reality of most of the game- to the point where items found within do not count towards your completion percentage!\n\nIf you are as big a fan of Metroidvania as I am, then you owe it to yourself to play Axiom Verge, but even more so if you appreciate quality aesthetic design in games and the ability of them to put you in a unfamilar and uncomfortable reality.

A science experiment goes wrong and you wash ashore in a strange new world. Jump around, shoot baddies, discover secret areas. It's fun.\nBut it's all downhill from there.\nItem hunting becomes a tedious chore and the game begins to punish you for not discovering every little secret, and most of this occurs in the level with most annoying BS indian chanting music. You really want to print that garbage on a vinyl? No thanks.\n\nThe last two or three areas are frustrating as it requires you to make use of your teleport ability, which just so happens to be bound to the movement keys. It's so sensitive in fact, that I often found myself teleporting when I didn't want to, throwing myself into enemies or falling back down from an annoying climb only to throw my controller down in disgust and angrily rip patches of my hair out. The foes in the final levels are impossible. Most of them even glitched out, got hung up on the level, and teleported through solid walls, which discourages any legitimate face-offing. They shoot faster than you can jerk off and kill you in three to four smackeroos, bringing you all the way back to a checkpoint. I believe Vaas had a word for this. Oh yeah, insanity. \n\nHowever! Axiom Verge does not hold your little Trump hands across the finish line. You'll feel like shit when you play, but also incredibly accomplished when you wiggle your way through that tough spot or spit on a boss's boots. \nThe story is weird and cryptic with some unexpected twists. The levels are varied and grotesque, and always feel fresh when you discover a new one. They snap together like a pile of lincoln logs and the game encourages backtracking as you nab new items and abilities, giving you access to previously unreachable areas. \n\nIn conclusion, Axiom Verge fits together in an oddly frustrating way.\nPapa Bear gives this game:\n11/10 honey jars on the objective scale\n4/10 honey jars on the personal scale\n\nI am now bald. \nThanks Axiom Verge", "timestamp_created": 1494851517, "timestamp_updated": 1494851517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31767451": {"recommendationid": "31767451", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999049927", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494983221}, "language": "english", "review": "This game just rubbed me up the wrong way.

I have owned nearly every console and PC configuration released in North America since the Atari and MS DOS.  Taking this into account, I can comfortably claim that Axiom Verge is perhaps the best platformer I have ever played.  That truely says a lot.\n\nWhat is Axiom Verge?  At first glance, it looks like a clone of the original Metroid for the NES.  But no.  It's much more of a cleverly crafted love letter to the era.\n\nBack in the day, NES titles often suffered from bugs known as address corruption.  These would usually take the form of glitched or discolored blocks or enemies.  The original Metroid was notorious for this.\n\nWhat was a bug in Metroid, Axiom Verge utilises as a fully intentional (and functional) feature.  For the sake of spoiler protection, I won't go much further than this.\n\nEvery area is beautifully crafted, perfectly matching the style of the time - but with oh so much love and polish.  Indeed, polish is perhaps this game's strongest asset.\n\nThe music?  Pulse-pounding.  I know of no other way to describe it.  The developer has turned chiptune into a veritable art form.\n\nThe story is \"meta\" - confusing, alluring, and possibly brilliant.  I would truly love to see it expanded upon in a sequel.\n\nGame-length is perfect.  Slightly longer than any 2D Metroid title, including Fusion and Zero Mission.\n\nIn the \"metroidvania\" genre, it checks off ALL the right boxes.

Most of your options are tied to weapon mods you find for your gun, which could turn off some, but if you have an exploration itch this shouldn't be a problem.\n[*]Graphics are fairly relaxed with a definite push in the Metroid direction, which is great. Some of the great robot beings look beautiful and intimidating despite being allies.\n[*]The game does a good job balancing new tools and giving you ample zones to return to once you obtain them.\n[*]Enemy design is crazy cool and they often convey what attacks they'll do with just their design. It always felt great to see a new monster and had an idea what it was about to do.\n[*]While most of the mechanics are good like the teleports, I'd like to specifically point out the drone mechanic. It's rather satisfying to shoot out your drone as a means of platforming and teleporting around.

His hair, sideburns, and overall attitude just made me sigh a bit every time he appeared in portrait conversations.\n[*]I felt like enemies were, for the most part, fair and you could approach them with a decent strategy and most of the time come out unscathed. This isn't the case with the enemies in the last area, which spam bullets and lasers out of every point of their body and sometimes you deal with quite a few of these before hitting a boss room. These enemies felt cheap and maddening compared with a game that ramped up tactics with new tools quite well.\n[*]The story is uninteresting and generic.

Auch wenn ich das Spiel an dieser Stelle ausdr\u00fccklich f\u00fcr alle 2D-Metroid Fans (und eigentlich auch Nicht-Fans) empfehle, hat das Spiel kleinere M\u00e4ngel. \n\nSo ist die Steuerung allgemein in Ordnung, jedoch gibt es \"F\u00e4higkeiten\" und Items, deren Benutzung etwas Geschick erfordern, weil die vorgesehene Steurung nicht immer ganz so funktionieren will.\n\nAuch das Balancing des Gameplays ist teilweise nicht immer ganz optimal gel\u00f6st. Vor allem die Endgegner sind teilweise echt lahm, erst recht, wenn man sie so besiegt wie es der Game Designer nicht vorgesehen hat. Wiederum erscheinen andere Endgegner dezent unfair. Auch die normalen Gegner sind - gerade am Anfang eines neuen Gebiets - etwas stark. Jedoch gerade die Gegner aus den ersten Gebieten verlieren ziemlich schnell an ihrer Bedrohung. Trotzdem ist es z.B. \u00e4rgerlich, wenn man direkt an einer Schleuse von einem Gegner \u00fcberrascht wird, wenn man zwischen R\u00e4umen wechselt... ja, das kommt oft genug vor. \n\nIch pers\u00f6nlich hatte immer eine Ahnung, was ich als n\u00e4chstes tun muss, aber wer Backtracking nicht mag, der sollte sich darauf einstellen oder ein Walkthrough benutzen. Backtracking ist vor allem ein Sprichwort, wenn man Secrets finden will und das ist - meiner Meinung nach - auch gut so. Denn man kommt immer wieder in ein Gebiet zur\u00fcck, um neue versteckte Sachen zu finden, an die man vorher nicht drangekommen w\u00e4re, wenn man eine neue F\u00e4higkeit erhalten hat. Das macht Metroid so nicht anders und das ist einer der Aspekte, die mir an dieser Art von Games so gef\u00e4llt. Das erf\u00fcllt das Spiel mit einem gewissen Wiederspielwert.\n\nDoch velleicht h\u00e4tten es ein paar Secrets weniger auch getan. Denn ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, dass vieles auch nur die Spielzeit k\u00fcnstlich hochpusht, also eigentlich die Waffen. Es gibt insgesamt 20 verschiedene Waffen, die man finden kann, exklusive der supergeheimen Secret-World-Waffen, auf die ich allerdings nicht eingehen werde. Die meisten davon sind jedoch leider relativ unn\u00f6tig und auch nutzlos. Ich finde es gut, dass Axiom Verge sich in der Hinsicht deutlich von Metroid distanziert und feiere die Kreativit\u00e4t und die Originalit\u00e4t, die in diesem Spiel pr\u00e4sentiert wird, aber wie gesagt verbleiben einige Waffen unbenutzt im Inventar und h\u00e4tten aus dem Spiel auch raus gelassen werden k\u00f6nnen. In Metroid hat man nur eine Waffe, die durch den Spielefortschritt immer mehr Upgrades erh\u00e4lt, durch die gewisse Passagen im Spiel erst erreichbar werden. Bei Axiom Verge ist es allerdings so, dass es vielleicht eine Hand voll von den Waffen auch wirklich effektiv nutzbar sind, um Gegner gut zu erledigen und im Spiel gewisse Passagen zu \u00fcberwinden. \n\nGenug gemeckert - all dies mindert nicht den Spielspa\u00df. Axiom Verge macht in meinen Augen fast alles richtig und erweist seinem Vorbild - Metroid - alle Ehre. Es hat eine eigene Story und v\u00f6llig eigene Features, wie Items/F\u00e4higkeiten, mit denen sich R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6sen bzw. Passagen \u00fcberwinden lassen. In der Hinsicht hat Axiom Verge kaum etwas von Metroid abgekupfert. Einzig und allein die Formel, die ja eben einen Metroid-Klon ausmacht, ist geblieben. Das Gegnerdesign ist auch sehr originell und es gibt einige lustige Dinge, die man Gegner \"machen lassen\" kann, selbstverst\u00e4ndlich nicht durch \"echte Glitches!\" ;) Ebenfalls das Sound-Design und vor allem der Soundtrack gefallen und untermalen die Atmosph\u00e4re optimal. Das Level-Design, auch wenn es viel Backtracking beinhaltet, ist genauso rund und abwechslungsreich wie in einem Metroid. Grafisch macht das Spiel ebenfalls einen guten Eindruck, es hat saubere Animationen, eine gute Farbpalette in einer ordentlichen Pixelgrafik. Es vermischt diese angemessen mit modernen grafischen Effekten, wie z.B. Verzerrungen bei Explosionen, die den Waffen gleich st\u00e4rker aussehen lassen... und ja, auch, wenn das Waffenarsenal eine dezent verwirrende Gr\u00f6\u00dfe hat, dennoch hat jede Waffe ein komplett eigenes Verhalten mit visuell ansprechenden Effekten. Zur Story m\u00f6chte ich nichts sagen, doch diese wird weitestgehend durch klein und wenig gehaltene Dialoge, sowie auffindbare Notizen erz\u00e4hlt.\n\nIm Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen ist Axiom Verge ein runder und gut gelungener, empfehlenswerter Titel, der seinem Vorbild alle Ehre macht, auch wenn er es knapp verfehlt.", "timestamp_created": 1494345439, "timestamp_updated": 1494345439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31648382": {"recommendationid": "31648382", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987327268", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493045349}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] You played Metroid II when you were a kid...\t[/h1] \n\n...and you loved every part of it?\n\nThen buy this game. \nSeriously the art is awesome, the music too.

And that was my run on Normal, while being distracted much of the time.\n\nMust buy, especially if on sale!", "timestamp_created": 1493778831, "timestamp_updated": 1493778833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31500327": {"recommendationid": "31500327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049437340", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497048199}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed metroid on the SNES you'll enjoy this ;)", "timestamp_created": 1493702230, "timestamp_updated": 1493702230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31475415": {"recommendationid": "31475415", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960498879", "num_games_owned": 872, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 26258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493584158}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Why can't Axiom crawl?\" -Philosoraptor42, 2015.", "timestamp_created": 1493596336, "timestamp_updated": 1493596336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495970", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31424958": {"recommendationid": "31424958", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980224534", "num_games_owned": 742, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469390161}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0411\u0443\u043a\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u044f [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/manuelle/recommended/283640/] \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b\t[/url] \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 Salt&Sanctuary, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0446\u0435, \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044f\u0441\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0438  (\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0448\u0438\u0431\u0430\u044e\u0441\u044c \u0442\u043e 3-5 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a) \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c-\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0439 -

This mystery is something that the original Metroid gave you, but Super Metroid (as a rehash) did not. With a new world, and a new story, this takes the best gameplay elements of the Metroidvania genre, adds a few of its own and takes off. \n\nThe humor and design of the game are very self-aware. For instance, an item lets you \"glitch\" through walls as was famously possible on older SNES titles.

Samus would be proud.\n\nYou start off not knowing where you are, or how you got here, with minimal plot revealed, you must start fighting your way through an alien world. As you gain new abilities, the map opens itself up to new possibilities, letting you swing from ceilings, drill through solid walls, and navigate tight crawlspaces, unravelling the mysteries of a bizarre new world as you do so. Along the way you'll find yourself facing a variety of enemies which can be killed or corrupted into alternative modes that can help you, hinder you, or just turn them into a new challenge to face. Occasionally when faced with new enemies, you'll corrupt them in an attempt to depower them, only to find out that their corrupted alternative is even more difficult.\n\nNo Metroid-style game would be complete without exploration, which this game delivers in spades. There is a lot of backtracking - though this is a defining characteristic of the genre, as new movement abilities let you pass earlier inaccessible parts of the map - but even if you're not going the \"right\" way, exploring new areas will often reward you with a new weapon, upgrade, or note that helps build upon the story. It's important to note that unlike the Nintendo title from which this game draws its inspiration, colour-coded doors do not make an appearance here - all doors are generally open, and instead being locked behind physical barriers that require a new movement ability to bypass. This is a change I certainly support, as I could never understand why in Samus' world anyone would ever install a door that required *firing explosives* to enter - someone should really have a word with their contractors.\n\nThis exploration is helped with a character that controls exceptionally well, being both highly responsive and with movement that feels extremely well-weighted. Some of the later abilities are a little trickier to use, but in a manner that requires practice, rather than resulting in any cheap deaths. The majority of abilities are sensibly mapped to make them easily accessible when you need them in a hurry, with only changing weapons requiring more than a single keypress on a controller - which I'd personally recommend for the best experience.\n\nSpeaking of changing weapons, there are a ton of unique weapons to be found. You'll generally only find yourself using a handful, often in specific situations, and while they're not all required in order to advance, this makes a nice change to the usual limited range that Metroid players might be used to.\n\nThe graphics have a pleasing 16-bit console aesthetic, with some fantastic spritework in places and a pleasantly varied, bright colour scheme throughout. The bosses are massive, detailed monstrosities; enough so that the game often zooms out in boss rooms, as they're larger than a single screen. This can make some a little tricky, though often they can be a little easy to defeat once you figure out their patterns and the safe areas of the room. My only complaint would rprobably be the lack of single-use setpieces to give the layout of the world a feeling of logical structure - but given the alien setting, it's hard to hold this against the game as a whole.\n\nAudio-wise, the sound effects suit the game well, but where it really shines is the soundtrack, consisting of some superb electronica, all being original mixes composed by the lone developer, really adding to the technological atmosphere. One complaint is the limited number tracks played in the main game, with only a handful played depending on whether you're in the upper or lower areas of the map - This might grate on you in time, and it certainly could have benefitted from a few more tracks for each area of the map - but this doesn't detract from what is otherwise a fantastic game.\n\nOnto performance: As a 2D game released in 2015; I'd be disappointed if it didn't run well, but I'm happy to report that it does, with masses of sprites often filling the screen without so much as a hitch, which in a game where failing to dodge enemy fire can result in a fairly quick death and a trip back to the last save room, is incredibly important.\n\nIn a world where Nintendo seem to be resistant to taking Metroid back to anyting near its roots, this game is more than worthy in filling the gap. Some may find the backtracking offputting, and even find themselves lost at times after picking up a new ability, unsure where to use it; but for fans of Metroidvania style games this is a must-own.\n\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1491794130, "timestamp_updated": 1491794199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31030095": {"recommendationid": "31030095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057142927", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500180584}, "language": "english", "review": "It's worth every dime to any Metroid fan of the 1980's on NES.\n\nIt made me feel like I was 8 yrs old again.", "timestamp_created": 1491701708, "timestamp_updated": 1491701708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31021789": {"recommendationid": "31021789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089122619", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491401141}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd have sex with this game if it was a person", "timestamp_created": 1491670902, "timestamp_updated": 1491670902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476033", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30986024": {"recommendationid": "30986024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025625270", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491814179}, "language": "english", "review": "You played Super Metroid? \n\nThen what are you waiting for?", "timestamp_created": 1491511297, "timestamp_updated": 1494074984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30974856": {"recommendationid": "30974856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029570032", "num_games_owned": 469, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467797605}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0451 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f Metroid \u0432\u043d\u0451\u0441 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u044b \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440\u044b - \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044b\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. \u041f\u043e\u0437\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0434\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 - \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u043b\u044e\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043b\u043e, \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c Super Metroid \u0437\u0430 15 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442.

Surprised me how well made it was, especially considering one person did it all. Superficially, it's a bit like Super Metroid, but I think it's unfair to both games to compare them too much. It has the 2D exploration, backtracking, hidden items and ability-gates which Metroid is well known for. The graphics and enemies are obviously inspired by Metroid as well. But it also does its own thing with its abilities and weapons, and feels like its own game, not just something derivative. \n\nSaying that, something derivative would have been completely fine as well. It's not like there are a lot of good Metroid clones out there, and if you're hungry for one then you should enjoy this. (Track down AM2R, too!) But calling it just a clone isn't fair either. It reminds me of a lot of SNES/NES/Amiga/C64-era games rolled into one, with Metroid just being the strongest influence, and with some modern touches as well. Plot and cutscene wise, there is a bit of an Another World / Flashback vibe going on. It could even be an unofficial prequel to Another World, in a weird way.\n\nMost of my time was spent hunting down secrets, which I enjoy. If you don't enjoy that, you don't really have to. The game makes sure you have plenty of things to succeed with even if you don't track down every last item. It has a somewhat ridiculous number of weapons, if you collect them all, and you won't use all of them much, but each one is interesting and several are useful in certain situations even if they may not become your main tool of choice.\n\nPowerups/abilities suprrised me, and definitely deviate from what you would expect from Metroid or similar, while still unlocking new and sometimes surprising ways to reach places you could not before.\n\nCombat is for the most part straightforward, but you have the option of using a device that modifies what certain enemies do, which is sometimes very useful (and sometimes not; and sometimes does some secret stuff...). Controls are responsive and fair. Boss battles are never ridiculously hard, sometimes quite easy (at least if you use the right weapon), sometimes requiring a few goes and a bit of luck. Save points are plentiful and you rarely have to traverse a huge amount of space again if you die, unless you failed to explore and find them. The save system is also nice in that death essentially teleports you to the last save point with your items/pickups and revealed areas on the map left as-is. So, unless you have a power cut, you never have to worry \"will I remember to get this secret again if I die before I find th enext save point?\" because you won't have to rememeber at all. I like that.\n\nBacktracking is not tedious as by the time you're likely to want to go back to old areas to find secrets you missed or could not access originally, you will probably be so powerful (both weapons and movements) that you can cut through both the enemies and the level geometry itself like butter.\n\nOne piece of advice, and a slight spoiler: There are some hidden areas in places. Make a note of the ones you find. The game tracks whether you have 100% map and 100% items in each area of the game, but does not include the hidden areas, and they are in different places each game (from a large number of possible places). There are guides to help you find any you have missed, but if you haven't made a note of which and how many you have found then you may not know whether you are missing any or not.

Whatever the cause may be, the ten hours I logged on my first playthrough were all incredibly enjoyable and even though I do have a few issues with it you can't get a better modern metroidvania experience than with Axiom Verge.\n\nPROS:\nStarting from the very basics, the game looks amazing and goes to show that incredible worlds can be build without a million-dollar art budget. The retro-aesthetic perfectly matches the retro-style gameplay, creating the perfect casual atmosphere to enjoy. The world is incredibly interesting which means backtracking (you will do a lot of backtracking) rarely feels like a chore, and by the time you do have to return to an area you usually have some new ability that opens up a little bit more of a room you thought you'd cleaned out an hour ago. The game is also full of items, weapons, lore, and bonuses that are incredibly satisfying to find, so if you're a completionist you have your work cut out for you, but nothing quite beats the feeling of gaining a new ability and using it to explore more of the world. The sound design of the game is excellent as well, the background music is fantastic and the sounds your abilities make when you use them are incredibly satisfying as well. Sound design often gets overlooked but doing it well can make any game better, and Axiom Verge does it perfectly.\n\nCONS:\nThese are all minor flaws I noticed while playing. If you play with a joystick controller you have to double-tap the stick in the same direction to perform some abilities, an action that always felt a bit awkward to me especially during more delicate platforming sessions. The boss fights are fun and enjoyable but most of them can be beaten with relatively little work if you use the right strategy, which can make an awesome fight less exciting, but you by no means have to play them that way. Lastly (and this is about the more fundamental design of the game), Axiom Verge rarely leaves you lost with almost no idea where to go. That may seem like a pro, but to me the metroidvania category is all about exploring a world and discovering new things on your own. While Axiom Verge never explicitly tells you where to go your options are often extremely limited, forcing you down a singular path. At about the halfway point the game starts to open up a bit, leaving more room to explore, but the initial few hours seem incredibly scripted for an otherwise well-done metroidvania. In talking with other players not many even seemed to notice this railroading so maybe this is a moot point, but from a design perspective it's definitely there.\n\nYOU SHOULD BUY AXIOM VERGE IF:\n-you enjoy older metroidvanias and are looking for one with modern polish\n-you're looking for a casual game to play at your own pace\n-you're a game designer and want an example of how games can silently guide the player\n-you like games with lots of collectables\n-you're looking for a new game to speedrun (there's a built in timer should you choose to use it)", "timestamp_created": 1488435255, "timestamp_updated": 1488435255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514349", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30261885": {"recommendationid": "30261885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002009022", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 1368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452246767}, "language": "english", "review": "Bleak world, oddly geeky background and design for the main character.

And since it seems that Nintendo is reluctant to fill that void, Axiom Verge manages to fill it for them.\n\nThis game is a great entry into the Metroidvania genre and one that is more on the Metroid side than the Castlevania side. It has a lot of elements borrowed from the Metroid formula, such as the map system, hidden upgrades, backtracking and world exploration. But, it also has a lot that lets it stand on its own. Having an item that just lets you teleport past walls, or having a beam that lets you glitch up enemies that are in your way are really novel ideas. \n\nIf you've missed that feeling of completing a Metroid game, then definitely give this game a shot.\n\nUpdate as of 4/22/17:\n\nI've now gone and finished this game 100%, so I have some additional comments on the completionist aspects of the game. Many of the item locations are super cryptic, and many times while finding items, I'd find one by pure chance of messing around and think, \"How was I supposed to find this without just messing around?\" There were some items that were behind walls you can just walk through, with no indication that you can walk through them. The ones that require passcodes that you decipher from the other scripts written on the wall were annoying as well. Overall, only go for 100% if you really want the challenge of running around everywhere. It took me a total of 15 hrs to find everything, and most of that was just wandering around aimlessly hoping I'd find something. I eventually had to resort to using a guide to find the last few items after 2 hrs of wandering around.

There was also a part of the game that gave me motion sickness and where it was near impossible to see the enemies I was fighting, one of the few moments where putting my head down and pushing through didn't feel satifying. As well while there are a lot of fun weapons you will usually find yourself only using 2-3 that are really practical, as most are awesome to watch but pale in comparaision to the high-DPS vanilla shot, the wall ignoring electric shotgun, and the delayed detonation explosive ball to deal with powerfull enemies without getting close to them.

In particular there's one health node fragment which you will likely only find through sheer luck. The address disruptor is an inventive mechanic, although it's not always used to its full potential; there are few real puzzles using it, and the rewards for completing them are optional items. The game has over 20 weapons but few of them are useful or fun to use, which also makes combat a chore most of the time. Rather than trying to have as many items as possible, the game should have more closely emulated 2D Metroid, where you have fewer powerups but each has a unique purpose.

However, the personal taste ultimate decides whether it's good or not.\n\nI grew up with 2D games, this game appealed to me.\n\nThe story is confusing at first, but once you uncover more of the game's lore through ingame notes and dialogue, you will understand it when you manage to wrap your head around it.\n\nThe standard controls take a little to get used to, it's not horrible. You can change them the way you'd like.\n\nThe graphics are as expected, no complaints. I absolutely love the HR Giger influence though. The distortion effects give a unique tone to it. Color schemes are OK, it's not too bright or oversaturated.\nMy only complaint is the screwed up scaling ratio, making pixels look uneven on a 5:4 monitor.\n\nSound effects are more or less what you'd hear from an NES and a Gameboy Advance, which I don't mind at all.\n\nThe music is one the most important aspect of the game to me. It's one of the best I've heard, it adds to the surreal theme and general atmosphere. If it's something that makes a game good, then it has to be the game's music, at best composed directly from the person who envisioned the game.\n\nThere is no ammo (except for bombs which you find late in the game), other than that the HUD is minimal. The game borrows the map elements of Super Metroid, the map doesn't show item locations however.\n\nMost weapons that you find in the game are just 'meh' because of their lousy damage. The only really useful weapons are the Inertial Pulse (Super Metroid's pure plasma beam) and Kilver (highest damage of all weapons, shotgun-esque hugging-range gun). The coolest weapon though is the Voranj, which shoots bolts that split in two, looking like a fractal tree. You will also find tools which are necessary to progress in the game.\n\nThe enemies can get annoying sometimes, but they are dispatched quickly by just spamming your gun - and even quicker when you picked up Power Nodes.\n\nUnfortunately, the bosses are getting lackluster later in the game. It's really a shame, because there is always an easy way to defeat them - even the endboss.\n\nVerdict: I'd say this game is worth a shot when you liked Super Metroid.

Some of them appear to have strengths against certain enemy types so there's an element of strategy too. Sometimes using a couple of weapons in tandem to kill an enemy.\n\nI don't normally feel compelled to collect crud in games but Axiom Verge teased me enough that I wanted to figure out how to get to the secret areas. I think it also helps that they're not just placed on a map from the get-go (i.e. NOT secret and NOT a challenge). \n\nThe soundtrack is cool too. I kept finding myself humming the tunes when I wasn't playing it.\n\nOver all, I really enjoyed Axiom Verge.

Sometimes using a couple of weapons in tandem to kill an enemy.\n\nI don't normally feel compelled to collect crud in games but Axiom Verge teased me enough that I wanted to figure out how to get to the secret areas.

I kept finding myself humming the tunes when I wasn't playing it.\n\nOver all, I really enjoyed Axiom Verge. Definitely worth purchasing if you're into sci-fi or platformers (especially if you enjoyed them in the NES/SNES days). Tom Happ, I salute you.

If you are like me and think to yourself, \"So what? I'm a huge Metroid/Castlevania fan and I have seen a billion 'Metroidvanias'. None of them have wowed me like the games ending in '-oid' or 'vania', so what makes this one different?\"\n\nImagine, if you can, the first time you played a Metroid game. You would unlock one ability after another, each one opening the world in around of you. Try to remember that epiphany moment upon getting that upgrade you had no idea would exist, but made perfect sense after the fact. For me, it was getting the space jump in Fusion. \"It's not only a double jump, but you can jump forever?? Awesome!\" I was hooked ever since.\n\nAxiom Verge starts out very by the book, as far as copying Metroid is concerned. Get the thing that destroys certain blocks, get the thing that makes you smaller, get the different gun with different properties. You know it, and you have played THAT game before. However, after certain point in the game, I had no idea what to expect the next movement based ability to be. I knew SOMETHING was missing, but didn't quite know what exactly. It was like I was back in that powered down elevator shaft, with no idea what my goal was, other than to explore. It's a magical feeling, \n\nAlso, I feel AV relies more on your abilities to move through your environment rather than blocking your way with a different colored block. I rarely found myself shooting my obstacle in AV, but rather moving around or through it.\n\nTry to go into this game as blind as possible.

Vertical traversals involve awkward, rapid fire use of directional double taps and transformations. Grappling is reminiscent of Bionic Commando in a bad way. Attempting to jump while swinging causes an instant dead-stop plummet.\n\nAction gamers will contend with an embarassment of weapons, leading to far too much Mega Man. Unless you memorize the right weapon or ability for each enemy, you will find combat a grind.\n\nI've played dozens of metroidvanias, often for hundreds of hours. This one could have been great, but got too full of itself.  It reneges on the promises of the genre. Item completion is not possible based on in-game cues - you must create external cipher keys and decode hidden details. Often, you must use abilities never modeled elsewhere in the game. This sounds interesting, but is not fun. You can't win just by playing - you must work at it.\n\nI waited years to savor this, and the ashes of its failures are bitter in my mouth. This would not irk me if it were not so very, very close to being great. If the teleport dashes were directional and triggered by a secondary button, that alone would fix it. If the grappling had a suitable range and better collision, that woudl help. If the secrets were anchored to in-game unlocks rather than translation hijinx, that would be nice. Instead, it's just a twisty plot with a stiff engine, and poorly clustered level design. There is a reason modern titles have standardized on a hub transit model, or provided movement enhancements.\n\nThe game is well made, but poorly thought out. I can't recommend it due to frustration level and a slightly high difficulty curve on Normal. Instead, consider Shadow Complex, a more fitting homage to Super Metroid.

Reccommended if you are at all a fan of metroid or metroid style games.\n\nThis may sound redundant for a metroidvania game, but this game has clear inspirational ties to metroid. Its not just the exploration based platforming gameplay, so many things, from the tile designs and atmosphere to the way the first powerup  is to the immediate left of the start point, this game pays great homage to metroid, while at the same time not feeling any obligation to copy it exactly. Anyone who has ever enjoyed a metroid game will be pleased by the games homages, and perhaps even more pleased by how different it decides to be from its inspiration. you will find no morph ball in this game, nor will you collect a million missiles, and in their place you will find many versatile weapons and powers to collect, with clever and original concepts and excecution. \nThe game has an abundance of secrets as one would expect from a game with such heavy ties to metroid, but axiom verge is in my opinion far more fair about what constitutes a secret. No secret in this game requires that you bomb (or drill as the case may be) every floor wall and ceiling until you find a random energy tank or missile pack; all the secrets in axiom verge have clues to hint at their existence if you are observant enough, while still being subtle enough that it takes a clever mind and dedication to find everything. \nThe setting and story is compelling, and constantly left me wondering what was going on and trying to figure out the world i was in. The game gives answers out to these questions with a satisfying slowness, and the ending leaves just a little bit to the imagination, just enough to fuel theories and speculation. \nThe boss fights are all fair and interesting, if a bit easy if you are highly skilled at these types of games (which i am not). The bosses all have a specific way they need to be fought, and careful analysis of their attack patterns makes it possible (and given how strong their attacks are, neccessary) to avoid most if not all their attacks. \nWithout going into detail, there are some features and powers in the game that will appeal to anyone who have ever enjoyed encountering glitches or corruptions in videogames, such as the glitch worlds in metroid or minus world from mario. The feature is very interesting and a fun suprise upon first playthroughs.\n\nOverall Axiom Verge is a fantastic game that I highly reccomend to any fans of metroid or similarly playing games.", "timestamp_created": 1484420058, "timestamp_updated": 1484420058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29238490": {"recommendationid": "29238490", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995196779", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486336703}, "language": "english", "review": "Axiom Verge is an obvious love letter to the 8-bit NES classic, 'Metroid'. From the title screen on, its a blast of nostalgia that captures that creepy mood, music and atmosphere of the original just perfectly. After a lab explosion, your character finds himself somehow on an alien world, guided by a voice communicating directly to him. It is not long after that a large, ominous 'mask'- the game's titular image- stands before him and gives him a brief explanation as to what is happening, that they need help, and you must be the one to do so. \n\n....but do you trust them? SHOULD you...? (..do you have a choice?) What is this thing, and its motives? Why are you here? Why are areas guarded by bio-mechanical abominations that call you a demon...and who is Athetos? Every answer seems to raise new questions as you progress through the multiple areas of the world. Its a decent story that keeps you guessing, but gives you JUST enough hints to figure it out -right- before the \"big reveal\", which feels satisfying once you do know. \n\nAs with the original Metroid, there are many powerups to be found. Most of them are functionally the same as the \"source material\", but have their own fun, unique twist. For instance, rather than a morph ball, you get a little flea-looking drone that you can control to get items, access switches, remotely fight enemies, etc. Instead of the bombs, you get a laser drill--- bore through rocks and enemies as you run with a constant stream of plasma! You also get a grappling hook which is similar to the one in Super Metroid, the classic \"high jump\" item, and later on an item which lets you pass through walls and teleport a short range (effectively making this a \"double jump\" type item). There are also items that increase max health, attack power, projectile size and range, and around 25 (!) different weapons to obtain, all with their own unique attack, which can be fast-swapped out with the push of a button. \n\nHowever, the REAL star of this show is the GLITCH GUN, a fun toy with infinite 'ammo' that lets you glitch out enemies, walls, items and more. \n\nGot a tough enemy in the way? Glitch it into something MUCH easier to deal with! See something graphically crap-out in a wall? Glitch gun it to reveal a new path! Glitch bubbles into invincible, rising platforms, and lots more. Every enemy (except bosses) seems to have its own glitch-out state of being, some more helpful than others, including breaking through bricks and revealing secret paths that you otherwise could not reach. \n\nThere are a fair number of varying monsters to fight, including an array of sometimes-HUGE boss beasties just waiting to challenge you, all set against a pretty decent soundtrack. Like Metroid, though, the enemy AI is either \"homing or roaming\" with regular monsters, and boss battles being \"pattern-based attacks\". Not to say it isnt tough, and most of the deaths youll experience in the game are your own fault, since its simply 'memorize the pattern and dont screw up'. I died 25 times in my first playthrough, but none of them felt overly cheap. \n\nMy main gripe about this game is the \"where am I supposed to go now?\" feeling youll get many times as you make progress. Unfortunately, thats par for \"Metroidvania\"-style games, especially in these 8-bit types where just about any block in the game can potentially be destroyed to reveal secret items or paths...youll either have to suck it up, or refer to a walkthrough. I consulted one 3, 4 times throughout this game; the layout is fine and making progress USUALLY doesnt get you stuck, but sometimes you just want to make some real progress instead of slapping mindlessly at blocks in rooms youve already backtracked into 5 times before. \n\nGifed to me from a friend over Xmas... it was on my wishlist. Had I purchased this myself though, I would have had no regrets.

I own an Xbox 360 pad and prefer to play with the left stick. However for that specific move I must use the d-pad simply because I can't pull that move off otherwise. I also accidentally press the left stick weapon quick select all the time which means I select a weapon I don't wanna use at that time.\n\nOther than that the game is almost flawless.

Aethestically, this game is mesmerizing. Functionally, its feels like a mess.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? There's no denying that this alien world has a very distinct artistry to it, and from a purely cosmetic standpoint it really, really works. What is this place? What's with these giant talking heads? Only the bare minimum makes sense, and from a Metroidvania perspective it does a great deal towards driving curiousity in the world around you. Axiom's Verge's amibiguity flat out captivated me; I wanted to know more.\n\nAnd yet, that same amibiguity turned out to be a double-edged sword. You might think a strange, alien world would be filled with meaningful landmarks, but that just doesn't seem to be the case. The world as a whole just feels like a hodge-podge of random terrain that goes from \"weird green-looking stuff\" to \"weird blue-looking stuff.\" Its nice eye-candy in the moment, but its make for terrible navigation. Getting a power-up essentially had me going, \"Oh great, I wonder which forsaken dead end this thing hooks up with.\" Exploration can quickly devolve into aimless wandering as you travel half-way across the map just to find a health fragment (and subsequently pick another dead end to check out.) The poking around feels more like a mandatory exercise than a fun sidequest.\n\nThe cryptic nature of the world carries over into some of its powerups. It probably sounds cool on paper to run through walls, but again, which walls? Generic Wall #31 probably isn't a very good landmark to use for hiding secrets. You also hack enemies to produce all sorts of funky effects, like them being able to suddenly break seemingly random tiles for no obvious reason. And why can I hack only one out of five different pools of similar-looking acid? These moments of discovery feel less like \"Aha!\" moments and more like, \"Oh, OK. That just happened, I guess.\" moments. Its wildly infuriating to feel like the world is just stringing you around, rewarding dumb luck rather than intelligent observation.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, combat is by and large boring. Early enemies are often placed in very exploitable positions, whereas later on enemies get really \"homing\" happy. The bosses, on the other hand, tend to be massive rinse-and-repeat affairs where you can, quite literally, stand and/or jump in place while mashing the fire button. Their patterns are often dreadfully predictable, and combat seems to favor raw damage output over finesse by a long shot. Combat can definitely end up adding to the tedium of randomly running to and fro.\n\nUltimately, its feels frustrating to have this incredible world held at arms length by obtuse mechanics. I can't say I've played anything quite like Axiom Verge and a part of me wants to keep absorbing its eccentric wonders, but I've found myself losing patience with all the wild goose chasing.

The weapons have pleanty of variety to keep things fun. Enemies are well executed, and bosses keep getting tougher as the game goes on. You may have to experiment to see what works and what doesn't on certain enemies; but the game never punishes you for trial and error.\n\nDon't feel shy about consulting a walkthrough if you get lost. Because this map is HUGE, with countless nooks and crannies full of secrets and upgrades. My only greivence is that there are bonus levels in the game which only appear randomly with each playthrough; meaning you could play this game 5 times over and still not experience everything. Seems like a needless restriction.\n\nAside from that, this game is a joy to play from start to finish. The fact that 1 guy made this game is incredible.

This game looks and plays like the spiritual successor of Super Metroid, which is probably the primary selling point for at least half of the people buying it.  As video graphic technology accelerated, the 2D platformer style that was the bedrock of early console games has mostly been abandoned.  That makes new titles for fans of that style always welcome, as long as they're well executed.\n\nIf you have played the early Metroid games, then this game will feel incredibly familiar, like a homebrew bootleg port.  I say that in a good way.  The bubble blocks, lava pits, save nodes and doorway portals are all here, scattered around an unforgiving planet inhabited by insects, robots, biomechanical ghouls and vampiric monsters resembling creatures from the watery abyss.  The map is a complex labyrinth of pitfalls and hidden chambers and the soundtrack adeptly reflects the haunting atmosphere of the game.  This game knows exactly what it's trying to emulate and hits the mark perfectly.\n\nFortunately, Axiom Verge comes with enough unique twists on its mentor to deliver a fresh experience.  The full arsenal of weaponry is far more extensive and diverse than Metroid, triple the amount of various beam weapons that you might expect.  This provides a variety of options to eliminate your foes and I found most of them to be useful throughout all portions of the game.  Also, rather than using a \"Morph Ball\" to find and access smaller tunnels, this game provides you with a tiny drone to navigate those areas instead.  Like Metroid, you'll find various tools, such as a grappling hook, to traverse the rooms.  You'll also find powerups for your weapons and your drone that will eventually allow you to access areas you couldn't before, although the manner in which you eventually reach those areas is slightly different than it would be in Metroid.  The most unique tool is the Address Disruptor, which allows you to 'glitch' the enemies and environment.  This allows you to materialize hidden blocks or morph enemies into a different form with different behavior patterns.  Lastly, there are five separate entrances to 'secret worlds' that are randomly generated in different locations for each game, allowing you to gain additional powerups and secret weapons, if you can find them.  This makes the game slightly different each time you play it.\n\nThis game easily makes it onto my top five list of favorite platformers.  Aside from a few frustrating learning moments with the controls for some of the tools and one level with a very obnoxious music theme that sounds like a singing robot (Lower Kur), I loved everything about it.", "timestamp_created": 1483432887, "timestamp_updated": 1483432930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28965962": {"recommendationid": "28965962", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993612772", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483407973}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic 2-d platform adventure game.

Io adoro i giochi alla Supermetroid, ma di \"cloni\" fatti davvero bene se ne trovano davvero pochi, e questo titoletto finisce dritto dritto tra questi pochi fortunati. Un prodotto come questo, pagato all'incirca nove euro, vale decisamente pi\u00f9 di parecchi titoli tripla A venduti al quintuplo, a mani basse. \nVestiremo i panni del dottor Trace, uno scienziato che, durante un'esperimento in laboratorio, si risveglia in un mondo alieno e con una voce di una donna nella testa...Da qui inizier\u00e0 l'epopea che lo porter\u00e0 ad affrontare un nemico molto, molto particolare, accompagnato da delle entit\u00e0 che lo aiuteranno nel suo viaggio per scoprire la verit\u00e0 che si cela dietro quel pericoloso universo. \nIl gioco, tecnicamente parlando, \u00e8 quello dei giochi a scorrimento 2D, con uno stile grafico 8-bit estremamente fatiscente, con richiami stilistici allo storico artista H.R.Giger (celebre per aver creato la creatura di Alien): il mondo di Sudra presenta delle aree esteticamente curate e ricche di dettagli (dettagli che a volte per\u00f2 creano momenti di confusione visiva), che vanno da claustrofobiche ricoperte da sostanze rigeneranti a ampie aree rocciose e innevate. Il sonoro fa la sua bella figura, e ogni tema musicale \u00e8 perfettamente adatto ad ogni area o situazione. Dal punto di vista del gameplay parliamo, per l'appunto, di un Metroid-like, quindi di tutti quegli aspetti tipici dello storico sparatutto 2D di Nintendo. La peculiarit\u00e0 di AV \u00e8 sicuramente l'enorme quantit\u00e0 di potenziamenti per la nostra arma (sono arrivato al finale con nemmeno la met\u00e0, e ne avevo circa 5 o 6...) e durante l'avventura potremo potenziare persino noi stessi (teletrasporti, rampini, droni telecomandati ecc.), ampliando la barra vita attraverso il ritrovamento di globi rossi o potenziando la gittata, la potenza e la dimensione dei proiettili della nostra arma. All'interno dell'enorme mappa del gioco (divisa in settori che scopriremo man mano nel corso dell'avventura) troveremo i savepoint con i quali potremo salvare e riempire al massimo la salute. All'inizio molte aree ci verrano precluse, per poi esplorarle mano a mano che troveremo potenziamenti adatti al raggiungimento delle stesse, proprio come avveniva in Metroid. Non mancheranno i soliti collezionabili e gli obiettivi opzionali utili per le statistiche personali e per eventuali record da battere.\n\nChe dire. Il gioco scorre bene, \u00e8 decisamente longevo (10 ore e 11 minuti tondi tondi) ed \u00e8 citazionistico quanto basta da fare felici i nostalgici del genere. Unica nota negativa..\n\n[i] La parte finale...Cristo...La parte finale...Mi viene male solo a pensarci...!\t[/i]\n\nAllora...Immaginatevi un gioco che per nove ore scorre fluido, senza particolari momenti ostici e con una curva di difficolt\u00e0 modesta. Ecco, ora arrivate alla parte finale, entrate nell'area di gioco conclusiva per poi...RITROVARVI DI COLPO IN UN LIVELLO INCREDIBILMENTE FRUSTRANTE, AL LIMITE DELLA BESTEMMIA. \nDavvero, il la curva di difficolt\u00e0 nell'ultima ora di gioco impenna bruscamente, con nemici incredibilmente irritanti che vi annienteranno con pochissimi colpi.

Ele conta a hist\u00f3ria de Trace, um cient\u00edsta que, num dos seus experimentos, acaba acordando nesse mundo esquisito. Eu confesso que n\u00e3o dei muita aten\u00e7\u00e3o pra hist\u00f3ria quando joguei, mas ela \u00e9 mais rica do que aparenta ser. Ela \u00e9 cheia de significados, e h\u00e1 v\u00e1rias teorias na internet sobre os fragmentos de plot que o jogo apresenta no decorrer.\n\nO que mais me agradou nesse jogo foi a trilha sonora. Cara, como ela \u00e9 boa! Eu tenho ela no meu Spotify e ou\u00e7o sempre.\nO visual tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito bem feito, principalmente se voc\u00ea parar pra pensar que foi feito por um cara s\u00f3. As cores s\u00e3o bem vivas, os cen\u00e1rios s\u00e3o bem desenhados, os trechos s\u00e3o bem memor\u00e1veis. O mapa eu tamb\u00e9m achei bem gigante. N\u00e3o tem fast-travel [spoiler](na verdade tem, mas s\u00f3 mais pra frente na hist\u00f3ria)[/spoiler], ent\u00e3o prepare-se para andar e explorar (o que na minha opini\u00e3o \u00e9 \u00f3timo). H\u00e1 muitos secrets pra se descobrir tamb\u00e9m, uns s\u00e3o bem \u00f3bvios, mas alguns tem que explorar bem pra encontrar.\n\nUm ponto que achei mais ou menos foi o balanceamento da dificuldade. Alguns bosses s\u00e3o f\u00e1ceis demais, principalmente se voc\u00ea sacar o weak spot dele. As vezes voc\u00ea vence um boss ficando parado e atirando, por\u00e9m nem todos s\u00e3o assim. E em alguns trechos os inimigos s\u00e3o BEM mais dificeis do que o boss que vai chegar. Ali\u00e1s, o jogo \u00e9 desafiador, prepare-se (mesmo no 'normal').\n\nA quantidade de armas, itens e equips \u00e9 imensa. E, sem brincadeira, voc\u00ea acaba usando praticamente todos eles. Cada um tem uma utilidade, que vai depender da situa\u00e7\u00e3o que voc\u00ea se encontra. E muitas delas requer treino pra poder ser efetivo com elas ou alcan\u00e7ar lugares pra poder progredir.\nDesses itens, o que eu mais gostei foi a \"onda-hacker\" (n\u00e3o lembro o nome certo haha), que ela \"glitcha\" os inimigos e algumas \u00e1reas. Essa mec\u00e2nica \u00e9 a coisa mais criativa do jogo e muito legal de se usar. As vezes vc glitcha o inimigo e ele fica mais fraco e f\u00e1cil de matar, ou as vezes ele fica mais foda, ou as vezes ele se torna algo \u00fatil pra voc\u00ea progredir tamb\u00e9m. \u00c9 bem interessante.\n\nA jogabilidade \u00e9 uma coisa que eu vi algumas pessoas reclamarem, mas eu achei fluida e responde bem. A \u00fanica coisa que incomoda um pouco \u00e9 o \"dash\", mas s\u00f3 pra quem joga no controle. Eu joguei no controle, mas me acostumei. Acho que \u00e9 s\u00f3 quest\u00e3o de se adaptar.\n\nPor fim, minha conclus\u00e3o de que esse jogo vale muito a pena, n\u00e3o foi a toa que ele foi indicado pro TGA 2015. Jogo muito bem feito, hist\u00f3ria densa, jogabilidade \u00f3tima e muito bonito.

I like the aesthetic of this game a lot, the music, the weapons, they're all cool, but overall I didn't enjoy my time with Axiom Verge that much. To begin with there is a lot of backtracking in this game, and while there are a few shortcuts you can expect to tread the same ground quite often and it isn't fun to do so due to how movement works. *spoilers* The way you traverse in the game horizontally becomes all about teleporting, you can never have a higher base movement speed like the old Metroid games so I was always just double tapping as much as I could to move as fast as I could. This is annoying and I should have looked in the options to see if I could rebind it. In addition it's pretty easy to not know where you need to go next so you're just wandering around, you don't always immediately use the ability you just unlocked to put you back on the right trail, which while a minor nitpick can be annoying.\n\nMy other main gripe is the spike in difficult near the end where enemies just become death dealing bullet sponges. I assume this is to balance out for people who went through and collected a majority of the powerups but I didn't and it made the last few sections extremely frustrating with many enemies taking up to 1/8th of your health in a single volley while taking many hits to kill. I also only used a couple of the weapons in the game, it doesn't feel like you HAVE to use the other ones so why bother? I ended up cheesing many enemies by turning into the droid and just running past them, then teleporting to my drone to avoid them, or gaming them by just running the drone into them and getting off one hit at a time before it died. This to me is not fun, but when you're on a sliver of health (or more in some cases) and the checkpoint is a ways away why risk it?\n\nOverall it felt okay, movement didn't feel as good as I would have like and was finicky, and some of the combat was downright annoying (weird spikes in boss difficulty then being super easy, or enemies that did more damage than the bosses did). Overall it's worth picking up on a sale depending on whether you really like Metroid games and can overlook these faults. If not I would recommend avoiding it as it can be a very frustrating experience at points.", "timestamp_created": 1483171606, "timestamp_updated": 1483171650, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499851", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28859570": {"recommendationid": "28859570", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962152557", "num_games_owned": 1008, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483169357}, "language": "english", "review": "Axiom Verge is an amazing Metroidvania game, it is very reminiscent of Super Metroid in appearance tone and gameplay, but it has a very large set of it's own unique mechanics that work really well.

For the Super Metroid-like exploration aspect, it's pretty neat.

Usually they don't hold my attention much longer than that because with a lot of them if you've played one you've played them all. Axiom Verge sucked me in for hours on my first play. My initial impression was \"wow, this is a Metroid clone right down to the map and enemy style\" but it very quickly deviates and becomes its own game. Obviously it was heavily inspired by the original NES Metroid but the developer has added a ton of his own original ideas to make it both more challenging and more interesting. \n\nI'm not very far into the game because it is actually pretty freaking hard at some parts so I'll just give my initial impression and why I think it grabbed me so quickly:\n\nPlot: The plot is interesting from what I've seen so far and although \"story moments\" are few and far between, they give you just enough to keep you wanting to see the next \"cut scene\" and figure out what is going on. Aside from dialogue before boss encounters and at certain points when you discover something important, you're left alone to just play the game... which is nice but it is certainly different from modern games where you always know where you're supposed to go next. There is a lot of independent exploration in Axiom Verge.\n\nCombat: Combat is pretty straightforward if you've ever played an action-platformer. It is, as I have already said, very reminiscent of Metroid but there are some key differences. For one thing as far as I have seen you don't need a certain weapon to defeat specific enemies. Which weapon you use is completely up to which ones you like to use. Thanks to modern systems that have more than two buttons on the controller, switching between weapons is easy and quick. The main difference between Axiom Verge and Metroid's combat is you can lock your character in place with one button so that you can freely aim your gun to hit targets at weird angles you wouldn't be able to hit while moving. I didn't use this a lot at first but let me tell you it is almost essential during some of the boss battles.\n\nControls: For the most part the controls are fantastic but I am using a steam controller and some of the default button bindings are messed up. If you're holding the left trigger to lock your characters movement and using the joystick to aim your gun, it keeps switching weapons because I guess that is also the way to quick select guns. I'm sure you can fix that yourself I just haven't gotten around to it yet.\n\nGraphics & Sound: Both gloriously retro Nintendo. The soundtrack is phenomenal, I must say. The art is decent. Most of the enemies are smaller so there's only so much you can do with a handful of pixels but the bosses and character animations look great.\n\nOverall: I really didn't think I was going to like this game this much. It was like a dollar and I just wanted more games in my library that I could play with my Steam Controller. I was very pleasantly surprised.

It\u2019s not most groundbreaking and you can spot where the game\u2019s roots are easily. Still, every element of the game is done competently and is tuned to fit in the whole system. You can\u2019t overlook the fact that whole game was done solely by Tom Happ. Sometimes whole teams fail to not put average pieces in the way of really great ones.\n\nAt first glance the game is an undeniable copycat of Super Metroid (perhaps any 2D metroidvania centered around shooting is) with all the foundation taken straight of it: the isolation feeling, save point system, health replenishment particles that some of the dead enemies leave behind, and the eerie vibe of psychedelic 80s sci-fi.\n\nSo it goes like this. You are \u201cthe scientist\u201d named Trace, there\u2019s an explosion in your lab. You are awaken in the alien world and contacted by Elsenova who is giant war machine representing \u201cspecies\u201d of Rusalki. They are at war with Athetos a mad scientist destroying space-time. More accurately speaking they lost the war and now you are their last chance. But that are the bits of the story from later on, for now all the instructions you get are \u201cThere is a gun in the next room\u201d and \u201cYou must go, now\u201d.\n\nSo you get out and start exploring. Enemies hit hard encouraging slow and methodical approach. Learning attack patterns and using distance to your advantage keeps you from restarting back at egg-shaped rebirth chamber. You make your way to the next rebirth chamber. You find few upgrades in the process and a new gun, which has a different firing mechanic (making it a highly situational weapon). And then you get to the boss; the slow and tense rhythm fades away.\n\nIt all just goes nuts. Boss fights are punctuated with delirious high-tempo electronic music and filled with adrenaline up to the brim. The screen is traced with enemy shots. You dodge and jump. You keep firing. Precision, speed and reaction will get you through first few bosses. Pattern-learning and staying focused will pick up after that. Bosses will have phases with tricky moves and more deadly attacks. You avoid damage and keep shooting watching how your enemy slowly turns red. All of this just turns itself into red pulsating blur.\n\nThe rhythm slows down again. You proceed further to keep on exploring. This is a simple loop of going through building up tension to climax points and back to calm concentration. You\u2019ll collect more items, more weapons. You\u2019ll meet NPCs. Piecemeal storytelling: cryptic dialogues and ciphered messages. Backstory takes significant effort to uncover itself. Same for some of the most powerful weapons.\n\nSomewhere around the middle of the game Axiom Verge suddenly plays homage to Blaster Master repeating one of its key mechanics in reverse. Trace is granted an ability to launch a miniature remote-controlled drone to explore narrow spaces. Most innovative though is the Address Disruptor. The Glitch Gun. You fire it in a cone in front of Trace and it lets you pass through inaccessible wall (by evaporating them). Or it changes the properties of your enemy. Or it materialises a platform hanging in the air. It glitches. Magic happens.\n\nThe game\u2019s most amazing secret though is its very well hidden procedurall-generated dungeons system. The existence of such a system within the game is what defines its author\u2019s dedication to traditions of the genre. It\u2019s this little details like a special mode for speedruns with some thought put into it that make a metroidvanian labyrinth interesting to explore, not just pass by.", "timestamp_created": 1482535591, "timestamp_updated": 1482535591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600536", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28570209": {"recommendationid": "28570209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023035144", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447283181}, "language": "english", "review": "Follows the Super Metroid formula while being weird as fuck.", "timestamp_created": 1482527848, "timestamp_updated": 1482527848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28568499": {"recommendationid": "28568499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024155723", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450564557}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1482525024, "timestamp_updated": 1482525024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28550262": {"recommendationid": "28550262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055969492", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514077980}, "language": "english", "review": "alright holy shit this game was good. the story is a bit here and there but man if you liked metroid you have to get this game.", "timestamp_created": 1482472703, "timestamp_updated": 1511137631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28547025": {"recommendationid": "28547025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130295998", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492269818}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u96be\u7f20\u7684boss\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6b66\u5668\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u770b\u4f3c\u4e71\u4e03\u516b\u7cdf\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\uff0c\u5230\u6700\u540e\u6211\u4e5f\u6ca1\u80fd\u641e\u5b9a\u90a3\u4e2a\u795e\u79d8\u7684\u95e8\u3002\u5267\u60c5\u611f\u89c9\u8ddf\u4f20\u9001\u95e8\u6709\u70b9\u50cf\u5427\uff08\u5176\u5b9e\u4f20\u9001\u95e8\u4e5f\u6ca1\u592a\u591a\u5267\u60c5\uff09\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1482463607, "timestamp_updated": 1482463607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28546782": {"recommendationid": "28546782", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990277569", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481868434}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a really fun game much like the original Metroid game.

In the beginning it doesn't have much of a storyline, but as you go on, the storyline develops and becomes much more interesting.  \n\nThe game does some pretty neat things with the physics of the game too.  It gives you items that allows you to hack the world around you so that you can teleport through walls, and destroy parts of the world around you.  It also gives you an item to transform certain enemies into different versions of themselves, rendering them either harmless, bigger so they are easier to hit, or helping you reach areas you couldn't before or killing previously unkillable enemies.  \n\nThe one thing I didn't like about the game is how many weapons the game gives you.  I found 9 weapons and only about 3 of them were useful for killing enemies.  When I looked up a guide I saw that there were at least another 5 - 6 weapons that I didnt find.

Damals musste man als Samus Aran zur\u00fcck zu Ihrem Heimatplaneten, um noch einmal gegen Mother Brain zu k\u00e4mpfen und die Weltraumpiraten endg\u00fcltig auszuschalten. \nDoch Axiom Verge ist anders. Die Story und die Welt erinnern eher an eine (Alb-)Traumwelt, als an ein Sci-Fiction-Universum. Axiom Verge ist keine seelenlose Kopie der \u201ealten Zeiten\u201c sondern ein Ode an die Zeit der ersten Metroidvanias. Doch Achtung! Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist auf einem anderen Level, also heutige Spiele, soll hei\u00dfen, einfach durchrennen und abschlie\u00dfen geht hier nicht. \n\n[b] Die Grafik: [/b]\n\nWie anfangs schon beschrieben ist die Grafik vollst\u00e4ndig auf Retro getrimmt und in wundersch\u00f6ner Pixeloptik gestaltet. Auch der Sound passt hier zum Gesamtbild des Spiels. Aber der Grafikstil ist auch teilweise etwas un\u00fcbersichtlich und so kann es passieren, dass man Gegner, die im gr\u00fcnen Gras sitzen, \u00fcbersieht, weil diese ebenfalls aus gr\u00fcnen Pixeln bestehen. Diese Pixelgrafik muss man aber schon m\u00f6gen, den schlie\u00dflich kann die Grafik hier mit keinem teilweise aktuellem Spiel mithalten.\n\n[b] Die Steuerung: [/b]\n\nDie Steuerung mit einem Controller ist sehr zu empfehlen und auch die beste M\u00f6glichkeit, den Charakter vollst\u00e4ndig unter Kontrolle zu halten. Nat\u00fcrlich ist auch die klassische MuT-Steuerung (Maus und Tastatur) m\u00f6glich, aber Kr\u00e4mpfe in den Finger will nun doch niemand mehr, oder?\n\n[b] Die Story: [/b]\n\nDie Geschichte um den Wissenschaftler Trace, der anfangs keine Ahnung hat worum es \u00fcberhaupt geht. Genau wie wir, wenn wir das Spiel zu ersten Mal spielen und dann endlich die Waffe, den Axiom Disruptor, den virtuellen H\u00e4nden h\u00e4lt und die ersten biomechanischen Feinde pulverisieren. Erst gegen Ende des Spiels erschlie\u00dft sich die ganze Geschichte und l\u00e4sst einen mit einem \u201eAhh!\u201c zur\u00fcck. Leider ist die Story nur teilweise ausgebaut und so mangelt es etwas an Tiefe und Details zu den Wesen, die man besiegen muss. Trotz allem ist die Story super und mehr als nur ein L\u00fcckenf\u00fcller.\n\n[b] Gameplay: [/b]\n\nMan startet unbewaffnet und ohne jeden Plan, irgendwo in einer fremden und feindseligen Welt. Nach einem kurzen Gespr\u00e4ch mit einer biomechanischen Dame, findet man auch den Axiom Disruptor, die Standartwaffe des Spiels. Nun hei\u00dft es, schauen wie es weiter geht, den Hilfe bei der Navigation, wie eine Minimap oder einen Radar, gibt es nicht. Am Anfang ist das aber kein Problem. Die Wege verlaufen linear und man findet sich gut zurecht. Hat man erst mal ein paar F\u00e4higkeiten erlangt, geht es mit dem sammeln der Power-Ups soll und dass, kann dazu f\u00fchren, das man sich verl\u00e4uft. Nicht dramatisch, aber l\u00e4stig, wenn man immer wieder an der gleichen Stelle 10 oder 12 Mal vorbei latscht. Auch die Waffenauswahl ist ziemlich gro\u00df und allein f\u00fcr den Disruptor findet man, wenn man sich wirklich alles ansehen will, 24 verschiedene Schussarten. Hier ist alles, vom Laser bis zum Bumerang, dabei. Ja, nicht alles ist sinnvoll, den wer braucht schon einen Bumerang wenn er eine Blitzkanone hat? \nDas Sammeln von Ausr\u00fcstungen und das Besiegen von Bossgegner ist die Motivation des Spiels. Die Bosse sind mit der richtigen Ausr\u00fcstung zwar nicht das Problem, aber es geh\u00f6rt schon etwas Geschick dazu, nicht in die Sch\u00fcsse des Bosse zu rennen und so schnell das zeitliche zu segnen. Auch die Weltenteile sind unterschiedlich aufgebaut und haben ihre eigenen Wesen und Viehcher, die man mehr mal weniger, nerv..... \u00e4hm, ich meine klug agieren. Rennt man einfach un\u00fcberlegt in den n\u00e4chsten Raum, so startet man wieder bei einer der vielen Speicherstationen und muss den Weg  bis zum Todespunkt wieder erneut gehen. \nJe nachdem wie viel Zeit man in das Sammeln investiert, betr\u00e4gt die Spielzeit 6-14 Stunden. Nach dem ersten Durchgang warten der Speedrun-Modus und der Hard-Modus darauf, getestet und durch gespielt zu werden. Wer alle Errungenschaften ergattern will, der ist mit ca. 15-20 Stunden dabei. \n\n\n[b] Fazit: [/b]\n\nAxiom Verge geh\u00f6rt zu den wenigen Titeln, die sich den Zusatz Metroidvania verdient haben. Wer Super Metroid und Konsorten klasse fand, wird hier nicht entt\u00e4uscht werden und voll auf seine Kosten kommen. Der Preis ist f\u00fcr Axiom Verge geht auch in Ordnung, aber nur wenn man wirklich alles finden m\u00f6chte. Im Sale kostete Axiom unter 10 \u20ac und das ist es auf jeden Fall wert! \nVom mir gibt es eine klar Empfehlung f\u00fcr AxiomVerge! \n\n[b]Doch Achtung![/b] Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist auf einem anderen Level, als heutige Spiele, soll hei\u00dfen, einfach durchrennen und abschlie\u00dfen geht hier nicht. Wer nur bedingt frustresistent ist, legt bestimmt den Controller nach dem 2ten oder 3ten Boss aus der Hand.  \n\nGeschrieben am 18.12.2016\n\nShadow, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LegionSchatten] Legion DS [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1482056855, "timestamp_updated": 1482063390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473205", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28430308": {"recommendationid": "28430308", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971877162", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 196, "playtime_forever": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483117204}, "language": "english", "review": "Axiom Verge can easily be seen as THE Metroid clone, but that is a good thing.

No que sea mal juego, pero se encuentra menos apetecible sus horas finales que por decir tira a la borda el concepto tras los jefes y sus estrategias.

Axiom Verge hits that right on the head - each and every area has its own unique (and very well made) visuals, soundtrack and enemies. Finding and exploring each of the diverse and colourful worlds was one of my favourite parts of this game.\n\nThe progression of this game is great. you will come upon something, play around with it for a bit, then realise you can't do anything with it and move on. Later, you will come across an item and think, \"maybe I can use this to get past that thing I found earlier.\" You can backtrack to past areas and find find optional stat upgrades and notes, whick give you some backstory.\n\nThe story is presented very well - the further you progress, the more is revealed is revealed about the protagonist, the antagonist, the \"Rusalki\" race, and why and how you are in the strange world of the game. However, the story is, at its core, pretty straightforward.\n\nThe combat of this game is nothing to really write home about, but it isn't really terrible either. the enemy design is nice and varied and balanced for the most part, but combat can sometimes feel a bit clunky, especially against faster melee enemies.\nThe bosses are quite the same - they're challenging enough, but they're all quite unoriginally designed and pretty forgettable.\n\nBut overall, Axiom Verge is an absolutely phenomenal game, and I don't think it got the recognition it deserved, especially being developed by a single man.

Some reviews are so effusive that you'd think it was even better than its obvious inspiration, Metroid. Looking at Metacritic, the PS4 version is only sitting at 84, and it's definitely better than that. So let's dive in, shall we?\n\nFirst of all, I don't want to hit much in the way of the story. What's here is pretty minimalisitic, and very intriguing, but in the end it doesn't feel like there's much of a resolution to anything. It's left ambiguous, probably intentionally. I don't know if there might be a sequel coming down the pike or not, but the story is certainly rife for exploring more. And finishing the game either under the 4-hour mark or getting 80%+ on items and map coverage leaves you with a scene that's decidedly cliffhanger-ish. I intentionally avoided almost all information about the game until I finished it the first time. The only thing I looked up was how many weapons there were. If you don't want to read about all the powerups and weapons, avert your eyes now!\n\nYeah, there are a bunch of those. You have a ridiculous array of death-dealing instruments. And the more you explore, the more you're going to find. The default weapon is very much base Metroid. You can get a triple shot, reflecting shot, the Kilver which is a short-range shotgun-style weapon, standard stuff like that, but there's some oddball weapons, too. The Voranj sends lightning blasts out in a huge pattern, but is weak. The lightning gun is crazy overpowered, locking on to an enemy and continuously hitting until they're dead. There's a weapon that feels distinctly like a multi-directional Diskarmor from Rygar. One particularly devious bit of puzzling will see you snag a Flamethrower, and that thing is really powerful in certain areas. There are 23 weapons in total, although three of them are super-secret weapons that you can only find in glitched secret worlds, and there is only one of them generated per save file. I ended up with the Heat Seeker, a really powerful homing shot that is actually even more powerful than the lightning gun.\n\nThere are also many powerups for your weapons, and for traversal methods. You can snag range, size, and power upgrades for your weapons, although sometimes they don't apply to certain ones. You'll also find the standard health upgrades. Then there are the cool ways to get around. Sure, you get some standard stuff like the high jump, and you get a drill that takes the place of bombs. But eventually, you'll get some more interesting stuff like a lab coat that lets you \"glitch\" through walls. This will upgrade a few times through the game. You also have a glitch gun that can affect the environment and enemies. It's certainly an interesting conceit, because a few puzzles rely on glitching enemies to achieve your goals, and it also lends to a sort of \"is this really happening\" vibe.\n\nSmall gaps are also fun. We all know about Samus' ability to roll up for small passages. Well, Trace can't do that. Instead, he gets a remote drone that he can use to navigate the passages. Eventually, you'll get the ability to throw that further, which also pairs with one of the last abilities, being able to warp to where the drone is. Wild stuff, that. There's also a shout-out to Bionic Commando with a biological-looking grappling hook, and the physics behave almost just like the NES game. Cool stuff!\n\nI like a lot of the look of the game, but some of it bothers me as well. The game clearly shoots for a sort of biological horror / H.R. Giger-style look, and it largely succeeds. My only real gripe is that while the game is tile-based, it looks too tile-based. A lot of platformers attempt to hide this a little better, including Metroid, and this one doesn't do that quite as well. It's still solid, though, because the alien vibe is always there, the creatures are monstrous and well-designed, and everything just feels... wrong, but in the way that the designer intended. That couples with the soundtrack, a thumping, pulsing, heavy-bass score that goes really well with the sort of biological/mechanical motif.\n\nWith all those weapons, you'd think combat was great, and eventually it gets there, but enemies feel very bullet-spongey early on, especially if you haven't explored well and gotten a few weapon powerups. This gets better, but the game overall feels a bit more combat-focused than a Super Metroid, where atmosphere is king and most enemies are felled pretty rapidly. This game feels much more like if Super Metroid had held quite a bit closer to the original game than it did.\n\nI mentioned the secret glitched worlds earlier, and those are pretty slick, too. You'll always find two powerups in them. You'll know you're close to one when the screen starts to get a strong CRT scanline effect with some distortion. Apparently the location of these is randomized from game to game, and the layouts are as well. No drill-wall secrets, though, so just get your stuff and get out!\n\nOverall, I really, really enjoyed my time with the game. I know a game has its hooks in when the first thing I want to do when I get home is play the game, so this totally succeeds on that front. If you've got a strong hankering for a Metroid game, and you've blown through AM2R, this is a worthy competitor. Play it. You may love it more than I did.  It doesn't dethrone Super Metroid or Metroid: Zero Mission, but it's certainly quality entertainment, and stronger than most Metroid-likes out there.", "timestamp_created": 1481321508, "timestamp_updated": 1481321508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718510", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28253894": {"recommendationid": "28253894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007847377", "num_games_owned": 581, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481207737}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a nice game made by someone who obviously knew NES games very well.

The weapons have a good variety of behaviors.\n\nThe art has a distinct style to it, which is understandable from only one developer worked on this.\n\nThe universe has a lot of room for development and I would love to see more.\n\nNegatives:\nThe world does not flow in a very organic or progressive way. The areas have little sense of connection, and although one or two weapons are useful for opening areas, this quickly goes out the window. The game plays a lot closer to Metroid II (the very linear Gameboy version) compared to a newer Metroidvania game, for most of the game. Only at the end where one is getting the last few skills or items do you need more than what was immediately made available or have to go to a previous part of the map to advance the game.\n\nThe world is very tight, which is the most important aspect of what the game does poorly. It's all action all the time, with very little of the map being relevant story-wise, and very little of the story coming out in the gameplay or environment. Never during play did I think \"I really like this room/level\" because it was beautiful or the way it fit the moment. Additionally, there's usually only a few new enemies per area or less, and these will be what you see in that area. After a while the game gets into re-coloring a few enemies, which is a little jarring because they're seemingly only used for some obnoxious difficulty in certain locations/battles.\n\nThe story at first was very interesting, but it doesn't get developed beyond an absolute minimum required to make the game go through a handful of plot points. There's also some glaring plotholes, like somehow you're in a computer environment (hacking and glitching) but also on an alien planet, and in a decayed civilization, and it just doesn't come together. Only at the very end does the final location mostly make sense given the plot. The lack of coherency between the world, story, and gameplay is the biggest problem with Axiom Verge.\n\nThe controls could've used a little work. The grapple mechanic is hilariously bad. I was really surprised at how poorly it controls given the author borrowing so heavily from Metroid. The grapple is pretty quickly superceded so it's not that bad, but it stands out the most. The weapon quick-select is also confusing, and the weirdness of how it behaves disrupts the combat considering how many guns you can get. The controller seems to have some deadzone (maybe 15%) but the lack of the option can make dashing and menu controls difficult with analog joysticks.\n\nOn the guns, there's not much of a difference between them in practice. Most enemies move too erratically to be fought by some weapons, and a number of the guns have pitiful range or pitiful damage, both of which gets you killed. Eventually you get upgrades for both range and damage, but this just makes the \"useful\" guns even better. Combat is pretty boring too, with enemies never being stunnable or blockable, having no weapon-specific behavior, etc, so it just comes down to spamming enough bullets. Many of the later enemies just dive right at you with near-unavoidable hits. The glitching helps make this more interesting, but late-game you end up just taking damage if you want to glitch (it takes time and might only slow them down), or take damage if you run straight in, so there's not much of a benefit.\n\nOn the art, most of the art time went seems like it went into the backgrounds, and not enough on enemies. The world has have plenty of art, which could've been used in more rooms, and even something like rotating tiles would stretched out the existing art. More enemies! What I would've given for just more space with more enemies. All the enemies even have only a few frames of animation, so it's not like more would've been that problematic. The art itself is more of a NES/GBC feel than SNES/GBA, and the visual crowding in a lot of places detracts from the detail and what could've been a simplicity of art.\n\nLate game-item hunting is a pain, because some items are hid behind foreground and you can't tell where anything is. Games used to get around this by having some hint-mechanic (noises, x-ray), and it's annoying Axiom Verge didn't inherit that.\n\n\nOverall:\nFor a game from a single developer, Axiom Verge is amazing. It brings some new mechanics to the table for other platformers to play with and take hints from. While the gameplay shines, the story and feeling of the game suffer immensely. I would absolutely only recommend it if you really really like the basic mechanics of Metroidvania games, because mechanics are all it does well.", "timestamp_created": 1480830434, "timestamp_updated": 1480830434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28172944": {"recommendationid": "28172944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184081933", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480810346}, "language": "english", "review": "Axiom Verge is the Metroid we were all excited for and was promised, but never got.", "timestamp_created": 1480810516, "timestamp_updated": 1480810516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28170666": {"recommendationid": "28170666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124546980", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504461761}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego muy bueno, lo he disfrutado mucho y ha sido un buen primer vistazo al g\u00e9nero. 100% recomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1480801439, "timestamp_updated": 1480801439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28170507": {"recommendationid": "28170507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001195210", "num_games_owned": 580, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480558311}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply put, this was the best Metroid-like game I have played in years.

One of the best Metroidvanias I've ever played. This game is a love letter to Nintendo and to Super Metroid. It has all the elements that made that game great: exploration, a broad range of weapons, power-ups, and upgrades (a LOT more than most Metroid-inspired games have, too!). Some of the upgrades are similar to a few of the Castlevania games, where you have to collect five or six pieces to complete the upgrade to your health, power, etc.\n\nMuch like many Metroidvania games, there is a lot of exploration and backtracking. Unfortunately, unlike most of these kinds of games, there are no teleportation devices (like the ones in Castlevania games from Symphony of the Night onward). --At least none that I've found yet. I'm a good ways into the game, haven't finished it yet, but if I find any, I will update this review.-- Fortunately, most of the areas are interconnected and fairly easy to get to. It can get a bit tedious, but a lot of times you'll find more upgrades and items on the way, so that's a plus.\n\nThe difficulty is just right. Just what you'd expect from a retro-style game, quite challenging, but in this case, a tad forgiving. Death only means you get sent back to the previous save room, and you don't lose any items or upgrades you've found. Also, you can save at any time, technically, though you will start back at the last save room you used. This can work in your favor, and save you time in backtracking. And another great feature is that save rooms are often right next to a boss room, and that is fortuitous because many enemies are vicious, and the game almost \"punishes\" you for bad gameplay. Enemies will make quick mincemeat of you if you are not vigilant and careful, and enemies are EVERYWHERE. Remember how some rooms/areas in Super Metroid only had a dozen or so scattered throughout (some only had half that!)? Well, expect to see a crapload of enemies in this game. Everything is out to kill you, and kill you they will. Same goes for bosses. Which is why there's save rooms so close to boss rooms.\n\nAs far as the items, weaponry, etc, there is a lot of them, as I mentioned. Some will remind you of the games that inspired Mr. Happ as he created this game, while many are quite original. There's a few that will destroy certain obstacles, pass through walls, swing around much like Samus does with the grapple, and even change enemy behavior! Bosses will prove to be quite a challenge, as some weapons can do more damage, while sometimes only a specific one will be able to hit a boss's \"weak spot.\" And as I mentioned before, you will die, A LOT, until you learn an enemy's patterns and attacks.\n\nAnd let me tell you about the music.... oh, man. The music is pure chiptune goodness. I never really cared for chiptunes, to be honest, though I do love the old Castlevania and Metroid tunes, but preferably arranged (Sound in Action, anyone?). However, this soundtrack really pulls you in, with its dark, brooding themes and wonderful variations.\n\nSo far, I've got about 7-8 hours clocked on my current save, taking my time with this game, and thoroughly enjoying it. I highly recommend this game if you love Metroidvanias, or just want a great challenge. Axiom Verge has it all: fun gameplay, awesome visuals, a great storyline, and lots of challenging fights and puzzles. For the price of the game, it's a great value. And if you're looking for replayability, there's a speedrun mode as well, which challenges you to complete the game as quickly as possible while gathering all of the items.

Yes, that's right, creator is singular! A single individual, Thomas Happ, created all the art, music, story, dialogue, code, and all the other miscellaneous required elements of a game. While I don't think that's something that can be factored into a review necessarily, I will say that I find that incredibly impressive. I find myself inspired!\n\nIf you enjoyed Super Metroid, you would probably find this a lot of fun. The mechanics are similar in terms of movement, exploration, and progression. It's a truly solid 2d side-scrolling platformer.\n\n[h1]Synopsis[/h1]\nThe game opens to a small sequence featuring a scientist performing an experiment. Something goes wrong, and the building they're in collapses. This scientist is revealed to be the player, as the focus shifts to the same man awakening in an alien room, having been enclosed in an egg-like machine. A voice speaks out to you from an unknown origin, and it names you: \"Trace\".\n\nAfter some initial dialogue, the game sets you loose to complete your initial objectives and get yourself comfortable with how the game operates. As you complete your objectives and explore the dangerous paths from point to point, you'll reveal more about the strangely organic alien world. Are the machines biological, or is the life here machine-based? What are the implications of some of the characters' appearances and motivations? It will be revealed to you in time, as you fight your way through a hostile planet to find your purpose here.\n\n[h1]Movement & Controls[/h1]\nThe movement of your player is vitally important in a game like this. You need to be able to interface very strongly with the game to accurately control your player and the weapon(s) they may be using to interact with the environment and fight the aggressively hostile enemies. Patience is a virtue here, as with other games like Super Metroid, where being brazen and reckless will result in your quick death. Watching how your foes move and respond and predicting their actions will benefit you greatly.\n\nThe controls themselves are simple, and very responsive. Once you understand the functions of the inputs, you can often use them to their full potential immediately.\n\n[h1]Game Mechanics & Progression[/h1]\nThe progression in this game comes in the form of items and weapons, which I'll refer to jointly as 'tools'. These tools will help you remove enemies blocking your path, eliminate obstacles in your way, and create new weaknesses in the environment and foes for you to exploit more easily. You're offered large areas to explore, but there is one correct route that will yield you a new tool. This new tool will demonstrate its utility to you immediately, and you'll remember an area you thought was impassable. It may no longer be!\n\nThe first time I played this game, I found it performed exceedingly well at surprising me with new mobility upgrades. I had been mentally noting locations that I might be able to come back to with new tools, but some of the tools so fundamentally changed how I navigate the environments that I was caught by surprise several times and needed to revisit some areas to see if there was a new path present. There often was.\n\n[h1]Environments, Sound & Music[/h1]\nThe environment created by the developer in this game is excellent. Each zone has a unique feel to it, matching its purpose in the game world, and each room within has a carefully designed atmosphere within the zone.\n\nThe fact that it was all made by a single person becomes clear over time, as the thematic elements of each zone become unified in the music, tile art, and background art alike. The soundtrack immediately became one of my favorite game soundtracks in recent history, particularly the songs that play when [spoiler]you enter the 'temple' area[/spoiler] and [spoiler]in the final climb to the boss[/spoiler]. I'm listening to the soundtrack now, actually! And not just because I'm writing this review :)\n\nIf you, like me, are prone to getting tunnel vision in games like this, where you hyper-focus on the mechanical elements and grow somewhat blind to the actual audiovisual elements presented... I highly encourage you to periodically 'stop and smell the roses' by listening to the music and examining the background art in some of the rooms as you move about. It's worth it!\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nAxiom Verge is mechanically challenging. Even on its lower difficulty settings, bosses are not a trivial matter. But, this game is in no way unfair! I find that the distinction between fairness and difficulty is an incredibly important one to make, and while this game may be difficult, it is not unfair. You always have the ability to analyse an enemy and find its weakness. You always have the ability to be patient and careful in your movement to evade incoming attacks. I find that I'm sometimes an impatient gamer, and most of the times I died while fighting enemies in this game, it was purely due to my recklessness, or my greed demanding I take another few shots at the boss before it enters its firing phase.\n\nThis game has difficulty options present when you start the game. I almost universally select 'Normal' and enjoy a single playthrough at the 'average' difficulty, so I don't drown out the story or environmental elements with the mechanical complexity in a game. After I finished my 'Normal' playthrough of Axiom Verge, though, I immediately went again for a 'Hard' run. I had enjoyed exploring the environment so much in 'Normal' that I had obtained 100% of the tools available. I tried going through in 'Hard' while getting as few tools as possible, and it was a significant challenge initially. I later felt like I had an excellent mastery of the controls as a result.\n\n[h1]Performance & Technical Aspects[/h1]\nTechnically, this game is very solid. I experienced no obvious instances of the game malfunctioning or causing me to lose progress or resources by failure of the medium. Pretty much all errors were mine.\n\nI wish to make a special note about this game that may be considered a spoiler. I'll enclose it in spoiler tags here for you to look at later. If you find the game may be malfunctioning in some way or are concerned that your computer is not running it properly, [spoiler]you should be made aware of the fact that it may be intentional. This game will present several effects to the player that seem like traditional glitches or malfunctions in video games, but they are intentionally presented in this game. Unless they're directly impacting your ability to play the game, please persist and see if you can discover what's going on![/spoiler]\n\nPerformance-wise, I had no problems running it. It's a very graphically simple game with no 3D elements to speak of, as I can recall. I think any relatively modern non-gaming computer could probably run this game with no trouble.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis has to be one of my favorite games in my collection. I really enjoyed playing through it not once, but twice, and experiencing the challenges it offered. I thought it was difficult initially, but grew much easier over time as I got used to the play style and the controls.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anybody who had fun with Super Metroid or similar games (Cave Story might apply!). I'm incredibly impressed with Thomas Happ, and very glad he decided to put his time and effort into this experience.

While many games have spawned from the platforming exploration genre it defined, few have been as true and accurate of a love letter as Axiom Verge. This is not to say that Axiom Verge is a rip-off. Not by any means! If anything, it's a tribute that knows exactly what made Metroid great, and pays homage to those elements.\n\nThe title starts in typical fashion with an extremely large (and unforgiving) world/map that you can only access scraps of, at the game's beginning. Each navigation item acquired opens up more of the map, until eventually the player feels like a space ninja, with nothing out of their reach or bounds.\n\nOn the topic of navigation and exploration, Axiom Verge is much more true to its roots than many recent titles in the genre. There's no color coded doors or blocks. When you get an item that expands your ability to traverse the landscape, it's on YOU (the player) to figure out or remember where said item can be applied. While this can result in a bit of frustration and backtracking, I found it to feel a lot more satisfying.\n\nAs for other factors: \n* The graphics are great (Pixel art, but with very intricate and detailed designs)\n* Music is phenomenal (the game does a great job of capturing the feeling of isolation and an alien environment through the insturment choice and composition.)\n* The story was really enjoyable for me (A lot of things are left unresolved, but done so tastefully as to keep the player thinking about it long after beating the game. Lots of great worldbuilding, and plenty of room for a hopeful sequel.)\n* Gameplay in general is also great. (Fairly fast paced, good flow of enemy and platforming difficulty, with some real fun boss fights)\n\nThe best way I can really put it is that Axiom Verge is quite frankly the best \"Metroid\" game to come out in quite some time. (Not Metroidvania, Metroid. Thomas Happ is doing the genre better than Nintendo themselves at this point.)

This could have been mitigated with a fast travel system or something but constant aimless navigation gets old fast, and the game is much worse for it (you'll get sick of the fantastic music first).

Instead, your character grows stronger and more versatile by finding tools, weapons and health upgrades scattered around the world, both in plain sight and hidden in the levels. The game is similar to Super Metroid in length, with Axiom Verge taking around 12 hours to beat on my first playthrough.\n\nThe game does a good job introducing a number of new weapons and tools that only make it more efficient to kill your enemies, but also make it faster to travel around the world. Some of these are inspired by Metroid (a small drone you can remote control) while others are a bit more interesting (a gun that can \"glitch\" enemies, causing their graphics to go nuts,  become vulnerable or start destroying their surroundings, among other effects). There is a nice line of progression to these powerups, giving them more uses as you progress through the game, allowing you to backtrack and find more secrets. There are a few bosses, ranging from smaller ones to ones that fill out the entire screen, giving them nice variety while giving a nice break from the constant exploration every now and then.\n\nThe game has a story, told with the few cutscenes in the game and log entries you can find scattered in the world. While the story isn't all that groundbreaking, it complements the game's atmosphere without being too overbearing; the game rarely stops your progress with a cutscene and never forces you to go through a certain path or arbitrarily locks places in the game due to not having gotten far enough in the story; the meat of the game is gameplay, and the narrative is really a secondary element rather than the main course.\n\nIf there is something to criticize here, it's that the regions in the game aren't as memorable as in other similar games, even if the H.R. Giger inspired graphics aren't bad at all.\n\nIf you've had an itch for a Metroid game, pick this game up.

You should get it if you liked those.\n\nWow, where do I even begin? I installed this to see how it was. Here I am, 13 hours later and I binged it. Played it in two 6-ish hour sittings because I couldn't stop for anything but falling asleep. There's a lot to talk about with this game, both good and bad.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThis is the meat and potatoes of the game. This is what's going to keep you occupied for most of the time, so it's important that this works well. It does. I've found very few situations where I was annoyed or bored with the game. The shooting feels great and suitably difficult and kept fresh by the insane variety of weapons and tools at your disposal. I particularly enjoy that each weapon more or less seem to have a specific playstyle and enemy type in mind, which keeps you varying up as the game goes along. There were a few I simply didn't find useful at all, being the Nova (which you get very early), [spoiler]Firewall[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Multi Disruptor[/spoiler]. The only thing that stood out to me was the grappling hook. Yes, I'm spoiling that because the grappling hook exists in every Metroid game ever, so it's not a big deal. It doesn't act like other grappling hooks and that threw me off a lot and it took me about an hour of gameplay to get used to how it works and its quirks. \n\n[h1]Enemy variety and difficulty[/h1]\nEnemy variety is good, although you keep crossing back through several areas multiple times, and this is where enemies can become very familiar after a while. There's also not really that many different types of enemies. You have wall crawlers, static sentries, chasing sentries and different kinds of flyers. But their art style, sound and attacks keep them from becoming stale regardless.\n\nBosses are suitably huge and while the first boss is a real pansy, they quickly become trickier and trickier to the point where you sometimes completely fail to understand how to beat it until you've tried different tactics. \n\nEnemies are suitably difficult and as you ramp up in power with new weapons and strength, so do the enemies. I found that towards the very end of the game enemies became really difficult and I found myself dying a couple of times to certain rooms. This can frustrate some players, but I found it to be enough to simply press on. The game also allows you tools to explore ahead of you and deal with dangerous threats without really putting yourself in danger, on occasion. It's however incredibly easy to forget you have these tools.\n\n[h1]Exploration[/h1]\nI have rarely found a game that compels me to explore so much as this game. While the storyline is fairly straight forward in where you need to go and what to do, this opens up later in the game, but I never felt I was stuck wondering what to do. I always knew almost exactly where to go next to progress the story, and when I didn't feel like doing that or I got a new tool I felt the urge to go back to older areas and explore and see what new areas I could visit with the help of the new tools. It's absolutely awesome in that regard. It rewards exploration greatly. My only complaint would be that some puzzles were perhaps just a little bit [b]too[/b] obtuse, requiring me to really use my head. When a game makes me take out my notebook and start deciphering messages, it's a good game.\n\n[h1]Tools and abilities[/h1]\nI won't spoil any specific abilities you get in the game as I felt they were an incredibly refreshing array of abilities that I quite frankly haven't seen much in this kind of game. Usually what you get is the basic double jump and perhaps a dash and that's it. This game allows you to explore and manipulate the environment in such a way that you quite often forget just how much freedom you really have, and get stuck on a simple puzzle because you forgot you had this awesome ability that would let you pass this obstacle, because other games wouldn't have let you do that. It's definitely one of the games' great strengths, and also perhaps a weakness. Because, as I said, more than once I ran around lost because I forgot that the game allowed me to do things other games wouldn't and therefor I didn't think of them.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThis is a matter of taste. Some people can't stand the SNES style graphics and I respect that. However, I found them to work excellently for this game, and overall I found most areas to be distinct and creative, matching with its enemies. I have nothing to complain about here. Everything looks crips and colorful and effects are nice and easy to digest.\n\n[h1]Sound and music[/h1]\nSounds were very distinct and I could quickly learn what meant what, which is a good thing from these types of games. Usually sounds can be confusing, but I found every sound to be familiar after a while, which meant new sounds stood out and made me stop and wonder what that was. Music was really great and I liked almost every track with few exceptions. It has a chiptuney electronic soundtrack that fits the graphics style and the dark story perfectly.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nI grew up with the IBM 5150 and later the NES as my go to computer and console gaming as a child, so perhaps my expectations on a story are somewhat lower than others. Back then most games had a throwaway story, fitting on one page of the manual. It was all about the gameplay. This game surprised me with having a very Flashback-y style story with dialogue and I was really surprised to find myself being drawn in and wanting to know more. The world is simple, but crafted very well and the story is really very basic once you've seen it all. But the way the story is told keeps you guessing and wondering. On more than one occasion I admit to have been \"mind blown\" over how the story progressed. In spite of it being so it was still easy to follow and it really kept me wanting more. \n\n[h1]Settings[/h1]\nThe game has fullscreen and windowed mode, as well as graphics scaling to allow you leeway in the size of the window, should you go for windowed mode. Sound and music have separate sliders. Controls are rebindable for both controller and keyboard. The game allows you to use either a list or a selection wheel for weapons.\n\n[h1]Length and conclusion[/h1]\nThe game took about 13 hours from beginning to end from me and that was with a lot of exploration and running lost looking for secrets (yes there are secrets). I can easily see someone spending 20 hours on a single playthrough with sufficient exploration. But looking back at it I could probably have rushed through the main story in 4-6 hours if I wanted to. It's a great testament to the game that it kept me engrossed for so long in spite of being comparatively short. \n\nI heartily recommend this game to anyone who likes weird, dark, sci-fi stories and platformers of old. It's not an easy game, nor is it forgiving. The puzzles take some real thought and it will put your platforming skills to test. But it's a great little game and when I see it was developed by a single man I am more than impressed.", "timestamp_created": 1475338586, "timestamp_updated": 1475366746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620036", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25780759": {"recommendationid": "25780759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054649113", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473145715}, "language": "english", "review": "Metroid is an Axiom verge clone.", "timestamp_created": 1475239485, "timestamp_updated": 1475239485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25777683": {"recommendationid": "25777683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186389322", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475291556}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0432 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u044b\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0433\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u044d\u044f)\n\u0412 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043f\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u0411\u0435\u0437 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e)", "timestamp_created": 1475219798, "timestamp_updated": 1475219798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25770907": {"recommendationid": "25770907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005400406", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477444921}, "language": "english", "review": "The Metroid series may be dead, but its spirit lives on, and nowhere is that spirit stronger than in Axiom Verge.

Players with incredible attention to detail will enjoy the way items are hidden. The way some secrets are concealed can be incredibly harsh, but if you discover them, it'll feel even more rewarding for overcoming the challenge.\n\nEven though I felt like I was excruciatingly thorough, I do not feel cheated by the secrets that I missed, and I am glad that they are used so cleverly. I guess to criticize it, some of the solutions felt very rare or like surprise one-offs that added to their sense of excessive difficulty.\n\nThe game itself is not actually punishing however, and while many of the guns are cool to discover and, agreeing with the developer, provide life-blood to exploration through very fun rewards... Most of the discovered guns are far from required for completing the game. Upgrades that improve your general abilities, such as damage per shot and max health are hidden as well. \n\nAgain, this is an exploration game as well as an action game! \n\nSome of the easier to find weapons are placed in map areas that seem to suggest a Zelda-inspired(whoops) approach to game mechanics, where the area will often contain a wepaon that seems to be designed specifically to defeat a nearby boss. This isn't *always* the rule, and all of the bosses can be defeated in a wide variety of means. That really adds a lot to ... letting the player approach combat in creative ways.\n\nThe story is pretty good as well, and I won't talk too in-depth about its details, but it manages to weave its narrative in with its artwork and mechanics very well! The digital effects, the subversive effects in a not-quite-16bit world, and the biomechanical all work well together to give the game an alien atmosphere.\n\nThe music is enjoyable, too. Loads of synth. Probably my favorite track is the title music. It gave the correct first impression that it was a very electronic, oppressive atmosphere, but that you'd be READY for it.\n\nMy complaints with the game are minor. \n\nSound design only fails with hitting invulnerable armor. The sound effect stacks loudly.\n\nThere is a small issue with not having enough tools to identify whether or not you missed secrets regardless of the reminder system (you place waypoints on map regions that persist until replaced) because it's possible to miss secrets that are in plain sight by tiles that may not respond to the tools you had 2 hours ago. That doesn't happen very frequently, it should be noted, and most of the secrets can still be discovered by being thorough, and being gated by map access (blank spots in the map mark obvious ways to continue exploring as you upgrade).\nAnd again: The secrets I missed were ingeniously hidden.\n\nAlso there's a speedrun mode and a silly reference to Metroid if you're into that sort of thing.

Its been 30yrs since the original Metroid, and with Nintendo not seeming to want to appeal to fans and give them a proper game, I dont see how you can pass this one up.\n\nIts your classic 8-bit side scrolling style. Shoot first, ask questions later. Which you will by the way, the story is very good. Some people would say \"Its a little to chatty\", I would disagree, or say to you that everything is there for a reason and that forms the story that the developers are trying to tell.\n\nAll of the weapons are very interesting, each one with its own unique abilities and altarnite fire. As you progress through the game and unlock more weapons and abilities you are able to backtrack and access areas that were previously cut off.\n\nI have to say also, the bosses in this game look amazing! The colore detail and art style of each boss looks awesome. So when you enter a boss fight, you really take the time to look them over and apriciate the hard work that went into designing this game.\n\nOne final note: The music to this game is gold!

It can be unforgiving at times with a few of the bosses, but other than that, it's a pretty decently-balanced game.  It's nice because, if you're not strong enough, most times you can go back and get out of an area and power-up some more.  I have played through the game in full, and I definitely feel that if you're into 8bit or retro-style gaming, you'll enjoy this one and get your money's worth.  \n\nSo if you like Metroid, a game which this is most-like, do pick this one up.

His response was something along the lines of, \u201cIt's Metroid...\u201d He was partially correct.  The striking likeness to the acclaimed Nintendo series is what I initially found attractive.  At the time I even recall hearing that it was an outright clone.  It turns out this is mostly false.  Super Cyborg is closer to what I might call a clone (and that's not necessarily a bad thing).  Although its influences are obvious, Axiom Verge still brings a lot of originality to the table.\n\nThe game follows Trace through his adventure on Sudra.  Once the seat of an advanced civilization, the planet is now mostly overrun by flora and fauna.  Perilously close to the planet exists a spacial anomaly of sorts called the Breach.  Due to Sudra's proximity to the Breach, parts of the world are less stable than others.  This lack of stability, or perhaps corruption would be a better word, ends up playing a major part in several game mechanics.  As you explore the world you (may) encounter the many notes that are scattered about.  They function as one of the prime ways the story is conveyed, the other main way being dialogue.  There is surprisingly detailed story here, but the game makes very little effort to spoon-feed it to you.  It's easy to miss out on large chunks of lore if you don't spend significant time exploring.\n\nWhile searching the map you're also likely to find some of the many weapons, upgrades, tools, and other secrets.  One of the more innovative items is the Address Disruptor.  It allows you to corrupt enemies and de-corrupt parts of the map.  Glitching has several different effects on enemies.  Sometimes they become less hazardous, other times they perform beneficial actions, and occasionally they take on characteristics of a different enemy type.  It is a cool concept that I don't recall having seen in other games.  There are a staggering number of weapons, so many in fact that I probably barely used half of them.  Most of them are pretty cool, but some are certainly easier to use than others. While the game does feature a quick swap option, the ability to omit weapons entirely from the weapons wheel would have been nice.\n\nAlthough I only extensively used a little more than a handful of weapons, I imagine that on a planned run certain guns may be especially handy due to their proximity to your route through the game.  There is a speedrun mode, and I'm sure that players interested in that will be able to find sequence breaks and boss quick kills.  Aside from scouring the map for every item, this is where most of the replay value will come from.  There are achievements for beating the game under a certain time and finishing with under a certain percentage of items. It's all very reminiscent of the sort of challenge runs I remember people trying in Super Metroid.  I found some of the boss battles to be a little simplistic,  and couldn't help but wonder if this was an intentional design choice to make things faster for people running the game.  If nothing else, they're very impressive visually.\n\nSeveral of the bosses are gargantuan, not unlike the regions of Sudra in which they reside.  All of the areas feel different from each other and very alien.  There are a few rooms in particular that appear to be there specifically to give the player an idea of the scope of this place.  It's clear a significant amount of time and effort went into creating every aspect of this world.  I doubt it actually abides to NES technical and color limitations (this is probably for the best), but it certainly managed to give me a hefty dose of nostalgia.  The majority of the soundtrack is good, and I especially enjoyed the track \u201cTrace Rising.\u201d  However there was one song (\u201cInexorable\u201d is the title) that I disliked so much that after hearing it a few times I wanted to mute my speakers while traveling in that region.  The song's vocal sample quickly became grating.\n\nDespite a few flaws, Axiom Verge is a fun ride.  As the credits rolled I was reminded of something remarkable, this game was developed entirely by Thomas Happ.  He has created a solid and memorable game that pays tributes to his inspirations while still remaining original enough to stand on its own.  I've heard he might expand the franchise and I really hope he does as I'd definitely like to revisit it.  I'd recommend this game to fans of 2D Metroid titles, and people that enjoy exploration.  Don't go into it expecting it to be a clone though, because it's different in more than a few ways.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review?

Imagine isso h\u00e1 anos sendo pedido. Agora coloque o nome do jogo de Metroid, e da desenvolvedora de Nintendo. Axiom Verge \u00e9 um jogo com inspira\u00e7\u00f5es extremas de Metroid, al\u00e9m de ser, \u00e9 claro, metroidvania, ele \u00e9, e parece muito com o Super Metroid. \nUma coisa muito interessante \u00e9 que  Axion Verge foi feito por apenas uma pessoa, Tom Happ fez as m\u00fasicas, gr\u00e1ficos e desenvolveu tudo sozinho.\n\nO cientista chamado Trace e seu companheiro, Hammond, est\u00e3o fazendo um tipo de experimento nas montanhas do novo M\u00e9xico em 2005. Algo d\u00e1 errado e uma explos\u00e3o acontece, desmoronando todo o laborat\u00f3rio. Trace acorda em um lugar estranho, e uma voz o guia por esse lugar, onde ele vai descobrir v\u00e1rios segredos.\n\nAxion Verge tem um enredo muito bom, uma hist\u00f3ria ci-fi com pontos, e at\u00e9 plottwist interessantes. \u00c9 o tipo de hist\u00f3ria que n\u00e3o \u00e9 previs\u00edvel e desperta o interesse, fazendo voc\u00ea se perguntar: o que est\u00e1 acontecendo? Porque? Como? \n\nComo um metroidvania que se preze, h\u00e1 muitos lugares secretos com equipamentos de tiro diferentes, ou powerups que aumenta sa\u00fade, poder de tiro e alcance do mesmo. S\u00e3o v\u00e1rios equipamentos de tiro. \nOutros equipamentos que tem (efeito passivo) s\u00e3o os tipos: pulo maior, um drone que o jogador controla com o intuito de entrar em lugares menores, entre outros que tem a afinidade de prosseguir no game, como uma roupa nova que faz o jogador atravessar paredes finas. \n\nOutra coisa que tamb\u00e9m fica escondido s\u00e3o os arquivos de leitura, que explica (ou confunde) mais o enredo do game. Alguns desses arquivos est\u00e3o em outras l\u00ednguas, como a Sudra, que \u00e9 uma l\u00edngua de outro planeta. Para conseguir ler esses arquivos, algum outro arquivo escondido ter\u00e1 um c\u00f3digo para colocar em uma tela espec\u00edfica no menu de pause, ao colocar, ele vai automaticamente traduzir esses arquivos em l\u00edngua alien\u00edgena. \n\nGraficamente \u00e9 muito bonito, pixelart 2d muito bem feito.\nA trilha sonora \u00e9 fant\u00e1stica, toda original, um eletr\u00f4nico com melodias tristes, bem estil\u00e3o ci-fi e cyberpunk, n\u00e3o sou f\u00e3 de eletr\u00f4nico, mas gosto quando esse tipo de m\u00fasica e inserida de um jeito bem feito, com o contexto da hist\u00f3ria, tanto em filmes como em jogos. Um bom exemplo de trilha sonora inserida com sucesso \u00e9 do Half life 2, que \u00e9 sensacional e usa esse estilo de m\u00fasica tamb\u00e9m. As trilhas que mais gostei de Axiom Verge foi o do cen\u00e1rio Ukkin-Na [Amnesia] e do Kur [Inexorable], totalmente viciante.\n\nA dificuldade, pelo menos no dif\u00edcil (onde comecei a jogar) \u00e9 bem alta, morri diversas vezes. Alguns bosses s\u00e3o dif\u00edceis e outros bem f\u00e1ceis, no todo \u00e9 um jogo que voc\u00ea vai morrer bastante (pelo menos no modo dif\u00edcil), n\u00e3o sei dizer algo sobre o modo normal por n\u00e3o ter jogado, acredito que n\u00e3o seja algo muito complicado. \n\nEu demorei, segundo o profile do jogo, 20 horas, mas na steam eu s\u00f3 tenho 12 horas jogadas. Fiquei um tempo sem internet na \u00e9poca que eu estava jogando, talvez o steam n\u00e3o conta o tempo do jogo quando est\u00e1 off-line, n\u00e3o sei dizer.

Axiom Verge is probably the most successful indie Metroid style game outside ofCave Story.

Hard isn't terribly difficult, but there are some very cheap enemy placement and unfair-ish boss battles. There is an acheievement for not dying, but I find damage unavaoidable in many spots of the game.\n\nThe game is unique enough on it's own, interms of it's art style, soundtrack and item pickups. You'd probably expect the typical Double/Super Jumps, Morphball/Crawl powerup, Super bomb and flight upgrades, but many of the power ups are JUST different enough to be unique, even if the function is similar to most Metroidvania games. By the end of the game, I had too many weapons and it feels like Thomas Happ had to \"fill in secret spots with items\" and instead should have had some weapons be upgraded. It is as if he had fun making different weapon types and putting them in the game, versus thinking what should actually be in the game.\n\nThe story is also unique in comparison to Metroid, but I'm not convinced it's satisfying.

The way I see it, if you're going to pay homage to the best, you may as well go all out, and do it right. And on that front, Axiom Verge does not disappoint.

You can't ask for much else. I enjoyed the exploration, item collecting, boss battles, story, and the overall atmosphere of the game. My only small gripes have to do with the way a couple of the game mechanics work (or rather, don\u2019t work) - specifically, the grapple tool and the dash/teleport ability were way too finicky and/or inconsistent to pull off, for my tastes. I'll concede that part of the issue is probably that I used the control stick on the controller rather than the D-pad for primary movement, which makes those abilities harder to reliably pull off, but in my opinion, that should have been accounted for as part of the design. In particular, the dash/teleport ability just didn\u2019t work consistently enough for me, and made a few parts of the game extremely frustrating. But other than that, I really can't think of any other complaints. \n\nAll in all, this is about as good a game as one could possibly hope for in the classic Metroid style. It's a game I could/would have probably made myself, if I weren't too old and lazy now (or, like, had no job or family).

I used a 360 controller and had no problems. Don't know how other controllers will do.\n\nAnd CHECK THIS OUT: One of my peeves in games is when you have to read/watch an intro to a boss everytime you die/go back to fight it and have to read/watch it again, over and over and over and it drives me freakin nuts! This was done smart and right. Only watch it once, if you die, you don't have to see it again and again and again....this is huge and deserves game design praise!!!!\n\nThis pulls big time influences from the classic NES Metroid and SNES Super Metroid. Sometimes its too obvious (doors, Norfair-esque terrain, destructive runs/screw attack-ish). I think there were probably more elements from other games as well. Because the game is still very unique and fun, the unoriginal elements didn't bother me and was kinda funny. Perhaps to pay homage to other games as well; there is a weapon that reminds me of Rygar. \n\nOther than that, if you like 2D games, I highly recommend.

The game is a bit slow to get going, so I may as well address negatives first.\n\n\n-\tMovement initially stiff/not for sequence breaking\nIt takes a while before you so much as get high jump boots and prior to that, there\u2019s nothing like dashing or means of navigating small spaces, so it feels as if you\u2019re stuck running around a giant maze.  The movement isn\u2019t rigid in the way that Castlevania III is, but there\u2019s not much you can do to adjust your y-axis level for quite some time.  The multitude of walls and barriers subsequently ensure that you\u2019re never in a spot the developer doesn\u2019t want you to be in before you\u2019re supposed to get there. \n\n-\tGame feels like it was made in phases\nThe initial few settings you\u2019re involved in\u2026 well, despite the fact that you\u2019re dealing with a formerly inhabited planet gone to semi-ruin, it\u2019s hard to tell what purpose any of the environments served.  Some appear to have functions.  Others do not.  Additionally, the initial music tracks are a bit more chiptuney, culminating in a track in lower Kur with digitized singing that is not only bad, but doesn\u2019t make sense in context of the caves you\u2019re running around at present.\n\n-\tPasscode system because passcode system\nThe game wanted to consciously make the \u201cJUSTIN BAILEY\u201d nod, and well, okay, but the passcodes are not well-integrated other than to get you the capacity to read a few notes in translation/flesh out the lore or later jimmy open a few hidden passages, which you\u2019d have to backtrack to and then seek out to find.  The rewards are worth it, but the reality is that after the game has been out and people have found the locations, it boils down to \u201cfind location, punch in code, grab item, forget you have the code system again.\u201d\n\n-\tStory exists in fits and starts\nThis is either a plus or a minus.  Do you really care about a story?  Well, Axiom Verge is really trying to have a story here, with a bunch of potential interdimensional and/or time travel and ethical questions and morally ambiguous characters.  The trouble is that the story is usually used as a denouement in either reading the notes or immediately following a boss battle.  Despite the fact that you have the Ruskali stationed at various intervals throughout the planet and they\u2019re your NPC helpers, you can\u2019t really interact with them and you may go through periods of just poking your head in to see what they\u2019re up to and getting no reaction at all.  Kind of a bummer.  As for the story itself, it\u2019s trying to be deep and convoluted and while it\u2019s nothing too extraordinary, it seems to be well-executed enough, if you\u2019re thinking that specific slip-ups are intentional or could be made to be intentional.\n\nIt's a lot to complain about at the outset and I wasn\u2019t initially a fan, but it does get better and more playable.\n\n+ Pretty darned good soundtrack!\n\u201cCellular Skies,\u201d which plays in the overworld portion of Kur, might be one of my favorite tracks I\u2019ve heard in a game in a while and from there, all the new regions have good, atmospheric tacks that are complementary of the overall atmosphere.  In particular, the Edin track, \u201cPhosphene,\u201d is very subdued and fits a backdrop where you can see open plains dotted by bits and pieces of ruined alien architecture.\n\n+ WEEPONS!\nAxiom really goes all out with the weapon selection for a shooty game.  If you\u2019re comparing it to Metroid, you may be disappointed by the inability to combine weapons, but most of them have their own utilities and strategies and there are a bunch of them that one could conceivably use regularly during the game, discounting the fact that one is waaaaay better than the others and some, like the Firewall and Reversible Slicer, are unlikely to have any great functionality.\n\n+ Glitch Gun!\nIt\u2019s a sort of doofy method of changing enemy behaviors and opening up blocked off passages, but the Glitch Gun is pretty fun to use and handles well enough, along with having some interesting results.  I think that it makes the game a bit easy in stretches when you can get enemies to puke up health restoration.  I also don\u2019t really get how you\u2019re causing flora and fauna to trip out by shooting bio-mechanical whatsits at them, but whatever.\n\n+ Drone Travel!\nMidway through the game, Trace gets the ability to spit up a wee bitty squid that he can then use to navigate small spaces and fight enemies.  It's a plus over the \"how does this work\" morph ball of Metroid fame that, in Prime, led to countless space pirates getting mangled in confused attempts to replicate it. Your squid can shoot lasers and fight dudes and as you fill out your upgrades, it's finally possible to teleport to its location and go through silly processes to gain infinite height.

Level designs felt fresh and intuitive, rarely caused a sense of being directionless, and had many 'visual leads' that hinted at uses for later upgrades.\n\nPuzzles were clever and made intuitive use of the game's unique mechanics, though some lategame puzzles were almost too obscure to be solved through anything but serendipity. (Often involving the use of the Address Disruptor on enemies, which sometimes have less-than-obvious effects while glitched.)\n\nTools and upgrades offered a decidedly cerebral approach to Metroid-like platforming while avoiding the common power spike that renders later challenges pointless. However, I got the impression that the endgame was lacking at least one more upgrade to mobility to aid in backtracking, such as a Speed Booster. (There were many long, straight hallways I was expecting to be used with one.)\n\nWeapon variety was impressive, but the majority of the choices lacked a niche or purpose, or were completely outmoded by even some of the earlygame options. It would have been interesting to see more weapon-specific puzzles as were demonstrated in the first area of the game, or at least retooling the selections to have slightly fewer weapons with more useful applications.\n\nBosses often felt either underwhelming or frustrating, as most of them had a simplistic pattern with an unusual hitbox and loads of health. There was one boss (Gir-Tab) where the hitbox was placed behind the enemy entirely, while the front was completely invulnerable to shots. The only weapons I had that could reach that far were the Nova, which felt woefully underpowered, and the Voranj, which could only randomly hit that area. The sheer amount of shots it took to take down the boss was frustrating, and I'd died at least 14 times before then thanks to the discrepancy in firepower at that point in the game.\n\nThe writing definitely kept me hooked, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it made up for what initially seemed to be an unfitting protagonist in an alien world. The foreboding hints at Athetos' history and the enigmatic nature of the Rusalki did leave me wanting more character development, or perhaps even an alternate ending considering there were some optional fights / interactions at key points in the game.\n\nOverall, Axiom Verge is a wonderful take on the fairly small non-linear platforming genre that had me constantly going back to play more with few little nags. The game bleeds passion and attention to detail, especially in the lavish SNES-style spritework that paves every part of the game as a harrowing, but beautiful alien world.

There's also a lot that's fresh and original aboutit, despite being a retro platformer firmly rooted in a lot of older gaming traditions. The music (while I couldn't really get into most apart from one track) is distinctive and well written, and there are a lot of powerups and mechanics that give an interesting dimension to the gameplay that are rarely seen in other games.\n\nHowever, this is a two-edged sword. There is a bewildering number of weapons to find, each with it's own well thought out mechanic, but unfortunately most of them are entirely useless.\n\nAnother thing that is worth pointing out is the story. It seems a lot of people praise this game for that aspect, but I really don't think it's a strong point of the game. Yes, it has its share of reveals and little twists, but so do M Night Shyamalan movies and they are still mostly horrible.\nI just didn't find myself investing in it at all, and for all its bluster about alternate dimensions and technology and the nature of reality (which already wasn't new when the Matrix did it 17 years ago), it really doesn't have anything interesting to say. Now, I don't think the quality of a game necessarily rests on the story (there have been plenty of good games without good stories), but don't automatically buy in to the idea that this game has a particularly good one.\n\nMy last minor gripe is that I think the game is just a shade too long for the first play-through.

Unepic was ok, but kinda boring, La Mulana was good but I didn't have the patience for it, Ori and the blind forest I had technical issues with (hoping for the definitive version to fix that), but there is one game that beats them all. Axiom Verge is the game I was looking for. I [b] haven't [/b] beaten it yet, so please consider this more of a first impression than a full review.\n\nIt is the right ammout mix of great graphics, fluent gameplay, haunting story and an awesome soundtrack. All done by a [b] single person [/b]. When I found out about that I was blown away.\n\nIf you've played games like Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the night, you'll be instantly familiar with this game, because it follows the same exact formula. As you explore the world you find health and damage powerups to make your life easier and also unlock new guns and abilities. which grant you access to the next area. There are a ton of weapons, some more practical than others, some better against certain types of enemies. Interestingly most of the bosses I've encountered so far (with the exception of one) can be beaten by your basic gun.\n\nYou'll also make use of all of your abilities to find secrets, which range from a basic notes detailing the world to hidden powerups and weapons. They usually aren't too hard to spot, but there are some, which are quite tricky. But because the secrets are tied to certain game mechanic also means you'll have to do a lot of backtracking in order to find everything. There is no fast travel of any description, which is a little annoying. But then again, this is completely optional.\n\nThe bosses are giant hunks of biomass and steel, which all have clear pattern you can take advantage off. The only \"problem\" with that is that they generally get faster as they take damage, which turns every encounter into an intense battle. While the boss encounters can be hard, they're never unfair, in fact they're quite the opposite. Not to mention the music is so good, that I didn't care I died, it simply meant I coul listen to it a little bit longer.\n\nWhile Axiom Verge borrows from other games (Contra, Metroid, Castlevania, Bionic Commando, etc.), it also has it's own original ideas. The ability to \"glitch\" the enemies, effectively crippling them, or turning them into floating platforms/ health generators is unique, fun and incredibly useful. [b] Intentional glitches [/b], I have to say, this is the most inovative game mechanic I've seen in years.\n\nThis game is also quite heavily story driven for a metroidvania game, if you're into sci-fi, you'll enjoy it. And if you're here only for the gameplay, you'll enjoy it as well.\n\nThere is also built-in speedrun mode, which is just that. It bypasses all the custcenes and slaps a timer on the screen. \n\nSo far I haven't encountered any bugs, so good job there. One ability could use some little tweaking though. Later in the game you'll acquire the abiliy to dash through thin walls using the D-pad or the left stick. I use the left stick for movement and I've noticed that sometimes Trace dashes on his own while I'm moving the stick. Normally it's only supposed to happen if you rock the stick twice in the direction you want to go, but I swear it happened when I simply touched it. I hope it makes at least a little bit of sense, explaining controls is always the hardest part.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is incredible especially if you consider the fact that it's a single person project.

Indeed every element feels familiar, however he has managed to put surprising twists on the formula. Each power up is a joy to discover and play with. \n\nLevel design is varied and interesting.

Il paragone con Metroid \u00e8 evidentissimo ma Axiom Verge \u00e8 un gioco cos\u00ec ben ispirato che non pu\u00f2 essere chiamato un clone; le idee di base sono state ampiamente modificate e rielaborate a tal punto di poter parlare di un opera a se stante, originale e fresca. \n\nOvviamente la similitudine e il richiamo a Metroid \u00e8 lapalissiana: scenari oscuri e dispersivi abitati da una civilt\u00e0 (quasi) perduta, creature aliene voraci, oggetti e abilit\u00e0 da collezionare... praticamente in questo \u00e8 identico! Per\u00f2 la cosa pi\u00f9 bella di questo gioco \u00e8 forse una caratteristica che persino Metroid, il campione degli action/platformer, non pu\u00f2 vantare di avere. Nell'atmosfera del gioco, oltre l'aroma classico di questi giochi, si respira molto l'aria di un survival horror. Certo, le munizioni sono infinite, ma molto spesso, quando si incontra un nuovo nemico (molto spesso per la prima volta) si ha sempre paura di restarci secco anche perch\u00e8 non tutti i nemici rilasciano energia, specialmente quelli pi\u00f9 deboli! \u00e8 una continua lotta per la sopravvivenza e dunque vi garantisco che se giocherete a questo gioco state certi che morirete tante, tante volte e questo \u00e8 un fattore veramente positivo! Inoltre il personaggio non da assolutamente l'aria di essere un duro \u00e8 il suo andare in giro solamente con una maglietta e dei pantaloni non lo rende affatto invincibile al contrario dell'armatura di Samus. Ancora di degnissima nota sono appunto le note presenti nel gioco che, una volta collezionate (e persino tradotte!) tutte potranno dare una visione pi\u00f9 completa della trama e di cosa \u00e8 accaduto al pianeta Sudran. La grafica \u00e8 veramente spettacolare, molto creativo il desegn generale, le ambientazioni e soprattutto originalissimi i boss. La mappa \u00e8 ci\u00f2 che ci si pu\u00f2 aspettare da un metroidvania che si rispetti: ampia, labirintica e con mille segreti. La musica \u00e8 veramente fra le migliori mai viste: \u00e8 come se i Kraftwerk, i Frakie Goes To Hollywood, i Depeche Mode, Aphex Twin del periodo ambient e Shakti stessero tutti facendo lo stesso incubo contemporaneamente! Ascoltare per credere! Come ogni buon Metroidvania che si rispetti Axiom Verge continua anche dopo averlo completato, le estensioni dei power-up non sono mai abbastanza e inoltre c'\u00e8 anche una bellissima variet\u00e0 di mondi nascosti dove tutto appare come un televisore a tubo catodico (!??!) e con tanti bug grafici. Bellissima anche la storia \u00e8 i personaggi tutti, una vera e propria sorpresa che si estende piano piano e non sempre, soprattutto se non stiamo attenti alle note, possiamo capire tutto al 100%.\n\nAxiom Verge non \u00e8 solo un (evidente) tributo ad una delle serie videoludiche pi\u00f9 importanti della storia, \u00e8 un gioco che eccelle nel suo genere e spazza la concorrenza come se niente fosse.

As the player navigates the alien world, you discover and slowly piece together a very strange and cryptic story that may or may not make sense at its conclusion.

This is a running theme of the game where experimentation creates both interesting items, weapons, or bosses while also creating trainwrecks.\n\nLevel design is mediocre at best, the surroundings and environment more lending to a surreal world. It is fairly easy to get lost without spending time making sure you are going the right way, and inconsistency plagues the game's design. Sometimes, the game forces you to use an item or movement ability on something that, before then, simply didn't work but does in that room. In one specific time, it even works on only part of the room despite there being other sections that are identical!\n\nDifficulty tends to run in a feast or famine situation: Early on you have a fairly smooth curve but entering a new area often ends with you getting destroyed. Death can be used as a shortcut and is also part and parcel of a speedrun. Bosses are likewise hit or miss, serving more as puzzles than challenges, though some bosses can be a bit esoteric in terms of their gameplay or strategy. \n\nAll in all, Axiom Verge may not be a perfect game, but it's a unique and interesting one. If you look past its flaws, you can get a great sci fi experience and a story that will leave you thinking deeply. If you're afraid of complex designs (or just feel like you may get disoriented from the truly alien feel of the game), feel free to skip it, but watch a let's play.", "timestamp_created": 1467603318, "timestamp_updated": 1467603318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24062810": {"recommendationid": "24062810", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967582007", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467583447}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredible Sci-Fi throwback to the super nintendo.

Do you like good Storytelling? Eerie Atmosphere? Yes, yes and yes? Then you [i]may[/i] like Axiom Verge because it offers at least the Metroid'y parts you like and love. The game handles just like Samus on SNES, the upgrade and exploration system is quite similar while adding little interesting knacks to the powerups and their usage.\n\nAxiom Verge is trying hard to be a homage to Metroid while struggling to define its own identity. The graphics have that distinct NES flair, even turning flickering and glitches into a smartly implemented mechanic. However the design overall more often than not looks bland and samey, alterated only by monotonous color schemes that quickly turn boring to the Samus-spoiled eye. \n\nThe soundtrack has its moments, driving the dark sci-fi shivers up your spine in rare moments. However there are also the flaws: sound assets and music parts are often unfitting, sometimes plain annoying to the ear. Music often appeared as very unfitting to the sceneries shown, taking me out of the immersion. The story offers great potential, but falls flat on its face during the later parts of the game. Boss fights look interesting at first glance, but quickly devolve into a \"find the ideal position and fire away\" fest. \n\nIn short: For every bit of light there are quite a lot of shadows lurking in the corner.\n\nOverall Axiom Verge has some great ideas, but the \"wow\" moments are rarely spread. There's a huge load of backtracking involved and secrets are often discovered by hard trial and error instead of smart hints. The gameplay is overall fluid, without major flaws and the character controls are as tight as can be. Axiom Verge gives you 10-15h of \"good\" content to chew on, depending on your expertise within the genre.  If you're in desperate need for a \"Metroid'y\" game, give it a shot.

Although this description is certainly true when glancing at the game's surface, it is misleading as to what this game is truly about. Axiom Verge is about the atmosphere of the world rather than depth of gameplay.\n\nAxiom Verge was created entirely by a single man. That man has done a phenomenal job on the aesthetics of the game. But just beneath the veneer of beautiful pixel artwork and retro techno music lies a game that falls short to deliver a challenging and ultimately satisfying experience. \n\nMost of the game's enemies are pushovers that do not have the numbers or intelligence to pose a serious threat. The only time that they become dangerous is when the player gets impatient and tries to rush through a particular section of the game. In addition, the boss fights are completely repetitive once you understand the boss's weakness, requiring very little  thought or skill. All of this amounts to a game in which the player's responses to new areas of the map are more or less the same. \n\nThe story is shallow and trite. The developer of this game should not be writing for anything, let alone a video game. I wager that he could have paid any amateur with a modicum of hobby writing experience to flesh out a skeleton storyboard and they could have come up with something better. Some reviewers have said that the story is interesting. While the setting may be interesting, the writing and overrall narrative structure is cliche at best and just plain bad at worst. \n\nAll of that said, the artwork and atmosphere are still quite beautiful. That alone justifies at least a 5-15$ price tag depending on how much that means to you. Indeed, I myself originally bought this game for the artwork and was not disappointed on that front. \n\nIn essence, Axiom Verge is an atmospheric Metroidvania-style 2-D sidescrolling shooter with good artworkand smooth gameplay mechanics that could have used significant input from a more seasoned game designer.", "timestamp_created": 1466989097, "timestamp_updated": 1466989537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23846492": {"recommendationid": "23846492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043549843", "num_games_owned": 536, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476942664}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a perfect spiritual successor to Metroid, modernized, made grittier and less comfortable.

High quality 2D retro graphics and on point music take you on a journey on this strange world, a fantastic mix of organic and cybernetic that made me constanstly wonder on the true nature of my surroundings. There are a lot of creative ideas and the game is challenging enough even for Metroidvania fans: you can see all the love for the genre poured in this game.\n\nThere are a couple of downsides though: there are too many secrets... Don't get me wrong, I know it's the point of the Metroidvania genre, but I feel like Axiom Verge takes it to an extreme. Normally there are a majority of easy to guess secrets and a certain number of secrets that are a real pain to find. In Axiom Verge, there are way too many secrets that are a real pain to find. I'm all about thinking outside the box, but sometimes I found items for dumb luck and even then, despite being an avid collector, I scored a 72% on my first run: too many way to interact with the surroundings, too many things to check, too frustratring in the end. Combined with no way to fast travel (a running power-up or a teleport between areas), it discouraged me from aiming to 100%. Going back to the roots of the genre it's cool, but I think you can take a couple of pages from modern games too: Metroid Fusion marks the rooms with items to find, but even then you have to struggle to get it.

You start out weak with no abilities. As you progress you pick up health, damage increasers, projectile size and distance increasers, unique weapons, and of course various abilities. Unlike Metroid weapons don't do anything except let you kill enemies; you open up new paths purely with your abilities.\n\nAbilities include a drone that lets you get through those tiny places because Trace can't crawl for some reason (it's ok because the drone is sweet). A drill that lets you break blocks to find hidden areas. Coats that let you \"glitch\" through walls. A glitch gun that changes the properties of enemies, making them easier to kill and sometimes becoming the key to solve a puzzle and getting a powerup. And more!\n\nThere's over a dozen weapons in the game, all with unique ways to kill enemies. The only problem is some weapons are clearly superior, and others are so bad you'll never use them.\n\nThe enemies are fairly unique, and satisfyingly explode into little pixels when you destroy them. The bosses are also challenging and fun. You almost never feel like the game is cheating, but instead that you just haven't figured out a good strategy.\n\nThe sound effects and especially music are top notch.\n\nThe world is large with many secrets. There are even Secret Worlds you can find that give you extra powerups. The game will likely take you 10-12 hours to beat on your first playthrough. There's also a hard mode and a speedrun mode to add more playability and challenge.\n\nI do have a couple complaints though. The story is very confusing. Even after beating the game and reading all the notes I'm still not sure what was going on. It's ok though because a game like this the story isn't important. My last complaint is that powerup locations don't appear on your map. In all 2d Metroid games with a map, there's a circle on a map section to show there's an item there, and it becomes a dot when you find it. No such thing here. But there is a yellow dot in the upper right if you've found all items for that map, and a purple dot if you've uncovered all parts of that map.\n\nIf you love the Metroid games you are all but guaranteed to love this game too.

While the gadgts are well balanced, and extremely cool in their use, the weapons I found lackluster due to balancing.\n\nGadgets - You will be introduced to a slew of gadgets to help Trace get across the world of Axiom, from zipping thorugh walls, to controlling a drone that will later on help you reach sections that were accessible due to Trace's size.\n\nWeapons- Weapons offer a huge variety, but very few of them really offer anything good, which presents the issue of Quantity of Quality. I feel that less weapons with improved power would be a better focus here, as many of the weapons shown, are cool, but highly ineffective, since their capabilities generally do not mess well during combat, and the reduce damage some weapons make, keep them on the unselected list, which by the end of the game, your having to quickly run through the weapon ring becomes a minor hastle, not game breaking.\n\n+Level Design+\nI enjoyed the level design that this game offered, various locations had their own unique feel and generally included their own flora and fauna. Though the maps may feel large at times, and one wishes they could teleport from save egg to save egg, overall, these various locals offer enough of a distinct atmosphere as to push Trace onward.\n\n+Plot+\nOh yes, the plot of this game is phenomenal, and it does push you, as the player, to find all the key notes to help explain what is going on. As you begin to unlock answers, it may make you doubt who the real hero and villains are. Combined with the alien landscape, the story and Trace's interactions with the Rasalki are both interesting, and at times, heart pounding as you wonder why thigns are the way they are.\n\n+Music & Sound+\nThe Music from location to location is varied, and unique, helping to define the many areas that you travel through. It harkens back to the days of Genesis and SNES sound tracks, with limited room for instruments, thus forcing the composer to work in a creative twist to make each track memorable.\nThe Sound design of creatures, weapons, and enemies are good, clear, and not obnoxiously loud or annoying, and I give it to their sound designer for creating good clear audio that fit the weapons, creature, and ambience of the world.\n\n+Final Thoughts+\n\nI highly recommended this game, I've played through it a few times, and like Metroid, it can be beaten fairly quickly once you have the locations and the rhythm down.\nWith a story that makes so many questions a challenge to find answers to, the end left me wanting a sequel, and as old as this game maybe, I certainly would play a sequel to continue on the adventure of Trace and the world of Axiom.\n\nI hope many of you found this review informative, without crossing into spoilers, and that you give this game a chance, you'll find it worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1465747012, "timestamp_updated": 1465747012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23514206": {"recommendationid": "23514206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051709302", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490733060}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game if you enjoy Metroid-like.", "timestamp_created": 1465705865, "timestamp_updated": 1465705903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23512881": {"recommendationid": "23512881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072006918", "num_games_owned": 883, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451527047}, "language": "english", "review": "Let's face it: we'll probably never see another proper metroidvania in either Metroid or Castlevania series. Koji Igarashi is taking care of the latter right now, working on his much anticipated Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. As for the former -- here it is, the Metroid we were wating for, made by one person.\nAxiom Verge follows the genre formula to a T, dropping the player into a vast world, full of interconnected rooms with a plethora of weapons and upgrades to find, monsters and bosses to kill and secrets to uncover. It somehow also manages to be innovative, introducing some unconventional weapons and mechanics, the most prominent being the glitch gun. The SciFi story is somewhat nonsensical, but the world it takes place in and the characters it makes you meet are memorably eery -- a dead planet inhabited by several AIs in form of colossal severed female heads that would make H.

We have plenty of those. But Axiom Verge is a cut above. It is a quality title and unlike many others in the genre, AV takes most of its inspiration from the original Metroid from the NES. In fact, it almost feels like spiritual successor of both Metroid.\n\nYou step in to the shoes of Trace, a scientist who awakes in a mesmerizingly desolate world after apparently dying in a laboratory explosion. The plot of AV is Trace finding out the strange truth behind the world he's arrived in, the creatures that reside there, and what happened to him in that explosion.\n\nThe presentation of AV is a knock-out. Everything from graphics, the character designs, the sound, the music, the plot, and even the carefully-picked dialogue comes together to build this eldritch, dreamlike journey through the world of Sudra. The moment-to-moment action is already quite engaging and responsive but having that extra element of atmosphere just heightens the play and makes Axiom Verge a very captivating experience.\n\nThis game gives you many upgrades to find (many of them secret) and they are always satisfying to procure. There are more than 20 guns for the player to use including a special \u201cGlitch gun\u201d that has unique wild effects on each of the world's enemies. You are welcomed and encouraged to experiment with all of Trace's arsenal and chances are you'll be surprised with how fun some of these weapons can be.\n\nThere is a flaw to this game and it's hard to put one's finger on. Exploring this psychedelic world should be a little bit more exciting. Maybe its the backtracking or maybe the world just doesn't have enough detail in its design, but moving through the world isn't as fun as the more critical moments in the game. Dare I say, it can be boring.\n\nHowever, overall this is a recommended game. It takes many appropriate lessons from the classics of genre and is put together so well that it will likely be considered a classic in the coming years.

Axiom Verge is a Metroid-like game that is designed SOLELY by one person, Thomas Happ. For me Axiom Verge is one of the best games I've played during 2015. Where to start? the gameplay is very good and fluid, the atmosphere is enthralling, the music is very captivating, and the story is very intriguing and fresh.\n\nIn Axiom verge, you play as a scientist who becomes involved in a bizzare science experiment and wakes up in an alien environment. This premise is very similar to Another World, but the moment the game starts you realize you are in a totally different game both in gameplay and tone. All of the game mechanics, including dying and respawning is explained in story which increases the immersiveness of the game considerably. As the game progresses, the story becomes more and more bizzare. In order to understand the storyline, you have to collect a lot of hidden items throughout the game world.\n\nOne major weak point of the game is the fact that after mid-game, you are left alone with very little direction to go in a huge game world. Since the Indiebox package I got included a full game world map I had little problem where to go, but without such a map I can understand the game requires A LOT of trial and error and backtracking. Also, one of the last upgrades you receive near the end of the game is operated hard by keyboard compared to a gamepad.\n\nPros:\n - Very well written and intriguing storyline\n - Fluid gameplay with a lot of different mechanics\n - Extremely good visuals\n - Amazing soundtrack!!!\n - Tons of hidden materials that increases the replayability of the game\n\nCons:\n - Without a guide or a map, finding where to go becomes a very hard task after mid-game\n - Some late game mechanics work much better with a gamepad and doesn't work as fluid with a keyboard.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1464643292, "timestamp_updated": 1464643292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23295435": {"recommendationid": "23295435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049282559", "num_games_owned": 819, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496091479}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor Metroid desde Super Metroid, largo complejo, lleno e secretos y con una historia que sinceramente me ha gustado un mont\u00f3n, \u00bfRecomendado?

The graphics are tile-based and done in a stylish faux-8-bit fashion which causes things to look alien and abstract, creating an eerie atmosphere that draws you in from the start. The backgrounds are more detailed and often beautiful in their own right as well, however the cutscene art is less impressive looking with human characters looking weirdly off-model. The music is all well done and chiptune in style, with each zone having a unique and memorable soundtrack that further establishes an otherworldly alien atmosphere. \n\nGameplay is very tight and responsive, Trace, the player character controls very well and there are a TON of collectibles to find: health expansions, weapon upgrades for range and projectile size, and -19- different weapons plus a secret weapon to find. There's also a large variety of unique tricks to Axiom Verge such as a mechanized drone that you can swap places with, a \"glitch\" gun that solves puzzles, reveals secrets, and alters enemy behaviors, a drill that allows you to break through tiles and explore further areas and a teched out labcoat that lets you phase through solid walls. There's a lot of variety in player ability and makes exploration fun and rewarding.\n\nHowever, for all its neat tricks and secrets, Axiom Verge does fall flat in a few places. First and most notably are the enemies and bosses - while visually many enemies are unique looking and a few have some interesting tricks, most are just fodder and aren't very remarkable. Moreso lacking are the bosses - there are technically 10, but two of them are fake outs which come in the late mid-game, and the final zone alone has 3 boss fights to itself - one of which is skippable. That makes half of the games bosses there, and the other half are largely concentrated in the first 1/3 of the game before you gain the ability to backtrack to previous areas. So in effect, you fight four decently designed bosses before you even really start gaining any good abilities or weapons, then go through a large stretch of the game without any boss fights at all - aside from the two fake outs, theres only one true boss fight in the mid-late game, and then have the last three thrown at you all in the final zone. \n\nIt is a very awkward and honestly grating pace, as the first few bosses can be very difficult with your low item collections at the time, and as stated you can't backtrack to search for more items until these initial bosses are dealt with, then by the time you fight another boss you've likely gotten so many new toys that the remaining ones are pushovers. Axiom Verge just doesn't let you use all the toys it gives you in a very enjoyable way outside of exploring its game world, sadly.\n\nLastly, the game's story is just very lackluster. The atmosphere is fantastic and intriguing, the game world eerie with a backstory hidden behind collectible notes and files of a world that had advanced technology and faced catastrophe.... but little is done with it. The notes only paint a vague image, and the primary supporting cast - H.R. Giger looking creatures called Rusalki - only pitch in the story occasionally. A big deal is made about awakening them from a stasis and repairing them, but once you do nothing really happens with them besides the first one you meet. I know gameplay should be prioritized over story, but story is important too and I feel if Axiom Verge was going to be this minimalist with its plot, perhaps it shouldn't have had one at all, or at least just a very bare bones \"game manual\" plot. As it is, Axiom Verge introduces a lot of cool concepts, characters and visually interesting places but does very little with them, sadly.\n\nThis all said and done, I do reccommend the game. For its flaws, it still plays and sounds and looks beautiful, and is a well designed Metroidvania for the most part. It's a much needed science fiction style Metroidvania and for a game made entirely by one person in his free time, it certainly shines. Also, you can put Trace in a leotard with the legendary Justin Bailey code.

It just isn't as good as what inspired it. It's basically a less fun version of Super Metroid. It gets boring and monotonous pretty quickly.

Some just seem like they have no purpose at all, other than the make the game more difficult. They also seem underpowered, as they rarely stop anything. Some enemies will be all over you instantly while you're blasting away. That's the main thing I found annoying. I found myself avoiding than engaging. \n\n*The enemies. Like I said above, if I could avoid all the enemies I would. Some are all over you in seconds. Others are just plain annoying. I feel as if the weapons are underpowered. \n\n*The flow of the game. One minute you're exploring a new area, the next you're scratching your head. This happens way too often, and you're forced to just go on to the next area. Happens in the next area also, just keep moving forward until you get stuck. This is how SM was also, but in that game it was fun to do so. In this game, it just feels like such a drag to go back to an area with annoying enemies and such. The graphics of this game doesn't help which brings me to...\n\n*The graphics. I think the animations of the main character and for the most part the guns are great. The bosses too, but man, the backgrounds and everything else is too drab. Too much gray and red, really bleak.

"playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465406643}, "language": "english", "review": "People are calling this Metroidvania-style, but I don't think so. This feels way more like a pure Metroid game than anything. Gameplay wise, your character's strength is defined by the items they find; no amount of killing will make you healthier or faster. However, there's a massive amount of weapons that makes fights enjoyable, and exploration tools that open up the world around you, with pickups that increase your health, damage, weapon range and even projectile size, so exploration is well-rewarded. The main issue with this is that a good 20% of the items can only be found with one end-game item, and finding the right areas to plunder can become a massive hassle if you aim for 100%\n\nThe story was intriguing enough to keep me going to the credits. One scene near the midsection played out rather well, with the gameplay changing to match the character's state of mind... somewhat. I'd describe the ending, but I'd rather avoid spoilers so let's say that, on a personal note, I wasn't a fan. However, I liked the game's use of graphical glitches as a gameplay and story element, and was very pleased that the player-character, Trace, doesn't [i]once[/i] remark on how the glitches reminds him of things he saw in a video game he once played. It's all played straight, with mentions of \"artifacts\" and \"The Breach\" being things that affect the world in unnatural ways.\n\nThe game-map is pretty big, or at least it [i]feels[/i] big. There's lots of things to be found, as was mentioned in the first paragraph, and returning to old areas with new tools not only makes exploration fun, but makes killing once-annoying enemies with new weapons all the more fulfilling to one-shot. One of my main gripes with the game (along with what makes me not want to dub it \"Metroidvania\") is that you have no method of warping to places late in the game; your main method of fast travel is to make for the hub-corridor and catch a ride with a local monstrosity. Which is pretty neat in how streamlined it is, but with the way lore is presented, I'm surprised there wasn't a way to get taken to specific save-points around the world. There's also an annoying habit of having secret areas hidden behind blocks that are identical to other blocks, so you'll spend a lot of time hugging walls near the end.\n\nSound is good. Music loops similar to how old PS1 games used MP3 tracks in that they finished the song, then played it again after a moment's silence. I wouldn't call it stuck-in-my-head-for-days memorable, seeing as it's mainly ambience. But the final boss fight is easily the exception, and I'm sure it'll find its way onto playlists here and there. One track ended up grating thanks to either dying and returning to a save point over and over again, or just revisiting said area and slowly losing patience for what started out as a really cool track. As a plus, if you go into low HP values, the game will do the usual \"bdeep-bdeep\" thing, but it's in time with the music, and will slowly dip in volume so that you're not being assaulted by \"[b][i]BDEEP-BDEEP-BDEEP-BDEEP[/i][/b]\" like some annoying \u00a35 alarm clock.\n\nThere's also an optional Speedrun mode that adds a timer and cuts out story and \"randomised\" elements so you can try to beat the game as quickly as possible. It's something I might use, and I'm sure others would be pleased to see it.\n\nI'll add in as a disclaimer that I got the game as a birthday gift so the value of the game is a bit nebulous. But I would easily recommend the game to people with \u00a315 knocking around, if they're a fan of older 2D Metroid games.

I LOVE ELSNOVA ;)\n\nDas Retro Gef\u00fchl ist bei diesem Game einfach am besten ausgepr\u00e4gt. Aber nicht so schrecklich Bunt. \n\nDie Musik wurde besonders angepriesen, die hat mich nicht so geflasht, aber passt Perfekt ins geschehen.\n\nWann kommt denn ein zweiter Teil? Ich brauch mehr davon :)\n\nAhh eins noch. In normal ist das Game recht einfach. Besonders die Bossfight sind nicht so anspruchsvoll. W\u00fcrde es gleich auf schwer probieren. Habs selber noch net getestet. Die Mobs gehen, aber wie gesagt, die Bossfights sind keine gro\u00dfe Herrausforderung. Aber egal...dennoch Nice :)\n\ncu\u00b4s", "timestamp_created": 1461760298, "timestamp_updated": 1461760298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22638622": {"recommendationid": "22638622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000307978", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461628589}, "language": "english", "review": "(tl;dr at bottom)\nVery enjoyable game in the Metroidvania genre. Story was okay, but the exploration was what drove my interest.\n\nThe game was very good at showing you when you could not enter an area, and could clearly tell another item was needed.\n\nUnlike Metroid (in my experience) the game did not require specific weapons to get to different areas, but instead relied on the secondary equipment that had a focus on mobility.\n\nThe second-last boss was surprisingly difficult (and was practically a bullet-hell game compared to the rest). However, some areas that were difficult to get to were quite important. If one was to get stuck I would recommend  looking up a map or guide to find where areas connect.\n\nPlayed on Windows with the Steam Controller (final two bosses completed with Xbox 360 controller).\n\nNOTE: Some difficulty occurred when configuring the Steam controller (playing via Steam Link). It would always recognize the trigger as the trigger even when the config set it to map to a different button. I assume Axiom Verge hooks in at a lower/earlier level than usual. Luckily the game allows for customising controls in-game.\n\nThe Crunch\n========\nPlaytime: 12h22m\nOS: Windows/Steam Link\nInput: Steam Controller, Xbox 360 Controller\n\nPros:\n- lots of weapons (not tied to enemy/damage types, pick what you like)\n- broke the rules with its movement equipment\n- fitting soundtrack\n- lots to do for completionists (I am not though so this is biased)\n\nCons:\n- Surprisingly difficult/different penultimate fight\n- Didn't show how to get to/where the last few areas were very well.", "timestamp_created": 1461629426, "timestamp_updated": 1461629426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22629239": {"recommendationid": "22629239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287836983", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459530649}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed playing this game, it brought back fond memories from when I was younger.

To often we now see \"retro style pixel art nostalgic\" indie games that almost always fall short of the classics they immitate. I have been somewhat disillusioned with indie games in recent years because of this, but axiom verge is different - it doesn't try too hard to strive to compete with the games it takes inspiration from, but humbly suceeds at doing so regardless. The game is very hard to flaw in any way; the artwork, gameplay, sound design, music... the whole game is of exceptionally high quality. I noticd a few very minor bugs, but nothing gamebreaking - but taking into consideration that the game was developed by JUST ONE PERSON, I am astounded at the superb quality of the whole game.

Axiom Verge doesn't hide the fact that it is a love letter, heavily influenced by the classic masterpiece. The game succeeds in many ways. The areas you will traverse are ranged and all have a beautiful, 16 bit scifi theme. The music melts nicely into those environments. There are a range of weapons and upgraded abilities to acquire. Boss fights are challenging without being too challenging and catering only to the obcessive gamer population. \n \nWhere the game falls a little short is in the late game pacing and the story in general. I never really cared for the Keanu Reeves super scientist bro story line. Samus was the strong silent type. I felt this game could have benefited from that model. Late game pacing with no fast travel eventually ended my trip a little prematurely. After hour 8 I ended up just traveling back and forth between distant locals hoping to explore a new piece of the map with a newly found ability. I found myself not enjoying that process or caring much about the story I was involved in so I stopped playing. Too many great games out there with not enough time to play them all to continue on when I'm not in it, just for the sake of beating it.\n\nHowever, if you are in the market for a retro Metroid game for PC, look no further.

The developer of Axiom Verge managed to create a Metroid style game that captures the essense of the Nintendo masterpiece better than anything I've played since the actual Metroid itself. Forget the other \"Metroidvania\" games you find on Steam, this bar none the best of the bunch.\n\nEverything from Maps, Weaponry, Items, Music and level design is a wonderful homage to Metroid, and yet the developer managed to turn this into his own unique game. I couldn't put the controller down, and I was hooked from the first night. My first run took somewhere close to 16 hours becuase I did get stuck quite often, so this game does not hold your hand in the slightest. There are plenty of secrets and some obscure locations and items to find, I suggest a walk-through if you're desperate, but there are some things I was positive I would have never found on my own because of cryptic puzzles and hiding places. \n\nMy only complaint is that some items and areas were hidden pretty well and a little too obscure, and honeslty there were too many weapons and most of them were not worth using. I like the fact that there is variety and people could potentially use a certain weapon the entire game if they wanted to, but there are just so many, and so many of them are junk or far too situational. I mean, there is one weaopn in the game that I literally used once for a certain boss and never touched it again because it had no other practical application beyond that. Kind of a waste.\n\nI also felt that the last section of the game, namely the final two maps you visit, were a little rushed. The final boss is also kind of a let down and I was hoping for much more.\n\nI can't fault the game entirely for the ending and the abundance of (bad, junky, worthless) weapons, because overall this game really does belong in your library if you're a fan of these types of games. I will be playing this again, maybe trying for that speedrun or low item % run, you never know.\n\nI hope the guy that made this game releases a sequel, I really do.", "timestamp_created": 1460181353, "timestamp_updated": 1460181353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22308455": {"recommendationid": "22308455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974823431", "num_games_owned": 442, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460029091}, "language": "english", "review": "Axiom Verge finishes pretty weakly but it's style and surprising twists on nostalgia make it worth the price of admission.", "timestamp_created": 1460155728, "timestamp_updated": 1460155728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22293092": {"recommendationid": "22293092", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996526397", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460069064}, "language": "english", "review": "A great Metroidvania style game, with some unique twists.

I just kept thinking \"The original Metroid did this already\".\n\nThe visuals of this game are quite unattractive and lead me to believe that the developer doesn't really understand pixel art and what makes it appealing.

Power ups to the weapons didn't seem to make any noticeable difference. \n\nTools that you find to progress seemed to be used for one specific instance and then forgotten. There game makes no effort to introduce the tools by giving you various fun things to do. No, they feel like elaborate one off keys.\n\nThe games exploration amounts to spraying every block in the game with each tool you have to see if it opens a secret area. Its time consuming and not particularly fun. It just doesn't seem very clever. Just random.\n\nAudio didn't blow my hair back either and some of the sound effects are just plain bad.\n\nIn closing, If you're like me and don't have much time for gaming, this game doesn't offer much in the way of new or interesting game play. I'd pass on this one in hopes of finding something that's more orignal. If you want nastalgia just play the original Metroid games again.\n\nIf you have all the time in the world to play games I still recommend you pass.

I think the general creepiness of the world feels like the original Metroid, but the controls are more precise like the SNES iteration.  I love that the game never tells you exactly where to go next, this is what's missing in today's action/adventure games (with the notable exception of the Dark Souls series).\n\nThe upgrades that allow you to progress from one area to the next constantly surprised me - I was almost always wrong about what was needed to access a new location.  A few examples: you don't need missiles to open doors, you don't use bombs to blow up weak blocks, you don't roll up into a ball to get through tight spaces, and you don't get a freeze gun to turn enemies into stepping stones.  There were a couple exceptions, but for the most part the developer did an excellent job coming up with new ways to solve these old puzzles.\n\nThe music is some of the best I've heard in gaming, from any time period - dark synths with the occasional bit of creepy chanting.  And the graphics, while a little bland in some of the wall/floor textures and enemy sprite designs, more than make up for any shortcomings with several rooms that are absolutely jaw-dropping.  Many of the weapons also put on a nice light show, and are worth tracking down for this alone.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, most of them are completely optional, and unless you go back and thoroughly explore you won't find half of them.

Unfortunately, it seems that the amazing series isn't worth reviving, which is a sad disappointment to fans of the series, myself included. Even if NIntendo did decide to revive the series, it would most likely be revamped into something that is unlike what we all know and love. So, you ask, how can I relive my childhood memories of searching for hidden items, exploring exotic worlds, fighting bizarre bosses unlike any I've ever seen. Well, look no further. Ladies and Gentlegamers, Axiom Verge is what you've been looking for.\n\nThe series starts you off with an elusive plot that introduces you to your main character, but is vague enough that it keeps you searching for answers for the next several hours of the game. You wake up in a strange egg-like structure, forced to begin making your way around. Despite the fact that it doesn't contian a near-silent protagonist like the classic Metroid games, Axiom Verge still manages to keep you in the dark with it's plot, slowly revealing pieces to you for a mind-blowing finale. The game is chock-full of interesting environments, creatures, and boss-fights that will give you a rush of adrenaline and nostalgia that you haven't probably felt since you beat Metroid Zero Mission a decade ago. \n\nThe best part of all is the replay value. Heck, you'll find yourself searching for all the hidden items and secrets scattered all over the map long after you've beaten the game's final boss. The game has a similar end-game bonus if you manage to get nearly all the items in the game, giving you a secret ending. The world also has several pieces of paper and tablets that reveal parts of the plot that aren't normally obtained during the main gameplay. \n\nMy only major gripe about the game is the keyboard layout. It's unlike any I've ever seen in a game, especially a platformer, and won't have you holding your mouse and your fingers on the WASD keys. For this reason, I highly recommend grabbing a controller if you've got one handy, if not, it takes a little while getting used to the layout, but it's by no means a deal-breaker.\n\nSo, I'm sure you're asking yourself, is this game merely a copy of Metroid? Will I just feel like I'm replaying Super Metroid, except now I'm out twenty bucks? Absolutely not. While Axiom Verge will tingle your nostalgia senses, but it's got it's own wonderfully crafted story and world that stands all on it's own. \n\nIs it worth it? Heck freaking yes.

It had a fantastic story, superb controls, the extensive length and repla ability associated with the Metroid series, and some of the most suspenseful and immersive music that I have ever heard from interactive media.\n\nAxiom verge reminds me of this game in all of the best ways. It has a fantastic soundtrack, a lengthy hour count for being such a small game (took me 11 hours to complete the story mode at ~60% item collection), and visuals that match the old Metroid games perfectly. This is undoubtedly a game for the sake of nostalgia, bringing back the feel and attraction of old Metroid games while adding an entirely unique world and story. It is extremely difficult to believe that so much variety and creativity came from one developer, who managed to create what I must call a masterpiece.\n\nThat being said, there are a few issues I would point out to both the developer and to those who have an interest in playing this game:\n\n- It is extremely challenging, but not always in the best ways: Most of the bosses and enemies are creative, unique, and require some problem solving to defeat that make each new area a pleasure to find. However, some enemies (heavy turrets and a boss you will recognize when you fight it) are simply infuriating, as their patterns make them nearly impossible to skirt or stun using even the best end-game weapons. However, a bit of patience and well-placed fleeing can mitigate this issue.\n\n- There are so...many...guns: This game involves an  upgrade system common to the Metroid series, in which new items unlock new areas by adding some new form of movement that allows the player to access new parts of the map that they passed earlier in past areas. Included amongst these upgrades are a plethora of different weapon types that can be equipped at any time once they are found. However, there are ~30 different weapons, which means that any normal player finds 4 that they like and never use any of the others. This could be interpreted as a positive aspect of the game, adding a large selection to the player, but I prefer a smaller selection of weapons that are individually more useful. This makes the weapon selection much more akin to the tool selection from any LoZ game.\n\n- No instruction or direction whatsoever: Again, this could be interpreted as a positive aspect of the game, forcing the player to search for their objective rather than being pointed in a particular direction and being told to fetch. However, I have found that a small amount of instruction (what you should be doing and a general idea of where to do it) is preferable to no instruction at all, simply because it removes the 1 1/2 hours devoted to backtracking to find that one door that you can open now. In an attempt to help prospective players without directly spoiling anything, I would recommend that players assume that the tools they are given are capable of doing more than what they say, and that no two tools perform exactly the same task (IE some tools may be useful for doing things other than what their explicit instruction text says in-game).\n\nThese are my main concerns with the game, but otherwise I found it extremely enjoyable and unique. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys old 8-bit metroid-vania games and unique science-fiction.", "timestamp_created": 1458195837, "timestamp_updated": 1458195837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501466", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21869610": {"recommendationid": "21869610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087349430", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458134949}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u6240\u8b02\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u7684\u306a\u63a2\u7d22\u578b\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3RPG\u3001\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u4e0d\u6c17\u5473\u306a\u4e16\u754c\u89b3\u3067\u3059\u304c\u9006\u306b\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3060\u3068\u60f3\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u4e16\u4ee3\u306b\u306f\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u8868\u793a\u306e\u30d0\u30b0\u304c\u6f14\u51fa\u3084\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3068\u3057\u3066\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u3066\u3001\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u3078\u306e\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30ea\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u611f\u3058\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3068\u306f\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3082\u53e4\u81ed\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304b\u3068\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3068\u3051\u3057\u3066\u305d\u3093\u306a\u3068\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3057\u3063\u304b\u308a\u3068\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305fUI\u3084\u64cd\u4f5c\u611f\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u6700\u8fd1\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u6bd4\u3079\u3066\u3082\u905c\u8272\u306a\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u7684\u306b\u306f\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3082\u96e3\u3057\u3055\u3088\u308a\u3082\u8b0e\u89e3\u304d\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u9583\u304d\u306e\u307b\u3046\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u304b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u611f\u3058\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4eba\u306b\u306f\u662f\u975e\u904a\u3093\u3067\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1458137529, "timestamp_updated": 1458137529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21863610": {"recommendationid": "21863610", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997888485", "num_games_owned": 461, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451196602}, "language": "english", "review": "In the time I spent playing this game, all I it felt like I was doing was wandering around aimlessly to the right while occasionally fighting bosses.

Aside from excelling in every area, what sets it apart is a compelling intrigue and a wide range of pretty unique mechanisms, which I will do my best not to spoil here.\n\nThe first right note that the game hits is the atmosphere. The visual design might not be everyone's cup of tea (it surely wasn't mine at first), but the somewhat crude colours of this alien world in which you find yourself stranded play their part in creating a deep sense of immersion. The sounds and music are on point, and set the perfect mood for the 12-15 hours you'll probably spend exploring and backtracking across the different areas on a casual playthrough.\n\nThe sense of progression is extremely satisfying throughout the adventure. The level design teases you along the way with a good number of inaccessible areas and/or pickups, which you'll be encouraged to revisit once you've acquired new tech. Aside from lore logs and the usual upgrades (health, range, weapon damage), a good number of the items you will find are inherently specific to [i]Axiom Verge[/i] and will have unique consequences on the gameplay. The movement upgrades really redefine the platforming, and the rather sizeable pool of weapons will leave you with a lot of options when it comes to combat.\n\nThe difficulty balance was just right for me - some of the end-game rooms and bosses are pretty brutal, but exploring and acquiring enough upgrades will make it possible to push through without too much grinding and frustration. With a clear mind and a bit of experience with the genre, finding your way on your own is perfectly possible (and I would deeply recommend doing so, as it is infinitely more satisfying than following a guide). The more hardcore-oriented players will be glad to know about the inclusion of a Hard mode as well as a built-in Speedrun mode, complete with global/split timers, reduced RNG and leaderboards with separate categories (any%, 100%, low%)! Nonetheless, [i]Axiom Verge[/i] is perfectly suited for casual gameplay as well.\n\nDid I mention one person did all of this? Yep. The coding, the art, the level design, the music (!)... all the work of a single man, Tom Happ, who created [i]Axiom Verge[/i] as a personal project in his spare time over the course of five years.

Even the story is interesting, if a bit strange at times.\n\nThe one thing I'll criticize here is the lack of direction the game provides you with.  Even in exploration based games like Castlevania or Legend of Zelda, there are usually SOME hints of where to go and what to do.  I have spent hours searching for my next objective.  Some areas are difficult to traverse, and so it gets frustrating when I can't figure out where I should be!  Note that I enjoy explorative games.

Gameplay is responsive and smooth and there are a lot of guns in the game.

The game doesn't always tell you explicitly where to go so you're gonna have to do some exploring which is rewarding because you find different upgrades all over the maps. \n\nDriving the events of the game is a fascinating scifi story that takes some twists and turns just when you thought that you figured it all out. It left me wanting for more of this universe and it's characters.\n\nMusic is very on point with 8-bit melodies mixed with cavernous, reverby bass drums with a little bit of glitch sounds sprinkled in to create a suitable, catchy alien aural landscape.\n\nThe visuals pay homage to the games of old with 8-bit looking -yet- high resolution sprites. The bosses especially look impressive.

I guess, since I do recommend it to some people, that's a yes.\n\nFor the most part, this game has solid gameplay. The fun and aesthetic of metroid are captured well, and the game has enough hidden treasure and a harsh enough difficulty curve to make 100% completion worth striving for. However, if you want an interesting, compelling, or even intelligible story, I suggest looking somewhere else. The characters are poorly constructed and have personality traits that contradict their actions. Why is it that Trace has no qualms about slaughtering mutants with a flame thrower, but once he's facing a mass murdering psychopath, he suddenly gets gun shy? The whole world is very confusing and the fact that all the characters are hiding things and keeping secrets gives the game a very \"I could tell you, but I won't\" vibe.\n\nAs I said, though, the mechanics are mostly good. Mostly. The main problem with the gameplay is that it is possible to get stuck in area that you are underleveled for. I got trapped in one and had to turn on cheats to stand a chance in it. For the most part this shouldn't be too much of a problem, because it's usually necessary to pick up upgrades or equipment from one area of the game in order to progress, but it can still be an issue.\n\nThis gameplay issue actually exacerbates problems with the story, because the story is already convoluted and all over the place, and is very unclear about its chronology, and the fact that getting to certain areas early can allow you to watch cutscenes out of order makes it even more confusing.\n\nOverall, get it if it's on sale, if you really like metroid, or want a challenging game without much need for story.", "timestamp_created": 1457292801, "timestamp_updated": 1457292801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21669455": {"recommendationid": "21669455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067221842", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483969264}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply put, calling this a metroid clone only does it half justice.\n\nI would call it a masterpiece if it wasn't for one song in the soundtrack, and you'll know it when you hit it.", "timestamp_created": 1457284513, "timestamp_updated": 1457284583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21657123": {"recommendationid": "21657123", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993270833", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512970289}, "language": "english", "review": "Metroid Prime sounds REAL good right now, doesn't it?\n\nRating: 7 out of 10, the game nails the look and feel of the NES age, especially with its atmospheric environment and sound design.

If you are dying for a metroid like game, this is probably it.  \n\nThat said, it's my opinion that a lot of the weapons and the way you use them is pretty weak.  I'm not going to pretend to be an excellent player, but there are some guns that seem to serve little purpose in most fights.  I did, however, find myself switching guns quite a bit to clear trash mobs, and I did not see it as much of a plus.  In general, I would say there are some balance issues, but it isn't trying to be a modern easy to play game, so maybe it's fine the way it is.\n\nI havne't gotten too far in the game, but it was pretty obvious to me that there is no clear progression to the game.  Some games, even metroid, have good pacing, but in this one you can explore quite a bit more than you need to before having to backtrack.. I'm not sure that everyone will have the experience, but I did find myself fighting my way through the same areas multiple times, almost pointlessly.\n\nThere are a lot of good things about this game, like the soundtrack.  It's also a pretty good adaption to the retro castlevania/metroid games.  I would say if you haven't played the old school games that this is based on you should go back and find emulators for them.

It combines elements of Mega Man, Castlevania Symphony of the Night and Super Metroid into a mentally orgasmic experience that I have not fealt in a long time.   This game brings everything to the table that the 80's babies grew up with in terms of gaming.  The controls are tight and intuitive, the weapons and tools are unique and diverse.  You will use everything the game gives you to beat it.  The boss battles are fun and turn into bullet hell battles as you damage the enemy.  Each boss has it's own unique fight involved in beating it and that point brings me to this point.  The game gives you just enough to know how to play but the game itself teaches you how it wants to be played just by playing.  This is something that gaming has been missing all to often lately.  Most games now a days hold your hand with tutorials explainig every single aspect or you get railroaded into a graphic novel with way to deviate and explore.  This game is all about exploring and backtracking.  If you have played many a metroidvania game this will be complete second nature to you.  The assets are clean and retro harkening back to Metroid on the NES, yet are unique to themselves.  The game gives a constant feeling of being alone in an alien atmosphere with the constant feeling of danger.  The enemies will mess your face up if you don't pay attention and employ some fancy footwork.  This game is such an original in the sense of story and music.  Oh the music!

You\u2019ve got your standard expected powerups like high-jump, life expansions, and alternate weapons\u2026 but there\u2019s also a half-dozen powerups that you [i]will never see coming[/i], and this is where the game really shines. In Metroidvania games, we\u2019ve trained ourselves to watch our surroundings and say \u201cHey, there\u2019s a blocked passage with some obstacles in front of it. Guess I better come back when I\u2019ve got the right upgrades.\u201d But Axiom Verge does a great job of keeping this from even happening; the powerups are [i]so[/i] unique and different than what you\u2019d expect that you\u2019ll never be able to spot where they\u2019re used ahead of time, so you\u2019ll have to periodically wander around with a fresh eye to re-evaluate the world using your current abilities. If you remember that magical moment when you got the Space Jump in Super Metroid and realized \u201cWhoa, I can [i]fly[/i] now?!\u201d You\u2019ve got a good idea of what to expect from the powerups in this game. (In fact, don\u2019t even watch the trailer. It spoils some of \u2018em.) \n\nThe sound and art direction is scary good. Without spoiling anything, the game pays [i]very[/i] close attention to detail, and you\u2019ll constantly be finding little things to appreciate. The artistic design of the environments will trigger a lot of recognition not only from Super Metroid, but also from Fusion and Zero Mission. I love how creepy some of the environments are; if you\u2019ve ever felt that Metroid games didn\u2019t have enough creepy organic elements in the stage design, this game\u2019s got you covered.\n\nMy nitpicks are comparatively small:\n\n- Late into the game, the controls start to get questionable. You\u2019ll have to juggle about 6 buttons for special items alone, and there\u2019s one item which is too easy to misfire on accident if you\u2019re not careful. Hope you've got a controller.\n\n- The story\u2019s a bit on the incomprehensible side. There is no awesome \u201cbaby Metroid saves you\u201d moment; instead there are only a handful of \"WTF\" moments and no straightforward explanation for them. The ending was less than satisfying, and apparently the biggest questions will be answered in the sequel.\n\n- While the soundtrack is very stylish and distinguishable, I found it lacking some powerful melodies. Out of all the tracks, only about one of them is melodic enough to hum. Most of the tracks have a heavy, same-sounding techno beat which could get tiring to hear after a while.\n\nOverall, Axiom Verge does for Super Metroid what Shovel Knight did for Mega Man, going above and beyond a simple homage and demonstrating an astounding understanding both of what Metroid fans wanted, and how the formula could be expanded using new ideas. Game length is about 10 hours on the initial playthrough if you take your time and hunt for stuff without a guide. The homage bits are spot-on, and the new ideas are brilliant, sometimes shocking. Despite some nitpicks, I give the game a solid 9/10. The gameplay was thoroughly satisfying from beginning to end.\n\nIs it worth the $20 asking price? It\u2019s a bit steep. I think that if you\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re getting into, wait for a 25-50% sale. But if I were to ask you \u201cHave you ever wished that you could go back in time and re-live the day you played Super Metroid for the first time, so that everything would feel new again?\u201d and you were to respond \u201chell yes,\u201d then the game is worth every penny.

Il constitue un hommage aux premiers Metroids, et il le fait avec beaucoup d'inventivit\u00e9 au niveau des power-ups. La possibilit\u00e9 de \"glitcher\" les ennemis est une v\u00e9ritable trouvaille : chaque ennemi a ainsi deux formes, r\u00e9servant souvent quelques surprises. L'exploration est plaisante et il y a de nombreux secrets, ce qui fait qu'on a toujours envie de progresser, de d\u00e9voiler les myst\u00e8res de la carte. En somme, en tant que Metroidvania, c'est une r\u00e9ussite.\nPar ailleurs, le gros point fort du jeu est son esth\u00e9tique : les d\u00e9cors sont magnifiques, dans l'esprit des vieux Metroids avec un petit quelque chose en plus, unc\u00f4t\u00e9 cybern\u00e9tique et organique \u00e0 la fois, je ne sais pas vraiment comment dire.

You get thrown into the world of Sudra after an explosion and after very little to no real heavy explanation as to why you are there the game tells you to \"explore\". \n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint the mechanics are solid, and well implemented. The game plays like butter, and it is very challenging. Nothing isn't impossible to overcome, but will take time and persistence. Don't give up.\n\nMy only complaint is that there are too many weapons in this game that are not very useful.

Each environment is unique, both when compared to other areas within this game and to other games. The pixel art is wonderful. The characters and enemies look great, but it's the levels, areas and environments that really shine. It's a sci-fi adventure that looks like nothing else.\nThe exploration aspect is fantastic, with levels being fun to explore and rewards being plentiful. There are multiple points in the game where I looked at the level layout and thought \"Oh, there's no way they did that...\" or \"Oh, I wonder...\" and when I tried it, sure enough, there was a secret reward waiting for me.

Like with any Metroidvania, a lot of them give you access to new areas, but leave you to rememeber where they might be useful. The place this game shines is with weapons. Unlike in Metroid, where the weapons are just bigger missles, this game is full of weapons that aren't at all required (I think you can get through the entire game with only 2 or 3 weapons), but each one functions a little differently and opens up a huge variety of ways to fight. Instead of just being more powerful, these weapons might instead change the way you play by giving you more options on how to approch enemies. None are way more powerful than the next, but each one is more or less useful depending on the situation or the enemy (plus there's no ammo, so you can use whatever weapons you like without worrying about resources). This really adds to the exploration, helping the rewards feel more unique and like you're truly missing something if you don't find them. Of course, there's a ton of damage upgrades, health upgrades and other such powerups along the way too, which are more frequent than the weapons. There are also notes, which help you out almost not at all but give you lore, story and background to the characters and world. Between the notes, upgrades, weapons and required power-ups, there's tons of different stuff to find and searching for rewards never becomes boring.\nThe combat in this game is solid. It's simple and not the reason you'd play the game, but crucial nonetheless. It makes the world dangerous and challenging to explore, acts as an obstacle between you and your next destination, gives most of the findable items (except notes) genuine value. The excitment of finding a heatlth upgrade or a cool new weapon is real, because the combat makes those things useful. The enemies are not pushovers either, so that alone will motivate you to find every last items to use along with your wits and your aim to overcome baddies. The eneimies theselves are well designed and give each area even more uniqueness, especially in the way you play through each one. Different attak patterns and weakness mean different stratagies for killing/getting past them.\nThe story of this game is fairly good. Minimal and nothing to right home about, but it gets the job done. The best part about the story is how little is explained in cutscenes and diolauge and how much is left to discover through notes that you find.\nTo top it off, this game's map has NO markers. No waypoints, no friendly arrows telling you where to go, nothing. The only in-game markers are the ones the player can place on the map, which can be useful, but these are just tools for you to use as reminders. You get very few hints as to where to go, you get 0 icons or other visual indicators pointing to your next destination. The map itself isn't even complete - it starts off blank, and then records rooms that you've been to, meaning the only thing on the map are the places you've already been. This is one of this game's strong points, because it forces you to explore the world for yourself. It lets you get a little lost, then find your way. It makes you feel like you're wondering a foreign world, not following directions.  \nOverall, this game is elegant in a way most (if not all) games should aspire to be. What I mean by this is that everything ties into one thing: exploring. The envoirnments are gorgeous and fun to explore, and getting to new areas feels great because of the darastic change in atmosphere and appearacne. The weapons and power-up are helpful, but most of them are optional, rewarding you for exploring the world thoroughly. There are some require items, but these are tools that give you new options for exploring the world. The enemies add challenge to the way you traverse the world, and value to the items you find while exploring. The story is explained at a surface level, but there's so many details, extras, lore and background to the story you can discover by, again, exploring (and if you don't care, you don't have to read them, so it's a win-win either way). Even the required objective is not pointed out for you, so it will require you to explore around for it. This game has one central theme - exploration - and everything else revolves around that. EVERYTHING. Envoirnemts, items, combat story, map, all of it is one tightly-woven experience that I highly recomend to anyone who is a fan of retro games, sidescrollers, metroidvania, sci-fi, or exploring.\n(My one complaint is some of the extra stuff is honestly TOO hard to find - I would be impressed by anyone who 100%s this game without a walkthrough.

But at no time did I ever feel frustrated by it. The game is jam packed with things to find and you will willingly double back over areas that have places which now look suspicious in light of your most recent upgrade (the map marking feature is exceptionally useful here). Discovering new items or getting past a previous obstacles is extremely satisfying - and it happens often!\n\nThe setting is excellent. The game does a great job of building atmosphere through the level design, little bits of lore hidden throughout the map, cutscenes and music. You really do feel like you're alone, trapped on a strange dead alien world, struggling to find answers. \n\nThe story is very compelling. It's delivered in small, short segments which feels like a great choice. The pacing is good and will keep your curiosity piqued as you move forward. \n\nThe graphical style is wonderfully retro. It's pixel art, but it's extraordinarily done. One thing in particular I really love about Axiom Verge is the way it works \"glitches\" into the world. If you've ever played an old NES game on real hardware, you will immediately notice familiar looking sprite/tile corruptions, flickers, and placement errors. This is done to great effect in this game and it's incredible how it manages to bend them to actually work in a good way!\n\nThe music is perfect.\n\nMy one and only complaint would be the controls are a little tough to get used to at first. I kept finding myself reflexively using the right analog stick expecting to aim while moving. In actuality, no such feature exists. I also found myself frequently clicking the analog stick buttons by mistake and accidentally activating their functions. Not a deal breaker, but again, it does take some getting used to.\n\nI've only just completed my first play through and there is so much left to discover.

But that label does an injustice for what the game presents.  There is an unbelievable amount of items and powerups packed into this game, and thats not even bringing up the most unique thing about this game: glitching the world!  That concept really enhances the game experience and presents a new set of challenges and strategies that your basic Metroid clone would lack.  It also is paced very well, starting you off nice and slow, but really pushing you come the end when you get more powerful.  Even on the easiest difficulty, playing careless will result in death.  Doubly true for bosses, which all present difficult but fair challenges.  However, a few bosses can be defeated using cheap tricks.\n\nThe story knows its place is on the backburner, because the thing that sells this game is the adventure and action.  So it is generally not intrusive.  And the backstory is revealed only through certain pickups.  But it does have some interesting ways of reintroducing itself, ways that you will definitely not see coming.  The story isnt anything special, but it was not lazily written by any means.\n\nOverall, Axiom Verge is one of the best games I've played on Steam.  And thanks to item percentages, multiple endings, and even a speedrun mode for those who enjoy that challenge, there is replay value there.

But even if you perservere through the graphics and sound, the game experience is not a pleasant one. I don't like the stage design, the enemies, or the weapons/powerups. There is little creativity in the maps and moving through it feels more like a chore than actual exploration. Most enemies are simply annoying, most of them move too fast and very hard to dodge, including their attacks. The drill upgrade is okay, but the combination of a drill and the address disruptor is a very weak design choice, as you'll end up drilling or disrupting everything in sight.

The platforming, puzzles, and progression are really solid, and if you want a challenge I would recommend it.  I didn't die THAT much, so don't let the difficulty put you off.  Also, I am not a huge fan of back tracking, I would've liked a fast travel option very much.\n\nIn addition, the graphics are excellent given their limitations.  They do a great job emulating NES graphics, and I will say the effects that they have that don't appear to look like NES graphics, do a good job of sort of jarring you with their 'wrongness.'\n\nOverall, this game does a very good job of making you feel uncomfortable.  The world it builds is very strange and alien, something I don't think Metroid did as good a job at.  It really makes you wonder, what has happened here, what is going on, who am I, what am I?  Nothing feels safe, no one feels trustworthy.  It's actually almost Lovecraftian - you feel like you are an ant even if you are a powerful ant, in a hostile, alien world, ruled by alien powers you don't understand, that could easily destroy you.  \n\nAll that is excellent.  I will say that the story feels like they could've done more and gone further, they had built something very complex with it.  They use diary entries to push the story a little further than in-game dialogue allows, and that can help you fill in some blanks.

Check. Huge maze-like world? Check. Lots of tools and weapons to traverse and defeat enemies with? Check and check. Metroidvania here we come.\n\nAxiom Verge is another shooty action-adventure game swimming in the vast sea of such titles you can get on steam. It has everything you expect- tight controls, a decent narrative to immerse the player, a fair challenge, and rich artwork. When you first boot up the game, this all become apparent. But Axiom Verge goes a little deeper in the mechanics and scope- \u201cglitching\u201d the game is one of its key features. Its a neat building point that harkens back to 80's and 90's where players can tease the game into letting the character walk through wall, corrupt enemies, and use passwords to gain more access to the world. Its unique and certainly plays with the idea of what boundaries are in a game. Of course, its all programmed in there, but it just feels like your cheating the game. It makes you grin. \n\nFurthermore, you get a lot of stuff to play with. All of these tools help a player to be as perceptive as possible. All of the game's areas are peppered with secret passages and hidden doorways. Does a passage seem to end early? Take out the drill and check the wall. See some odd flickering? Give it a pass with the Address Disruptor. Found a small passage? Take the drone out for a spin. Found some odd letters? Jot them down. Maybe you can crack the code later. Axiom Verge is a game that rewards players being perceptive and hounding leads. The vast majority of the game's weapons are found snooping around the environment- though only the first three weapons you gain are actually needed. The rest are for funsies. \n\nThe narrative deserves a special note. While it is mainly delivered via cut scene and text boxes, its best used is when the game shows, not tells. Unfortunately, this wavers though out the game. The beginning if chock full of these little tells, images, and sequences that envelope the player into the world. But then it stops for a while. Here and there you're treated to a text box interaction, but nothing that grabs you during play. Until you hit certain area later in the game- then the game just envelopes you. I wanted more experiences like that, but the game mostly tones back down to text boxes. Overall, the story is mysterious with some great sci-fi concepts and a few twists.\n\nAxiom Verge is on the easy side- even on hard mode. Hard mode just makes weapons deal less damage, enemies deal more, and health drops are less frequent. This really isn't a challenge since death is mostly inconsequential- you just port back to the last save. You even keep any power-ups obtained and exploration done if you didn't save beforehand! (which is great, I hate re-doing sections) With the glut of weapons you can deal with any problem and the tools and power-ups make escape a breeze if things go sour. \n\nThe bosses, while really impressive looking, are mostly ham-fisted encounters with easy patterns. Some can be defeated by simply standing(or crouching) and shooting. Others shoot so wildly and unpredictably that standing and shooting is THE strategy. Trying to dodge will likely get you killed and it's better to get as berserk as the boss and fill it with bio-mechanical plasma. The bosses are certainly a glaring weakness of the game.\n\nWhen the grappling hook tool is gained it is quickly phased out with other, more versatile tools. Its only apparent function is to obtain a more versatile tool in the next area. Makes me wonder why its in the game at all. There are also a few weapons that are just there to be collected and add little to the game due to their extremely weak power, poor versatility, niche use, or all three.\n\nIf your looking for an impressive maze adventure in the same vein as the 2D Metroid titles, Guacamelee, Cave Story, and Symphony of the Night, Axiom Verge is well worth its price tag. If you especially enjoy 100% a game, finding secrets, and decrypting cyphers, than Axiom Verge gives you even more. It you like speed running, Axiom Verge helps you with a specific speed running mode. If you like messing with game data, again, Axiom Verge can scratch that itch with its diverse Passcode Tool. But if you're looking for a fast-pace game to challenge your reflexes and make you think how to overcome a boss or enemy, Axiom Verge will let you down. This is a pure action-adventure title and it bathes in that quality.\n\nOne more note, this game was made by one guy in about five years- Tom Happ. He did the art, the music, the narrative, the design, and the distribution.

Okay. I don't usually do this but I'm just going to break down everything separately.\n\nFirst off: I will quite frequently bring up this game's contemporary Environmental Station Alpha multiple times, since a comparison to this game is how I found ESA originally, and then what brought me back to this game was a comparison of this game to ESA, and since the games came out in the same month both heavily aping Metroid, the comparisons are almost begging to happen.\n\nStory: It's pretty good, actually. I wouldn't say it's a huge factor in the game, but the story and the collectible lore are pretty intriguing, leaving just enough ambiguous to keep you guessing. I wouldn't say the story is the main draw of the game, but I definitely can't hold it against the game.\n\nGraphics: Hmm. This is tricky to rate. On one hand, the pixel art is gorgeous to look at. On the other hand... it's a bit of a sensory overload sometimes, since there are so many bright colors all the time. It doesn't help that the only really noticeable graphically difference in most areas is the color. The game doesn't have very well defined \"enivironments\" like ESA, and though this technically has better \"art\" than that game, I dunno, I feel ESA just has a better aesthetic than this game. I wouldn't say the graphics are bad by any means but it's amazing how bland I find them for how well they're done.\n\nMusic: It's alright at first, it's very game-y music, but by the end of the game I was utterly sick of it. I dunno, it's way too blaring and in-your-face most of the time. Metroid had more atmospheric music, ESA has more atmospheric music, it added to the mood instead of overpowering it. I wouldn't say it's bad music, you'll probably enjoy it your first time through the game, but not for much longer.\n\nAnd now... here's where things are really gonna fall apart.\nGameplay: Uuugh. I should love this so much more than I do. But. Okay, here's the key problem: This game is stubbornly rooted in Super Metroid, in almost every aspect. A lot of its mechanics are quite similar, for one, just \"modernized\", and for what it's worth, a lot of the \"modernized\" mechanics are good. The grappling hook is an utter travesty though, worse than any in Metroid and an absolute trainwreck compared to the fantastic grappling of ESA. It's just... thank god this thing barely sees any use because it's utter trash. \n\nBut that aside... the game design itself apes Super Metroid far too heavily, especially when it comes to collectibles. I did not enjoy hunting for secrets in Super Metroid and never bothered to get 100%, but I wanted to here because achievements etc. I did not get past like 75% without consulting a guide because there are just so many obnoxiously hidden secrets in the game... Some of the passwords in particular are total \"how would you ever figure that out on your own\" moments, and. Okay, maybe this just annoys me in particular, but sometimes... secret locations are shown to you on the map via the wall of the room not being finished. But other secrets aren't. There's no consistency for stuff otherwise hidden in the exact same way, it's just really strange. You have a fair share of pure fake walls that you can't find until you're touching them, and there's a ton of things you need to drill, a few strange glitched enemies you need to take advantage of, and absolute no item-finding tool to assist you, unlike Super Metroid. There is, amazingly, both indication of 100% map completion and 100% item completion for each specific area, but you'd never know until it showed up for you the first time, and even then you probably wouldn't know what it means.\n\nI will be the first to admit that, yes, ESA did have a lot of the same stuff to it. But here's the thing. The way that game's map is designed turned an annoyance into sheer brilliance, because the map was 100% tightly packed. You could figure out where secret rooms are 9 times out of 10, because the entire map is solid as a rock. There was also a hidden map item that mapped out most of the main secret areas, too. And even with the secrets on the outside of the station, you did have a fairly limited scope of things to search. Stuff was hidden, but it made sense. In Axiom Verge, it just doesn't make sense. Add to that the fact that there's no \"secrets\" necessary to just complete the game, no fake walls, no maps lying to you, and you'd never know there were supposed to be secrets like that until you accidentally stumbled upon one, or noticed how low your item % was at the end of the game. \n\nI've rambled on about this one element enough but this is legitimately the biggest deal I could ever have with a metroidvania:\nExploring isn't fun.\nAny metroidvania that fails this is fundamentally doing something wrong, no exceptions.\nI loved exploring in games like ESA, Guacamelee, La-Mulana, Knytt Underground, heck, even games like Dust and Ori where exploration is stupidly easy. Here though, it just ain't fun. \n\nOnto the rest. Sigh.\nThe platforming is generally alright. I actually dig most of the movement mechanics in this game. The coats constantly upgrade your ability to move through walls, and by the third one you have this cool dash attack that speeds up movement considerably, and it's just really fun to use. The drone is far, far superior to the Metroid morph ball, being much more flexible and once you have the drone swap allowing for a lot of cool movement options. I'm legitimately excited to watch the run of this game at AGDQ as soon as I finish watching this review, because while movement in this game is a bit stiff at first, as it tends to be in most metroidvanias, it gets really fun later on. There's no real tough platforming challenges in the game, though, a few instances of grappling hook shenanigans but they're rare, and everything else isn't any harder than completing the first world of Super Meat Boy. Heck, probably even easier than that.\n\nI have mixed feelings on the combat, though. For one, there are too freaking many weapons, and so few of them saw much use. Especially once you get one of the god-tier weapons that basically invalidates all the other weapons before it. The lightning gun feels like cheating, almost. Basic enemies start out pretty manageable, but by the end of the game they are waaaayyy too strong and waaayyy too durable, and possibly even waaayyy too prevalent. I guess, the game wouldn't have any challenge at all with the higher-tier weapons unless the enemies are this way, but it reeks of fake difficulty. The bosses fare a little better, though they're also fairly unmemorable. There aren't very many of them, they're all very standard in design, no clever tricks, just shooting and dodging stuff. Snore. The final boss is atrocious, by the way, being basically an RNG boss unless you're a god at dodging tons of projectiles and three huge hitboxes while also trying to hit one specific section of the ceiling. Seriously, who the hell thought that was a decent idea for a boss. It doesn't even feel rewarding to win, it just feels like \"Oh, I got lucky with the health drops this time so I won. Okay.\" And it's just really anticlimactic. Though honestly the entire game feels really anticlimactic. The story itself is fine but never seems to go anywhere. I didn't realize I was approaching the end until the game was like \"Oh hey by the way you're approaching the end\". Ehh. Some of the guns are fun to use though. For a primarily combat-driven game though I really feel like this could've been better. Granted, I've never really liked combat in Metroid games either, and the bosses in Metroid games are even worse than the ones here in my humble opinion, but whatever.\n\n[Character limit hit, continuing in comments.]", "timestamp_created": 1453182708, "timestamp_updated": 1453183529, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566108", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20618626": {"recommendationid": "20618626", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994457791", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464218375}, "language": "english", "review": "a definite great game, really pays a great compliment to the 2d platform of metroid series, story plays out very intresstingly, worth the playthru.", "timestamp_created": 1453180630, "timestamp_updated": 1453180630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20617492": {"recommendationid": "20617492", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970109947", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470376590}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well-crafted Metroidvania with eerie environments, good music, and creative gameplay elements.

Yes Axiom Verge is a huge game full of sharp shooting, platforming and discovery much in the spirit of games like Metroid and Castlevania. It also reminded me of a little known classic called Wolf Child. \n\nAt times Axiom Verge feels almost imposible to uncover as it is so vast and choc-full of secrets to uncover some of which require a sharp eye, others a sharp mind. Unfortunatley not all the time I put into the game was pleasent however. This was due mostly to some momentary design flaws. For example there is a particular section of the game that took me hours to figure out and it was due to a puzzle that had no particular set up. The next moment came with the seventh boss who in a sharp turn from other bosses felt like more of grind than a battle of skill. These moments set me back hours grinding what is otherwise a smooth experience to a halt.\n\nThe dificulty level also takes a sharp spike towards the end of the game which isn't especially surprising (duh) but I felt the game doesn't balance your newly acquired abilities as well as earlier in the game resulting again in battles of health grinding or even worse dreaded retreads as you replay one area over and over and OVER... sorry.\n\nMoving on. With much of the bad stuff out the way the game truly shines in pretty much all of it Metroidvania inspired glory. For the vast majority of the game exploration is incredibly fun, there are tons of fantastic enemies to face along the way and it all revolves around a intruiging story that is reminicent of sci-fi films like the Matrix. For the most part the controls are very tight however I did run into problems playing with my 360 pad (mostly cuz the D-Pad sucks). Also I really didn't like the implementation of the dash and double jump. \n\nI absolutley loved the breadth of power ups, weapons and abilities. This for me was the most rewarding aspect of the game I squeeled like a school girl upon finally getting the infamous flame thrower! Also the drone is amazing and in conjunction with the field disruptor lead to some awesome puzzle solving. After stumbling awarkardly through the games jagged world for hours you will eventually move through it like a 16bit God! \n\nOver all Axiom Verge is an incrediably fun if slightly flawed platformer. It's one of the best games I have played for some time and certainly the best platformer since Shovel Knight. To think this is the work of one man blows my mind.

They have become so commonplace as to be unremarkable, and it's not difficult to see why. Even setting aside the obvious power of nostalgia and the (relative) ease of production of such titles, there remains the matter of how often and how severely the gaming industry has changed. What graphics are considered acceptable by the general public, what practices are tolerated regarding downloadable content, what genres see growth, decline, and resurgence, and what platforms games are developed for... All of those things have changed over the years.\n\nSo what separates Axiom Verge from any other genre throwback? What makes it unique? \n\nThese things do:\n[list]\n    [*]The story of Axiom Verge begins in a manner that is rather typical of comic book/video game science fiction. The protagonist, Trace, is a scientist working on some relatively undefined experiment during the game's opening. The mechanics of what he's doing at the time are irrelevant. What matters is something predictably goes wrong, and through means unknown to him Trace awakens on an alien world, guided by a mysterious voice. From there things become increasingly complicated. The presentation of the story is simplistic, but the story itself is not.\n    [*]The game's art style is knowingly inconsistent, and it uses this to its advantage. The sprite work for the protagonist Trace and many of his enemies is relatively simple, something that is thrown into stark contrast by the game's bosses and several NPCs. The difference is jarring. It's also excellent at ensuring the player feels exactly how bizarre and alien Trace's situation is. Admittedly, I would have preferred the game stuck with its more detailed style throughout, but considering it was developed by one man over years that may not have been feasible.\n    [*]An early power up allows the manipulation of certain aspects of the environment and enemy behavior through essentially \"hacking reality\". This system could have been used more thoroughly, but works rather well in practice.\n    [*]Rather than receive many different weapons throughout his adventure, Trace receives (bar certain movement powerups) a single gun that acquires progressively more diverse and complicated bullet patterns. The diversity of combat styles this allows once several bullet types are acquired is one of the game's highlights.\n    [*]Things taken for granted in games of Axiom Verge's genre are part of its universe. Save points are an in-universe technology, not a gameplay abstraction, for example. \n    [*]The occasional hidden area is, effectively, a segment of \"broken reality\", indicated through a scan-line effect over the game's visuals and circuitous layout design.\n    [*]Axiom Verge's soundtrack is excellent, both on a technical level and at providing atmosphere.\n    [*]The game has a \"speed run mode\" built in from the outset that removes all story elements, a nice touch in a genre that frequently lends itself to such challenge runs.\n[/list]\n\nThose are the game's highlights. What, then, are it's weaknesses? \n[list]\n    [*]While the game being created by one man in virtually every aspect is impressive and worth commendation, the development status of the game shows in ways that may not be appealing to everyone. The environments are diverse and interesting, but also primarily prone to simplistic shapes in their design more often than not. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it should be noted.\n    [*]As mentioned above, while the disonnance of the game's multiple sprite work art styles are used to its advantage, it's hard not to imagine how much more effective the game could have been at providing its alien atmosphere if the high level of detail used in bosses was the default.\n    [*]Some of the game's secrets are sufficiently obscure that obtaining them without a guide is extremely unlikely. Some might take this as a given considering the game's genre. I found it more annoying than not. \n    [*]Outside of the explicitly delivered cutscenes and text boxes, the story is given through the breadcrumbs of in-game notes that can be discovered and eventually translated. The concept is an established one, but remains divisive. I wasn't too fond of how this game handled it. \n[/list]\n\nAll in all, do I recommend Axiom Verge? Absolutely. It's not by any means perfect, and its weaknesseses and presentation can understandably be divisive. Despite that, the game's strengths make it well worth a purchase for fans of its genre. Even so, watching at least one gameplay video beforehand is recommended.

So gro\u00df, dass Metroid die einzige Reihe ist, von der ich alle Titel besitze. So gro\u00df, dass ich mir erst Prime 3 und dann danach die Konsole zum spielen zugelegt habe. So gro\u00df, dass ich eine gro\u00dfe Auswahl an selfmade Games aus der Fanbase durchgespielt habe und mich selbst daran versucht habe solch ein Spiel zu entwickeln.\n\nIch habe es aufgegeben, nicht so allerdings der Entwickler von Axiom Verge, Tom Happ. Er hat es, als alleiniger Entwickler, geschafft, ein Spiel zu entwickeln, dass sich mit Metroid messen kann.\nZu Anfang f\u00fchlt es sich an wie Metroid. \u00c4hnliche Grafiken, \u00c4hnliche Gegner, \u00c4hnliche Umgebung. Doch immer mehr offenbart Axiom Verge seine eigene, surreale, zerbrochene Welt. Auf den ersten Blick erkennt man H\u00fcrden, die man in einem Metroid durch Raketen oder den Morph Ball \u00fcberwinden k\u00f6nnte. Doch trotz dass Axiom Verge sich mit seiner Welt, den Gegnern und der anf\u00e4nglichen Spielmechanik von Metroid kaum unterscheidet, entwickelt dieses Spiel sehr schnell eine \u00fcberraschend faszinierende Eigendynamik.\n\nWenn der Bohrer die Raketen ersetzt und eine Drone statt dem Morphball eingesetzt wird, dann ist das Axiom Verge. Doch Axiom Verge hat einige Besonderheiten zu bieten, die dieses Spiel selbst gegen den Meilenstein Metroid gewinnen l\u00e4sst.\nZuerst einmal die Story. Zwar ist die Story nicht Hauptteil des Spiels sondern nur sehr dezent verbaut, jedoch l\u00e4sst sie mitf\u00fchlen und hilft sich in die surreale Welt einzufinden. Sie gibt dem Aufenthalt einen Grund und macht das Ziel des Spiels, Athetos aufzuhalten, deutlich. Man versucht nicht einfach nur weiter zu kommen, man versucht Athetos das Handwerk zu legen!\nWeiterhin bietet Axiom Verge in Zusammenhang mit der Story eine \u00fcberraschende Spielmechanik, die ich so noch nicht gesehen habe. Hacking und Glitching. Monster hacken um ihre Hitboxen zu vergr\u00f6\u00dfern oder sie harmlos zu machen, Glitches in der Welt hacken um Plattformen herzuzaubern, oder sich durch W\u00e4nde glitchen um verborgene Orte zu erreichen. Das ist in Axiom Verge Alltag. Mit einer Waffe auf Monster zielen und sie dadurch hacken zu k\u00f6nnen ist in diesem Genre wirklich ein au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliches und vorallem auch interessantes Feature.\nUnd wo ich schon bei Waffen bin: Axiom Verge ist voll davon. Ob die einfache Kanone, den W\u00e4rmesucher, die Feuerwand, die Blitz- oder die Laserwaffe, alle Waffen in Axiom Verge sind einzigartig gut gelungen. Noch interessanter wird es dadurch, dass jede Waffe f\u00fcr einen anderen Verwendungszweck gut ist. So gibt es R\u00e4tsel, die man nur durch die Benutzung der richtigen Waffe l\u00f6sen kann. Insgesamt gibt es 24 verschiedene einzigartige Waffen.\nDoch nicht all diese Waffen lassen sich in der normalen Welt von Axiom Verge finden. Denn es gibt geheime Welten. Jeder Metroidfan wird jetzt an die vielen Geheimg\u00e4nge in zahlreichen Metroid-Titeln denken, doch Axiom Verge geht noch einen Schritt weiter: neben den zahlreich versteckten Items und Wegen in Axiom Verge sind Geheimwelten eine eigene Art von Versteck. Man erkennt durch einen R\u00f6hreneffekt auf dem Bildschirm, dass man nah an einer geheimen Welt ist. Die Stellen mit solch einem Effekt zu finden ist schon schwer, jedoch in diese Welt hineinzugelangen oft noch mehr. In manchen F\u00e4llen geht das nur durch volle Ausr\u00fcstung und ordentliches herumgeglitche. Einfach im Internet nachsehen, wie das funktioniert? Denkste! Denn die Positionen der geheimen Welten sind quasi zuf\u00e4llig und deswegen bei jedem Spieler anders.\n\nNeben der liebevoll gestalteten Welt und den vielen ausgekl\u00fcgelten Game-Mechanics muss man vorallem auch den Soundtrack loben, da dieser wirklich Laune macht und selbst in Dauerschleife nicht langweilig wird. Ich empfehle, gerade f\u00fcr Chippunk-Fans, deswegen die Version mit Soundtrack. Es lohnt sich!\n\nDas einzige, was ich bem\u00e4ngeln k\u00f6nnte ist, dass in den meisten Metroid Teilen etwas mehr Geheimverstecke sind in denen Man Powerups findet. Die Vielseitigkeit der R\u00e4tsel zu diesen Geheimverstecken fehlt mir ein bisschen.\n\nInsgesamt ist Axiom Verge f\u00fcr mich wie ein Geschwister von Metroid, dass gelernt hat seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen ohne dabei seiner Familie untreu zu werden. Es f\u00fchlt sich anfangs an wie Metroid, doch es wird, meiner Meinung nach, immer besser, bis es, zumindest einige Metroid Teilie, im letzten Drittel knapp \u00fcberholen kann.\nEs ist schon traurig, dass eine Person es schafft ein Spiel zu entwickeln, dass an die Qualit\u00e4t von Super Metroid ankn\u00fcpfen kann, w\u00e4hrend das Original sich durch \"Federation Force\" in eine derart kindliche Umgebung begibt, dass man sich als Fan der Serie dar\u00fcber sch\u00e4men muss. Andererseits ist es erfreulich, dass ein Entwickler versteht, was die Fans des Genres wollen und es schafft eine bessere Qualit\u00e4t als das Original abzuliefern.\nVielen Dank Tom Happ!", "timestamp_created": 1452465215, "timestamp_updated": 1452465644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20455233": {"recommendationid": "20455233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081031940", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504485261}, "language": "english", "review": "if you grew up playing on an NES or an SNES, then this game will be a glimpse into the past for you. eloquently capturing so many elements form so many classic games, and making it into one seamless playthough. i highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1452455523, "timestamp_updated": 1452455523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20451841": {"recommendationid": "20451841", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970642017", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488716659}, "language": "english", "review": "Fairly competent Super Metroid rip-off, with the story premise from Another World, but not as good.

But while I admired the franchise from a distance, a number of factors kept me from putting too much time into any of the games in person. The Metroid games always seemed far too cartoonishly colorful for me to get, for lack of a better word, immersed. The narrative, while compartmentalized, was always part of a bigger story; Super Metroid for the SNES started with a lengthy exposition dump that made me feel as though I'd missed out on a great adventure before booting up the game. By this point Samus Aran has built up some considerable baggage. Axiom Verge appeals to me because, for one thing, it's a stand-alone one-shot title that I can enjoy without worrying about previous installments. But that's far from its only appeal.\n\n[h1]Art Direction[/h1]\nAxiom Verge, perhaps in homage to the classic NES titles it was inspired by, has a lot more black in its color palette. The environments feel darker, less vibrant than those in Super Metroid or Fusion, or the latest polygonal entries in the franchise. The H. R. Geiger factor is turned way up, both in regards to environments and boss design. Even with the darker color palette, the environments are quite varied and are complimented by their music. It felt like a genuine triumph when I finally left the claustraphobic cave system in Kur and saw the alien horizon of Sudra for the first time with the 'Cellular Skies' track playing in the background. The enemy design is similar to Metroid, with the exception of the bosses, which boast their own distinct personality. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story is initially told in a fairly minimalistic fashion: Trace is a scientist who ends up in an alien world due to an unforeseen accident during a lab experiment in his isolated mountainside facility.  Upon awakening, Trace is guided by an alien voice whose English is suspiciously reminiscent of badly translated game localizations of yore. Upon completing the tasks the voice demands of him, Trace is treated to some token exposition and the game continues. It's at around the halfway mark that there's a substantial paradigm-shifting plot twist. It's no exaggeration to say that I went from merely liking the minimalistic narrative to relishing it, becoming invested. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThis is a solid Metroid-like, with player abilities that are similar, but at the same time quite different. No morph-ball? No problem, just fire off a headcrab-esque drone to investigate narrow crevices and interact with whatever's beyond. No space-jump? Some canny improvisation with the double jump, the grappling hook, the blink-coat and the drone will let you fill in unexplored areas of the map efficiently enough. The glitching mechanic allows you to alter enemy behaviors or get into otherwise inaccessible areas of the map. There's even an in-game code entry tool that lets you translate story documents, or enter secret areas using character sequences you find in the game, as well as to cheat, if you're so inclined. The player will quickly start recognizing enemies over time, and approach them in a way that best capitalizes on the behaviors and weaknesses of the adversary in question. It's best to unload on some enemies and kill them before they reach you; it's best to glitch others out so that they'll slow down, or spit health particles to refill your waning supplies. And so on. There are a fair number of secrets hidden all over the world that might give the player an edge. Most can be found with some reasoning, or with an eye out for inconsistencies in tile patterns. Others are more devious. One or two may require a guide. \n\nAll that said, there are some minor flaws to be found here. Oftentimes the game feels more responsive with the keyboard, especially in regards to using blink abilities, which is a shame since I much prefer using the controller for platformers like this. The grappling hook, while cool in concept, feels rather stiff and inconsistent in regards to jumping off a swing. I have an affinity for grappling hooks, but this one feels like it's obsolescent inside an hour after the player finds it.  There are more than twenty projectile weapons to be found all over Sudra. The vast majority of these are so over-specialized and situational that I'm hard-pressed to say I used them more than once. It feels like for most of the game Trace's best method of dealing with enemies is the Disruptor, which is the basic starting blaster, or the Kilver, which is a close-range, high-damage AOE weapon that can hit things through walls. They're simple, but they're reliable. It's a little disappointing that the rest of the weapons don't have as much utility. \n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nDespite the occasional shortcoming, I still consider Axiom Verge to be among my favorite indie games released in the past couple of years.

Still, it's the closer any game has ever got to Super Metroid. Metroid Fusion is less Super-like than Axiom Verge. (I'll confess I can't compare with Zero Mission, because it's been too long since I last played it.) A clone with it's own thing - yes, it's kinda paradoxical. It's like a fan-made spiritual successor, albeit the fan is a professional programmer/designer/artist/composer/nerd-god-among-us and Axiom Verge is his  spare time project, or so I heard.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n* The closer you'll get to Super Metroid, my favorite game ever.\n* Design: cool retro aesthetics, sometimes going even to monocromatic or CGA-like palette. HR Giger and Cronenberg-inspired biomechanical design. Also, glitch art relating to reality bending mechanics.\n* Some huge bosses. The screen zooms out so you can see the whole monster and his room!\n* You can use a PS4 controller right of the bat it you want. I don't have one, but if you do, good for you. A 360 one will do too.\n* Huge array of weapons. Most of them have a clear trade-off. The ones that cover wider area are weaker. Some have very specific uses. Most of the time, I used an electric bolt more akin to a melee weapon than a projectile, very strong albeit very short ranged, but hits across walls and floors. Another cool weapon is an electric beam that homes into the enemy, but it's not effective with some enemies.\n* Very cool mobility mechanics! See those narrow tunnels? Think you'll get a morph ball upgrade?  No, you'll control a spider drone to explore and gather itens! Later on, you'll be able to teleport into the drone's position. You'll also be able to teleport to the other side of walls and later on, you'll have a multidirectional teleporting dash! So maybe you want to reach a distant platform? How about jumping, teleporting up at the apex, then blasting the drone's egg, hatch the egg, teleport into the drone's position, teleport dash again and voil\u00e1: there is your platform! Maybe you're a grappling hook person? You're covered too! Go as Cronenberg-Bionic Commando as you like, Rick! \n* Glitch your enemies away! Adress disruptor will turn your enemies into those things that used to appear on your screen when you banged your cartridge while your system was on. Their AI will change too in different ways. Some will become slower, others will alter their motion, some will turn against other enemies, some will turn into platforms and a specific kind will even become controllable via player input. There may be trade-offs, as enemies may become slower, but gain a special attack. Some walls and platforms can also be glitched-deglitched so to allow your way.\n* Great music! Very sci-fi-like electronica. Chiptune square sound waves mixed with traditional trance-like sounds. Listen to Famicom/NES's square wave being modulated into distortion!\n* Although I've seen a reviewer claiming he got stuck for 2 or 3 hours, I've breezed through the entire game in far less than a week. Granted, sometimes I didn't know what I was supposed to do, but I did it anyway (It's a Metroid clone - you go everywhere you can and look for anything you can. What's the secret?). No guides used. Only clue I got from somewhere else was a spoiler in that said video review - thanks Super Bunnyhop... Good thing it was nothing major, not getting that would not hinder my game. Also, I cannot understand why some people complain about difficulty. This game, at least in normal mode, is not hard at all! I'm impressed how quick I've beaten it.\n* Although the design is not as supertight as Super Metroid's, this gives Axiom Verge it's own twists. As you'll not be as efficient as Samus doging a barrage of bullets, you'll find yourself hiding a lot and exploiting enemie's AI's inefficiencies, like when it traps itself in a corner. But that exploit adds to the sense of strategy. Knowing how enemies behave is essential to come up with ways to defeat them or at least to run away from them.\n* Fun.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n* Shameless Super Metroid rip-off. Wait - wasn't this one a pro? Oh yeah, right. Next one, please.\n* Although it says \"Full controller support\", it's limited to 360 and PS4. Got a PS2 one and plan to use X360ce on this game? Too bad, it won't happen! You gotta have a Xinput controller or a Dualshock 4. SCPToolkit (Windows only) will do the trick for Dualshock 3. Google it and give it a try if you need it, it's worth it.\n* The story is very difficult to grasp! While Super Metroid told its tale through game mechanics, Axiom Verge will explain the backstory of everything through dialogue and notes. Not a bad thing per se and Metroid Fusion already got that approach before, so it's not new either. But this one is made from the start to twist your brain! If you have the patience, by the end you'll make sense of all the nonsense, but it's too convoluted to be for everyone. It's nothing you'd not have seen in Moffat-era Doctor Who before, but that alone says something.\n* Although weapons variety is cool, most of them will not be used. I was surprised to realize how many times the best approach was to use the default weapon.\n* Although bosses' visual designs are cool, some of them have uninteresting AI. There is one in particular which I killed just by mashing fire as I realized all I had to do was beating his fire frequency (gunfight until one of us dies first).\n* Sometimes you gain access to a new part of the map, dig your way into a hole, only to realize your reward was not an upgrade, but a backstory note. And sometimes you won't even be able to translate the alien language. Said backstory notes should be located only in areas you have to traverse anyway, not in detours where your sole purpose is the note.\n* I sometimes wished the combat was tighter and being a bullet-sponge was less of a successful strategy - maybe you should try hard mode if that's your concern too, but beware: the said bullet-sponge strategy becomes a legit strategy on two or three later bosses - the last boss, specifically, is all about how much damage you can take and how much you can recover before depleting your health. Health is no rare commodity in normal mode but, in hard mode, that changes. Bullet count goes the other way around, so choose wiselly when to soak yourself in bullets.\n* I wish it was longer, but I can't have everything I want, can I? As a one-man-made game, you would expect a lot less.\n\nSummarizing, a great game, not a perfect one, but no game is. It's a Metroid ripoff and knows it well, and yet it presents cool new ideas. Just make sure you have the right type of gamepad or you don't mind using your keyboard.\n\n10/10 - Would Cronenberg it again.", "timestamp_created": 1452258771, "timestamp_updated": 1452267340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505114", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20390273": {"recommendationid": "20390273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193383845", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452229915}, "language": "english", "review": "Felt like the days I would play on my Gameboy Color or Gameboy Advance playing Metroid games.

The game's story is rather interesting, you have to piece together the bits and pieces of why you woke up in this strange place.  Overall the experience is solid, though I had a few issues that mainly plague Metroidvania games, such as some collectibles being so well hidden that you will never find them unless you rub your butt against every wall you find.\n\n\nThe biggest flaw I would have to say is the map, it's very minimal and often lacks important information.  Such as where you saw a powerup at.  You have to manually place reminders that you cannot define.  So say you find a place that you need to jump really high to.  Then you have an area where you have to squeeze through.  Both reminders take the same form in the form of a number.  This means you cannot really tell what the reminder is for until you go back and remember again, which can lead to a lot of pointless backtracking when you get a new powerup and find it's the wrong one.  Doors are not clearly defined either, so in certain areas that have an interface screw angle it can be hard to read your minimap because you can't distinguish the white from the slightly whiter white.\n\nAlso to deal with backtracking is that there is no way to \"reveal\" breakable blocks or hidden walls without rubbing your aforementioned but on them.  You later on get bomb weapons, but they are not only unable to break the blocks, but unlike the Metroid games do not reveal the block type.\n\n\nAside from the pixel hunt angle, it's a good game.

I was a fool to have waited so long.\n\nThis game is top notch. It's definitely more toward the Metroid end of the spectrum than Castlevania, and that's just fine. It's probably obvious from the screenshots, but I figured I'd clarify. And what a Metroid it is; this game looks, feels, and plays just like a console Metroid made in a huge studio with all kinds of money behind it, such that it's hard to believe that it's an indie game from just one guy.\n\nEverything about it is excellent; sound, music, gameplay, controls, level design, bosses, enemies, etc. Everything. It has the 8-bit aestheitc nailed to the point where it looks like a late-period NES title, but it has tight controls, and feels more like Super Metroid, or perhaps Metroid Fusion.\n\nPlaying it feels just like Metroid, with massive maps to explore, riddled with secrets, and passages that interconnect each level at various points. The game has a built in mapping system very reminiscent of Super Metroid, with the handy addition of being able to set reminder points (two per zone), which is very super handy. I love that feature.\n\nBosses are screen-filling monstrosities that all have a \"trick\" to defeating them that can be approached in several ways, though it usually appears that there is a \"correct\" way to do it, and everything else is for low-completion challenge. Another thing I like is that there always seems to be a save point directly near the boss rooms, so you don't have to redo any large sections before retrying the boss fights, and the boss rooms themselves always have a room right before them with a very obvious and unique background so you don't accidentally stumble into it without saving.\n\n Regular enemies are quite varied and all have their own fun tricks to use against the player, though most of the smaller ones all seem a little generic. There are enough weapons to pick from that there is often one that works best in any given situation, so dealing with them becomes more a matter of Megamanesque choosing the right tool for the job. Thankfully the weapon selection via right analog stick makes that a breeze.\n\nSound effects are good, and fit the 8-bit theme well, though I think I'd have preferred something more SNES-sounding. The music sets a completely different tone than the Metroid series as well; less moody, you-are-alone-against-an-entire-planet-of-things-out-to-kill-you, and more high-tech, bio-mechanical computers, and alternate dimensions.\n\nI'm not finished the game yet, but I'm 9 hours in and I don't want to put it down. I recommend this game to anyone who likes the genre with no reservations at all. Least of all the cost.\n\nAlso: nominating for the Steam Awards \"Whoa, duuuuude\" award, because, whoa, duuuuuude.", "timestamp_created": 1452030649, "timestamp_updated": 1479933222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20332046": {"recommendationid": "20332046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004484756", "num_games_owned": 1467, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498282220}, "language": "english", "review": "Axiom brings back a lot of pleasant times spent with Metroid II and Super Metroid.", "timestamp_created": 1452024101, "timestamp_updated": 1452998560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20328315": {"recommendationid": "20328315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051141972", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452014193}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a pretty good metroid clone, with one minor flaw (it's probably nitpicking, but no total item indicator on areas really leaves you guessing if there's anything left to grab somwhere).

a masterpiece.  While not without flaws, it is something special and amazing.  The two areas the game excels most at would be graphics and gameplay.  The graphics are different from your usual Metroidvania fair.  The world the game is set in looks distinctly alien and gives off an uneasy, almost nightmarish vibe.  Couple this with a very strong aesthetic.  The entire world looks like something out of H.R. Giger's nightmares and adds to the unsettling feel, while being both beautiful and impressive at the same time.  The game also does some amazing things with the graphical style, not only having Ninja Gaiden style cut scenes, but also some truly inspired moments of horror.\n\nGameplay wise, it uses some underutilized tools of exploration, ranging from telportation, drones, and drilling to altering the world itself and glitching or unglitching parts of it.  Other than that, the weapons, while not all useful, all have a distinct feel to them and are different from what we usually get, such as an electro mace, a volt shotgun, and a blast which explodes remotely.  Exploration is pretty cool all around.\n\nMusic wise, the music isn't memorable or ear wormy, but fits the dreary environment, adding to the otherworldly feel.\n\nNow, the game does have a few problems.  There isn't a great way to fast travel and the back tracking can become tiresome.  Many of the weapons are unfeasible to actually fight bosses with so will go unused.  Secrets...the game has a huge number of secrets and doesn't always help you find them.  For example, I tried to find my way into a hidden passage, but the blocks you can enter look the same as the rest of the blocks.  It can get frustrating, though this does give it replayability as you can try and find everything or get help for a second playthrough.\n\nStory is both a strong and a weak part of this game.  There is a story and it's pretty good, utilizing the game's engine and design to create some suitably effective and horrific moments, however a large portion of the story goes unexplained and overall, it is up to a large amount of speculation.  The game obfuscates story elements as well, leaving notes in other languages which need translation...it can get tiresome.\n\nDespite the flaws, however, Axiom Verge is a master class work in Metroidvania with an aesthetic and design which is unique from its contemporaries and makes it stand as one of the best of the best.\n\nGive it a playthrough...or three.", "timestamp_created": 1451879855, "timestamp_updated": 1451879855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20279272": {"recommendationid": "20279272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025031120", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451807684}, "language": "english", "review": "Was totally blown away by the reveal that Trance was...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na man.", "timestamp_created": 1451877817, "timestamp_updated": 1451877817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500339", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20273320": {"recommendationid": "20273320", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969395791", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493564304}, "language": "french", "review": "Axiom Verge est un excellent metroidvania.

The sound design in each area is haunting, yet also uplifting.

You have a few standard ones, and your first gun is pretty standard, but there are over 10 guns, all of them giving you more options instead of simply being raw power.

The graphics are amazing, the music is great (along with the near death sound integration), the gameplay is good for what it is, and the story is surprisingly unique despite me thinking I knew exactly how it was going to play out. However, throughout playing I just felt this sense of generic-ness, this feeling I had done it all before. Yes, obviously this is a metroid spin off, but even above that, I just felt like there was nothing new for me to discover. Sure there are secret weapons, hidden worlds, life and damage powerups for you to find in every nook and cranny- but I am talking about the life behind the game's eyes, it just felt like there was no originality or drive there for me to continue playing. Furthermore, I found the enemy design annoying at best, most of the weapons useless but novel (I think I only used 3 for more than 5 seconds despite collecting 8 or 9), the backtracking tedious, and the price too high for what I got. In short, I had fun while playing but left disappointed and just overall very static on how I felt while playing the game.\n\nMaybe I am looking for the wrong game out of this? To compare with another metroid clone released recently, I loved Environmental Station Alpha. But ESA is even more of a carbon copy clone of metroid, with much less interesting weapon and powerup progression. But the secrets were more engaging, the bosses harder, and overall it just felt like more of an immersive experience. Axiom Verge is constructed ten times better than ESA in almost every department however it just feels lifeless in comparison to me. I was not nearly as hooked or addicted, although I did beat the game in 2 sittings (but mostly because the game was pretty short and I'm a binge gamer).\n\nI'm sure if you're looking for a new metroid game and have been waiting for a good spiritual successor for a long time, you will be satisfied and enjoy Axiom Verge. I'm also sure that if you just love any metroid/vania that is out there as long as it has a decent production value, you'll also enjoy Axiom Verge. I guess I just went into it expecting to be blown away, and left with a mostly forgettable experience besides the art and music. Based on personal experience alone, I do not recommend this game at it's asking price.\n\nEDIT: Reading other's reviews, I immediately realized what I was trying to say but couldn't put it into words: The exploration was just not fun. I felt like I was going through the motions despite the game going \"Look, you can explore all this stuff over here!\" and never felt \"smart\" or \"engaged\" whenever I found a secret. The one secret world I found was drilling randomly into a wall, and the multiple pickups I found were just mainly backtracking to previous areas that had a non-hidden powerup behind a progress locked (literal key or powerup you get later in the game) gate to get a 1/6 heart piece that requires you to get 5 other pieces to get your health up a pip. The weapons you get are worthless usually as previously stated, so other than cool animations or some ridiculously niche usage, there is really no point to explore past some lore you might be interested in.", "timestamp_created": 1451728190, "timestamp_updated": 1451728785, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554556", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20208249": {"recommendationid": "20208249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036093254", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479014560}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game.

Not the best example of it, though. If you need a fix, you can't go wrong, but maybe you could go back and play Super Metroid too?\n\nTight gameplay, feels very natural with a controller in hand, though teleport-dash input is a glaring issue. It -really- needs to be bound to a button and not directional double-tap. \n\nThe corruption/glitch aesthetic is a nice twist and spices up the regular gameplay, changing enemies with your glitch ray and whatnot, but outside from that application it is dreadfully underutilized and never explored in any meaningful way other than to provide roadblocks and ability requirements.\n\nLarge but inconsistent weapon variety (some obviously strong, some nearly useless, many in between that are outshined by the more useful ones), visually impressive but weakly designed boss encounters, somewhat forgettable music. Graphics seem to be hit or miss on people, I found them a little lacking; aside from color there's few strong, consistent, eye-catching features of a given zone and everything is a bit bland and lacking flavor. But the outdoor environments were a little more pleasing.\n\nPlot is, without question, completely overrated by the majority of reviews I've seen. It's adequate, but there is little build-up and almost no sense of drama or weight to the events. The ending -- even the true ending -- is a little disappointing, and feels like there was supposed to be more gameplay to follow it up and conclude things better.\n\nI'm harshing on the game a bit here when the truth is that I enjoyed the time I put into it. It doesn't hold your hand or tell you where to go, letting you get immersed into exploring each zone at your leisure. The exploration and puzzles are done well and hit all the right buttons, though it has a habit of throwing a lot of branching paths at you that result in dead ends, forcing you to backtrack because you don't have a given ability. But that's an issue about the genre itself, isn't it?\n\nI would like to give this game a negative rating, just to balance out the average a little and make it more representitive of the quality of the game, but... I get the feeling that's like yelling into a windstorm so nuts to it.\n\n(I personally think the teleport dash is kickin' rad, more games need teleport dashes)", "timestamp_created": 1451542580, "timestamp_updated": 1451544319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20138327": {"recommendationid": "20138327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024081964", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451536025}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is quite the throwback to every metroidvania you can think of and delivers on a lot of the same vibes while subverting your expectations at the same time.

Regardless of the guns or upgrades you end up having they end up being a frustrating and demoralizing thing to be constantly fighting as you backtrack (or progress) through the world.\n\nThe saddest culmination of the bad enemy design is definitely the bosses, most of which either end up being \"stand in one spot and shoot\" or \"find this very specific way to cheese it out\". Neither of which would be a problem if there was something inbetween those two difficulty extremes.\n\nIn general I'd still say it's a great game with some cool inventive weapons, the sole issue is with enemy design, and it pains me to pick fault with it because of how incredible the game is otherwise.

It's got an intrigueing story, although a lot of it is left to interpretation. Besides the main story line, there's plenty of notes hidden around the world that give additional insight to what is actually going on. The graphics are based on old NES style games and vary quite a lot in quality, with the Rusalki taking the prize. Concidering the self-imposed limitations they're absolutely stunning. The music has some really high quality tunes, though some are just plain annoying to listen to, and since it's a metroidvania game you'll be hearing each region's music quite a lot. \n\nThe mechanics are fairly straight-forward for the most part of the game. You run, jump and shoot. It gets old fast, but once you've gotten a fair chunk in to the game it starts to losen up with additional move sets, and nearing the end the flexibility in movement is quite fun. It never gets to Super Metroid levels of variety, but they've got some fun ideas that work well. As far as the weapons go (there's a lot of them), most of them range anywhere from highly situational to useless. The first few are more or less glorified keys to open locked doors.\n\nThe world is large, but it's deceptively linear. You can go to a lot of places, roaming around looking for secrets and whatnot, but the actual progression though the game is more or less straight. There are plenty of optional weapons and upgrades you can pick up whenever, but each essential item is required to get the next at every point.\n\nIt's a good game and I had fun roaming the world of Sudra. Wether it's a game for you depends mostly on if you like the old metroidvania games, since it's just that. There's some new ideas and angles, some of which work. Others not so much.

Be sure to get some nice, quality headphones or speakers, a good game pad, a comfortable chair and a few of your favorite snacks, because this game is going to take you on a journey.  I'm not being metaphorical.  This game will fill your ears with other-worldly sounds and your eyes with dancing colors, but most of all, your mind with a tale so engrossing, you will forget where you are and become lost in it for hours.\n\nI'm going to be 38 soon.  I've played many a game in my day.  I own a ton of games spanning many platforms from many generations.   It takes a lot to hold my attention anymore.  I've probably invested thousands of hours into games like D1, 2 & 3.  Starcraft, Dune, Warcraft, C&C, Sim City ect.   Even though I grew up playing them, I don't play a lot of platformers anymore.  I lean towards rpg's, rts's and games like Bioshock.  However, Axiom Verge had a Sci-Fi look that appealed to me.  So I bought it without expecting to ever really finish it.  I just wanted a nice distraction.  Well I got much, much more out of this game than I ever expected.\n\nAxiom Verge is a labor of love, and it shows in every facet of the game.  From gameplay mechanics, to the detailed sprite artwork to the absolutely incredible soundtrack throughout the game, it just feels so damned polished, it's a fantastic journey into the imagination.   It's mind blowing to think, one guy developed this title by himself over the course of five years.  \n\nThere's just so much I could say about this games polish and presentation, but it's been said before.  So I'll just say this:  This is one of those games that will draw you in, and you will litterally miss it when it's over.

I'd call the game \"tentatively recommended...with many caveats\".  Lacking such a rating category, I'll have to lean on the side of not recommending it.\n\nMy number one complaint about the game is that the secrets, of which there are many, are handled in far, far too archaic a manner.  Basically there are tons of blocks which appear solid but can be passed in one way or another; some are telegraphed visually, but many are not.  This makes upgrade/secret hunting an excruciatingly tedious process of trying your several wall bypassing abilities on nearly every wall in the game.  This isn't fun.  Upgrade hunting in Metroidvanias is rewarding when there's some hint or indication that you can come back and get something later - and you remember it and do so.  Stumbling into a hidden room because you exhaustively tried every ability on every wall in the adjoining area doesn't make you feel clever, it makes you feel like your time is being wasted by a developer who has no concept of fairness.\n\nI finished the game with barely half of its available weapon arsenal, which I only realized upon consulting a guide after the fact.  Some were hidden so fiendishly that I'm surprised a developer would go so far out of their way to discourage the average player from getting to experience some of the more entertaining weapons that said developer surely put good effort into creating.  Even if you do find some of them, most can only be obtained so late in the game that you never really have much time to play with them anyway, which is a shame because they are all pretty interesting and fun to use.\n\nMany details of game's story are similarly buried in hard to find journal entries, and from what I gather it seems like the developer is a bit too enamored with his grand designs there as well.  It's overly complex and too obfuscated for the passive manner in which its delivered and I once again can't understand the logic of putting all that effort into it, only to then hide it except from the most obsessive of players.\n\nNow that being said -  you can ignore the secrets, ignore the story, play the game in a straightforward manner - and it manages to be a decent Metroidvania, although even then not without foibles. Primary among them is a type of dash ability obtained roughly half-way through the game.  This is activated by double tapping a movement direction which, when playing with an analog stick (an absolutely fine input method before that point) is often accidentally activated when you don't want it to, and annoying to pull off with appropriate timing when you do want to use it.  A button dedicated to the dash would have been preferable.\n\nThe tile based graphics are also a little too slavishly retro for my taste, to the extent that I'd even call the game ugly in parts, and on several occasions I had trouble distinguishing between foreground and background tiles.  In my defense, this is because there are places the sames tiles are actually used for both - which is another of the misleading methods by which paths to items are hidden.\n\nThe difficulty can range from infuriating to a breeze, completely dependent on what weapons you've found.  While the ease with which some bosses can be dispatched with optional weapons would be a good reason to encourage exploration - as a new player experiencing the game for the first time, you have no idea that these weapons are out there to be found.\n\nUltimately, I had some fun with the core game, but took no joy in the exploration and backtracking because of how things were hidden and that's pretty damning for a Metroidvania.

Gets a lot of influence from the Metroid series without actually being Metroid. This is not a clone. You run, jump, shoot, backtrack, find upgrades, but apart from that, it is very different.

It sort of recreates that Metroidish feeling of \u201cI can\u2019t get to that area yet, but I bet there\u2019s an item that\u2019ll help me,\u201d but it is not an item that you\u2019d think it\u2019d be. There\u2019s no morph ball, no space jump, no missiles. You instead get a creative tool or ability you wouldn\u2019t expect and because of that, it really captures that first sense of wonder when playing Metroid for the first time. \n\nThe story is average. The premise is the common, \u201cThere is a bad guy, and you are the only one who can help us\u201d with a plot twist or two. The setting is very interesting and unique, but being a unique and complex world, it can be confusing without finding and collecting the in-game notes about it.\n\nAxiom Verge was made by one person, and I gotta say I am very well damned impressed this guy created all this.

Exploration, upgrades, weapons, etc. The question, is what differentiates Axiom Verge from its best competitors in the genre? Metroid-style games are common, and there are plenty of great examples that populate the modern PC game library. Ori and the Blind Forest, Guacamelee, Shadow Complex, and Mystik Belle are all good games that fall in the category.\n\nOn the surface, Axiom Verge looks and feels like the classic NES Metroid. Deep down, it STILL feels like the classic NES Metroid, except it has tighter controls and a few neat tricks (like phasing through walls and corrupting enemies with a glitch-gun).\n\nWhat TRULY makes Axiom Verge stand above its competitors, is its ability to captivate the player by allowing them to get lost in an alien world. While all of the above-mentioned metroidvania games guide the player's exploration by bombarding them with \"Go here next\" hints, objective markers, and compasses, Axiom Verge stands alone by refusing to hold your hand and tell you where to go next. The main design aspect that seperated Metroid & Super Metroid from Metroid Fusion, was that the first two never held your hand. Instead they allowed you to, again, get lost in a mysterious alien world.\n\nSo... Is Axiom Verge innovative? No, but it does what it set out to do so well that you might even recapture the same feelings you felt when you popped a Super Metroid cart into your SNES for the first time. Axiom Verge is a captivating game with much to see and do.\n\nThe plot is mysterious and full of twists. Trace, the oddly-named main character, is a hapless victim of an accident that throws him deep inside of an unknown world, alone and unguided. The level design is engaging and packed with tons optional upgrades and weapons. Speaking of which, there are over 20 unique weapons, and a lot of them are just plain crazy. I can't forget to mention that there are plenty of ways to traverse the labyrinthine world of Axiom Verge, from ceiling-hook swinging Bionic Commando-style, to airdashing, to teleporting through thin walls, to remotely controlling small drones.\n\nYou might be thinking \"This is kind of expensive for such an old-looking game.\" But I assure you that Axiom Verge is one of the finest games in its genre. It isn't short either. Of 48 players polled, it took over 11 hours on average to complete the game.", "timestamp_created": 1451047267, "timestamp_updated": 1451047267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 183, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.909687", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19925420": {"recommendationid": "19925420", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990036156", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 208, "playtime_forever": 1053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494756152}, "language": "english", "review": "OK, I have at long last finally completed this game.\n\nAlright, the game is just so well done that I have to change this review into a recommendation despite it's absurd price tag.\n\nSo, this game is another retro metroidvania on steam that was built with love and as such its brimming with content. It is extremely well polished and designed, the engine used is fantastic and smooth, the sound is extremely well done as well as the music, the story is excellent, really everything is is perfect. It is one of the best ever retro games on steam..... However, it isn't as popular as one would expect such a well made game to be and this is due to two very serious problems.\n\nThe first problem is the controls. Now, don't get me wrong, the actual movement in the game is absolutely fantastic. The actual problem is that the game can only be played specifically with an xbox controller. Keyboard cannot be used, other controllers cannot either, the game was designed with the xbox controller in mind and it shows. As such, if you do not have an xbox controller the game is unplayable and you cannot buy it.\n\nThe second problem is the price. The standard price for games like this is 15 dollars, there are plenty of similar games around steam and they cost 15 dollars at most. This is 20 dollars, that is simply too much to ask for. There is no reason for this to cost 20 dollars. It does not offer better graphics than similar games nor does it offer more content and gameplay. As such, I don't recommend buying this game unless you have first played dust: an elysian tale as well as Ori and the blind forest. They're cheaper and just as good... but if you have finished them, and you really have the money, and want the same good production value, then by all means buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1451012592, "timestamp_updated": 1474538292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482602", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19919491": {"recommendationid": "19919491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105659835", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467999528}, "language": "english", "review": "I own Axiom Verge on both PC and PS4 and its simply a fantastic game.

OPTIONS!  So much of the game is optional, it really rewards exploration.\nTo expound on point 3, it is common in games of this genre for the player to spend a lot of time retracing their steps trying to find the way to progress the story forwards.  Axiom Verge is no exception here but it is less irrirating because you will frequently stumble across a new weapon, health upgrade, or extra story element.\n\nAxiom Verge is an outstanding example that future games of this genre will be compared against.

Not only do I recommend this game, but I also recommend Mr. Happ make sequel, if only for the music alone. 9.2/10", "timestamp_created": 1450418032, "timestamp_updated": 1450418032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19755001": {"recommendationid": "19755001", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967803170", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512309735}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

The textures are very rough and sterile, they have no flavour, no distinct, striking pattern. It's simply a cheap and loveless surrounding - all the time. You are not immersed in the environment, you don't feel like you wanna be a part of it. The music sadly supports this strongly, cheap 8-bit-like noises instead of soundtracks. I simply never felt welcome or intrigued by new environments, speaking of which:\nThey appear way too often. The map, which is really small over all, is neatly divided into sectors, but within those you have like 5 different environments as well. Sometimes it feels like one environment is 3 screens wide. It changes too fast for you to develope an emotional connection. \n\nThe bossfights are cheap as fuck, and there is no end boss fight. wtf?\nThere are like 12 beams, why? You literally play with one long range and one short range, period. You cannot combine them or anything, they are simply useless. \nSafe rooms are 2 tall, not that I care, but WHY? It is utterly random.\nTools. You don't need them or they get replaced. The drill is annoying as fuck but for the most part your only tool to detect secrets. \nThe story is the nail in the coffin. It started out really good and I felt compelled to uncover the truth, well, the game ends before you even know what's going on. No kidding. You struggle the entire time with little bits, playing puzzling in your head until the end, and then there is no real surprise or anything. The concept is amazing, but it played out SO badly..\n\nStill, there ARE some good things about this game, some gimmicks are innovative and fun to play with. The story is a let down in the end, but keeps you driven most of the time. \nAll in all, no real recommendation for people who would like to see super metroid reborn.

The map is a large, sprawling affair, which makes for a huge game with lots of secrets.  For the most part, Axiom Verge defies the concept that collectibles need to be boring incremental boosts.  Gone are the missile packs littered around which expand your supply of already-more-than-you-need missiles.  Collectibles trend towards new weapons, new powers, or lore pick-ups, all of which add more life and variety to the game than just another ammo pack.  Obviously, there are still health and damage upgrades which are useful, albeit less inspiring, but the majority of items feel like they are expanding your toolbox or your immersion in the universe rather than just giving you more of the same thing.  \n\nOn the topic of powerups, you can't talk about Axiom Verge without talking about the late game mobility powerups.  Of course, you ACTUALLY CAN'T talk about the late game mobility powers, because spoilers...  Half the fun is unlocking the new powers, and realizing OH MY GOD, THAT JUST HAPPENED?  I'll just say that they are stupendously satisfying, and they are wonderfully subversive compared to what you think they are going to be.  Let it be known that Axiom Verge has the best not-a-morph-ball EVER.  \n\nOf course, with all that exploration, sometimes things can get TOO sprawling.  Get ready to backtrack.  A form of fast travel exists, but is unavailable for about the first half of the game and has a limited number of destinations.  The bigger complaint is that the exploration at times feels slightly aimless, as the new places opened up by acquiring a new powerup aren't obvious without good memory (or good notes) or some old fashioned wandering.  Finding the \"right path\" that progresses towards the end is occasionally confusing, and the story is light on explicit directional clues, favoring vague (sometimes barely stated) objectives like \"find the repair drones,\" etc.  To many people this reads like exactly what you want from a Metroid-like, though others may find the meandering slightly irritating.  \n\nThe story is sufficiently strange, and doesn't detract from the exploration, platforming, and combat.  Dialogue is infrequent, with details and extra mysteries revealing themselves with lore item secrets.  There is enough narrative depth to heighten the overall mood of the game, making it more weird and alien, but it generally steps aside to let the action and exploration elements take center stage (which is high praise for a Metroid-like).   \n\nThe game keeps up an old-school exterior in terms of sound design and graphics, and while that means Axiom Verge isn't always \"pretty,\" the game embraces these as features rather than limitations.  The \"glitchiness\" aspects certainly wouldn't work as effectively with a more modern look.  By adhering to these old school limitations for most of the time, the occassions where is does break from this orthodoxy become especially exciting.  When the screen zooms out to show a giant boss sprite, when you get distortion effects from using late-game mobility powers, and when you shoot the (extremely satisfying) Voranj weapon for the first time, there is a rush of surprised joy which wouldn't be as much of a high with a more modern look.  \n\nWhile the environment tilesets may be occasionally bland, the sprites (especially the bosses) and the giant-robot-as-tileset Rusalki are awe-inspiring.  The music serves as an effective mood setter for the game, creating a creepy and oppressive atmosphere.  This place really feels like an unfamiliar, hostile, alien world.\n\nThere are the little things, too, which show so much thought and care in the construction.  For example, the \"low-health beeps\" keep tempo with the background music to make them noticable but not irritating.  The weapon ring UI is the best use of a right analog stick that a 2D platformer could ask for, and ought to be copied by all and sundry.  (You listening, Mega Man?)  These things are nice little touches, and it shows that the creator (a one man team) paid attention to the details.  \n\nFor those of us raised on (raised by?) the NES and SNES, this is the best kind of trip down nostalgia lane.  For those whom these consoles of yore were before your time, consider this your point of entry.

I really liked the overall feel and tone of the narrative and how well everything seemed to tie together from the artwork, to the game mechanics, right on down to the narrative. Clearly the creator of this title had a stict vision for Axiom and belive it was realized quite well.\n\nOn the downside I have to say I was pretty disappointed with the boss fights. There are a few that I would consider fun and rewarding but they seem to get worse as the game drags on and many of them have a gimmick trick that can take them out in no time. The End Boss was especially lackluster and but overall I am still more than happy with this title.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1449476589, "timestamp_updated": 1449476589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547038", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19540355": {"recommendationid": "19540355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198228259756", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493084248}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um dos melhores jogos que ja joguei em anos!

Bosses were a bit too simple once you find the trick, but the wide assortment of weapons keeps you on your feet when it comes to taking out the normal enemies. Their AI is pretty dumb, I'll have to admit. The items in this game are diverse and really change up the gameplay in a way that doesn't just reproduce other Metroidvania items (well, except the grapple).\n\nAt nearly 11 hours, I completed the game with 75% items, 95% map revealed.

That means you'll be slowly amassing an aresenal of power-ups and weapons to beef up your player character, and using lateral thinking and exploration to unlock and discover new parts of it's mysterious and seemingly massive map. In Axiom Verge, by the end of the game, you'll likely have a massive weapon wheel, all with their own little quirks and benefits. You'll think about areas in a totally different way by the end of the game, as your movement options will increase exponentially. You'll chip away at the Map screen until all those squares are filled in. It's a classic, satisfying formula, and it works here. The level design matches the mechanics quite well, and the exploration feels very natural.\n\nI adore Metroid. I remember I went on a total binge of purchasing Metroid-vanias when it became moderately clear to me that Nintendo is currently kind of neglecting the franchise. ANYWAY. Axiom Verge is a love song to Super Metroid. It's the Interstellar to 2001, in a way. It's a hard game to live up to; most consider Super Metroid to be a masterpiece. And you can tell it's likely that Thomas Happ, the creator of Axiom Verge, probably does too. \n\nAnd therein lies one of the issues with the game. While there are many Metroid-vanias coming out nowadays which innovate the genre, Axiom Verge itterates does very little to distinguish itself in any truly meaningful way. Looking back, I can remember very little memorable or particularly excellent. Nothing truly bad, but nothing that had me enraptured. I thought the \"Rusalka\" were really cool, I remember some really neat puzzles, and the soundtrack having quite a few killer tracks, those stick out, I'll admit. But I don't really remember any unique level design. I don't really remember the name or feel of any areas (other than an area that takes place above ground). I don't really remember developing any engagement or attachment while running through its glitchpunk corridors.\n\nBut I DO remember the clearly Geiger-inspired visuals not being my cup of tea (this is ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE, however (obviously)). I remember boss battles which were so poorly designed they seemed like jokes. I remember combat that often felt finnicky and imprecise. I remember monotonous crawls through combat areas. I remember maybe a dozen weapons I never touched after acquiring them. I remember a plot so convoluted, silly, and engrossed in itself it just came across as pretentious. But most importantly, I remember a moment in the game where a necessary item was hidden in a giant mass of breakable blocks, inside a soulless random tile. At that point, I thought to myself, \"Something about this game isn't working.\"\n\nHey. Axiom Verge is by NO means a bad game. It's actually pretty good. Mechanically, the game is solid, with a few neat inventions here and there. If you're looking for a fix of Metroid like I was, this is a fine way to go. However, I would never introduce someone to the genre this way, and I find myself having trouble remembering anything I found truly notable or excellent about the game. Which I suppose isn't a bad thing. But it's not a good thing, either. \n\nSo, I guess Axiom Verge is a thing, that isn't necessarily bad, but isn't necessarily good either. Axiom Verge is a game.

Thomas Happ did an excellent job in creating not just a metroidvania game, but the classic 2D Metroid game.\n\nJust one look at Axiom Verge and you'll immediately get that Metroid feel. From the overall look & feel and level design to enemy types, weapons and play mechanics, Axiom Verge draws heavily from Nintendo's cult classic. And that is certainly a good thing in my book. This game is basically the original Metroid on steroids, made with modern tech and little to none of the annoying old limitations.\n\nYet, despite drawing so much from Metroid, one shouldn't dismiss just how original Axiom Verge actually is \u2014 Thomas Happ has created a unique world with interesting characters and story. Nor should anyone doubt the high quality of this game: the graphics and overall visual design are gorgeous, music and sound effects are atmospheric and fit the game perfectly, controls are spot on and everything is pretty much just right.\n\nJust as any Metroid game should, Axiom Verge features an extensive map, which is made up from different zones, all of which feature their own design and style. As you play you will slowly uncover more and more parts of the map, with some of them becoming available to you only after you'll get new upgrades and abilities. As you would expect, there is quite a lot of platforming in this game, with some of it being rather challenging, but none of it's really unfair \u2014\u00a0if some of it may seem that way, then you probably don't have the necessary equipment yet. Unlike most metroidvania games, which almost exclusively take place in rather small enclosed areas, Axiom Verge features some broad open areas, which nicely break up the the regular flow and add some additional variety to the game.\n\nThe boss fights in Axiom Verge are exciting, with bosses being interesting and huge, in fact some of them are so huge that the screen zooms out to be able to show them completely. As with most things in this game, some bosses are better fought with particular weapons that you may not have when first encountering them, so it may be a better option to keep exploring than fighting at the first possibility. As with the bosses, enemies in this game are very interesting both in design and behaviour/attack types and patterns.\n\nAmong the more unique game mechanics in Axiom Verge is the glitch gun, which serves many different purposes (like opening up passages, traversing the map, etc), but also can modify the enemy units. Glitching the enemies causes them to change in one way or another, gaining new properties, which you can utilise for your own purposes.\n\nAll in all Axiom Verge is a great game which you definitely should play, even if you aren't a fan of the genre. It's a darn shame that almost nobody did \u2014 at the time of the review, SteamSpy estimates the sales at ~29K copies.\n\nP.S.

With my only prior meteroidvania experience being Castlevania Symphony of the Night, I didn't know if I'd like a sci-fi one. The visuals in the game ALMOST look like they would belong on an NES, but just barely make it to the 16 bit look due to multiple layers of scrolling, and amounts of color on screen (would probably be on a turbografix 16/pc engine). I got this game through Indiebox, and I'm glad I did, because I got a bunch of stuff, including a map of the game, which helped out a lot. I only really have 3 issues with this game. The first one, is backtracking. This metroidvania doesn't really have a teleportation system, exept for the INDI area, which is a glorified version of a teleporter that takes longer than one. I didn't mind the backtracking too much, but it's something to keep in mind when buying this game. Second is the PC port. I think the PC port is fine for the most part, but I'm experiencing an issue where when I'm simply playing the game, my computer doesn't recognise my controller's input as an input to the computer, so it goes into sleep mode. This is really annoying, but it can be circumvented by using big picture mode (even though it's inconvinient). My third issue is the end. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but this isn't one of those game where you feel acomplished at the end for overcoming what you faced, at least not to the extent of a lot of other games.\nOther than those issues, I can reccomend this game.

It isn't completely flawless, but if you're looking for something to scratch that itch, this is it.\n\nMore details:\nAxiom Verge is a great game, and basically none of the complaints I saw on the negative reviews here at steam seemed to be even factually correct by my own experience. It has contra-style aiming, there's a decent number of bosses, which are for the most part clever and interesting; the game has plenty of challenge to it and lots of things to discover. It's largely completionist-friendly: There is nothing missable; there are some bonus areas that appear in random locations but they don't count for the game's \"official\" 100%, which is good enough for me. Playing this game is fun and satisfying; there are puzzles everywhere, many of which have more than one intriguing solution.\n\nThere are a few complaints, mainly falling toward the end of a game, and none of them really make me not want to play it again. \nThe story ends in a somewhat unsatisfying way; I like the mystery of it, but it leaves too many questions completely unanswered, even after reading all of the notes. It tries to be a story people talk about and try to figure out, but it feels like it was written without even the author knowing the truth behind everything. I prefer stories with satisfying conclusions: The universe is saved, you win, that sort of thing; even leaving some hints that things aren't as they seem alongside something like that would be better.\nThe final boss was a breeze, which should never be the case. To be clear, I had 100% of the items in the game, but that's no excuse. By comparison, the final bosses of Metroid Fusion and Zero Mission are so tough that unless you went out of your way to get more items than you normally run across or are just ridiculously good at it you'll probably get killed, and the latter is made even harder if the player has 100%. In this case, the section before the final boss was harder than the boss itself. After the challenge and cleverness of most of the earlier bosses, this was a bit of a let-down.\nThere were some really clever puzzles with the game's \"glitch gun\" that alters the behavior of enemies it hits in the last section, and I really wish the game had more puzzles like that, possibly replacing some basic \"gotcha\" items in non-obvious walls.\n\nOverall, though, it was fun. I never really had a complaint while I was playing the game, and what complaints I have come up with were on reflection rather than in the experience.

Weil in Sachen Story und Leveldesign isses prinzipiell nicht schlecht (Stichwort Secrets), es k\u00f6nnte aber an manchen Stellen noch etwas besser sein. Die Levels bieten oftmals wenig \"Einzigartiges\" in Sachen Plattforming.\n\nDie Steuerung f\u00fcr eine gewisse F\u00e4higkeit im sp\u00e4teren Spiel ist nicht ideal gel\u00f6st, da man zweimal hintereinander eine Pfeiltaste dr\u00fccken muss. Mit dem Xbox 360-Pad hat es mich nicht gest\u00f6rt, kann aber durchaus Leute verstehen, die dann ungewollt den Skill einsetzen. Das sind die einzigen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Kritikpunkte, die ich an Axiom Verge auszusetzen h\u00e4tte.\n\nDaf\u00fcr sind die Abschnitte atmosph\u00e4risch, sch\u00f6n abwechslungsreich und vom Gegnerdesign ziemlich gut umgesetzt.\nMit dem Address Disruptor kann man Gegner \u00e4hnlich wie bei Grafikfehlern von fr\u00fchen Konsolenspielen \"glitchen\", die sich dann ganz anders verhalten, z. B. Lebensenergie geben oder sich in benutzbare Plattformen verwandeln.\nExperimentieren lohnt sich! Es wird zudem f\u00fcr einige Geheimnisse ben\u00f6tigt.\n\nUnd der Soundtrack ist einfach fantastisch. Wer auch nur ansatzweise f\u00fcr Videospiel-Musik zu haben ist, dem brennt sich der OST sehr schnell ins Hirn. Sehr eing\u00e4ngigen Melodien, die wunderbar zu den Leveln passen. Dass die Lebensanzeige immer passend zum Rhtyhmus der Musik pulsiert, ist ein nettes kleines Detail.\n\nWeiter positiv sind die wirklich vielen Waffen hervorzuheben, auch wenn man nicht alle von denen jemals benutzt. In manchen Situation kann es durchaus hilfreich sein, mal eine andere Wumme auszuprobieren, etwa bei den Bossen, die die K\u00e4mpfe teilweise sp\u00fcrbar einfacher machen. Generell ist das kein Hardcore-Roguelike und auch kein Dark Souls, die Speicherpunkte sind fair verteilt, daf\u00fcr h\u00e4lt Tracer nicht allzuviele Treffer aus. Wenn man nicht blind vorprescht, ist ein Durchkommen absolut kein Problem, bis auf 1-2 Bosse, wo ich mehrere Versuche gebraucht hatte.\n\nVom Umfang brauchte ich knapp 11 Stunden inkl, letztem Boss und Suchen nach einigen Items, bis ich durch war. Und es fehlen noch 9% an Gegenst\u00e4nden sowie 3% der Karte, die ich unbedingt noch haben will.\nWobei fairerweise auch Nintendo mit ihren Metroid-Spielen selten so viel mehr Umfang hat(te) und die Titel zum Vollpreis verkauft hat. Und dank Speedrun-Option und Hardmode in Axiom Verge plus dem Entdecken aller Items relativiert sich der Preis wieder.\n\nWen die Ecken und Kanten an dem Spiel nicht st\u00f6ren, kann bedenkenlos zugreifen. Sonst w\u00fcrde ich auf einen Sale warten.\nAuf jeden Fall hat es mir sehr gut gefallen.

You start on a strange alien planet with nothing more than your wits. Progression comes by acquiring new abilities that give you access to new areas. The world eventually opens up, and there are lots of places to explore and secrets to uncover.\n\nVery quickly, however, Axiom Verge subverts your expectations of a game of this sort, especially if you've played Metroid before. You'll see blocks and places and think \"Oh, I'll use bombs here\" or \"I'll get a morph ball later\". By the second ability you get, the game gives you a completely different way to progress past them. The methods of travel and manipulation tools you get crazier as you go on, and like any good entry in the genre, by the end you can zoom around and steamroll enemies with ease.\n\nGetting there will be a long road, as the game puts up a decent challenge at its regular difficulty. The regular enemies start off simple enough, but later ones have attacks and abilities that will catch you off guard the first time you encounter them. While you can brute force your way through them, knowing your abilities and weapons will give you an easier time when dealing with them. The bosses don't evolve quite as much, but they mostly manage to be intense, fun encounters. If you love exploration and puzzles, this game has you covered as well, as some of the most difficult secrets will require you to know the game's mechanics and require you to pay careful attention to your surroundings to claim your rewards.\n\nThe exploration and fights are a pleasant experience since the presentation is excellent. The world of Axiom Verge looks very nice and retro, with a style that gives an appropriately otherworldly feel, and even manages to make graphical glitches significant. The music has an old-school feel, and like the graphics manages to evoke the feel of a wondrous,  unfamiliar place.\n\nThe high points Axiom Verge hits makes the low points all the more glaring. The coolness of the best items makes the ones that aren't as subversive or useful that much more disappointing. While each map looks great on its own, they don't connect together well, with one example being an area with a night sky connected to an area with a daytime sky. The story has potential, and looks like it might go in some interesting directions, but it drops plot points and world elements as quickly as it introduces them. In the end, most of the consequences of the game's events are waved away, although the ones that aren't leave things open for interpretation.\n\nEven then, the flaws don't detract enough from the game's best moments. Axiom Verge is a great experience that looks like a straight tribute to Metroid, but eventually forges its own path, and largely succeeds at it.

I just wish there were some hidden starting abilities.\n\nWhile there is a lot of weapon variety many of them end up being useless. They don't rack up the kind of damage or range that either the lightning shotgun (the third weapon) and the starting weapon will do.\n\nI was very dissipointed with the ending. I really wanted to have the main character change their mind or find some way to do it, but it appears there is only the one ending where I think the protagonist honestly acted quite foolish which goes against their supposed character of a critically thinking scientist.\n\nBut I can't say to not get this game. It has so much going for it. You will not be dissipointed if you like any similar games. The music at the very least is pretty good and as far as gameplay there are few that are as good in the genre.

Its just beautiful. Its a standard 2d Metroidvania with mazelike maps, areas you cant get to until you get certain powerups, backtracking, savepoints, many different interesting weapons and items. That all is pretty vanilla for the genre. The story is minimal (so far) but is interesting enough to make me want to keepo uncovering more of the plot. You are a scientist who was performing some kind of high-energy beam experiment when *dun dun dun* something went horribly wrong and the building you were in collapsed on your head. But instead of dying you got sucked into a world that looks like one of Geiger's fever dreams. You have no idea why you're here and you hear a voice in your head...\n\n What makes it beyond awesome is the atmosphere and music. Creepy biomech monsters and pulsing slimy organic-looking masses in the background seem like something right out of Aliens or Metroid, and a driving electronic musical score that perfectly matches the creepy bio-alien feel. Its Metroid if Metroid was done by an indie studio in 2015. Its pixel art, but very very well made pixel art with modern depth and DPI. The controls are fluid and very well executed which is always an absolute requirement in a game like this, and the controller mapping is fully customizable. If you f'd a jump or got hit,  its your fault, not the fault of the controls.

I would not, read on to learn why.\n\nKind of saddens me to not reccomend this game to be honest, it's very well crafted but there's only so much bull shit a man can take.  Regular enemies that take way too much damage, frustrating bosses, a dash mechanic that would be awesome if it had a dedicated button rather than having to tap away on the d-pad, weapons that don't really add a whole lot to the game.  I love the Metroid series which this pays homage to in many regards but honestly I feel this game pales in comparison. \n\nIt's like the developer played Super Metroid and though it wasn't diffuicult enough.  This game is more like Metroid than super Metroid, it's progressive in terms of scope and variety of pick ups, but a complete step backwards in terms of approachability.  Filling your game with enemies with too much health and unavoidable attacks just saps all the fun out of it and the bosses later on are just awful.  I would even argue that the exploratory nature of the game is hamstrung at a certain point I wanted to go back to explore old areas and find items so I could get more health to help ease the pain of a boss fight, but I was trapped in one area until I beat said boss and collected a certain item.   \n\nThe visual design is excellent but the music is so-so it loops quickly and repeats often so even the tracks I enjoyed I got sick of fairly quickly.

A lot of the environments in the game are quite visually striking too, albeit a bit self-indulgent. Lately that's the only thing that kept me going through the game. \n\nBut even so, the design of these maps are painfully outdated. The original metroid could get away with endless vertical climbs and recycled enemies with boosted health because of hardware limitations. I hate to use this cliche', but it's 2015, level design must have meaning (I'm talking to the thoughless amount of dead ends through corridors in Axiom Verge) many of the places I jump to, have no meaning, no puzzle, it wastes the player's time. \n\nWhat made metroidvania games so good in the past, was their incredibly fast pacing and constant gratification of finding secrets throughout the map. Some of those \"metroidvania\" traits exist here, but they are too far apart, or you're busy jumping to a place that leads to a dead end. It's a horrible paradox to make such bad mistakes in level design, then forcing the player to explore it. \n\nThis review is critical on purpose, because your style enticed me- \"Megaman, Metroid and Contra all packed into one, this game was created by someone who appreciates videogames\" or so I thought. \n\nThis game has the clunky shooting of the original Megaman (you can't run while shooting down, you must stand still everytime you want to shoot) and the painstaking backtracking of the original Metroid. \n\nYou obviously have a talent for creating spawling alien atmospheres, you're an artist, I appreciate your tastes. I see you made this thing all my yourself too but you must have input from other people, especially for map design. \n\nDon't recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1447435344, "timestamp_updated": 1447435344, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563291", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19047692": {"recommendationid": "19047692", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978351587", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447464368}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

This is one person's attempt to create a truly modern 2D Metroid-like game, using all the lessons learned from the best of the best in genre and adding new elements, that weren't tried in the genre before. This game has exciting exploration, varied locales, fantastic soundtrack, unique visuals that mix old-school 8bit and 16bit era art with subtle modern effects, surprisingly good challenge for the most part and a very interesting atmosphere that can probably be summarised as \"sci-fi adventure as if Another World/Out of This World was designed by H.R. Giger\".\n\nIt's not without flaws or questionable decisions. Challenge in the opening parts, before some upgrades, feels higher than you'd expect from a Metroid-like game, with action not being tight enough to justify that. Boss battles look great, but only 2 actually feel fun to play, with most others just being \"shoot shoot shoot die already it's getting annoying shoot shoot\" deals. Game features some random elements in the way of \"Secret Worlds\", which, in concept, are cool, but make the \"exploration\" part of the genre most loved for it, a bit less rewarding, because the areas are random and you have no chance of getting everything in one run. Some of the navigation moves just feel clunky to pull off, especially the very important one, that requires directional double-tap - most of the run-and-shoot actually plays better with an analogue stick, but these are very hard to pull off and are frustrating even on a d-pad, no matter what gamepad you use. And finally, the story and dialogue feel rather averagly written, which is sad simply because the setup and situations they show are actually very interesting. So, story, while often predictable, is exciting to experience and the world lore is out there to be found, but both are just told in a very mediocre way.\n\nThat said, the game is still fantastic, especially due to its innovation in treating death more like a... well, Souls game, I guess will be the most understandable comparison. That is - death does bring you back to the last save room you used, but you keep all the unlocked map squares, items and everything that is permanently done (like killing a boss or triggering a cutscene) stays done. This, along with the idea that enemies do not respawn immidiatelly after leaving the room and instead after you move two rooms away, makes exploration so much more fun, while not simplifying the rules to the point, where it gets boring.\n\nOne of the best recent games in genre which, while probably isn't as full of awesomeness as La-Mulana or Aquaria, still feels like a solid \"proper full game\" that you'd get full priced 15 years ago and love it.

To be perfectly clear, I'm thumbing up the game BARELY because the price is out of control. I got it on sale for $14 and that's a lot closer to what it's worth.\n\nThis is a metroidvania (clearly) and is more similar to the original metroid in aesthetic and exploration than most recent entries. Unfortunately some of the upgrades are very nice but others fall very flat. Specifically, the primary weapon is a bit ridiculous. There are serveral types of \"beam\" that you can pick up, but you can only have two equipped at once and toggle between them without going to the menu. Further, they're all really very boring weapons. I found myself relying mainly on the first gun until I got the other one that shoots straight for long distances, then my alt weapon was the one that could penetrate walls a little. Not very exciting. Another annoying design quirk is the \"lock\" button. In Metroid games you can lock your firing angle in various ways depending on which entry in the series you're playing, but in Axiom Verge you hold a button to lock your position instead, so the d-pad controls firing angle instead of movement. Look, the Metroid systems aren't perfect, but they allow for highly mobile combat and they feel natural. The position lock in this game is immersion breaking, even after having been used to it for a couple hours.\n\nSome of the other items are quite nice though. Instead of a morph ball you get a remote drone that you can fire and then control. It can go just about anywhere so long as it's not blocked by high jumps or otherwise un-navigable terrain. You can even leave the area you left your body in and continue exploring. When the drone dies or self-destructs you return to your body. That's pretty neat, really.\n\nThe other main items are a disruptor and a laser drill. The laser drill is kind of a more convenient version of Metroid's bomb weapon - mainly intended to break holes in certain walls. The disruptor works to corrupt the reality of certain blocks or enemies and can make some interesting things happen when used in the right place. For example, there's one enemy that looks like a big coral and shoots out annoying projectiles that fly around in random directions. If you get the leve 2 disruptor you can corrupt it and it shoots out health instead.\n\nThe length of the game isn't too bad. I've been playing for a few hours and I'm at less than 20%. I'm smart enough to not use a guide/FAQ until after I've beat the game though, so YMMV if you spoil yourself.\n\nAnyway, it's [i]certainly[/i] not worth $20.

instead you get a drone with its one health, damage and attack for small corridors or to scout ahead of areas which is not only very clever to make a safe route to your destination but is also pretty fun to attack with at times, but that is just an extra function for the Axiom Disruptor, the most broken weapon is the Flamethrower pretty much incinerating every-living-thing in your path.\n\nthe sound design is also well made, the songs fits the enviroments and gives you the feeling of isolation yet, determined to push ahead to the dangers to come.\n\nbut the most challening part of the games are the bosses, in metroid all the bosses are somewhat bigger to fit the levels they are made in, but they arent that huge, BUT in Axiom Verge the bosses are HUGE, and instead of just shooting what moves you actually have to plan carefully what you do agains them and where their weakpoints are and how you approach them.\n\nif you need another reason why you need to play the game, check out plenty of other reviews.\n\nhave fun and game on!\n-AssaultPowerX", "timestamp_created": 1446057130, "timestamp_updated": 1446057130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18723577": {"recommendationid": "18723577", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973608826", "num_games_owned": 471, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445968938}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]rating: worth buying at sale price (<15\u20ac)\nscore: 8/10 - very good \nsimilar games: Super Metroid\ntags: metroidvania, platformer, exploration\n[/b]\n\nAxiom Verge's biggest inspiration was clearly Super Metroid, one could even call it a cheap copy of it and I wouldn't object, The level structure, the world design, the enemy design, the pacing, everything really feels like Super Metroid and I can say that as someone who didn't even play Super Metroid for that long. However everything also is a bit worse than in Super Metroid to be honest. That doesn't mean it's a bad game, it's still very good actually, but in this review I will mainly talk about the things I didn't like,  because I think those are always more important factors for someone who is thinking about buying the game.\n\nThere are a surprising amount of weapons in the game, some of them are also a bit harder to find, and that's cool, but the difference between the weapons is so minor or some weapons are so extremely situational that you will maybe use it just 3 or 4 times or so. I think the developer could easily \"merge\" the functionality of some weapons together who kinda fullfil the same role. For example you get a spreadshot which shoots 3 projectiles in a cone with very low range, but then you get a weapon which shoots electricity in a cone but this one can also shoot through walls and does more damage too. \nOr you have like 4 different weapons which just shoot projectiles forward with just really small differences, and then you have a weapon which covers the whole screen but does little damage. The sound design of the weapons is also not great.\n\nThen there are the enemies. A lot of enemies just have their movement pattern and technically \"ignore\" you, you just have to watch out that you don't touch them or their attacks. The game had too many enemies like that for my taste. I find these enemies annoying most of the time, because they prevent you from traversing the enviroment, because they crawl along the paths you have to go most of the time. And that is a problem since this a metroidvania and you will backtrack A LOT in this game. There are also more aggressive enemies, some really cool ones, but also a lot of really annoying enemies. Some have attacks which are undodgable, well, in theory you could dodge some attacks I guess, but in practice it's just annoying. Much later in the game there are enemies you can only dodge using the teleport ability, but using the teleport ability is really fiddley so sometimes weird things happen.\nBecause the weapons aren't well designed overall and there are more annoying enemies than fun to fight, the combat isn't the strongest suite of this game.\n\nWhat was really dissapointing, like REALLY dissapointing, were the bossfights. Visually they are really really well designed, but they have extremely weird attack patterns, weird weak spots and the fights mostly consist of standing in the right spot and spamming the shoot button. It also doesn't help that the bossfight music is the same for every boss.\nAll of these annoyances get even worse at the last quarter of the game where the game sends you from one end of the world to the other just to get an item, then back to the other end of the world and then somewhere else. On your way the game throws one room full of enemies at you after the other with the thoughest enemies of the game. But because this gets so tedious and annoying I just wanted to rush through past all enemies or was too lazy to go to a save room or something which even led to more frustrating moments.\n\nAnyway, that was a lot of criticism, I still really like this game. First of all I think the game does a good job with the metroidvania aspect (good, not great). There are a lot of different pick ups you can find, not only weapons and items you need to progress, but also stat upgrades and stuff like that. I also like how all the areas are connected with each other and how the game guides you a bit through it`s world. However you can easily forget where you can go and where you know you need an item for. This could easily be solved if the game just let you put notes on the map, an infinite number of notes with custom text, currently you can just mark 2 spots per area which doesn't help at all. A good example of what I mean is Legend of Grimrock 2. The difference between your character at the start of the game and at the end is so extremely huge, you really feel the progress you made.\n\nThe story of the game starts really simple and boring actually, and after reading the first lines of dialouges I thought this will be a throwaway story, but over the course of your journey the story gets more and more interesting. The game also has some really neat surprises for you. The presentation and atmossphere are also really strong, the pixel art is really really good except for a few enemies, but sometimes you come across some really huge and incredible looking things. The music also fits the game really well, I especially like the subtle sounds when you are in the room before the bossfight.\n\nSo. The game has functional combat, good exploration, interesting story and nice atmossphere and music. It is also over 8 hours long which is nice, however as I said the last quarter of the game is really tedious. If you are a fan or metroidvanias the purchase is a no brainer for you, you probably already purchased it. For everyone else I recommend waiting for a small sale.", "timestamp_created": 1446020994, "timestamp_updated": 1446025730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541266", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18708269": {"recommendationid": "18708269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171845002", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503605897}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u043b\u044f \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0430 \"\u042f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e! \u041e, \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e, \u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\". \u041f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b \u0443\u0439\u043c\u0443 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435, \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0443\u0445\u0443 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0443.\n\u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432-\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043b\u043e\u043a", "timestamp_created": 1445937928, "timestamp_updated": 1480387767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18703374": {"recommendationid": "18703374", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988510453", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465854500}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't played metroid-vania games since back in the day, and this really re-ignited my love for the genre.

It tries very hard to be Super Metroid, and [i]nearly[/i] succeeds, and that's pretty good. \n\nActually, it has this weird identity crisis where it can't decide whether it wants to be Super Metroid or not. Despite having a nearly identical atmosphere and basic gameplay structure, not one of the upgrades you get works the same way as any upgrade in any Metroid game, except for extreme basics like your first gun and health upgrades. Trace starts out controlling much the same as Samus does at the start of Super Metroid, but then the two diverge wildly in play style as they progress through their respective games. In that sense, it is refreshing, and that makes it feel less like a simple retread of Super Metroid.\n\nThe game has many guns, but very few of them are useful. The handful of guns you are required to get by the plot are sufficient for most of the game, as ALL of your guns get more powerful when you find weapon upgrades. There is one secret gun that is absurdly overpowered and shreds the game's otherwise nearly-impossible final boss.\n\nThe plot is entirely incomprehensible. If you just focus on Trace's character, and the way he copes with the bizarre situation he's in and matures, the story is all right. There's a very good scene in one area where Trace begins hallucinating, and the area becomes more nightmarish as you progress through it.

The developer CLEARLY understands the target audience; the execution of this game is flawless. From pixel 1, I was engaged, entertained, challenged (but not frustrated), and taken aback at the quality of this production. Everything is flawless; the execution, the scenario, the music (oh, that wonderful soundtrack; music is the artwork of time, and graphics are the artwork of space), the artwork, EVERYTHING fits like a finely-tuned jigsaw puzzle. The only exception to this might be the confusing/clunky Grappling controls, but it's a very, VERY minor nit-picky thing at the extreme. \n\nThis game caters to anyone who liked Super Metroid. If that game holds a special place in your memories, this game is the game Nintendo SHOULD have produced DECADES ago as a sequel. I promise, if you liked SM, you will like this game equally as much, if not moreso, thanks to the larger variety of levels, and the awesome soundtrack. \n\nThe passion that went into this game shows.

Like most metroidvania games, you explore a large and connected world doing things like platforming, shooting enemies, getting powerups, and getting new abilities that will help you solve puzzles, beat bosses, and generally progress in the game. There are also a good amount of secrets and some interesting story bits thrown in. The overall story is confusing and mysterious, which helps add to the alienated vibe of the game as well as making the plot more interesting. Without spoiling anything, the basic plot is that you play as Trace, a brilliant scientist that gets caught in a lab explosion, loses consciousness, and winds up in an unknown place. It's up to you to figure where you are, what happened, and how to get home. \n\nAs mentioned, the gameplay is mainly platforming, shooting, exploring, and some mild puzzle solving. You can find a good variety of items if you look hard enough. You can get powerups to increase the damage, size, and range of your weapons, as well as expansions to your health. There are some passive powerups mixed in with tools that will give you new abilities, helping you progress through the game. There are some interesting notes you can find scattered throughout the world that will give you more bits and pieces to the mysterious story as well. However, the coolest part is that you can find a lot of cool weapons. A few are required to get through the game, but many of them are found by exploring. These weapons all have their own unique qualities. It's nice because they are well balanced and do not require extra ammo. They all have inifinite ammo, meaning you can play around with them all you like. So you can use certain weapons to effectively fight certain enemies, cycle through all your weapons to vary your gameplay, or just pick your weapon of choice and have a ball! It adds a layer of fun to the discovery of new weapons. Plus, the controls are tight and the control scheme is fairly comfortable.\n\nThe art is very colorful yet fitting to the world of unknown mystery and wonder. I also found myself really liking the soundtrack a lot. Sounds a bit John Carpenter-esque to me. It's crazy how Tom Happ has managed to do such a great job with the gameplay, the art, and the music basically all by himself. The package as a whole comes together beautifully. The dark, mysterious atmosphere and cool techno influences mixed with a bit of alien flair make for an engaging experience that sucks you into the game for hours.\n\nAs great as I think Axiom Verge is, there ARE some negative arguments to be had. It didn't run flawlessly on my computer, but my computer is a bit dated and worn out as well so I'm sure it was not a fault of the game... just thought I'd mention it slowed down in some of the larger, busier areas for me. Hardly worth complaining about. This game is clearly heavily inspired by the Metroid series, and while I love that... you could make the argument that it is borrowing from that inspiration a bit too heavily. I personally think it has enough differences and unique twists to make it work as an original game expanding on the genre, but I could understand some people not finding it distant enough from that source. It'd also be cool to have a bit more of a choice in some story elements, but ultimately it is a story that you have to follow and your character is Trace, not you, so I suppose it makes sense the way it is. My only real complaint with the game is that you get a dashing ability, but once you get it you cannot turn it off. This can be troublesome for precise movements because you dash by double tapping in a direction. So if you're trying to move forward and then stop to dodge something and move forward again too quickly... you'll dash instead of just moving. You can lock your position or turn all the way around on stopping to remedy it, but it is a touch adjustment and can still get you killed in some hectic situations while you move eradically. As far as replay value, it's probably not a game you'll start up again immediately after finishing it. There's hard mode, which seems to be about the same but harder, and speedrun mode for... well... speedrunning. So unless you want it to be more difficult, you want to speed through the game, or want to go hunting for achievements, then you probably will leave it alone after your playthrough. Though it DOES have good replay value in the sense that you'll definitely be coming back to it at some point to experience it all again, and the amount of playtime in your playthough is pretty good.\n\nSo there are a few bad points, but the good clearly outweighs the bad in this case. It's a decent length game with tons of things to find and a neat story. The music and art are very interesting as well. If you like Metroid, Super Metroid, or metroidvania games in general, then you'll definitely appreciate this game. Honestly, it's probably one of the best games I've played on Steam. So the question is... is it worth the price? And for this one, the answer is yes. 20 dollars for 15-20 hours of great gameplay is definitely worth your time and money. If you're on the fence about waiting for a sale or just getting it full price, get it. It's worth it and it's worth supporting with the purchase. I couldn't wait either and I certainly don't regret it one bit. Axiom Verge gets a 10 out of 10 for being one of the best metroidvania experiences I've ever had.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tz0VkZ-OJ8I", "timestamp_created": 1442390033, "timestamp_updated": 1490602382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590735", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18051709": {"recommendationid": "18051709", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990100415", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433351970}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the best Metroid game I've played in years.", "timestamp_created": 1442369916, "timestamp_updated": 1442369916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536680", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18044439": {"recommendationid": "18044439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092298764", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511211825}, "language": "english", "review": "Satisfied my lack of 2D Metroid games to play.

Warning: this isn't a game that will hold your hand and a lot of back tracking and trial and error will be necessary as you traverse the tunnels and corridors looking for a way forward. Thankfully, this isn't much of a chore as the gorgeous 16 bit world has been crafted with loving attention to detail and your entire journey plays out to one of the best video game soundtracks.. full-stop.

Something that bears mentioning is the glitch effects seen in game - as someone who owned and operated a NES for several years, I'm quite familiar with what happened if a cartridge was inserted crooked, or if the contacts were dirty.  Axiom Verge duplicates these with startling accuracy.  On the style side, this game isn't for the squeamish - if Metroid's environments were biomechanical, Axiom Verge is BIOmechanical.  Tentacles, fungal growths, pulsating organs, and some very Giger-esque imagery gives me the impression of walking around inside some huge creature, rather than an alien planet.  This is alleviated when you get to the surface areas, but I never liked the Monstro scenes in Pinnochio as a child, so this combined with the music (a pulsating, semi-atonal electronica selection) makes me feel uncomfortable.  I believe this is intentional, as someone suddenly ripped from their homeworld and plunged into a dying alien world would probably have a bit of culture shock.\n\nStorywise, the game does very well.  I'll not spoil anything, but it kept me guessing, and it's very hard to figure out who to trust as the game goes on.  It's delivered through in-engine cutscenes and dialogue boxes, without voice acting - this is probably due to a combination of budget concerns and adhering to the NES style, but I do hope for a larger budget for Axiom Verge 2 (or whatever the studio's next project is).\n\nOn the technical side, the game is superb.  The controls are very tight (more like the original Metroid or Mega Man than the slightly floaty Super Metroid) - my only two complaints are the double-tap teleport command (would be better if it was assigned to a button) and the weapon quick-swap (it takes a bit to figure out how to assign weapons to the quick swap, and on my controller one of the quick buttons is R3, with the right stick being the normal weapon swap, which occasionally leads to accidentally opening the weapon ring).  Still, use a controller with this game, and you shan't be disappointed.  Additionally, the game has a built-in speedrun mode.  Speedrunning is a staple of metroidvania games, though I've always been bad at it.  Speedrun mode removes all cutscenes and adds an on-screen timer that automatically splits at every boss kill, which is wonderful if you're into that.\n\nThe achievements show that the developer knows the metroidvania audience; aside from the standard achievements (beat the game, beat it on hard, beat it without dying, and beat every boss), they included achievements for both 100% and low% collection, 100% map completion, and finding some very well hidden secrets.\n\nOverall, if you played and enjoyed any modern Metroid game, you'll probably enjoy Axiom Verge.  If you like modern Castlevania games and aren't adverse to sci-fi, you'll probably also get a kick out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1442034544, "timestamp_updated": 1442034544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17992864": {"recommendationid": "17992864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032084283", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502162870}, "language": "english", "review": "Being a long-lasting fan of the NES/SNES/Sega/Portable sidescrolls, this game literally shoves all of what is good from all of them into one-solid-package. I can honestly say that since Super Metroid, the genre unfortunately kind of died for me. Yes, there was Metroid Fusion! I know there was Viewdiful Joe! They were... okay. But they lacked something savvy that the Sakamoto crew just seemed to really grasp that made the original Metroid, and its SNES follow-up so captivating. It was smart, each boss had a format to solve to defeat, the music was abysmal and ambient, and the atmosphere made you feel secluded and distantly alone from everything.

For the most part, I enjoyed the experience. The music is enjoyable, and the graphics are pretty nice for the 8-bit NES style they were going for. Gameplay wise the game is fairly solid with only a couple of hiccups here and there.\n\nThe story consists of a scientist named Trace being transported to a strange world after an accident at work. He is tasked by a mysterious living machine to revive her fellow living machines, and find a way to stop the evil scientist who has put the  planet into disarray. There's a bit of a M. Night Shamalamadingdong twist in there along the way. The story is interesting, but at times can seem a little all over the place. You can flesh it out more via locating notes around the world, that give you further information that the \"cut scenes\" you encounter don't fully inform you of.\n\nThere are a ton of different weapons you can encounter during the game, as well as a decent assortment of enemies. There are a few palette swaps here and there but they usually at least ACT differently. Not all of the guns are useful, but there are a small handful that are very effective. Flamethrower comes to mind.\n\nThe game, however, is not without faults. The first fault is that the game is very vauge at times as far as where you're supposed to go, or what you're supposed to be doing. There is at least one bit which requires you to use your hacking device to solidify some lava so you can stand on it and jump higher. Simple, right? The issue is that no other lava in the game (that I can recall anyway) has the same effect of getting solid, so you really have nothing prompting you to try it. Another section involves you having to find an item you actually need to progress further in the game, via drilling into a wall in a room completely full of drillable walls.\n\nSome items cannot be aquired without making use of an item that allows you to input a password. To find these passwords you have to translate a made up language (or, you know, just google it). The flamethrower is one of the items you need to do this for. One of them even forces you to translate the language by sight alone. It was an interesting concept, but comes off as more annoying than fun. Still, this is not THAT big of a negative as there are only a handful of instances that require you to do this.\n\nOverall, in spite of the issues the game is a fun, and challenging Metroidvania. It's a little bit closer to the Metroid side, than the CastleVania side, so be aware of that. The game is quite clearly a massive love letter to Super Metroid in particular so go in expecting Super Metroid, not something like Symphony of the Night, or Dawn of Sorrow.\n\nI'd personally recommend it if you're into the genre, just be prepared for a bit of a sequel bait if you get the true ending (you have to get most of the map, and items so that your percentages are displayed as green).", "timestamp_created": 1441766792, "timestamp_updated": 1441766792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17942707": {"recommendationid": "17942707", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960499853", "num_games_owned": 783, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440358900}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Aunque lo denominan Metroidvania, Axiom Verge tiene mucho de Metroid y casi nada de Vania. \n\nRecorreremos diversos escenarios de un mundo alien\u00edgena enfrent\u00e1ndonos a todo tipo de monstruos, y obteniendo un mont\u00f3n de poderes y armas que aumentar\u00e1n poco a poco nuestra capacidad de movernos por el mapa y abrir nuevos accesos, etc. \n\nEstas mejoras de movilidad son de lo m\u00e1s variopinto, desde un taladro hasta un teletransporte a corta distancia o un gancho a lo Bionic Commando.\n\nCreo que lo m\u00e1s notable para un juego de este estilo es que a pesar de lo complejo del mapa y la cantidad de caminos inaccesibles que vamos dejando seg\u00fan avanzamos, casi siempre sabremos cu\u00e1l es la ruta correcta (aunque en una ocasi\u00f3n tuve que tirar de gu\u00eda, lo reconozco), por lo que no se hace pesado y no estaremos pate\u00e1ndonos el mapa en busca de una abertura o un objeto que no hab\u00edamos detectado.

Definitely would recommend this to fans of games like Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.\n\nProbably the feature that makes Axiom Verge sand out the most is the sheer number of weapons to collect (nearly 30), and just how creativily hidden some of the secrets are. Most of these are optional and you can complete the game finding only a fraction of its' secrets, but it definitely adds replay value.\n\nAxiom Verge isn't without flaws however - probably its biggest flaw is the combat itself. Many types of enemies and bosses are cheaply placed or have attacks which are almost impossible to avoid . Enemies will sometimes also block the doors to rooms, causing you to hit them as soon as you re-enter said room. Forcing the player to take damage is poor design and hopefully the combat will be ironed out in subsequent patches or the sequel. The bosses are also a slight letdown, as for the most part they don't react to the player's presense at all, and simply cycle through scripted attack patterns. The final boss is probably the worst example of this poor enemy design, as its attacks are more or less impossible to avoid, and the battle boils down to simply mashing the attack button while hoping your health bar holds out, rather than requiring any actual skill.\n\nThe other major flaw is that the game makes little effort in telling you where to go next. Other than occasional \"hints\" in dialogue you're left to figure it out on your own. For example, after defeating a certain boss, your only hint is to take an elevator up. But it turns out that to continue onward you actually have to find a special item (which was never even mentioned) and then go underground to access a completely unrelated area. I admire games which don't just spell it out for the player, but there's no way a player is going to be able to figure this out without using a guide other than through pure trial and error, which isn't fun.\n\nIn spite of these annoying issues the core game is good, the world is intriquing and ominous, and trying out all of the weapons is fun in of itself. So I can easily overlook them and give this game a recommend.

What drew me in initially was the H.R. Giger style of the \"cover art.\"  I adore dark alien imagery, and Axiom Verge is full of it.  The world the game takes place in just feels...wrong (in a good way); like a place that shouldn't ever exist in any part of the universe (a bit like the Far Realm in D&D).  This feeling is helped by the cyberpunk-style soundtrack constantly pulsing in the background as you explore the tendril-like labyrinthine environment.  I just have to say, the game nails atmosphere perfectly, and that's not even getting to gameplay and story.\n\nThe action feels tight here, and it's always satisfying to blast hostile aliens into pulpy goo.  There are also a ton of weapons to find and play with -- and believe me, there are *a lot* of them, each one with a different feel.  Some of them I'd say are objectively better than others, making the \"lesser\" weapons you find pretty much useless.  But that's a minor complaint.  There are also a ton of other optional items to find: everything from health powerups, damage powerups, range powerups , projectile size powerups and so-on.  That leads into one of coolest aspects of this game: just how much there is to explore.  I spent about 20 hours on my first playthrough and only managed to find like 70% of them total items in the game.  And believe me, I spent a long time exploring.  Although, to be fair, I'm pretty bad at metroidvania games.  I think the average time for a playthrough is 12-13 hours.  Still, for an indie game, that's pretty huge.  There are also some really fun mechanics introduced into the game, like being able to \"glitch\" enemies (which changes their appearance and how they behave).  It's always fun to figure out which enemies' \"glitched\" versions do what.  You also get the ability to teleport through walls with your badass sciency labcoat, which is just awesome in of itself.  \n\nThe story is pretty darn great, too.  I won't spoil anything about it, but I was pretty impressed with how well-written it was.  My only issue with it was how it ended -- not necessarily what happened, but how it was executed.  The pacing sort of felt a little rushed in the final encounter, but that's a pretty small complaint and doesn't take away from the experience, in my opinion.  \n\nOverall, this is easily one of the best games I've played in the last few years and deserves your attention.  The asking price is a little steep for your average indie game, but this game is *well* above average.  :)\n\nI'd give it a 9/10 overall.", "timestamp_created": 1440377615, "timestamp_updated": 1513057409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17686286": {"recommendationid": "17686286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013864531", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505455879}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a lasting artstyle and unsettling story and atmosphere.

Axiom Verge is not a new genre touchstone the way, say, La Mulana was.

The game also rewards exploration with inventive, purely optional weapons, which is a great improvement over a hundred missile expansions.  Unfortunately all weapons do roughly the same amount of damage, even ones that are awkward to aim, so many are not as good as the default gun.\n\nMetroid was inspired by Alien, and Alien was inspired by H.R. Giger.  Axiom Verge looks back to Giger's works and often feels even more Metroidy than Metroid itself.  It's a great decision, and the game looks gorgeous.\n\nThe game doesn't do anything exciting to enable sequence breaking - some breaks are possible, but it doesn't do anything as bold as Super Metroid's walljump or Bunny Must Die's parrying.

More than that and the controls would agitate me enough to just quit and walk away for a while.\n\nThe 2 biggest issues effectively pair together. The right thumbstick for gamepads is horridly used as a weapon select wheel, with the L/R thumbstick clicks cycling between preset weapons. A problem with this is it becomes far too easy to end up swapping weapons unintentionally in combat because of inevitable clicks while moving. \n\nAll of this could be fixed with a little more condensing on controls. Remove the drone from having a discrete button press and treat it as a quick-select weapon. Make the selection wheel a Press+Hold button action to activate thumb-stick selection on Y, the quick-select tap Y, and the drone a preset 4th weapon in the quick select.\n\nAnother issue is a frustrating dash that is unlocked and controlled by double-tap direction movements. It feels uncomfortable to use in any situation and completely breaks momentum on the character while exploring. It would be much better served if it had a dedicated button to control use. A good candiate to replace is the super-bomb, which somehow gets a dedicated trigger while having ~10 locations to ever really need to use it, compared to the heavy use of the dash when unlocked.\n\nI wish the controls were better so I could enjoy the great story, cool weapon selections, nice environments, and tons of secret items.

The story is intriguing and the setting completely engaging.

It's a HUGE game, with so much to do. The gameplay is great, and there are plenty of secrets to find. At first, the sense of exploration made me keep playing, finding out how to do certain things, finding new areas to explore, etc. But after about half way through the game, the main thing I wanted to do was find out what happened next in the story, and i'm not really a big story guy. I wont say anything about it specifically in order to keep this review spoiler-free, but you can look up the trailer to get started.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThe gameplay is great. It's a sidescroller, but by the end of the game there is so many maneuvers to do that it gets quite challenging. Another great thing about the gameplay is that I didn't find myself getting stuck anywhere to the point I had to look something up. Sure, you might have to think about it for a while, and the game is really challenging at times, but there is something so rewarding about figuring something out on your own, it's fantastic. The only problem with the gameplay was that some of the weapons seemed completely inferior to the base gun, which isn't really a downside but doesn't add much to the game.\n\nMusic/SFX: 7/10\nThe music was pretty good, it was fitting. Nothing that stood out too much, but also nothing that I really despised either.\nThe sound effects were for the most part good, except for the drill hitting something that couldn't be drilled sounded similar to scratching finger nails against a chalkboard (which makes sense actually... but couldve chosen something less aggressive)\n\nStory: 10/10\nLike I said before, I don't want to spoil anything, but the story is simply fascinating. It what motivates you to keep exploring.\n\nControls: 9/10\nThe controls were really solid on the xbox-360 controller. I'm not sure how the keyboard support is, but judging by the movements you have to do it would seem to be pretty hard. This is really just a personal preference.\n\nGraphics: 11/10\nHOLY COW the graphics are amazing in this game. I don't really have anything else to say but WOW.\n\nThere is also a \"hard\" mode, and a \"speedrun\" mode, as well as completionist achievements for those who want to play even more. For the speedrun mode there are even leaderboards, which is great.

Interesante. Cuenta con final secreto bastante impactante as\u00ed que os recomiendo esforzaros recolectando cosa. Encuentras cachos de lore en forma de notitas que te dan pistas sobre lo que ha pasado por aqu\u00ed.\n\n\u00bfJugabilidad? Bueno, bueno. Es entretenido, pero no es muy dif\u00edcil: Lo he acabado en Normal y en Dif\u00edcil y si eres capaz de pasarte el Guacamelee muriendo poco te digo que este juego es un paseo. En el caso de las armas, hay muchas y son estupendas, pero s\u00f3lo unas pocas son obligatorias para avanzar, otras tantas las he visto in\u00fatiles y hay una en concreto que es sensacional para matar a un boss, lo cual es malo porque, otra vez, hace que el combate sea muy f\u00e1cil.\n\n\u00bfSonido? La P*lla de Goya. Suelo irme a dormir tatareando las melod\u00edas, y creo que encajan de p*ta madre con cada entorno en el que te encuentras.\n\n\u00bfEl precio? Yo creo que se percibe caro para ser un juego de este estilo. Si eres completista te durar\u00e1 8 horas.

Te recomendar\u00eda comprarlo, dicho esto.\n\n\nEn resumidas cuentas, si est\u00e1s RABIOSO por encontrar un juego para SADOMASOQUISTAS, este no es lo tuyo pero yo creo que es un paseo audiovisual agradable, por su m\u00fasica, una historia que interesa y que tiene sus interpretaciones. \n", "timestamp_created": 1437523027, "timestamp_updated": 1437523027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17163554": {"recommendationid": "17163554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036080286", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514272325}, "language": "english", "review": "Since Super Metroid, only two 2D Metroid games have come out: Zero Mission and Fusion. \n\nFusion was a really spectacular and different take on the Metroid 'verse, but some thought it was too linear, and had too much dialogue. \n\nZero Mission improved on Fusion's mechanics and is a better aging version of Metroid 1, but the rehashing of areas, while certainly nostalgic, did not bring much new to the series. \n\nSuper Metroid itself, while not my favorite Metroid game, is the best 2D game ever and had a lot that was completely original as well as all those little nostalgic areas while still managing to keep things fresh every step of the way.\n\nAxiom Verge is a worthy successor.\n\nYou start off extremely confused in a giant mechanical egg.

It's a solid title even if you don't know it was made by one guy. There haven't really been many pure Metroid style games recently- most similar try to blend the Metroidvania genre with other gameplay types. That's well and good, but this goes closer to the roots, and, in my opinion, is stronger for it.\n\nHowever, there are a few minor issues.\n\nFirst off, sometimes your progress is completely halted because of a detail you couldn't realistically find out on your own without a guide, unless you either get lucky or experiment more than should be necessary. (1 specific room and 1 specific boss.)\n\nSecond, the aiming controls could use some work- although they're usually fine, sometimes they force you to move in a specific direction to shoot the way you want to. There is a button that's supposed to help with aiming, but it locks MOVEMENT rather than aiming, which I found strange, because being stationary is usually a bad idea. Simply changing the movement lock to aim lock would be very helpful in this regard.\n\nThird, the \"glitches\" don't ever really feel like you're actually messing with the game.\nHere are the things they do, based on my memory:\nMake enemies bigger/smaller\nMake enemies shoot slower\nMake enemies shoot with less spread\nTurn enemies into a different type of enemy\nMake enemies, or their attacks, destroy some specific walls\nMake enemies, or their attacks, create\nKill enemies prematurely\nMake enemies slower\nMake enemies stop moving\nMake things solid/disappear/turn into blocks you can destroy\nGo through walls\n\nThese are used to good effect for unique gameplay that revolves around finding out how to best use these changes, but the \"glitches\" never really feel like glitches, other than the aesthetics. Going through walls is the closest it ever gets. For someone who's actually glitch-hunted in games (notably Super Metroid) this isn't like HUNTING for glitches, because you're given a gun and told \"Use this to make things work differently.\" It's more like solving a combat puzzle in Megaman, or switching between worlds in Guacamelee. The glitch aesthetic is really just that, an aesthetic. It typically works well, but I was a bit disappointed it wasn't a bit more like actually finding glitches for yourself. There are also secret worlds that appear at random, but these felt more like random secrets than glitches to me from my limited experience with one.\n\nFinally, an issue that was more of an annoyance than any of the other things on the list. The enemies all tend to be damage tanks. This is meant to be a catalyst for players that use strategy over simply running and gunning. However, what it tends to do is make fights drag even after you've found out the best strategy to use against an enemy.\n\n\nOne more thing: I think the game is actually TOO well-designed- the creator knew all the limits of the player at any given time, and prevented sequence breaking. I like sequence breaking, so this makes me sad.\n\n\nOverall the game is very enjoyable (I finished the game, which I only ever do when I think it's worth playing all the way through.) However, go into it with the knowledge that the game is more about combat puzzles than realistic glitches.", "timestamp_created": 1436558825, "timestamp_updated": 1436559117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16977449": {"recommendationid": "16977449", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999647574", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511032104}, "language": "english", "review": "TL:DR at bottom-\n\nI love Super Metroid. I love Super Metroid so much that I searched out fan made ROMhacks of the game. One of the best I have found is Super Metroid: Redesign by Drewseph. He changes everything: the physics, the weapons, and game mechanics. It is completely different, but it is still fundamentally Super Metroid.\n\nAxiom Verge is very similar in the regard. The gameplay is different, the physics are different, the weapons are different, the story is different...but it is still fundamentally Super Metroid. Rather, it takes what I love about Super Metroid and distills it into the amazing experience that is Axiom Verge. I cannot recommend this game enough. \n\nIf you like the classic 2D Metroid games, Castlevania games, or even run and gun games like Contra, this game is for you. If you like classic 2D platformers like Mario or Sonic, this game is also for you. If you don't like either of these game types, then this game might not be for you, but I would recommend getting it anyway for one simple reason: Steam offers refunds on games now.\n\nYou have literally nothing to lose if you get the game and immediately dislike it. You can use the refund option. However, I have a feeling that if you get Axiom Verge, you will want to keep it.\n\nThe music is very well written, and one of my favorite things about it is the prevalence of a heavy bass kick in most of the tunes. To me, this is Trace's heartbeat. It increases during boss battles, it decreases during calm areas. Another cool thing is the low health beep. Anyone who has played Zelda of Metroid is familiar with this; it is an annoying, jarring way of telling you that you might die if you don't get health soon. Axiom Verge uses this mechanic, but instead of overriding the music, the low health beep is implemented into whatever song you are listening to. It slows down or speeds up depending on the BPM of the song. The first time I heard it, I was amazed that I hadn't seen that used in any other game I have played as it is such a good way to let you know that you have low health.\n\nThe environments have some areas where the backgrounds have pulsating objects that move to the beat of the music. I am a huge fan of how this is added. It helps to suck me into the game, and make me feel more connected since the music is an integral part of the experience.\n\nThe jumping physics are top notch, and able to offer precise movement control. Some of the upgrades you get are very cool, but I won't go into them since finding them and figuring out what they do is a fun part of the game. There is only one part of the map I am less than impressed with, but that is just because there are a lot of small, white creatures that sort of blend in with the background and can disrupt your jumping if they hit you. \n\nThe difficulty of this game comes in normal mode and hard mode. I finished normal mode in about 10 hours, with something like 80% of the map revealed and 75% of the items found. There is a lot to find, and doing it is fun. There are an amazing amount of weapons that do various things, making some boss fights easier with certain weapons.\n\nOverall, this is an amazingly well made game, which is made even more incredible by the fact that it was made completely by just one man: Thomas Happ. He designed the game, composed the music, and created the story. This game is a huge win for independant developers, as it shows that good things can come to those who work for them.\n\nGet this game. Just...get it. As much as I love Super Metroid - the lonely atmosphere, taking down large boss enemies because Samus is awesomely powerful, the music, the exploration and cycle breaking...I am conflicted to say that this game may even be better than Super Metroid. They are very similar in game type, and this game does so many thing right. Super Metroid and Axiom Verge may have to live in my mind as co-favorite games.\n\nTL:DR Get this game.

The gameplay is solid and feels good with a lot of the same challenge and reward as the NES era of video games.\n\nThe story is intriguing and interesting. It is told partially through interaction with other characters in the game, partially through the levels and surroundings as you explore, and partically through notes you find laying around. It was interesting enough that more often then not I would spend quite a bit of time just trying to find the next hidden note with more story, I wanted to know what else was going on in the world around me.\n\nThe gameplay and combat mechanics feel VERY strongly like 2d era Metroid. Its very satisfying with a large array of weapons that work better against different enemies under different situations. The enemies are varied and interesting. You have the ability fairly early on to \"glitch\" enemies which causes their behavoir to change, and this can be both helpful and hindering depending on level circumstances. The bosses all feel very well done and are often challenging trying to learn the patterns and proper method for attacking them.\n\nThe different items in the game all grant some level of improved mobility through the game, from grappling hooks to teleporting, and the mechanics are not always straight forward which in this case actually adds to the puzzle and challenge in a good way.\n\nAnd the soundtrack... The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and I could double the length of this review just praising the music. So rather than do that, just trust me, if you like Chiptunes and old video game era music, this games soundtrack will blow your mind.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys classic metroidvania style games.

The original Metroid is probably one of my top 5 favorite gaming experiences of my life.  So this game was basically made for people like me.\n\nSomebody on Metacritic described it best:  This game is 'Retro Gaming Ecstasy'.  Challenging gameplay, with no real hand-holding and a large focus on exploration.  You'll do a lot of backtracking - as you'll find rooms where you will encounter insurmountable obstacles, only to later find an item which allows you to explore it - a classic feature of the 'Metroidvania' genre which I love.  Really fluid, tight controls - those who grew up on NES/SNES platformers will feel right at home here.  Diverse weapon selection and there are very few parts of the game that force you to use one weapon over another - you can choose which is best for your playstyle.  As you get deeper into the game (without spoiiling too much) there are a bevy of movement options at your disposal which adds to the experience greatly.\n\nThere are also a number of large,classic 16-bit style boss fights in the game.  The early ones are fairly trivial - the ones in the latter half of the game are fairly challenging and you will feel accomplished when you defeat them.   (Note this was only on Normal - I did not play on Hard - yet)\n\nThe only real frustration I had with my playthrough was going off to explore another area, forgetting to find a save location, dying, and then being reset to my last location, which might have been a long way away.  This only happened a couple of times, and I learned quickly to find a save spot while exploring!  \n\nNow that I am done, I am motivated to go back and see if I can do it faster, via the game's built in 'speedrun mode', which disables the story popups and slowdowns.  Very cool feature and a nice nod to the speedrunning community.\n\nHighly recommended.

As you continue through the game, you'll find it subverts a lot of what you'd usually expect. Small Morph-Ball sized gaps? You don't fit though those. You send a remote drone to explore in your place. And the glitches... well, this game replicates glitches you might have seen on some poorly built NES games, but these are gameplay mechanics. An annoying exploding enemy can be glitched to make every other enemy explode when you shoot it. Buggy terrain can be swept away or made into existence to create passage. \n\nSurprising story, too. Creepy collectable notes, Prime log style, that cast things you've encountered in a different light. A far more intricate plotline than any Metroid or Castlevania game, told through dialogue and a few cutscenes. There's a speedrun option that tracks your time and skips every single talky bit, if you don't care for that.\n\nEspecially impressed that this was made by one person alone, over the course of 4-5 years.

Even more rare for an indie game to have this much substance. Yet even more impressive is the fact that such a game can exist under the creative eye of a Single Person. All coding, artwork, music handled by a single person with more creative talent than should be possible.\n\nI grew up in the NES days and put my time into Batman, Megaman, Bionic Commando, Ninja Gaiden, etc. etc., and this game just Does It Right. Sooo right, down to the 8-bit cinematic sequences, sound effects and difficulty. The art here is Giger-like, bio-mechanical monstrosities with a minimal colour palette for each area. Not NES minimal, but nostalgic nevertheless. Every sound fits so well and is incredibly authentic, without being a knock-off. The stereo digital static that surfaces in certain spots just makes the hair on my neck stand up. Speaking of which, the music isn't anything to scoff at either; it's a beautiful hommage to classic games, but incredibly modern/apocalyptic dark electro. This makes revisiting areas a pleasure, just to hear the amazing songs play again. Trust me, you'll be revisiting places often.\n\nThere's the obvious Metroid comparisons, albeit with an integrated map system, but it feels completely natural. Hidden areas requiring your newly-found skill power-up begs for exploration of every section of the map. Items and Nodes appear in plain sight, seemingly unobtainable, until you advance enough in the game to wander back and pick it up. The list of weaponry is Huge as well, breaking up any monotony and providing a depth of strategy to the R-Type-esque bosses, and overall use of different weapons vs. different enemies. I highly suggest using a gamepad, it's really fluid and organic, although remembering the weapon icons is a little tough.\n\nBottom line is that Axiom Verge is well worth your time, even if you get 'stuck': you can always come back and dig a little deeper. There will always be that corner of the map not filled in, taunting you to run 'n gun your way over to it to see what's up.

I've just completed it and I feel buzzed. On first impressions it might seem like another Metroid clone. However, the more you play, the more you realise that it has a unique character and personality of its own. I'd say the words spiritual successor would be most appropriate. It utilises all of the strengths of the Metroid franchise and virtually none of the weaknesses.\n\nThe game is challenging, but none of that challenge was unfair. It was obvious the developer could see the game through the player's eyes when designing it, like having save rooms spaced apart at perfect intervals (and there's always one before boss fights), the levels being designed really well, the controls being slick and smooth, and you're never forced to do silly wall jumping manoeuvres that Metroid had you do.\n\nThe visuals worked well. Most of them were just dungeons really, but everything was consistent. And the music was a whole new level of awesome, ranging from gripping atmospheric tracks to adrenaline-pumping boss battle tracks. \n\nThe game throws a variety of challenges your way, there are tonnes of weapons and unique accessories to collect that help you get stronger, plenty of secrets to find, but my favourite aspect were probably the boss fights. They were all challenging to some degree, especially the ones in the second half of the game, but each and every one of them could be beaten with the right strategy. The trick is to simply figure out that strategy and to optimize it. I kind of wish there were more of them in fact. From what I recall, the game only has 7 boss fights in total. \n\nSince this is mostly a dungeon crawler, the story was in the background most of the time, but it had some cool and unique concepts, and the backstory cutscenes were always interesting, as they always revealed something new.\n\nI can't really find anything major to criticise about the game, aside from the fact that it's not for everyone.

Most of the time, I generally cycled between 2-3 weapons. Some of the weapons also felt so similar to others, I really didn't bother using them most of the time. Reducing the number of weapons, and increasing their unique interactions with the environment would have added a lot of flexibility in the game (see metroid prime games, fewer weapons, but I felt more attached to the weapons)\n - Some of the enemies and areas feel like there's a cheap shot. By the end, I made a habbit of running my drone through each room before I walked through to keep from getting sneak attacked by the burrowed \n - Most of the bosses were too easy. The only bosses I had a hard time with were Uruku (for some reason, I couldn't get it through my head to shoot the mouth after clearing the other parts) and Ukhu. Giving the bosses more varied attack patters and behaviors would have made them much more engaging for the whole fight, rather than the first half where the patterns were memorized.\n\nSummary\nDon't take the cons as a \"don't play.\" These are just things I felt the game could have done a little better. Overall, I thought  this was a fantastic game beginning to end, and I am excited for axiom verge. The gameplay, music, and art style were all so reminiscent of the old days exploring dungeons in Metroid. Not only does it capture the styles of the old game, but it builds upon it with even more interesting zones.

It's obviously not aimed for players who are looking for graphics and super new detailed effects, but from my own experience this always comes at the cost of gameplay and fun. And this is where Axiom Verge excels. \n\nTook me 15 hours to beat the game with 97 deaths, 71 % map revealed and 60 % items. Yes I am kinda new to this genre and I am lame :-) This being said, I had a great time and fun. BUT the backtravelling and countless hours of just looking where you might go, what you have missed might be frustrating for someone. Some places where so unintuitive, that after a few hours I just used a guide at some parts because I value my time more than the joy of the moment when you find out where to go. Oooooh , so this is iiit .... umm okay ? \n\nThe sound and the music is another superb aspect of the game which I enjoyed very much, but the thing is that during my 2nd gameplay I found it kinda repetetive and maybe even annoying. Not every song is good, so I ended up using my own music in the background.\n\nPlayed on a keyboaard since my old Gamepad is not supporter because of the lack of the circular buttons. I have only the D-pad. Steam big picture mode doesnt let you save your controller settings which btw carries over to the game, unless you bind every button.\n\nIs this game good ? Yes it is, definitely.\nIs this game perfect ? No, it isn't. It has it's flaws like everything in this world. I am yet to play a perfect game or meet a perfect human :-)\nIs this game worth it ? Yes it is, but probably not at full price. I bought it here on steam for 17.99.

That is annoying, but not a game breaker. Unfortunately the biggest hurdle in this game is controls.\nI had to remap my controls several times as I got new abilities that crowded up my controller. Some items become kinda worthless as well, but still demand a button. I wish I could disable items in my inventory. The best thing I did was learn to use the D-pad again, because THAT thing is ONLY for direction and does not double as a button. The \"double-tap\" on the analogue stick is janky as hell and you'll  be dodging all over the place when your just trying to move about normally or are aiming and running. Same with the bombs! I had to put bombs on R3 and quick select on L3, learn that D-pad, and it's all good.\n\nAll in all, solid game with some really nice surprises.\n\nLooking forward to the rest of the game, aka, resolution of the cliffhanger with sooooooo much unresolved.

With the full collection of items, there's some crazy acrobatics you can accomplish. \n\nThe story is told primarily through text boxes and SNES-esque cutscenes, and never felt overdone or particularly obnoxious. It's also pretty compelling, and I was curious to see how it'd play out. Furthermore, playing on Speedrun mode removes all the story elements completely, for a pure run-through.\n\nMy only real complaint was the lack of difficulty on most of the bosses. With the exception of the later few, bosses were complete pushovers (even on Hard difficulty). Considering how impressive and intimidating they are, it was odd how most enemies posed more of a threat. \n\nThat aside, Axiom Verge was an absolute blast to play, and having just finished my first play-through, I'm already starting on a second!", "timestamp_created": 1433761222, "timestamp_updated": 1433769759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623202", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16257320": {"recommendationid": "16257320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047436303", "num_games_owned": 3177, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452129381}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430!

He worked [i][b]solely[/b][/i] on the project.\nSo Tom Happ is responsible for the amazing pixel art, the fitting soundtrack, coding and of course game design.\n\nSo after I\u2019ve introduced the man himself to you let\u2019s dive into [i]Axiom Verge[/i]\n\n[h1][b]axiom\n\u02c8aks\u026a\u0259m/[/b]\n[list]\n[*]noun\n[*]a statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true.\n[/list]\n\n[b]verge\nv\u0259\u02d0d\u0292/[/b]\n[list]\n\n[*]noun\n[*]an edge or border\n[*]an extreme limit beyond which something specified will happen.\n[/list][/h1]\n\nYou slip into the role of Trace, a scientist in the near future. After your labor blowed up you awake on an alien planet and you hear a strange voice , which you can barely understand \u2026\n\nNow before I get into the Story let me talk about something else first.\n\n[h1]Nostalgia[/h1]\n\nBoy I really fell in love with the game. Despite my lack of hours I\u2019ve put in, thanks to that thing they call [i]Real Life[/i] (sigh), I\u2019ve seriously fallen for the game.\nNostalgia \u2026 NOSTALGIA!\n\nExcuse me. Now let me explain. It\u2019s nearly impossible to talk about [i]Axiom Verge[/i] without talking about [i]Metroid[/i], one of Nintendo\u2019s finest.\n\nBasically this game looks, feels and plays like a love letter to [i]Metroid[/i]. And this isn\u2019t even a bad thing! Au contraire!\n\nWell you see for the [i]older generation[/i], or let\u2019s be a bit nicer and say for us [i]Veterans[/i] it\u2019s something we longed for. We wished for. We needed.\n\nWhile there are numerous good games on the market, be it 2D, 2.5D or 3D there\u2019s nothing quite like a Metroid or a Metroidvania for that matter.\n\nAnd boy this game is one of the best if not THE BEST Metroidvania which was released in the last years.\n\nAs you might have noticed, I do have quite an affection for Metroid and the Metroidvania genre.\n\nBut let that not blind you! While I get critically hit by the games Nostalgia strike, I have to say it\u2019s damn near perfect. Especially if you consider that one sole human being was responsible for it.\n\n[h1]Let\u2019s talk about the game[/h1]\n\nI don\u2019t want to spoil too much so I try to keep it rather short, since exploration is key for any [i]Metroidvania[/i].\n\nAs I mentioned earlier you slip into the role of Trace, a scientist, which awakes on an alien and high-tech planet after suffering a fatal injury. Confused as to where he is and whether he\u2019s still alive or not and what this is all about he tries to makes sense of his situation.\n\nAfter hearing a strange voice which seems to try to help him he ventures into the next room and finds a Weapon \u2026\n\nThus begins your Story in [i]Axiom Verge[/i].\n\nWith a weapon in your hand, it\u2019s now up to you to explore your new environment and try to make sense of your situation. Death? Illusion? Afterlife? Reality? Dream?\nIt\u2019s now up to you to figure out what exactly happened to you.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve explored a bit you might notice the game has several glitches. Those are intended. Those glitches can be anything. Power Ups for your character or even Secret Rooms. It\u2019s up to you to find them to gain new powers so you can explore every bit of this weird place you\u2019ve found yourself in.\n\nYou\u2019ll find numerous Power Ups which will help you out in one way or another.\nMost of the time a new Power Up means that you\u2019re now able to reach new areas you\u2019ve been unable to reach.\n\nThe Drill for example allows you to, while dealing damage to enemies, destroy certain rocks which will occasional block your path.\n\nSo you see there\u2019s something for every situation.\n\nThe game features a variety of enemies and bosses and also secret labyrinths which feature unique creatures and bosses.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about the boss fights for a bit here. If you\u2019re new to the [i]Metroidvania[/i] genre then they might, maybe, hard for you but if you\u2019ve played games like this before then they might be actually a bit too easy.\n\nThis might be really the only negative aspect of the game that I could find.\n\nEverything else, the art, game design and music \u2026 Those all work in perfect harmony.\n\n[h1]What else can I say?[/h1]\n\nNostalgia! NOSTALGIA! If you grew up with games like this then this will be a must have for you. I guarantee it. Even if you\u2019ve never played a game like this before I\u2019d say go ahead and buy it. I truly believe that it\u2019s the perfect entry into the [i]Metroidvania[/i] genre, if that is, you\u2019re not able to get your hands on [i]Metroid[/i].\nEven if you just want to try something new this might be just the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1433527954, "timestamp_updated": 1451655207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715539", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16207071": {"recommendationid": "16207071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127788196", "num_games_owned": 436, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432056111}, "language": "french", "review": "Fan de Castelvania et m\u00eame plus de M\u00e9tro\u00efde ? ce jeu est fait pour vous !\nAxiom Verge est une jeu de type Metro\u00efdeVania 2D comme on les aime !\n-Le challenge est au rendez vous les boss sont a l'ancienne ils n'ont qu'un point faible a vous de le trouver ...

But turned out there is more.\n\nThe game matches me completely. Things I absolutely loved:\n[list]\n[*] Game is fun. Almost all the time. Even despite having several large levels, you never get tired of running back and forth. Graphics is colorful and stylish, range of available equipment is wide, and you can move really fast, performing various acrobatic tricks. Also, there is [spoiler]a certain horizontal lift[/spoiler], which makes inter-level journeys a matter of seconds. Very nice. And very important for every game of metroidvania genre.\n[*] It's not hard. I'm definelty not a hardcore platformer lover. Neither a casual, though... I just enjoy style, story, puzzles and exporation more than fighting, analysing boss movement patterns and so on. When I see \"difficult\" tag on a platformer game, it makes me a little sad. Axiom Verge is not one of this rouge-likeish super-hard platformers.\n[*] Visual style. There is not enough words to describe how much I love pixel-art. And also, I adore cyberpunk, bio-mechanical-styled things, and postapocalyptic athmosphere. Every one of that is present in Axiom Verge. On the top of it, game has very nice and modern visual effects, which turned up to be very nice addition. Stylish bio-mechanic pixel gun, radiating distortion effect on stylish pixel backgrounds. Beautiful.\n[*] Soundtrack. It's very good. Just listen to it.\n[*] Game tells interesting story. But, to be honest, the story is not a main source of fun in the game.\n[/list]\n\nAlso don't let the fact that this game has only one developer, who is also the artist, composer and designer, Axiom Verge is not a mere \"indie\" game.

There are a few duds, but I found myself changing weapons often to cope with various situations\n-Tools for navigating the environment are very unique and interesting, with only a few items coving the same role.\n-Fantastic music. I will probably buy the OST.\n-Glitching enemies and exploiting their glitches is extremely satisfying.\n-Hard mode and speed-run mode give replayability to a genre that usually lacks it.\n\nMehs:\n-Level design is not on par with Metroid games, probably on par with Castevania games though. The game spends most of its time hiding items and less making areas difficult or interesting to transverse. \n-Many secret items and areas feel gimmicky or seem to require prior knowledge to get to. Metroid games were good at giving appropriate visual clues to make a player stop and give an area a second look, whereupon Axiom Verge seems to take delight in hiding things in areas you would never think to look. This fine a couple of times, but it you rely on it too much, the player spends all their time drilling walls looking for secrets. I feel the game would have benefited greatly from some sort of \"X-Ray Scope\" equivalent from Super Metroid.\n-The story is different and interesting, and hints at something greater going on.... but then never delivers. It may be the intention of the developer to keep the story vague, but as a player I was invested in the world and wanted to find out more about it.\n\nCons:\n-Bosses are usually just meat shields with one gimmick that is predictable. I was hoping for more fights that forced me to rethink my strategy, glitch the boss or spawned mobs, or use weapons that I normally wouldn't. The bosses aren\u2019t terrible, but next to how creative the rest of the game is, they are surprisingly old-school and do not take advantage of the tools that the player amasses throughout the game.\n--------------------\n\nAll and all this is a fantastic game, and is worth every penny at full price.

Time for a review!\n\nStory goes you place as Trace, a scientist in the near future who wakes up on an alien planet after your laboratory explodes, and after contacted wireless by giant robotic companions, it is now of course up to you to solve what is going on and get yourself back home.\nI will get this out of the way, yes it is a throwback to old school 8-16 bit games like Metroid as you wander through the hostile areas on the similar map structure, game is very nice and captures the old school feel, just that some of the enviornments do feel plain sometime.\n\nGoing through the worlds enemies you will have a whole array of weapons, health & power nodes, upgrades, and pages to collect through the game to make your arsenal stronger and yourself to get to the next part of the game.\nWeapons come in all sorts from lightning to fire weapons. All provide a nice punch to it. You can even change the way the monsters controls with a hacking device to make it easier to navigate through the world because some of the rooms and enemies can get a little frustrating in tight quarters if they are in groups and others are just firing directly at a distance.\n\nMusic is nice and once again gives the foreboding feel as you traverse through the game.\nNot really many problems I had with the game, just in some cases while collecting powerups, the controls as you learn a new ability does take time to get used to as there are some almost seemingly impossible items to reach that require 3 button combos and moves to get to, still nothing keyboard breaking.\nAnother little thing that got to me was the boss fights, although very creepy in design, they all were too easy as there was a way to beat all of them in a certain position where you could just stay at and keep firing at them. \n\nStill overall it is a very nice game to get the nostalgic feel of the retro age in gaming, this game will probably take you 10-14 hours depending on the first playthrough if you do not know what you are doing or just collecting and finding all the secrets. Another great recommendation for retro and platformer fans alike.

The game follows the classic Metroid formula with some modern game improvements.\n\nFor example, the various weapons are tactical in nature.  As opposed to Metroid where the guns just get predictably more powerful, the various guns in Axiom Verge display radically different characteristics.  Picking the right gun for the right situation is the key to succeeding in combat.  Fortunately, switching between the surprisingly large arsenal is quick and easy with a controller (native PS4 controller support!).\n\nAnother surprising aspect is the story.  Though at first glance it appears to be a minimalist tale like so many other Metroidvania games, notes scattered around the world reveal a deeper and more convoluted plot than what is initially presented.  Combined with a cryptic ending, there is definitely a path paved for a sequel.\n\nThe only downside for me was that the game was rather easy.  I played it on Hard for my first run through and the game only started to get challenging towards the last third or so.  The main reason for this is that the enemy behavior is not very complex or varied.  Most enemies fit into one of two categories: moving in a set pattern, and dashing straight towards you.  The first type are always easy to kill, while the second require more thought but are usually easily defeated with proper tactics and the right weapon.  Boss behavior is similarly limited with most bosses only exhibiting one or two patterns.\n\nUltimately, I feel that $20 was a bit much for what I got.

Yes, as we all know, Metroidvanias are a dime a dozen in the realm of indie games, and it's easy to see why: It's a genre that is very easy to make, but takes a lot of talent and effort to do really well. For every Cave Story and La-Mulana there's a deluge of mediocre to straight up awful Metroidvanias a few meters behind them. Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania style game in which there's a lot of Metroid and not a lot of Vania, which I do quite like, as the Metroid side of things allows the designer to go really crazy with the atmosphere and world building as opposed to \"get the thing to increase your numbers.\"\n\nAs mentioned above, Axiom Verge feels a lot like Metroid, even down to the very first area of the game feeling a lot like Brinstar, complete with long vertical shaft with a bunch of enemies that run along the walls. It does start to branch off from there, as rather than breaking walls with things like power bombs or missiles, you are instead equipped with a drill. This drill can be used for combat purposes, but it's not too recommended as it does bugger all for damage. Another way in which this game branches away from Metroid is that you get a LOT of weapons throughout your playthrough. I ended up with ten different weapons by the end of the game, and while they're all pretty fun to play with, odds are you'll fall into one weapon and just use that for the rest of the game. This was a little disappointing, as I would've liked to see more environmental puzzles that made use of the characteristics of the weapons.\n\nPowerups in this game are pretty neat, and there are a fair few of them that are pretty cool, but there are a few that feel like completely arbitrary gating mechanisms, with the most egregious example being one of the later areas in which you have to mine through more blocks with your drill than the average Minecraft player, only to receive a key \"powerup\" that moves literally two blocks in the world and that's it. In fact, there were more than a few powerups that felt like completely arbitrary gates, something that I think could've been fixed with more of a focus on environmental puzzles that make use of the weapons you have.\n\nOne of the most important things that you need to do right if you're going for a Metroid feel in your game is to get the world itself correct. The world itself is big, very big, but it does have a tendency to feel somewhat sparse after a while. Another problem with such a big world is that if you ever need to backtrack, it gets annoying very quickly. There is no teleportation powerup (unless I just didn't find it; if there is, let me know and I'll change this review accordingly), which really doesn't make sense given that you teleport to the last save point when you die. Speaking of such, one thing that I was definitely happy that this game did is that you never game over, so even if you die, you don't lose progress.\n\nEnemies are your typical Metroid fare, wall-crawlers, spiders, things that shoot at you, and they do more damage as you go along because reasons. Bosses are really disappointing, especially given how cool they look. In fact, there is one boss where you can spend most of the time crouching and be perfectly fine. I did play through this game first time on Normal, so maybe the AI was tweaked for the bosses on Hard mode to make them actually threatening; I dunno. There was only really one boss that I would call challenging, and that's just because it does a lot of damage. The final boss was just a mashfest, honestly; dash around everywhere and shoot the thing from time to time.\n\nOverall, I had a pretty good time with Axiom Verge. The world was pretty good, despite all the backtracking; there were pretty well hidden secrets that were fun to find, and even though bosses could've been a lot more fun to fight than they actually were, this could be something that was fixed on Hard mode. If you've played something like Environmental Station Alpha, I'd definitely play this on Hard first time through. It manages to be pretty good, but not fantastic. 7/10.\n\nStory: The story, or at least what all I got of it from this playthrough as you need powerups to translate some of the alien text, is actually pretty cool. It's written quite well, even though it gets a little bit up its own arse from time to time (a line from a page that goes, \"As everyone knows from the Euclid Equation...\" Yeah, as *everyone* knows...). The only \"real\" character in the game - and that's somewhat questionable from time to time - is the character you play as, called Trace. Trace is/was a scientist at a facility that blew up, science happened, and now you're in an alien world. Without going into too much detail, the game does a very good job at making you wonder whether your \"benefactors\" are really that, as well as making you wonder whether what you're doing really is for the best. Despite this, there doesn't seem to be any alternate endings, for better and for worse. While there isn't much in the way of character development in the game, the focus of the writing is not on the characters; it's on the world, and building of worlds this game does pretty well. 8/10.\n\nGraphics: When I saw the art style of this game, I instantly knew why the person who recommended it to me did so: the art style in this game is pretty dang excellent. One shocker is that it was all done by one person. An even bigger shocker is that this entire game was made by one person, although I don't think witchcraft makes you one person still. All joking aside, this game does look really, really good. As mentioned above, the bosses look really, really cool, which makes it all the more disappointing how boring and easy almost all of them are. Funnily enough, the boss that looked the least interesting ended up being the hardest of the bunch (the bee thing for those who were wondering). Still though, the art style of this game is very, very good and it's all the more better considering that just one person worked on it. As for the technical side of things, the game fullscreened to 1080p and ran at a solid 60FPS throughout; just what you'd expect. It can be run windowed, but I never messed with that option as I like having things searing off my retinas at glorious full screen. I don't really need to say much more on this one than, \"look at the screenshots.\" 5/5.\n\nSound: Another thing that became very surprising once I learned that this was a solo project is the music: the entire game, as well as the music, was still made by one person. This is surprising because the music is quite good. It's kinda chiptune-y in some areas and kinda not in others, which normally shows a bit of a confused direction with the audio, but since the whole game is \"kinda 8-bit, kinda not,\" it never becomes too distracting. Plus, I don't know if these tracks would offer as much atmosphere as they do in a strictly 8-bit format. Speaking of sound direction, every enemy in the game makes the same exact noise when you hit them, which is a bit weird but again, one of those things that you notice if you're really nitpicking. I don't know if the OST is good enough to make me wanna buy it for myself, but it at the very least works really well in-game. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/8/5/4; cumulative score of 8.0/10. Quite a good showing, especially from one person, but it does some issues with level design and bosses that keeps the game from being as good as it could be. Still though, if you're looking for a Metroid-style game that you can blaze through in a couple of nights, this is a very good one to pick up.

You are almost completely unguided, which does have some problems in that the world is large and figuring out where to go can be frustrating. However, it also lets you be creative - you can often get places you aren't really meant to be at yet through the creative use of abilities. \n\nThe game's plot is not overly extensive or twisty, and ends in something of a cliffhanger, but there are notes and other things laying around for you to pick up which add a bit of depth to the world. At one point you get an item which allows you to quite literally hack reality, which really raises a lot of questions as to just what exactly is going on.\n\nThe controls take some getting used to but are responsive and work quite well for the type of game it is. There is a huge variety of weapons, and even if a few of them shine brighter than others all of them are useful in one situation or another, Getting hit is punishing, there aren't too many areas where it's truly difficult to do things, and most bosses are fairly easy once you have their patterns down. \n\nArt wise, the game has a very \"organic\" feel to it, and the music goes along well with it. Even the low health beep, which is infuriating in most games, is timed to go along with the music and fades in and out, so you notice it, but isn't irritating.\n\nI only have two real issues with this game. Backtracking can be quiet slow, even once you've unlocked the intermediate area that connects all others, and you will be doing quite a lot of backtracking. Beyond that, there are several hidden zones which are unique to each save file, but the only notification these are nearby is a slight visual change that's easy to miss. However, these hidden areas don't count towards your 100% completion or any achievements, but they are a fun throwback to the glitch zones of the original Metroid, and they can contain unique (and powerful) weapons.\n\nThe characters, such as they are, are typically interesting and the mish mash of English some of them do works very well to fit in with the game's alien feel.

keep me up to 3 am on a weeknight at my age, but this game is one of them. It captures the creepiness of being in an alien world that the original Metroid conveyed quite well, but provides modern helps like a minimap that make beating the game a little more surmountable. The difficulty level is probably a good bit less than the original Metroid, but it is still engaging. Player skill is still a big factor and the demands on your skills only continues to ramp up as you get some of the late-game items. It also rewards exploration and clever solutions with its \"glitch\" mechanic to some rather unclear puzzles to get some of the more rare items. \n\nMy only complaint is that it was a little too short. Even though a veteran of these types of games, I was taking my time on this game, and it still was only about 12 hours.\n\nAs a huge fan of the Metroidvania genre (having beaten Castlevania: SotN and Super Metroid multiple times), I highly recommend this game to similar fans!

Highly recommended if you like platformers.\n\nIf I were to make any criticisms: The music got on my nerves after a while; some of the tunes are too repetitive.

The voice tells you to go get a gun in the next room & then tells you she's unable to communicate anymore due to her injuries which she needs to you help her with.  As you go on you find out you're infected with some sort of pathogen that wiped out all intelligent life on the planet you're on.  It's slowly eating away at your nervous system & will eventually kill you.  So, you need to not only save these mysterious machine beings but yourself as well.  The story does get deeper than just that but saying any more would be spoiling so I'll just end it there.\n\n[b]FEATURES[/b]\n\nThe game starts out with you getting a gun & later getting various upgrades to help you on your journey.  These are mostly upgrades for your gun but they also give you some sweet looking attire like the Lab/Trench coats.  There's also health, damage & even projectile range & size upgrades hidden throughout the game. You eventually get more weapons that all have various uses like a big beam that takes up most of the screen, but deals very little damage to a laser that pierces through enemies.  There are so many weapon types in this game that it would take a small list to fill so I'll leave the rest to official guides or let you find them whilst you play.\n\nThe game has the main story mode with two difficulties.  Normal & Hard.  I suggest anyone new to this game play on Normal as I tried Hard (which I usually do play hard difficulties) but I found it much too difficult.  The game is fairly difficult even on Normal so I recommend playing it on that setting for your first run.  There are several boss fights in this game & each boss has its own weak point which you'll need to find & hit using one of the weapons in your arsenal.  Some weapons are better suited for each boss but it's your choice of which to use.\n\nThere's also a speed-run mode which I haven't tried yet so I won't comment on it.  \n\nThis game doesn't hold your hand as you play it either.  The voice in your head gives you a task but it doesn't tell you where to go so you're free to explore at your leisure.  That's a good thing, too because there is a ton of exploration in this game.  \n\n[b]GRAPHICS[/b]\n\nThe game looks very good & it's pixel art is fantastic.  There are some areas where you may need time to adjust because the foreground uses the same colors as the background so it can be hard at first to tell what's on screen.  Eventually you're eyes get used to it, mine did anyways.  Overall the graphics look very unique & the game does things I've never seen before in any classic pixel style art game.  You really need to see it to appreciate it.\n\n[b]AUDIO[/b]\n\nThe music in this game is god-like.  Try to imagine some really techno-metal sound effects, atmospheric music & trippy sunni style vocals mixed all together in one.  That's pretty much the only way I can describe it but the end result is fantastic.  I can't really compare this game's music to anything else I've heard before.  You really have to hear it for yourself.\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\n\nThe game utilizes every button on today's standard controllers.  You may not be able to use a retro controller for this one.  Everything feels solid from jumping & shooting to dashing & grappling.  You may need to get used to the dash & grapple at first but after you figure it out you'll be grappling off the ceiling & dashing through enemies like a pro.\n\n[b]OVERALL[/b]\n\nThis game is one of the better games I've played in recent memory.

The first boss fight teaches you that the faces of the enemies are the vulnerable spots, but this doesn't hold true for the rest of the bosses. Following fights have similar face areas on the bosses, but 2 of the 4 similarly designed bosses do not follow this same fight strategy. This would be perfectly acceptable if it weren't for the fact that it is established so early in the game that the particular spot is the weak point. In addition to this, multiple boss fights felt as though there was no space for dodging projectiles and attacks, and some of the attacks were too fast with too large of hitboxes. This left me feeling cheated at certain points of the game, having to fight a boss over and over, hoping I would make one mistake less than the last time (I'm sure I just suck at the game). The most memorable and well designed boss fight was the 3rd one, where the player could shoot different parts of the boss to disable those weapons. There was also an arena that punished reckless gameplay while rewarding thoughtful execution by providing cover to certain weapons at varying times. This fight also followed the first boss' damage design which made the other two fights with similar face designs feel more confusing. The arena was spacious and provided plenty of room to dodge the projectiles. \nIn regards to the overall world design, I liked the visuals and the different areas, but I found that they didn't make structural sense in the context of a world (and I hate to compare to Metroid) like Zebes from Super Metroid. Where in Super Metroid the levels changed gradually and made sense in their placement relative to each other (lava is deeper in the planet while the crashed space ship is at the surface, burrowed partly into the crust), Axiom Verge had a world which seemed to feel more like a variety show \u00e0 la Metroid Fusion. In Fusion this made sense because Nintendo created a scientific environment testing vessel, but Axiom Verge is supposedly a continuous world.\nThe story of Axiom Verge is told through notes and written dialogue/cutscenes, and while I have no problem with this method of storytelling I found the story itself to be far less ambitious or consequential as I thought it would be. This is where I bring my first direct criticism of Tom Happ himself; he has stretched himself too thin in creating Axiom Verge as a one-man development team. Happ has a strong grasp of the metroidvania genre and he clearly understands implicit level design where the player can find the next area and item through exploration. Where he struggles is storytelling and designing a compelling narrative for players. This is fine of course because Happ is great at making a tight game that controls like none other, but with such an ambitious story for Axiom Verge, I would have preferred someone else's touch on the narrative and how the gameplay and world reflected this story. \n\nAll of these gripes are minor because I simply loved the overworld, the combat, and the sense of progression based on items and powerups. I look forward to seeing what Happ develops in the future, and I hope he can collaborate with others to create a masterpiece following this promising first major release. \n\nTL;DR\nTHE GAME IS GOOD, NOT PERFECT.

How about the sci-fi creepiness of Metroid? Or the creepy alien lair of Contra?\n\nAxiom Verge takes these elements and cranks them up. The setting is creepy, the music unsettling, and the story increasingly disturbing. There's even some impressively melancholy chiptune music at one point.\n\nThe game first starts out as an utterly shameless ripoff of Metroid. I'm talking totally shameless - everything from the enemy types to the types of environments encountered early in the game, to the Super Metroid-esque map - it all screams Metroid, and it's painfully blatant, to the point where I rolled my eyes and thought \"Does this game have *any* originality?\".\n\nWell, it does.  Not only does the game not continue in this direction, it even deliberately subverts expectations.\n\nSee that thin space that you just can't fit through? In Metroid, you'd get through it by turning into a ball. Axiom Verge never gives you an equivalent ability, but rather, a drone that can fit through spaces that you cannot. High up areas that you can't reach? Grappling hook - there is no Space Jump. Thin walls blocking your path? No, you don't speed through them and break them - you teleport through them with a special jacket. You don't freeze enemies to stand on them - you \"glitch\" some of them to stand on them, or you \"glitch\" the world on occasion.\n\nWhat's this about \"glitches\"? Well, Axiom Verge has a little fun with the fourth wall. Remember how NES games looked when they weren't working right? When graphics glitches caused things to get garbled and strange looking? When in some cases, a graphics glitch would even transform an enemy or object in such a way that its behavior became totally different? (as just one example, Chip and Dale on the NES had a weird glitch in the sewers level at the point where you went up, where if you managed to get the water at the bottom of the screen to turn white, you can suddenly stand on it as if it were ground)\n\nWell, this game does that for deliberate and sometimes unsettling effect. There are \"fake graphics glitches\" you encounter quite often, which perfectly simulate what actual NES games looked like when they malfunctioned. The glitches and how they are used almost make it seem as if the world is tearing itself apart - an impressive way to take an error from our childhoods and use it as both plot and gameplay device, not to mention to add atmosphere. There are even some creepy \"outer world\" areas that look like unholy glitched up messes with some filters that approach the fourth wall, such as filters to make the game suddenly look like it's being played on an old TV that's dealing with interference.\n\nYour \"glitch gun\" weapon (it's called the Address Disruptor) can invoke this deliberately to a degree, as it transforms enemies into glitchy abominations and even changes their behavior. An enemy may slow down, change its attacks from ones that harm you to ones that break through walls, or even try to escape you. Some of these behavior changes are the sort of thing you'd expect to see from a messed-up Game Genie code used on the NES. Or, appropriately, what NES games do when the memory addresses of objects get disrupted. This game's sole designer, Tom Happ, really knows the NES. \n\nThe graphics, while retro-inspired, actually use certain design elements of the olden days to intentional effect. Areas tend to have their own color scheme. While NES games tended to do this out of necessity (without going into super technical detail, the NES had strict color limits due to how it handled its 8 palettes at any given time), this game does it deliberately. It starts out looking a lot more NES-esque, but gradually, more color is used. It works, and the areas, while generally not having more personality beyond \"creepy and alien\", \"super creepy and alien\", \"disturbing and alien\", and \"kinda creepy but cool, and alien\", still look distinctly different. They range from tunnels with pulsating organs hanging on threads to a very strange forest that looks like something that could not only never exist on Earth, but on any planet in this universe.\n\nThe music and sound design is... interesting. Sounds are often loud and piercing, similar to old games. I assume this was intentional. The music is entirely different, and is quite the genre mix. One song I found particularly memorable started out as a melancholy NES chiptune with echo effects, and started getting louder and with more electronic non-NES instruments added. Another song features alien lyrics and chanting.\n\nThe world is huge. You will get lost. You gain new abilities and new weapons constantly, giving a rather impressive feeling of progression that few games match. As you get new abilities that aid in travel, you'll naturally have to use them, and that's when it's time to look at the map and see which areas haven't been filled out. The hallway that seems to cut off on the map - is that because you got stopped by something and were unable to reach the end? Might want to check it out.\n\nThe problem is that backtracking takes longer the further you get in the game, and there just aren't enough connecting areas or fast means of travel to really speed it up that much. I didn't find it a dealbreaker, and some enjoy that aspect of the game, but just be aware that it's there.\n\nMy other complaint is that the end of the game ramps up the difficulty to such a degree that I had to use cheap tactics to fight the last few bosses and deal with annoying, tough new enemy types. I felt like I was fighting cheapness with my own cheapness. Not the best way to end the game.\n\nDespite these complaints, Axiom Verge is an amazing game, especially for being made entirely by one person in his spare time over 5 years. It's more than just a nostalgic throwback to the creepier side of the NES with its Contra, Ninja Gaiden and Metroid inspirations along with its oddly unsettling use of \"glitches\". It's also an amazingly creative experience that plays with the expectations of the 30-somethings and late 20-somethings that it's aimed at. Even if you hold no such nostalgia for that era and that style of game, it's still a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1432611687, "timestamp_updated": 1432783680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874026", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16005867": {"recommendationid": "16005867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131876996", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459464463}, "language": "english", "review": "can enter justin-bailey password from mitriod to make character run around in swimsuit >9000/10\n\n\nTo put it simply, Axiom Verge is basically Metroid with a lot of changed mechanics, and an extremely interesting plot. And I'll probably compare it to Metroid the whole review. \n\n\nTime for random comparisons to Metroid all in the same paragraph\n\nAnyways, sadly, you can't walljump, but the jumps are less floaty than most Metroid games, fairly close to Zero Mission. The password tool is annoying just in that some passwords are very hard to find and much easier to look up in a guide, making it harder to get 100% unless you look up a guide. I wish that the weapons would stack like in Metroid games, but there are way too many weapons, although it is interesting messing around with the different weapons. The music is definetely a different style than the Metroid games, but I think it is still very good music. As for the graphics, \"HAALY *poo* DEM GREEPICS\" - JonTron 2011. Continuing on, the difficulty is nice, gets hard near the end, its easy at the start, just normal video game stuff. but it is kind of hard at the end, not easy at the start, and slightly easier at the end.

It's super expensive if you'll play it for 1 hour and never finish it, but if you like the Metroid style, you'll at least want to finish it, and spend about 10 hours on your first playthrough, which may or may not be worth it for you.\n\nOVERALLS: i don't wear them.

I was especially impressed at how the game approached similar Metroid problems in different ways (ie. mini-bombs replaced with a giant drill)\n\nThe story is interesting and engaging but ultimately it's the exploration loop and combat that keeps you coming back. The boss fights are what you'd expect in an NES type game and most can be beat fairly easy (even on hard).\n\nOn hard you are looking at 11 or hours to get 75% completion and around 20 hours for 100%. Do yourself a favor and stay away from guides. I never had any particular problems difficulty wise. As long as you take your time you'll win. The last boss can be tricky if you don't have the correct weapons though.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Metroid style games.", "timestamp_created": 1432365286, "timestamp_updated": 1432365286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15959475": {"recommendationid": "15959475", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999886976", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488061459}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a love letter to the old school metroidvania fans.

Controid I guess.  Or Metra. If I was Contra and my kid was Axiom Verge, I'd suspect my spouse to have slept with someone else, maybe Dark Seed.\n\nI observed Axiom Verge's development (by only Tom Happ) for quite some time and was looking forward to its release. I cried a little when I heard, it'd be a timed exclusive for PS4, however it's all okay again, since it was just one month. And what I got completely satisfied my thirst for a next \"true\" metroidvania.\n\nWhile games like Guacamelee! or Strider (2014) are great and fun in their own regard, the metroidvania feel gets lost when they show you where you have to go on your map. In Axiom Verge, there's no such hand holding (at least not that I was aware of). You get put in a maze and have to figure out on your own how to get through it. I backtracked wrong a couple of times, but that's more fine by me, as this defines what metroidvanias should be about - to be beaten by your own urge of exploration. And when you didn't (and I didn't...) set the markers, the game generously give you, you'll be there for some time to explore.\n\nIt took me little more than 10 hours to complete the game, if don't explore every inch, like me, and sometimes pointlessly backtrack, you can finish it in about 8. For me, this is a perfect duration. In fact, I expected the game to last about three to five hours, like, say, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, so I was pleasantly surprised when I hadn't reached the ending at all after five. \n\nThe game feels even more amazing, when I think about that it was developed by just one person. Also, this ensures that the whole game experience is a lot rounder, however it doesn't come without at least SOME downsides. I thought, that some controls (I mean you, double tapping! And you, grappling hook.) felt a bit unintuitive. The music, while providing an excellent atmosphere to the game, was looped a bit cheap in the areas, that might have been better.\n\nOtherwise Axiom Verge brings an amazing experience to every lover of the metroidvania subgenre or frightening, HR Giger like artstyle or, preferably, both.\n\nHighly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1432314099, "timestamp_updated": 1432314099, "voted_up": true,

There will be sections of the environment itself which you can remove/create with the help of this device.

Which brings me onto the Speedrun option.\n\nI haven't played the Speedrun yet, but the intentional ability to \"Glitch\" within the game makes me very excited with this! There is even an achievement if you successfully complete the game in under 4 hours (quite a long way away from my 14 hours to complete - I was trying to be thorough and enjoy the beautifully tiled worlds and well crafted music).\n\nMy experience with this game is fantastic!

I followed development for 2 years prior to release. Being a long time fan of Super Metroid, I wanted something that was as good as Super Metroid. I gave Axiom Verge a lofty set of expectations, and it exceeded almost all of them. But to keep things short and concise, my personal takeaway:\n\nPros:\n[list][*]The world is [i]very[/i] well-designed. The way pathways connect in both expected and unexpected ways, and the means by which the layout of blocks guides/teaches you is superb\n[*]The story - some may not be a fan of it, and it can be a bit hard to grasp, but I found it both different and intriguing. It's not limited to dialog/journal pages, but more subtle world elements as well\n[*]Upgrades - they start out fairly boring, almost a carbon copy of what's been done before (weapons, high-jump, etc) but eventually become bizarre and unique, allowing the player to glitch through walls and such\n[*]Controls - Movement mechanics in particular become a lot of fun once you get all the mandatory upgrades\n[*]Scope - The game is a good size; large enough to sink several hours on your first playthrough, but small enough to complete in a sitting once you've mastered it\n[*]Secrets - There are a lot of them, including an entire [i]avenue[/i] of secrets I didn't even know about in my first playthrough. Some are very devious to find[/list]\n\nCons\n[list][*]Secrets - They manage to be both pros and cons, because while a lot of them are clever, a lot are equally esoteric and almost frustrating\n[*]Note taking - you're able to mark \"reminders\" on the map, but those reminders are just \"1\" and \"2\" - having a means to note \"come back when I can jump higher\" or \"glitch wall I can't open yet\" would serve the player much better. This issue bugged me in SotN, and it's not any better here.\n[*]Weapon balance - There are a bunch of unique and interesting weapons - and most of them are useless gimmicks. The Axiom, the Kilver, the Flamethrower and the lightning gun/piercer are about the only weapons you'll ever use when dealing with day to day combat\n[*]The Climax - not strictly the \"ending\" or the \"final boss\", but the entire lead-up to the finale felt weak compared to the rest of the game. There was a lot of build-up, and the final area just didn't live up to the rest of it[/list]\n\nIn short: the weapon balance is terrible, the climax was disappointing, and in spite of that Axiom Verge is pretty much guaranteed to be my game of 2015 and one of the best platformers I've played in the last 20 years, if not the best thing since Super Metroid.\n\n\nAnd since everyone seems to like talking about price: Axiom Verge is [i]absolutely[/i] worth the $20 price tag for anyone who likes games in the vein of Super Metroid.", "timestamp_created": 1432185668, "timestamp_updated": 1432185800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15922472": {"recommendationid": "15922472", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980813135", "num_games_owned": 509, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432185503}, "language": "english", "review": "A love letter to Metroidvania that still manages to stand on its own; it's well worth the play, even if it's a little rough around the edges. I beat the game on Normal difficulty with 100% completion in 16 hours.\n\nIt gets the feel mostly right, but dialog and cutscenes happen just often enough that the sense of pleasant loneliness that comes from exploring a hostile alien world is lost. In addition, the story, while generally fine, is told somewhat strangely--too much detail to hold much mystery, and yet not enough detail to appreciate its scope. I actually think it's fine that you can't really relate to most of the characters, being that they're supposed to be so alien, but the one that you are supposed to connect with is still fairly bland.\n\nControls are fine--the addition of a lock button to hold still while aiming is a nice touch, but there's a dash ability that requires double-tapping a direction that gets kind of old, and probably should have been its own button. Nonetheless, the game presents enough interesting ways of maneuvering around the environment that just traversing rooms feels pretty satisfying.\n\nItem collection is probably the game's weakest aspect--there's a ton of backtracking, and the map doesn't have any indication of what items you have or haven't gotten--it only tells you if you got them all. This would be forgivable if there weren't a pretty sizable number of items that are almost impossible to find without a cheat sheet or a lot of obsessive checking of every single wall, and some require even more unorthodox solutions--I'm all about out-of-the-box problem-solving, but the game gives little indication of even where to start in some parts (helpful hint: try 'scrambling' every enemy at least once to see what it does.) When you don't feel like you can trust the information provided by the game--when you aren't even given indication that you *should* be curious about a room--it makes for a pretty tedious exploration experience. This is further exacerbated by the lack of a final powerup that essentially trivializes navigation in the early areas of the game--an important element that helps mitigate the fact that the threats of the areas you're backtracking through are no longer challenging to someone with all the weapons and power-ups the endgame affords.\n\nVisually, the game knocks it out of the park--environments and enemies are beautifully bizarre, and come in almost endless variety. Nothing more to really say about it--it's a visual treat you'll be happy to pore over.\n\nThe sound design is similarly excellent: the music has good variety while keeping a certain pulsing feel that makes every area feel alive and alien; your weapons sound appropriately powerful, and your enemies sound appropriately monstrous. The only two knocks I have here are the low-health alert, while cleverly timed to the beat of the music, is rather piercing, and the \"clang\" you get when you hit an invulnerable part of an enemy becomes overpowering when you start fighting large bosses with rapid-fire weapons (since they tend to be almost entirely invulnerable save for a small weak point.)\n\nOverall, this is a great game, and my complaints are really mostly nit-picking--I enjoyed it thoroughly, and I can't wait to see the next game from Mr. Happ.", "timestamp_created": 1432179817, "timestamp_updated": 1432619925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15922445": {"recommendationid": "15922445", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987032560", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433730736}, "language": "english", "review": "The best metroidvania game that isn't Metroid or Castlevania that you will play this year.

Everything about this game is utterly fantastic. The gameplay, the graphics, the music (good lord the music). Axiom Verge is a love letter to Metroid in video game form. It is -unabashedly- Metroid. If you grew up on 2D platformers, this will be your jam. Even if you didn't, PLAY THIS GAME. It was made by a single dude! \n\nIt's a short but sweet experience. I'd say on average it'll last anywhere from 8 to 12 hours. I clocked in at 11 and a half hours as my clear time. There's a ton of collectables and hidden items scattered throughout the game, but most are pretty optional. \n\nSpeaking of collectables and hidden items, Axiom Verge has a lot of weapons. A LOT of weapons. I think there's 20 or so? A minor gripe I had was that despite the vast array of weaponry, only a handful are actually useful. It seems like the design mentality was akin to \"sounds cool on paper\", but in practice it ends up being pretty useless. Fortunately, the handful of weapons that are good are REALLY GOOD. And to be fair, some of the \"useless\" weapons are really useful against certain bosses.\n\nAnother gripe I had was regarding some of the controls. Two upgrades in particular, the Grapple and the various Dash upgrades you get have kinda... janky controls. They're pretty unwieldy. The grapple's just plain hard to use, and the dash, well...

The story is different, the weapons are different.\nBut you jump around, exploring areas with funny names on an alien planet, fighting hordes of enemies, and bosses that are waaaay bigger than  you.\n\nFor something made by one person, and their vision. It's pretty damn amazing. \nAxiom Verge does, what Nintendon't (Or haven't done in a god damn while).\n\nI'm not going to give a score, because I don't think games can be label good or bad with a single number.\nI will say that this game IS amazing, and hits a lot of the right notes for me.\n\nGiven there are a few things I don't quite like/agree with design-wise. Though this should be taken as a way to make the game better.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing visuals, things look pretty... well, there are some ugly things, but that's intentional!\n- Interesting story (I wanted to know more and more about where I was and what was going on).\n- Tight controls, walking and jumping around feels good and responsive.\n- Rewards gaming instincts. \n- JUSTIN-BAILEY\n- Tutorials through experimentation/gameplay.\n- Music is great and fits the setting. Elements of the HUD, and cutscenes are in time with the music. I love this stuff!\n- I want more of it.\n- Characters are well rounded, and have emotions. One of the \"Good\" characters even kills you at one point out of anger.\n- Moral ambiguity, makes for interesting story, and thought provoking situations.\n- Many hidden secrets, but much like Metroid, they can be in stupid places. Though I found 70% of items my first time.\n- Lots of weapons, all act differently. I found a use for most of them at least once, but I stuck with the main weapon.\n- Cool toys! You get a bloody corruptor, you can glitch out enemies and make them do weird stuff!\n- Not too much backtracking, not until you're tricked out with all the fancy toys, making it easy to get around.\n\nCons:\n- The Final Boss is a bit... Hard. Could just be me, but it's way too hectic. And was pretty much \"Shoot the thing and win\".\n- I would have liked to see the final boss actually use some of the tools and tricks you picked up.\n- The \"Invalid\" hit noise, that Metroid had too, is freaking loud, and can play over the top of itself!\n- Some areas, mainly the first and second one, kind of blended together for me.\n- I want more of it.\n- Kinda open/underwhelming ending, this could be for a sequel though.

This is an awesome game.  This is something that feels like it came straight out of the early nineties. Something that could almost have existed on the SNES with a bit more of the harsh pixels of the NES. A soundtrack that is electronic; Dark and brooding that still somehow seems like it could also be coming from one of those old consoles.  \n\n  It plays and control in nearly the same way as Castlevania Symphony of the Night, and Super Metroid. Running around collecting items and equipment to run around again, getting farther, deeper, to collect more items and equipment.  The game can be grueling if you aren't an explorer.  Finding weapon damage power ups as well as the weapons themselves can be hard.  Some of them much more well hidden than others.  Maps, and the \"cheat codes\" are mandatory for some pickups.  Searching the web for secrets made me feel like I was back on dial up just hoping I could figure it out.\n\n  I recommend a controller.  I found it the easiest way to pull off some of the harder \"jumping teleporting pet lobbing teleporting again and then again\" jumps.  The game can be beaten in under four hours with a map and a plan, but it's much more fun to go it yourself. When you get stuck, get help with that part and then continue.  You can always come back when you miss something.\n\n  The only two things I might gripe about are the asking price and the myriad of weapons that are either useless or bothersome to use.   I would have been a bit more solid on the price if it were 15 or closer to that.  Many weapons are specialized.  None seem to be \"super effective\" against any one kind of enemy, nor are there really any types of enemy.  They all seem to just have a base health pool, and you deal damage until they are dead.  No shielding, no regenerating and no armor.  There is a hotswitch button to change weapons without opening the weapon wheel.  This is underused completely. I simply stuck to the most powerful gun in the game until I found a more powerful one.  \n  If you're having trouble progressing, a power upgrade or two can let you breeze by.  I found particularly the last boss to suffer from this.  It seemed near impossible with my weak weapons.  Even the enemies leading up to the boss were giving me trouble.  I went back and collected a few upgrades and a weapon I missed.  Returned swiftly to the boss and there was no difficulty.  I simply destroyed him.  Unlike most of the bosses there was no pattern, nothing to learn.  I just shot the weak spot and I won in seconds.  Sadly a weak ending gameplay wise.\n\n  This is still an amazing game, beautiful to look at, slightly upsetting sometimes as well.  With it's near gore style in some sections, mechanical biological machine in others... the \"friends\" that you meet on the way are also terrifying monsters in their own right.  You should get this game, maybe wait for a sale? but it's nolstalga that plays amazing.

Namely in the form of a speedrun mode, size of map, a hard mode, and a couple other specific challenges for the achievement hunting folks out there (don't die more than once)\n\nI definitely recommend this game in the hopes other developers will see how successful this game is as an example of what TO DO when you want to make a metroid-vania game. \n\nSeriously though, Kur has one of the worst BGM's I have ever heard. I never had to mute a game everytime I get to a specific area. hah. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1431946471, "timestamp_updated": 1431946471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15883480": {"recommendationid": "15883480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014977552", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432463194}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu avec des Verges!!!!!!, et bah non , rien de sexuelle, a part peut etre une bonne erection dans le slip apr\u00e9s avoir fais quelque minutes de jeu.\nMetroidvania ou carrement metroid like car le seul defaut du jeu a mon sens et de vraiment plagi\u00e9 ou honor\u00e9r son ain\u00e9 sur beaucoup de choses comme l agencement des niveaux ou les ennemies recurant qui nous font l illustre honeur d arbor\u00e9 un swap color metris\u00e9... ainsi qu une traduction level dakar mais rien de grave ;)\nLE point noir du jeu \u00e9tant passer, voyons ce qu il y a de bon en lui:\n- Graphisme semi 16bits de bon gout ou 8bits de grande classe au choix, \n- des armes et am\u00e9liorations en pagaille \n- Des boss g\u00e9ant avec des patterns sympa qui vous donnerons du fil a retordre lors du mode speedrun et de certains achievements.\n- une bonne maniabilit\u00e9 et des mechanisme original de combats ( transformer des ennemies en version beta et regarder le resultat ;) )\n- une musique DIVINE qui resteras dans votre tete et l envie inexpliqu\u00e9 d \u00e9couter l ost au travail :p\n-une dur\u00e9e de vie raisonnable mais pas dingue pour ce genre de jeu. le curieux pourras finir le jeu sans ce lasser avant la fin et le gourmand pourras optimis\u00e9 ces parti en vue de speed ren\u00e9 le jeu :p\n\nNe vous fiez pas au nom salasse du jeu, il n est pas l\u00e0 pour vous vaseliner l orifice, \nce jeu, c est votre ami.\n", "timestamp_created": 1431941420, "timestamp_updated": 1431941420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15882745": {"recommendationid": "15882745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010209691", "num_games_owned": 874, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484462490}, "language": "english", "review": "I followed the development of this game for two years and had no second thoughts about throwing down $20 for it on day one.

From the mind of one man, who made all the art, music, story and gameplay, comes one of the best Metroid games I've ever played(my favorite game series, sans Other M).  Now, that's being a bit disingenuous, since Axiom Verge very much adds a lot to the Metroid formula, though makes no bones about where its inspirations initially come from.  \n\nThrough abilities such as teleportation, the Address Disruptor(a gun that creates NES-era visual data corruption on objects and enemies, similar to if you put an NES cart in wrong), the drone, and other abilities, it expands on the standard 2D Metroid gameplay in a huge way.  The lack of a run button is kind of a bummer, but that's a minor quibble, and the only major gripe is that teleportation requires a double-tap in the direction you want to teleport, which means trying to do this on an analog stick is pretty much luck-based.  I wind up going sideways when I want to go up, up when I want to go sideways far too often, but there's other means of movement that I can resort to to avoid that.\n\nThe graphics are incredible.  Using a faux-8-bit style with setpieces and bosses that fill the screen(or beyond!), I would say it is a visual combination of Metroid and H.R. Geiger.  Every single tile and object is covered with minute details, from dents and rust on bosses and enemies, to throbbing veins in organic scenery.  The Rusalki are incredibly unnerving looking, as you'll see as you play the game.  The gross organic look of many objects and enemies mixed with the technological parts of others makes for horrible techno-organic nightmare machines.  Backgrounds and terrain are lovingly detailed, and the special effects are straight-up surprising.  While I've been following the game for a while and thus knew about things like the Address Disruptor's effects, or what a boss death looks like, these things will likely shock a new player with their \"oh, right, this is a modern game!\" effect.\n\nThe weaponry is plenty and varied.  Not all are useful, plenty are gimmicky, but most have their time to shine.  I wound up sticking with the starter weapon for long range, and the Kelver for close up for most of the game, switching to about a half dozen other weapons throughout the game for specific reasons.  At the end I still hadn't found a full half of the total weapon count, so I'm eager to get back in and track them down.\n\nThe music is outstanding.  The boss fight themes are all frantic and intense, and the general world exploration themes are fitting to their respective zones.  I am definitely going to buy the soundtrack once it goes on sale.\n\nThe story starts off as basically Half-Life 1.  Lab experiment goes wrong, you get teleported to hostile alien world full of horrible death creatures.  Trace is a pretty interesting character whose reactions to things are pretty justified.  The Rusalki, your \"narrators\", essentially, are alien AI and have different personalities themselves that evolve as the game progresses.  By the end, I was mostly satisfied with the story, and a few sections of the game blew me away(the Hallucination section, in particular, was one of my favorite parts of a game in years).  Athetos, Trace, the Rusalki, they COULD have had more fleshed out stories, but I think it was fine as it was.  There's more to the story in hidden notes and such, possibly a true ending as well?  Not entirely sure, still haven't collected everything as of this review.\n\nGame time clocked in at around 12-13 hours total for a 70% playthrough for me.  I'm the sort to fumble around trying to find secrets though, so an 8-10 hour playthrough wouldn't surprise me, and there's a speedrun achievement for beating it in 4 hours, so there's that.  It's definitely a much longer Metroid game than most Metroids tend to be.\n\nOverall I'd say this was a 10 out of 10.  The only complaint of mine, detailed earlier, is for a single movement ability that works most of the time.  I was constantly exploring new regions and surprised by the variety in terrain, the music is great, very fitting, and only gets better as the game goes on, the gameplay was fun and very varied while providing plenty of options for weaponry, the visuals are some of the best 8-bit style graphics ever made, and the story is perfectly serviceable.

If you're into this genre or have a craving for a game filled with exploration, powerups, and rewarding backtracking, then look no further.\n\nPros:  \n\n-- Do you know what metroidvania is?  This is a near-perfectly executed game if you're into the genre.\n-- Challenging gameplay (you must set it to hard for the true experience!!!)\n-- Fantastic weaponry, powerups, and upgrades do what you hope they would:  expand your abilities and open up new areas for exploration. \n--  I especially liked that your upgrades didn't suffer from the \"grapple hook\" phenomenon where the only thing you can do with your tools is use them on tiles specifically marked (like the grapple hook tiles from the Metroid games).  The game probably won't stump you completely with the platforming puzzles, but it won't make it stupidly obvious with grapple hook/power bomb tiles.\n-- Great, difficult level design will have you praying for save points.  Really satisfies your urge to explore and backtrack.  There are scripted sequences, and often times when you're going through a new level that you'll have sections between save points you'll have to retry many times until you figure out how to tackle the enemies.\n-- Disturbing bio-mechanical themes (think Geiger without all the sex).\n\n\nCons:\n\n-- The color palette was often abrasive and muddled to me.  There were times when I couldn't distinguish background from foreground/boundary tiles.  This isn't a deal-breaker, but I would love to see someone mod this particular aspect of the game.

Controls are unresponsive and awkward and there's no dual-stick option, which is ridiculously anachronistic for any side-scrolling shooter released in 2015.\n\nOnly two bosses in and I'm also thoroughly unimpressed with the boss design. The first boss is just a generic bullet-hell spammer, while the second boss might as well be from a rhythm game. Both follow the formula of getting gradually faster as you tediously chip away at their health 0.5% at a time. The second boss also appeared to be glitched, as ducking under the high bullets only worked about half the time. This meant jumping over the high bullets, which the timing doesn't seem to realistically allow once the boss is at its fastest.\n\nCoupled with the damage knockback and maybe only 200ms of immunity after taking damage, there's no recovering after you inevitably get hit. Outside of that boss battle, the knockback also has a tendency to send you through doors and, upon reentering the room you were just kicked out of, the enemy who knocked you back is often sitting on the door and instantly depletes your remaining health.\n\nArt is fantastic, soundtrack is pretty decent (although the bass mix is ridiculous, turn down your sub before playing unless you enjoy head-throbbing migraines), and the concept is solid.

I couldn't wait for it to drop on Steam. So, I never thought I'd be writing a negative review for it.\n\nI did have fun with the game, but that's where the praise begins and ends. Of course, the soundtrack and art style are very cool and attractive, but the game proper underwhelms.\n\nThe game length is quite short (8 hours with ~85% completion), and the early parts are fun, but you quickly become too powerful for any of the game's enemies to be a threat to you, even on Hard mode. Basically, that means Axiom Verge quickly becomes focused on the exploration aspect.\n\nWhile exploring is half the fun of any metroidvania, the game gets into a slump where you're just dashing around the map like a mad man toward any undiscovered map tile, ignoring enemies and trying to find the next powerup (which you only need to get to the next powerup, anyway). The enemies might as well not even be in the game; you hardly deal with them past the first couple hours of the game.\n\nThe real problem with this game is the controls. Bosses get damn near impossible at the end of the game; one tiny tap on the control sticks will switch out your weapon, or enter the radial weapon select menu, or send you double-tap dashing in a random direction. The final boss fight was a nightmare akin to a Mario Party minigame, where I was spinning my D-Pad around and mashing buttons like crazy, just praying to get through it. The final upgrade you get is practically impossible to control, since it seems to have a mind of its own in terms of controller deadspace and which directions it \"thinks\" you wanted to double-tap.\n\nThe bottom line is that the game suffers from simplistic level and enemy design. If enemies were designed to be tough at first but then much easier to beat with each successive upgrade, there would be a sense of difficulty progression, but the game feels like a flatline item-hunt after the first couple hours. Also, the story is mostly incomprehensible, although to be fair, I haven't read all the collectible note logs. It's possible that the story does get fleshed out and has a great ending, but I personally wasn't gripped by anything the story had to offer.\n\nThat being said, I still think any self-respecting metroidvania fan ought to give Axiom Verge a go.

Follows the formula; Start exploring, see something you can't interact with, find the item to interact with it and get through, repeat. \n\nPlatforming/Movement: MegaMan-like, no momentum and instant acceleration. Works well enough when the platforming isn't where the challenge is, it's the shooting. Only problem I ran into was the dash ability you eventually unlock, which is a little too sensitive. Works by double-tapping a direction, and from fidgeting on platforms, I would constantly dash myself off of them.\n\nCombat: Easily the game's biggest strength, there are a ton of different weapons to find, and all of them are optional (apart from the first), I think. I found a use for just about every weapon at some point, which is a nice surprise given the lack of ammo/damage types that are usually present to force weapon variety. Somewhat challenging boss fights, though it helps if you have the \"correct\" weapon for the fight.\n\nStory/Exploration: Story was weird enough to keep me guessing at where it was going, but interesting enough to keep me invested in what was going on. Granted, if it takes too long to progress and get to the next story beat, you might not care about the plot anymore. Nearing the end, I took about an hour and a half of backtracking to find the one room I needed, which was starting to get to me. The map would feel familiar to anyone that's played Super Metroid, with the different zones having their own look, but fitting together nicely. Trying to find secret passageways is nicely rewarded, decent total number of collectables in the world, that have immediate benefits.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it, recommended if you enjoy metroidvania platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1431836372, "timestamp_updated": 1431836372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15865076": {"recommendationid": "15865076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039707389", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460867172}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9b42\u6597\u7f57\u52a0\u6076\u9b54\u57ce \u8ba9\u6211\u627e\u56de\u4e86\u7ae5\u5e74", "timestamp_created": 1431835273, "timestamp_updated": 1431835273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15863947": {"recommendationid": "15863947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076492050", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455437997}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't find anything bad with this game.\nGameplay, controls, sound effects, music, enemies/boss design, level design, art direction, story.\nIt's all great.\nFirst playthrough completed in 15 hours and I'll definitely replay it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1431827923, "timestamp_updated": 1431827923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15863801": {"recommendationid": "15863801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020275327", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431898611}, "language": "english", "review": "Q: Is it Metroid?\nA: Yes, it is Metroid.", "timestamp_created": 1431827080, "timestamp_updated": 1431827080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493590", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15863052": {"recommendationid": "15863052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014873575", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434146737}, "language": "english", "review": "I love when a game developer can take retro feels and turn it into an innovative game.

However it turned out surprisingly good for a one-man project. Not bad at all, Mr. Happ.\n\nAxiom Verge's story is alright but nothing that will stick with you. It does start out promising but as I've uncovered more of the story, either via \"cutscenes\" or hidden collectable letters (an idea I always welcome), the less I cared for it. It's really hard to win me over with a story so take this information with a grain of salt.\n\nGraphically it looks very reminiscent to Metroid and the games' overworld provides some beautiful sceneries, tho I think that fore- and background visuals often look very inconsistent. Nevertheless they get the job done and I really love the overall asthetic, right down to the garbled mess of glitchy sprites. The music is for the most part well done and greatly add to the isolating atmosphere of the game, but the instrumentation in some of the tracks can get very annoying.\n\nThere are over 20 different modules for your \"Axiom Disruptor\" to find, and while I haven't unlocked all of these modules yet, I've found myself only using 2 of them in my entire playthrough as both were efficient enough to destroy whatever came in front of me. Along your way through the game you will also pick up items that allow you to literally glitch through obstacles, dash or let you cling on ceilings and swing across pits \"Bionic Commando-style\". Player control is well done with the exception of performing dashes which require you to double-press your analog stick or digital pad to the intended direction. It often happened that I dashed without actually wanting to do that maneuver. Not only that but the analog stick control in the main menu is overly sensitive. I've played Axiom Verge with a XBOX360 controller and I'd like to hear feedback regarding this issue from other players.\n\nThomas Happ did a really good job with the design of the overworld. I haven't found myself stuck at any point during my playthrough despite the lack of information given to the player (as it should be). Even backtracking to locations you've already been at before doesn't feel like a chore. Secrets are very well hidden and will require some extensive searching. I'd argue that the level design is Axiom Verges' strongpoint.\n\nAnd despite all the good things I have to say about this game, it somewhat lacks its own identity. It lends itself way too much to Metroid and plays it safe. And the somewhat lackluster story doesn't help to emigrate that feeling.\nAlso I don't think that the game provides enough content for the 20\u20ac Steam is asking for it. I think that 15\u20ac at max are a good investment.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAxiom Verge schafft es, das Metroid-Feeling im Spiel aufkeimen zu lassen, geht aber auf Nummer sicher und kopiert Metroid lediglich, anstatt auf dem altbew\u00e4hrten Konzept der bekannten Reihe aufzubauen. Dennoch ist es eine respektable Leistung f\u00fcr ein Ein-Mann-Entwicklerteam, gute Arbeit Mr. Happ.\n\nDie Geschichte von Axiom Verge geht in Ordnung aber es ist keine, die den meisten Spielern lange im Ged\u00e4chtnis bleiben wird. Am Anfang beginnt sie vielversprechend doch je mehr von der Geschichte aufgedeckt wurde, entweder durch Cutscenes oder versteckten Notizbl\u00e4ttern, desto weniger interessierte sie mich. Ich bin nur sehr schwer mit einer guten Videospielgeschichte zu \u00fcberzeugen, daher solltet ihr meine Meinung zur Geschichte nicht zu w\u00f6rtlich nehmen.\nDie deutsche \u00dcbersetzung ist tolerabel, einige Rechtschreibfehler gilt es zu verkraften.\n\nGrafisch lehnt sich Axiom Verge an Metroid an und die Overworld bietet hier und da auch einige sch\u00f6ne Kulissen an, auch wenn es \u00f6fters vorkommt, dass Vor- und Hintergrundgrafiken oftmals sehr inkonsistent zueinander wirken. Die \u00c4sthetik des Spiel gef\u00e4llt mir sehr gut, bishin zu den grotesken Glitchgrafiken. Die Musik ist gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils sehr gut und verleiht der Overworld auch eine unglaublich gute Atmosph\u00e4re der Isolation. Nur wurde die Instrumentation f\u00fcr einige Musikst\u00fccke \u00fcngl\u00fccklich getroffen, was beim l\u00e4ngeren Verbleib in einer bestimmten Sektion auf die Nerven gehen kann.\n\n20 verschiedene Waffenmodule gilt es f\u00fcr deinen \"Axiom Disruptor\" zu finden. Allerdings habe ich w\u00e4hrend meines Playthroughs nur von zwei von diesen Gebrauch gemacht, da beide sich gut komplementiert haben und der Rest nicht wirklich hilfreich erschien. Au\u00dfer Waffen findet man in Axiom Verge noch weitere Items, die einem erm\u00f6glichen, sich durch W\u00e4nde zu glitchen, einen Dashmove auszuf\u00fchren oder sich an Decken anzuh\u00e4ngen und \u00fcber Abgr\u00fcnde zu schwingen, wie in \"Bionic Commando\". Die Steuerung wurde im Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen gut umgesetzt. Allerdings hatte ich das Problem, dass die Spielfigur \u00f6fters den Dashmove eingesetzt hat ohne dass ich dies auch wollte (Doppel-Tippen des Analgsticks oder Digitalpads in eine bestimme Richtung). Au\u00dferdem ist die Steuerung im Men\u00fc mittels Analogsticks viel zu empfindlich. Ich habe Axiom Verge mit einem XBOX360 Controller gespielt und w\u00fcrde gerne wissen, ob auch andere User die selben Probleme hatten)\n\nThomas Happ hat hervorragende Arbeit bei der Gestaltung der Overworld geleistet. Nicht einmal w\u00e4hrend meines gesamten Playthroughs bin ich irgendwo h\u00e4ngen geblieben, trotz sp\u00e4rlicher Informationen, die dem Spieler vorgesetzt werden (wie es auch sein sollte). Selbst das Backtracking in Areale, die man schon besucht hat, belastet nicht. Secrets sind sehr gut versteckt worden und es bedarf ein waches Auge um sie alle zu finden. Meiner Meinung nach ist das Leveldesign die gr\u00f6\u00dfte St\u00e4rke von Axiom Verge.\n\nUnd trotz all den guten Dingen, die ich \u00fcber das Spiel zu sagen habe, fehlt diesem eine eigene identit\u00e4t. Es lehnt sich einfach zu sehr an Metroid an und geht auf Nummer sicher. Und auch die schwache Geschichte des Spiels tr\u00e4gt nicht dazu bei, es vom Muster zu differenzieren.\nUnd ich denke nicht, dass das Spiel genug Content abliefert, um die 20\u20ac rechtfertigen zu k\u00f6nnen, die Steam f\u00fcr das Spiel verlangt. 15\u20ac w\u00e4ren noch in Grenzen.", "timestamp_created": 1431795533, "timestamp_updated": 1431795533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566936", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15857009": {"recommendationid": "15857009", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987630953", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436702968}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is, on the surface, a metroid clone.

With multiple collectables upgrades for health, weapon damage, range, projectile size, and various special upgrades, the game's structure plays out with the exact same progression as a metroid game. The most interesting gameplay mechanic comes from a sort of 'virus' that appears to plague the planet you are present on, and it is represented as game corruption (the kind you get when you don't put a game cartridge all the way in or run a rom through a corruptor). There's even a weapon upgrade that allows you to corrupt tiles and enemies with various, and sometimes bizzare, results.\n\nThe music is very solid, and while the graphical fidelity may be lower due to using pixel art, there is enough in the way of modern particle effects and distortion to make the game feel visually polished. Sadly, while the story is interesting enough, the main character is fairly forgettable, but Axiom Verge isn't a story driven game in any capacity, so this doesn't hurt the game much, if at all.\n\nThis game is of course not as polished as an actual metroid title, but is well worth playing, and at the very least has rightfully earned my 20 dollars.", "timestamp_created": 1431746621, "timestamp_updated": 1431746621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540490", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15847897": {"recommendationid": "15847897", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970724214", "num_games_owned": 773, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 1061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431756316}, "language": "english", "review": "Axiom Verge is a good game in the vein of Metroid/Super Metroid with Castlevania-esque graphics circa 1990. It's rather impressive for a title made by one person, but it's not without faults. The gameplay itself is very tight and enjoyable, and the story, while sort of predictable, is interesting to a point. There's a ton of upgrades to obtain, and many of them are optional. One thing I do like is that most upgrades boost the stats of all of your weapons, including damage, bullet size and range. This is an excellent way to make weapons feel less useless throughout the game, but the problem is there's so many weapons that you'll likely only use a handful of them. I think I had around 13 or so, and I kept defaulting to the best ones, some of which are from the first quarter or third of the game.\n\nSecrets are kind of interesting, as while there's a lot of secrets that are the same playthrough to playthrough, some of them, the secret worlds that look more retro and glitchy than the rest of the game, are randomized. You get 5 of them, and one of them is supposed to contain a strong weapon. Unfortunately I couldn't ever find the secret world with the weapon in it, but it's a really cool idea.\n\nThe game has an interesting \"speed run mode\" where it'll put time stamps on killing bosses and automatically skip text and cutscene stuff, so that's pretty cool if you're into speed runs.\n\nI guess the only other gripe I have besides there being a state of weapon overload, some of the level design could be more interesting. Much of this could be chalked up to the NES style, what with the blocky setting, but many of the underground areas lack their own gimmick to make the areas feel more separate. Also, I guess another extra thing on top of it is the last boss is really unsatisfying. Like, RNG bad. You are basically trading hits until it's over, so if you don't have a ton of upgrades or the flamethrower it's going to be rough (beware low %!). It's really up to if you get health drops or not, which sometimes you get absolutely fucked on. Not really a great way to close off an otherwise really fun experience.\n\nAll of this aside, I still feel like it's $20 well spent, though I'm highly biased toward Metroidvania titles. There's a lot of fantasy themed Metroidvanias to pick from (Chasm, Valdis Story, UnEpic, and eventually Bloodstained) but not really many sci-fi ones.

Recent trends have a seen a move towards the super hard \u2018Rogue-like\u2019 game and with no new Castlevania or Metroid on the horizon gamers have been at a loss as to how to scratch their map filling itch. But fear not because Axiom Verge is here and it\u2019s a little big special.\n\nThe brain child of one man studio Tom Happ, the game follows the long twisting story of a scientist who awakens in a strange world after he dies in an accident. It\u2019s certainly closer to Metroid than Castlevania but there\u2019s also enough of a difference to not make it seem like one of those carbon copy knock offs you used to get called things like Poc-Man or Space Invaded. Considering the lack of this type of game around at the minute and the fact the last proper 2D Metroid was back on the Gameboy Advance there\u2019s certainly a gap in the market.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with this type of game then let us explain. In Axiom Verge you explore and leap around the various landscapes shooting monsters and looking for useful objects. Upgrades normally give you a new move of some kind. In this case the first few you find add a drill for destroying certain types of wall, a high jump and shift scrambler thing. These objects then allow bypassing of certain obstacles and exploring further. You basically keep going until you meet a boss or hit an area where you clearly need something to progress and it\u2019s wonderfully addictive as your little map constantly updates and fills out the layout of the areas.\n\nOf course, you have to want to explore and Axiom Verge does a good job of keeping you locked into it. The environments are beautifully realised in their old school pixel style and each area has a unique look and characteristic. Enemy types also vary widely from area to area and the accompanying musical score sets the scene perfectly. The game also does a good job of keeping interesting looking things just about out of sight so you are always intrigued to go back later and see what they are.\n\nThe bosses you come up against start off large and proceed to get bigger and badder as the game progresses. They all require decent dexterity and brain power to overcome and this is a throwback to the shoot the 'glowing weak spot\u2019 of old days. We didn\u2019t come across anything crushingly difficult but you do need to be your toes. The difficulty level in general is set just about right. There is the odd spike here and there but our exploration was never stopped for too long. It can be annoying to be sent back a long way to the last save point but you do keep your exploration progress.\n\nThe save points are spread around each area and see our hero entering a pod which regenerates their health. These aren\u2019t exactly everywhere so you do have been careful when exploring as there can be a bit of distance between them. We did find this a little frustrating to begin with but once we found a few upgrades it became much less of an issue. The one thing we really would have liked to have seen is the ability to teleport between save points. It was the developer\u2019s choice not to integrate this but it would have solved the frustration of realising you need to be all the way over on the other side of the map.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much hand holding here either. Don\u2019t expect map markers of flashing squares to guide you to where you need to go. We didn\u2019t really have much issue with this as you nearly always have to go to the bit you haven\u2019t been able to explore yet so it wasn\u2019t exactly rocket science to work out what to do next most of the time. If you do find something that looks interesting the PC version now allows you to drop a little reminder marker there for you to come back to later.\n\nLevel design is strong throughout, which is good as there\u2019s a serious chunk of game to get through here. It\u2019s massively impressive to think this has been created by a one person team as it has the production values and feel of something made by a much bigger collection of people. It\u2019s filled with moments that you\u2019ll remember and it seems to have been so carefully created that you can\u2019t help but marvel at what has been achieved at times.\n\nOverall, Axiom Verge is a highly impressive game. It remains original enough while playing off core values of classic games to keep away feelings that you\u2019ve seen it all before. It offers up surprises and fun new things to play with at regular intervals and gives players some big beasties to test themselves against. It\u2019s a well thought-out game that has moments of genuine brilliance among a core of all round good design. It\u2019s very easy to recommend this to fans of the genre as there hasn\u2019t been a Metroidvania this good since Zero Mission.\n\nOverall 8/10\n\nhttp://www.retro101.co.uk/2015/05/axiom-verge-review-pc.html", "timestamp_created": 1431723378, "timestamp_updated": 1431723378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15844134": {"recommendationid": "15844134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067151874", "num_games_owned": 3141, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452551897}, "language": "english", "review": "It\u00b4s a great Metroidvania, I love it, it\u00b4s hard and addictive!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0gZfZ76CCY", "timestamp_created": 1431722399, "timestamp_updated": 1431722399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496556", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15843971": {"recommendationid": "15843971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087609208", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453485525}, "language": "german", "review": "TOP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1431721615, "timestamp_updated": 1431721615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.405768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15841266": {"recommendationid": "15841266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035742573", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467131415}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is hella.\nBest played with lights off and headphones on.", "timestamp_created": 1431709513, "timestamp_updated": 1431709513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15840823": {"recommendationid": "15840823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009767971", "num_games_owned": 353, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488875800}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the closest you will ever get to experiencing Super Metroid again.

Yes please!\nSurprisingly there are very few retro metroidvania games that exist on Steam, so the erection experienced was fierce when I found out that Axiom Verge was making a appearance.\n\nOn a more serious note...\nAs a whole this game is rather impressive, with nice environments to explore, pleasing musics to be heard, crisp and responsive controls to be played and quality pixel are to be seen. But if we were to dissect Axiom Verge and take a closer look at our samples we will start to find a couple of flaws. \n\nThis peculiar world is big and vast but has many empty areas which aren't fully utilised; it seems like there are a few too many pointless areas and places which act like filler or a waste of space. But, you find a tool called the \"Address Disruptor\" which can be used to disintegrate certain walls and bring platforms into existence. While altering the environment it also has a effect on the creatures as well. Some of them can be altered to allow you to access new areas you originally couldn't get too. A little creature that shoots beams at you will transform and instead shoot enemies or blow up walls, while a floating ball can be made more solid and ridden on to allow you to get to hard to reach places. Very neat and fun addition to the game.\n\nWhile the boss designs are brilliant, they really lack any form of difficulty and each fight so far seems to be underwhelming and unrewarding. (The biggest downfall IMO but maybe this might be better on the hard difficulty) For example you fight this one guy who is absolutely huge and intimidating, but the entire fight is spent standing behind a wall and peaking out shots between his attacks. Another fight I spent the entire time crouched down spamming my weapon fire while the boss just sent shots over my head. So far I have 1 shot all bosses and they are quite lame fights to be honest :(\n\nConclusion\nThis is starting to sound like a negative review but it truly isn't. When you put all the pieces together the game shines as a fun and addicting platformer that I can really see myself sinking a lot of time into. Sometimes I feel I need to do something more productive with the time given to me. But I can't resist it when you have game developers/music producers like Thomas Happ, who with tender love and care create absolute quality games by sinking their heart and soul into them. While it's not without its flaws, I can't recommend this game enough to every gamer who likes to dabble in retro platforming goodness.", "timestamp_created": 1431671103, "timestamp_updated": 1431831141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15834908": {"recommendationid": "15834908", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978590783", "num_games_owned": 686, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431841813}, "language": "english", "review": "Axiom Verge is a fantastic castle-metroid-'em-up.\n\nIt hides its secrets in really cool ways.

Full of great, responsive Metroidvania gameplay. Very close feel to Metroid, without seeming like a clone. Great ascetics and atmosphere. Menu systems are great, as are the map and weapon systems.  \n\nGameplay:\nControls are very tight, and I highly suggest that you play this one with a PS3/PS4 controller. Having the dpad in the main spot and the precision of the gamepad is vital near the end of the game, where you use one of your swifter moves and require precise use of it (or at least I did to stay alive) during the final battle. Doing this double tap Left/Right with a joystick is ok at first, but it is very difficult near the end.\n\nThe weapons are fantastic, and I implore you to find them all. Each weapon as it's great strengths, even if they felt miniscule in the final few rooms, where the enemies are quite tough. Superb selection. Movement is tight, and I very much loved how responsive the game was.  \n\nStory:\nStunning, while you are in a place that you don't understand, the alien story is nice and simple, while leaving ambiguity in droves, even after the end of the game. Smells like a sequel :)\n\nWhile games like this (due to ADHD) tend to make me only play in small bursts at first, man, was I HOOKED near 2nd half of the game, going after every nook and cranny of each map section. Even though I took time to explore every area I could, I ended up with a 90% map completion, and a 60% item completion.

As a massive fan of the series it pains me that Nintendo have not released a proper 2D Metroid game in 11 years (none of this Prime nonsense) but Axiom Verge really is the closest you are going to get.\n\nAfter an experiment of yours goes South you wake up in a strange world called Sudra. It\u2019s a strange world not too dissimilar to the planet Zebes and this doesn\u2019t seem to bother the games Protagonist Trace one bit\u2026 But we\u2019ll overlook that. The game\u2019s plot is interesting and engaging and remind me slightly of indie hit \u201cThe Swapper\u201d.\n\nThe game sees you travel across the world guarded by large mechanical beings known as the Rusulka. These beings are your eyes and ears and guide you across the planet. Without giving away any plot elements these being form a key part of Axiom Verge\u2019s plot.\nThe game emphasises exploration much like the Metroid games of old and it draws you in as you want to push further and further into its twists and caverns. One thing where the game does differ from the Metroid Franchise is the emphasis on different guns. Each of the guns allow slightly different attacks and excel in different situations\u2026 think the guns in Contra and you have a good idea what to expect.\n\nThere are other equipment to find that opens up new parts of the map such as a laser drill lets you drill through rock opening up new paths and secrets, a grappling hook with a striking resemblance to the one from Bionic Commando and right about the time you expect to get the morph ball you get access to a drone that you can set through small space and eventually teleport to.\n\nOne of the games key stand out features however is its glitch mechanic. Early in the game you acquire a gun called the Address Disruptor. The device can corrupt enemies and make them glitch out. This allows enemies to be converted to another form which may make them attackable, give out health or let you stand on them. There are loads of cool things to find and using this gun makes the game seem like a breath of fresh air. It also allows you to access secret areas that contain some of the game\u2019s best weapons but these secret areas change every play through.\n\nThe Save system in the game works well. There are save points scattered across the land which you teleport back to if you die. What is helpful is that you do not lose any of you gear that you have gained since you last save point. This helpful mechanic makes dying less painful as it tends to happen quite a lot.\n\nThe game isn\u2019t perfect. Some of the controls are fiddly and do not always seem to work as expected and obviously forget playing it with anything but an Xbox game pad. Another small issue is some of the enemies seem a little odd and do not really fit the rest of the game (the swirly flower things particularly come to mind).\n\nThe sound design however is fantastic and the background music in each zone really helps set them apart from one another.\n\nAll in all the game took me about 15 hours to get through and even then I had only found 72% of items and 95% of the map (sod the tops of tall rooms). What makes this amazing game even more remarkable is the fact it is made by one man. Tom Happ has created Axiom Verge all alone and this really stands as a testament to what is achievable. Axiom Verge is the best Metroidvania game this century and apart from the 2 standouts of the genre Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night this really is the best of the best.\n\nYou can check our our video review of the game here: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/150513_game-tutor-grades-axiom-verge-pc-steam", "timestamp_created": 1431622899, "timestamp_updated": 1431622953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15827340": {"recommendationid": "15827340", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970283122", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451228684}, "language": "english", "review": "oh man final'y  its here", "timestamp_created": 1431622722, "timestamp_updated": 1431622722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15827197": {"recommendationid": "15827197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051808382", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431621519}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game oozing in Metroid slime.

Um verdadeiro sin\u00f4nimo de nostalgia pura dos cl\u00e1ssicos dos anos 80 e 90. Inspirado diretamente em [b]Metroid[/b], Axiom Verge traz toda a divers\u00e3o dos cl\u00e1ssicos da gera\u00e7\u00e3o mas n\u00e3o deixando de ter suas pr\u00f3prias inova\u00e7\u00f5es que se encaixam perfeitamente ao game.\nO jogo foi desenvolvido em 5 anos pelo desenvolvedor independente [b]Thomas Happ[/b], o jogo nasceu para brilhar, o sucesso foi imediato. Axiom Verge foi bastante aguardado e lan\u00e7ado com uma exclusividade tempor\u00e1ria para o Playstation 4 no final de Mar\u00e7o deste ano. Tom Happ foi sempre muito aberto com a comunidade, fazendo sempre atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o jogo em seu blog oficial, chegando at\u00e9 a desabafar algumas semanas ap\u00f3s o lan\u00e7amento do jogo no PS4 pela morte de seu querido cachorro, que trocaria todo o sucesso do jogo para ter seu amigo de volta.

A limita\u00e7\u00e3o dos v\u00eddeo-game na \u00e9poca causava bugs gr\u00e1ficos nos jogos, como os famosos flickering que causava falhas em pixels.

A ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo tamb\u00e9m foi inspirada em Metroid, com cen\u00e1rios e monstros sci-fi. Os acess\u00f3rios do jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 pequeno com uma grande quantia de armas para ser usada que vai de furadeiras para alcan\u00e7ar \u00e1reas e at\u00e9 armas para hackear inimigos.

Not only that, but also an excellent example of how you need to make a game inspired by original Metroid. Axiom Verge has very similar design and gameplay, but improves upon every aspect of them to make something really unique and at the same time very recognizable to make you feel at home.\n\nJust like in Metroid games, there's a huge map you need to explore with unique areas and enemies in each of them. There's also a lot of secrets and hidden stuff to find including new weapons, story related notes and even random secret worlds which you can explore, each of which contains items and even unique weapon which is not available in the world map and not that easy to find. The game also has decryption device which not only can help you uncover hidden areas and Items, but also glitch some portions of the map to clear the way to the next area or even glitch enemies which can clear it for you or can fight for you in certain situations (this won't work during boss battles though). And if that's not enough, the game has a ton of unique weapons to suit your play style (22 or something in total including hidden ones) and variety of different abilities which can help you fully explore the map. The world of Axiom Verge is very unique and atmospheric, it has this organic and alien feel to it and it is also reflected in the soundtrack, which is just outstanding and surely one of my favorite soundtracks this year. \n\nBut if there's one thing that upset me a bit in Axiom Verge... it's boss battles. Now, don't get me wrong, it's not that they are bad or anything, it's just they are not very challenging, well, except maybe one boss but still, most of them is very easy. I don't know, maybe that's because I have played so many metroidvania games before and kinda know exactly what to expect from boss battles at this point, but that is the only complaint I have about this game, other than that it's just absolutely incredible and really fun to play. Oh, and if you are a speedrunner, the game also has a special speedrun mode for you.\n\n[b]Final verdict:[/b] 10/10\n\nAxiom Verge is one of the best (if not the best on PC) games inspired by original Metroid.", "timestamp_created": 1431615647, "timestamp_updated": 1431616070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 86, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.813174", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39491069": {"recommendationid": "39491069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198804932271", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 854, "last_played": 1516471284}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing.\n\nI played the Nintendo Switch verson of this game and I wanted to see how this version performs, and It's just as good. So much exploration and items to find to make you stronger and survive the upcoming dangers of later zones. \n\nThe music in this game is really good. Probably one of the best soundtracks I've heard in recent years. The developer really put a lot of effort into making the music and it's fantastic.\n\nThe bosses are quite a challenge on the first time since the process of learning the pattern and how to kill them tends to be part of some bosses (Ukhu being one of the hardest ones in my opnion), but they become easy if you do a second run of the game. To me, the bosses were a bit easy since this is my second time playing the game (first being the Switch version), but they were still fin noneteless. For some extra challenge, you can play on hard difficulty to keep yourself playing.\n\nOne negative I can say is that the final boss is kinda anticlimatic.\n\nOverall, this game is an amazing Metroid style game.

I really like good pixel art and this really looks pretty good with all the dark tones with good enemy and the natives of the planet are breathtaking in their design. Atmosphere is spot-on from the Super Metroid style and has decent music to acompany it.\n\nSpeaking of the Music, it's mostly okay. Only 2 tracks stood out to me and were really fitting to the area. The rest was more like background to me, not particularly bad, but that great either. All areas have a their own theme but the this where the good things about the areas end.\n\nLevel design is very repetitive. There are some areas with diferent layouts and paths, but it's mostly the same corridors and the same paths with only diferent color palletes. Basically they have no identity. It wouldn't be such a big deal if you didn't have to backtrack to them... which is prominent feature in Metroidvanias. It starts to become a chore to backtrack to a lot of areas and made me wish I had fast travel between areas, which you do have to some extent. I want to mention that some doorways can only be a unlocked by a password tool, by entering the correct password at the right place. While it's a neat secret, it's very easily missable and I wouldn't have noticed it's existence if I didn't read other people talking about it. All the contents from said doorways are completely optional, so it doens't ruin the experience for anyone in that regard.\nThe password tool is not only for revealing secret pathways but I won't spoil it for you.\n\nSpeaking of convoluted paths, there are what's called \"Secret worlds\". It's places really well hidden and also very dependent on which save file you're on to get the reward you want.\n\nAnother flaw the game has is, way too many weapons and very little use to them. I saw myself using only 4 weapons actively. It might be diferent from person to person, but I personally found little to no use for most of the weapons.\nThe power-ups, I thought, were okay but only 2 power-ups stood out among many \"overdone\" power-ups in past.\nTo not spoil anything, I'll just leave it at that.\n\nThe bosses weren't that good for me. Only 2 of many, offered a good challenge and the rest were just tedious button mashing on the shoot button. The bosses visually, are well design. The fights, however, were not so great.\n\nThe story while not amazing by any means, it's functional and it's decent. It's enough to keep you going and not so complicated that would make you start losing interest after some time playing.\n\nPros:\n+ Weapon variety\n+ Artstyle and overall presentation\n+ Story\n+ Controls are tight\n+ Lots of hidden lore to look for\n\nMixed: \n-+ Too many weapons with little to no use\n-+ Okay background music\n-+ Some secrets are too convoluted\n\nCons: \n- Level design is repetitive with barely any identity in each area\n- Secret world rewards being Save file dependent\n- Boss fights are mostly lacking in challenge\n\nMy verdict is a 7/10\n\nThere's fun to be had here If you're a fan of Metroidvanias and even a fan of Metroid. With the familiar kind of exploration, plenty of places to traverse through, acquiring power-ups to progress further and explore more. Plenty of secrets to try and find. But the level design makes a bit more of a chore to go through those areas again with also not memorable or fitting music most of the time.

Growing up I loved Harrison Ford in movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. My dad was big into PC gaming as I was growing up so he owned this game. I started to play it and instantly fell in love with it. First of all, you have to complete tasks in a puzzle-like way. It really makes you listen and remember what the characters say in the game in order to figure out what you have to do next. Then, it is very entertaining according to what happens, what characters say, and how they say it. You have the option to drive a car, air balloon, or submarine based on the path you choose. At one point in the game you can either continue on with the main mission with this woman named Sophia in two scenarios or one without her. Lastly, I love the 90s feel this game gives me with the pixelated objects and people and ASWD controls. It is an overall excellent game with all of my favorite aspects.

Diesmal ohne Filmvorlage, muss Indiana Jones verhindern, dass die b\u00f6sen Nazis in Atlantis zu den \u00dcbermenschen werden, die sie gerne gewesen w\u00e4ren.\n\nDas Spiel beginnt mit einem interaktiven Intro, in dem man in der Rolle von \"Indiana Jones\" ein altes Artefakt in seinem Heimat-Universit\u00e4t suchen soll. Das h\u00f6rt sich eher langweilig an, ist aber zum Br\u00fcllen komisch, wenn man sieht, dass der Abenteurer, der sonst jede Falle in verborgenen Tempeln umgehen oder entsch\u00e4rfen kann, in seinem eigenen College von einer \"Falle\" in die n\u00e4chste tappt, und dabei einen Ort der Verw\u00fcstung hinterl\u00e4sst.\n\nDas Artefakt entpuppt sich als Schl\u00fcssel f\u00fcr eine Figur... nur bl\u00f6d, dass der seri\u00f6se blonde Herr in Indys B\u00fcro sich ebenfalls als etwas unfreundlich entpuppt. Die Spuren der Nazis f\u00fchren Indy zu seiner Ex-Kollegin Sophia Hapgood, die mit Betr\u00fcgereien ihren wissenschaftlichen Ruf und Indys Vertrauen verspielt hat. Auf der Suche nach dem \"Buch des Hippokrates\" fliegen die beiden nach Island, in die Karibik und zur\u00fcck an die Ostk\u00fcste der USA. Sobald sie das Buch haben, ist der entscheidende Punkt des Spieles erreicht, an dem man sich f\u00fcr einen von drei L\u00f6sungswegen entscheiden muss: den Team-Modus (mit Sophia), den R\u00e4tsel-Modus und den Action-Modus. Abh\u00e4ngig von der L\u00f6sung des ersten R\u00e4tsels schl\u00e4gt Sophia zwar einen Modus vor, man kann sich aber auch anders entscheiden.\n\nAb hier beginnen drei unterschiedliche Handlungsstr\u00e4nge, die erst gegen Ende des Spieles wieder zusammenlaufen. Einige Locations besucht man in allen 3 Spielmodi, andere nur bei einem Modus. Au\u00dferdem sind viele R\u00e4tsel trotz gleicher Locations in den verschiedenen Modi anders (man findet andere Gegenst\u00e4nde und trifft andere Personen). Wer Indy 4 nur einmal durchgespielt hat, hat mindestens ein Drittel des Spiels verpasst.\n\nWie beim Vorg\u00e4nger gibt es auch bei \"Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis\" Punkte f\u00fcr jedes gel\u00f6ste R\u00e4tsel, die im IQ (Indy-Quotienten) festgehalten werden. Da es auch innerhalb eines L\u00f6sungsweges mehrere L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr manche R\u00e4tsel gibt, m\u00fcsste man f\u00fcr die volle Punktzahl das Spiel mindestens sechsmal durchspielen, um alle IQ-Punkte zu erreichen.\n\nIndy 4 ist nach meiner Meinung immer noch das beste Adventure aller Zeiten:\n- die R\u00e4tsel sind durchweg logisch\n- der Wiederspielwert ist durch verschiedene L\u00f6sungswege und IQ-Punkte sehr hoch\n- die Bedienung ist Dank dem bew\u00e4hrten SCUMM-System sehr komfortabel\n- die Grafik ist f\u00fcr VGA- und Amiga-Verh\u00e4ltnisse vom allerfeinsten und kann sich heute noch sehen lassen\n- das iMuse-Sound-System sorgte daf\u00fcr, dass die Hintergrundmusik sich an die jeweilige Spielsituation anpasste\n\nIm Abspann von Indy 4 wird angek\u00fcndigt, dass es ein Wiedersehen mit Indiana Jones geben wird ... als j\u00fcngeren Mann.

Viendo como se presenta la situaci\u00f3n, nuestro protagonista deja pasar la oportunidad de encontrar un mundo perdido como es la Atl\u00e1ntida.\n\nSus personajes secundarios tienen mucho car\u00e1cter e influencia en la historia y se convierten, sin quererlo, en personajes de peso en la aventura. Sophia Hapgood es una atractiva vidente-actriz con mucho car\u00e1cter que tiene cierto v\u00ednculo y contacto con Nur-Ab-Sal, un antiguo dios de aquella civilizaci\u00f3n antigua; siendo su apellido inspirado por el de Charles Hapgood, qui\u00e9n fue un estudioso de la propia Atl\u00e1ntida. Klaus Kerner es un oficial nazi del tercer Reich muy alto y muy engre\u00eddo, el perfecto antagonista para cualquiera de las aventuras de nuestro arque\u00f3logo favorito.\n\nHal Barwood\u00a0trabaj\u00f3 como guionista en pel\u00edculas como \"Loca evasi\u00f3n\" o \"Encuentros en la tercera fase\"\u00a0y es el responsable de la \u00faltima aventura gr\u00e1fica de LucasArts que se dibujar\u00eda pixel a pixel. El bueno de Hal, que hab\u00eda colaborado en otros juegos de la compa\u00f1\u00eda, cuido cada detalle del juego del Dr. Jones, tanto es as\u00ed que hoy en d\u00eda es una de las mejores aventuras de la llamada \"\u00e9poca dorada de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas\" y un juego que no debes dejar pasar si te gusta el g\u00e9nero.\u00a0\n\nLa idea para el guion del juego la sac\u00f3 de un libro de misterios sin resolver de la biblioteca personal de George Lucas, en este, se hablaba de que la ciudad perdida de la Atl\u00e1ntida se divid\u00eda en 3 c\u00edrculos conc\u00e9ntricos. A partir de aqu\u00ed empez\u00f3 el gui\u00f3n del juego que conocemos hoy d\u00eda y que los de LucasArts se empe\u00f1aron en que se llamase \"La siguiente aventura de Indy\", menos mal que Hal no se rindi\u00f3 y se empe\u00f1\u00f3 en que el juego tuviera un nombre que lo hiciera digno de una aventura de Indy (y que aventura) por lo que, tras mucho luchar, pudo dar un nombre continuista de la saga de Indiana Jones.\n\nEs un guion original del que no se hizo pel\u00edcula por m\u00e1s que los fans de la saga lo pidieron una y otra vez, e incluso cuando sali\u00f3 a la luz que se estaba rodando una nueva entrega de las pel\u00edculas, muchos pensamos que podr\u00eda ser \"la pel\u00edcula del Atlantis\" pero no, no fue as\u00ed. No obstante si existe una serie de c\u00f3mics sobre la aventura de la Atl\u00e1ntida.\n\nRetomando la historia y gracias al Di\u00e1logo Perdido de Plat\u00f3n que Indy encuentra, obtiene algunas pistas sobre donde empezar a buscar para descubrir, un poco m\u00e1s tarde, la ubicaci\u00f3n de la ciudad perdida y la llave que le dar\u00e1 acceso a esta civilizaci\u00f3n antigua, se trata de un sistema de combinaciones hechas con unos discos de piedra tallados.\n\nLos puzzles del juego est\u00e1n muy bien llevados, son muy l\u00f3gicos (al menos en su mayor\u00eda) y te meten en todo momento dentro del mundo de Indiana Jones y su\u00a0relaci\u00f3n entre los mitos y la realidad, como nos tienen acostumbrados, consiguiendo que nos sumerjamos directamente en la historia. En algunos casos la interacci\u00f3n de ambos personajes ser\u00e1 obligatoria para poder avanzar, necesitaremos que Sophia negocie con algunos personajes sobre los que tiene influencia, o entretenga con preguntas a otro mientras que el Dr. Jones puede moverse a sus anchas. Si est\u00e1s atrapado, no dudes en que ella puede ayudarte a dar el siguiente paso.\n\nY hablando sobre como relacionan la realidad con los mitos, os dejo dos im\u00e1genes de un viaje que hice a Grecia, a las ruinas de Knossos que aparecen en el juego. Cuando estuve all\u00ed y vi la similitud que hab\u00eda con el juego que tantas veces jugu\u00e9, reviv\u00ed mi infancia en aquellas ruinas y un escalofr\u00edo de nostalgia recorri\u00f3 mi cuerpo. En ese momento entend\u00ed lo grande que es LucasArts y cuanto nos duele que ya no exista. Si hab\u00e9is jugado, entender\u00e9is lo que os digo.\n\u00a0\nEn el juego podemos elegir tres caminos diferentes, uno en el que ir\u00e1s acompa\u00f1ado toda la aventura por Sophia, otro en el que ir\u00e1s solo con Indy utilizando el ingenio, por lo que habr\u00e1 mas puzzles, y un camino en el que ir\u00e1s solo con Indy con mas acci\u00f3n, habr\u00e1 mas combates y situaciones en las que usar tu habilidad como jug\u00f3n ser\u00e1 imprescindible. Pese a que los tres juegos me gustan y he disfrutado mucho con cada uno de ellos, he de reconocer que el camino con Sophia es el que m\u00e1s me gusta ya que, en mi humilde opini\u00f3n, se asemeja mucho a una pel\u00edcula de Indiana Jones. Tanto es as\u00ed que este fue el camino que eleg\u00ed para el an\u00e1lisis, pero os recomiendo que os hag\u00e1is tambi\u00e9n los otros dos caminos ya que no tienen desperdicio.\n\nTras actividades tan variadas como viajar a Montecarlo y tener una sesi\u00f3n de espiritismo, montar en globo en Argel o embaucar a un coleccionista de antig\u00fcedades en Las Azores, nuestros protagonistas finalmente llegaran en un submarino nazi, a la mism\u00edsima ciudad perdida de la Atl\u00e1ntida. Como puedes ver son todo aventuras que est\u00e1n muy a la altura del personaje y el mito.\n\nEl juego puedes encontrarlo en Steam o jugarlo directamente en ScummVM, para este \u00faltimo existe una versi\u00f3n en la que la comunidad fan mezclo el audio del juego con voces en CD que nunca sali\u00f3 en Espa\u00f1a, con la versi\u00f3n en castellano que lleg\u00f3 a nuestras tiendas.\n\nA diferencia de otros juegos de LucasArts tanto\u00a0en este como en el anterior juego de Indy, puedes morir, por lo que deber\u00edas ir guardando tu progreso de cuando en cuando. Es curioso que la compa\u00f1\u00eda solo permitiera este hecho en los juegos del arque\u00f3logo, ya que es algo que va en contra de la filosof\u00eda de la empresa pero sin embargo, vieron un valor a\u00f1adido muy bueno el hecho de que Indy pudiera caer, una manera de mantener una tensi\u00f3n tanto en los combates como en las acciones del protagonista a lo largo del juego.\n\nPara la parte final, independientemente del camino que hayas elegido, Sophia se une a ti para concluir la historia, ya que ella es qui\u00e9n tiene esa relaci\u00f3n especial con Nur-Ab-Sal y la ciudad perdida. De nuevo el tinte cinematogr\u00e1fico aparece y de que manera, es uno de esos finales merecidos de toda buena historia, continuando con la calidad del juego hasta el momento y poniendo una guinda genial a la historia. Adem\u00e1s claro est\u00e1 de que el hecho de \"rescatar a la chica\" siempre es bien recibido en estas aventuras.\n\u00a0\nPoco despu\u00e9s se trabaj\u00f3 en una secuela para este juego que se llamar\u00eda \"Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix\", cuya trama trata sobre un Indiana Jones que, despu\u00e9s de la segunda guerra mundial, tiene que hacerse con la piedra filosofal y viajar a Am\u00e9rica del Sur para evitar que los nazis resuciten a Hitler. El proyecto fue cancelado tras un a\u00f1o de desarrollo porque ten\u00eda mucha \"tem\u00e1tica nazi\" y podr\u00eda herir sensibilidades en un pueblo que acog\u00eda muy bien los juegos de LucasArts como era el alem\u00e1n, tanto es as\u00ed que para la aventura que hemos analizado hoy, las esv\u00e1sticas fueron sustituidas por cruces. Aric Wilmunder (uno de los padres del sistema SCUMM) ha publicado en su web documentaci\u00f3n relativa a este juego.\n\nEn definitiva, espectaculares gr\u00e1ficos en VGA 256 colores, de los mejores efectos sonoros iMUSE de la mano de Michael Z. Land\u00a0(que particip\u00f3 en otros juegos de la compa\u00f1\u00eda como \"El D\u00eda del Tent\u00e1culo\") y muchas horas de juego llenas de puzzles, retos y combates gracias a los tres modos de juego diferentes.\n\n\u00bfY t\u00fa? \u00bfAcabaste muchos combates de un solo pu\u00f1etazo?\n\n\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1Nos vemos pronto!!!", "timestamp_created": 1506028610, "timestamp_updated": 1506028610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35017013": {"recommendationid": "35017013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383919347", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505584341}, "language": "german", "review": "Absolut zum kotzen\n\n\nIch kenne das Spiel sehr gut aber diese Vesion hier auf Steam ist einfach nur grottenschlecht. 1. man kann nicht speichern 2. wenn man das Spiel beenden will steht nur Y/N anstatt einfach ja oder nein.

Habe das damals zusammen mit meinem Cousin gespielt und war enorm fasziniert von der Atmosph\u00e4re und den R\u00e4tseln. Und auch heute noch kann die Atmosph\u00e4re und die sch\u00f6ne Pixel-Grafik durchaus \u00fcberzeugen. Aus heutiger Sicht ist es auch sehr angenehm, nicht so vollgelabert zu werden wie in modernen Point-and-Klick-Adventures. Die Texte sind sehr kurz aber dennoch witzig und pr\u00e4gnant. Man hat nie den Eindruck, dass man zu wenig Information bekommt. Aus heutiger Sicht aber weniger angenehm fand ich ehrlich gesagt das R\u00e4tseldesign. Es ist zwar sch\u00f6n, dass man je nach Spielstil verschiedene Wege einschlagen kann und so auch unterschiedliche Locations besucht, aber die Umst\u00e4ndlichkeit mancher R\u00e4tsel fand ich schon schwer nervend. In einem H\u00f6hlensystem mit diesem Kompa\u00df-Fisch Goldk\u00fcgelchen suchen, mit einer Seance einen Skeptiker von der Anwesenheit eines Gottes \u00fcberzeugen (und nach jedem missgl\u00fcckten Versuch rennt der wieder weg) oder mit den fummeligsten Fahrzeugen aller Zeiten (Hei\u00dfluftballon, U-Boot) einen bestimmten Punkt treffen - das alles zerrt schon sehr an der Geduld des (heutigen) Spielers. Dennoch war es nach so langer Zeit wieder ein Vergn\u00fcgen, auch wenn ich anfangs bef\u00fcrchtet hatte, das spielen eines so alten Klassikers k\u00f6nnte meine Erinnerung daran entmystifizieren. War zum Gl\u00fcck aber nicht der Fall. Ein gutes Spiel \u00fcberdauert auch Jahrzehnte.\n\nDie Steam-Version ist zwar auf englisch, l\u00e4sst sich aber mit einem Patch (siehe unten) auf deutsch umschalten. Entgegen der Steam-Info gibt es auch englischen Ton. Ansonsten gibts die GOG-Version aber auch standardm\u00e4\u00dfig mit allen Sprachen. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=565852222\n\nNoch was zur Technik: ich konnte das Hauptmenu \u00fcber F1 nur aufrufen, wenn ich in den Fenstermodus gewechselt bin.

I love all four films (yes, you can go f*ck yourselves other reviewers, the Crystal Skull is A LOT better than this game), copycats and stuff inpired by or in the style of him. So the premiere point-n-click game of his made back in the early 90s was something I was happily on board to experience. My impression?\n\nWell I think an appropriate thing to call it is \"The Janky Adventures of Indiana Jones\". Yeah, I don't know if the developers of it could've done anything to make it less janky, but it is that at least a little. The gameplay mechanics are solid, they do a good job, but I like mine a bit smoother. They have a feeling of jaggedness and stiffness.\n\nThe voice actor who plays Dr. Jones doesn't even get close to sounding like him. I once suggested to my old man, who's a fan too, an idea I've had for a while for an Indiana Jones animated series with Harrison Ford actually stepping into a recording booth to voice him. It would be better than a fifth film, and would fix Fords age getting in the way. My pop just flat out told me that he thought Harrison wouldn't do voice work for anything. I wonder if back in the early 90s, he was in a public library or something, and saw someone playing this game on a publicly availible computer, asked what this newfangled thing on the computer was, watched a little, and then asked why Indiana Jones totally didn't sound like himself, which is how he got the opinion he told me. But it can slid do to artistic licence or medium constrants or whatever.\n\nThe tone is also slightly off. It feels like someone's close approximation of the Indiana Jones tone. I'm admittedly picky, so this caused the game/story as a whole to not feel that definitive. Not that it was bad, they tried. Stuff like the female sidekick character and the stuff she does and that happen to her, the design of the stuff in and from Atlantis, and a noticable amount of the dialogue, successfully lend to the appropriate classic tone. But when stuff like Jones dressing up like Charlie Brown on Halloween night to pretend to be a ghost, and Jones clumsily tumbling down multiple floors of his own university happen, the tone is comprimised due to out of place sillyness. I am planning to read the comic book adaption soon, so maybe that will help give me a better appreciation of the story.\n\nThe problem solving of the game is decent in the first half, but in the second half, I consistently was falling prey to mistakenly thinking the game was too strict for what turned out to be the correct solution, to be the correct solution. The game comes off as too strict for the ladder item to be usable in multiple places in Atlantis, or too strict for the knife thrower to be someone you can talk to. I guess suffering from cronic depression, the worst/hardest case scenario is the one I jump to first. But it's frustrating to go to a walkthrough, not because you don't know, but because you think you know, but you need CONFIRMATION BECAUSE THE GAME ISN'T TRUSTWORTHY AND HAS THE ATTITUDE OF A PRANKSTER.\n\nBut moving on, here's a query. Doesn't Indiana Jones get to experience a bunch of awesome things? What cool stuff do you get to do? Well my favorite thing would have to be the exploration of Atlantis itself in the form of a giant maze. You get to run Indiana Jones around a giant maze, try and find all the rooms you can enter, and avoid the Nazi soldiers. Indiana Jones and giant mazes were meant to meet each other! There are other set piece objective activites like that which give the game some substance. Flying a hot air balloon is okay, just a smidgen too hard, just to name one. \n\nI recommend this game, but only as a novelty piece. It deserves to be counted certainly as a solid part of the franchise because it is fun enough and Indiana Jones enough. But it has too many deviant things to it to escape novelty status in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1489118172, "timestamp_updated": 1489118172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458731", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30277286": {"recommendationid": "30277286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079376161", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488460001}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic LucasArts point-and-click adventure starring everyone's favorite archeologist.

Partially based on Henry Rider Haggard\u2019s Allan Quatermain, Dr. Jones is best known for his wit, as well as his iconic clothes: the bullwhip, the leather jacket, and the fedora. Despite being blessed with substantial knowledge on ancient cultures, languages, and combat methods, he often makes the situation worse by accidentally leading his opponents directly to the mystical treasures he tries so hard to prevent them from getting. His most prominent enemies are the Nazis who want to unearth ancient artefacts and plan to abuse them for their world dominating plans. In Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis the Wehrmacht now tries to find the sunken city-state of Atlantis and is determined to kidnap Sophia Hapgood, Indy\u2019s former partner, to reach it. Fortunately, Dr. Jones is able to get to her in time, but discovers that her apartment has already been ransacked by them. The two heroes now set out on a thrilling race to find Atlantis before the Germans can.\n\nThe game was released twice, once in 1992 and then in 2009 with a newly added voice over and reworked sound effects. Despite it bringing back Lucas Arts\u2019 staples like the SCUMM engine, it sets itself apart from the developer\u2019s other Point & Click adventures like The Secret of Monkey Island (1990), Day of the Tentacle (1993), or Grim Fandango (1998) by incorporating a much more versatile, partially randomized world that takes player choices into consideration. The story of The Fate of Atlantis can roughly be split into three acts, with the first and last always playing out more or less the same way, but the second offering players a choice on how they wish to proceed.\n\n[b][u]Players can go for one of three playstyles:[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] [u]Wits[/u]\n[list]\n[*] By picking the \u201cwits\u201d route, Indy will travel alone and face a number of very difficult puzzles by himself.\n[/list]\n[*] [u]Fists[/u]\n[list]\n[*] When opting for the \u201cfists\u201d route, Indy still travels alone, but the amount of puzzles and their difficulty level will be greatly reduced in exchange for more hand to hand combat.\n[/list]\n[*] [u]Team[/u]\n[list]\n[*] When selecting the \u201cteam\u201d option, Indy will be joined by Sophia and together they will try to work their way towards Atlantis.\n[/list]\n[/list]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448452679\n\nWhat surprised me is that these three options not only truly alter the gameplay, but that some locations, like Algiers, will look differently, while others, like Thera, are only available in certain routes. Not only that, but depending on the playstyle, characters like Omar Al-Jabbar will change in personality. Even during the team route, one will encounter puzzles with alternative solutions to them. Both Indiana and Sophia, for example, have different ways of trying to get information from Alain Trottier in Monaco.\n\nBut the game\u2019s strength is also its weakness. In order to add variety, item locations, puzzle solutions, and some NPC responses are randomized. This certainly adds flavor when replaying the experience, but also might make re\u2013searching items and information somewhat tedious and demands attentiveness from players. It also means that one should keep pen and paper ready (or take screenshots) as some puzzles rely on memorizing and correctly interpreting clues. Two minor gripes I have with this game are what they pass off as German and that apart from three brief sequences, there appears to be no way to play as Sophia. After briefly playing as her at the beginning of the game, I was anticipating a tag team mechanic that never came.\n\nOverall, I was not prepared for how hard the puzzles were going to be. This is definitely a good thing and I loved that I had to think as much as I did in this game, but players who just want to enjoy a nice story might want to think twice about purchasing a copy of The Fate of Atlantis. And despite my enjoyment for everything, when I finally thought that I had gotten the hang of things and that the game did not have any new tricks up its sleeves, act three came along and threw me for a loop with a massive fetch quest and increasingly cryptic clues. I was completely stuck and did not know how to proceed. At this point, I unfortunately have to admit that I caved in and cheated. I looked up what I needed to do on the internet and as it turns out, I had missed a barely visible cogwheel that was hanging on a wall in one room. Unfortunately, some of the plot relevant items in this game are barely visible or blend in so well with the background that players will pixel hunt to progress.\n\nNevertheless, the astonishingly detailed and advanced presentation of this 1992 title kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn\u2019t wait to see where things were going from here on out. Design\u2013wise, the game is definitely a high-end product that will leave players guessing at how long the developers must have worked on it. Especially alluring are little details, like the waterfall in Knossos, or the pitch dark rooms that become brighter the longer Indy stays in them. However, not everything is perfectly executed. Point & Click adventures are really good at presenting inventory and dialog based puzzles, but terrible when it comes to fighting or driving mechanics. Though these are a nice change of pace from the riddles, they are somewhat unintuitive in The Fate of Atlantis. When driving through the streets of Monaco, the car is very stiff and the fighting mechanic remains to be a mystery to me.\n\nPlayers can choose to either control the fights with a mouse, or, after pressing the F key, by using their keyboard. Strikes and blocks can be done to the top, mid, or lower region, and there is a way to skip most of the violent encounters by pressing the 0 key. Fortunately, the Steam version includes a pdf file of the game\u2019s manual, explaining the intricacies of the mechanics as well as some hints for the game overall.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448451954\n\n[h1]Bugs[/h1]\n\nI encountered one game breaking bug, during my third playthrough, while playing on my old toaster \u2013 an old, 32-bit desktop PC running on Windows Vista Home Premium, an Intel Core 2 CPU, an Nvidia GeForce 9500 GT, and 3070 MB RAM.

Among the games I used to play (Master of Magic, Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, Leisure Suit Larry, Ultima Underworld, Alone in the Dark, Doom, SimFarm, etc...), there was one LucasArts point-and-click adventure in particular that filled me with a sense of wonder and even awe: Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. I wasn't exactly a fan of Indiana Jones, but this game was bigger than the character. My English was barely rudimentary at the time, and I couldn't really follow much of the story and the humour. But the sense of wonder and awe was there from the start, and it remains to this day at the rugged age of 33, on my nth playthrough. While I do have very fond memories of all the other LucasArts adventures and other games from that period, this game will always have a special place in my memories.\n\nIn many ways, it is a classic LucasArts adventure in terms of gameplay, humour, cartoonish villains, and several tough and sometimes questionable puzzles.

I wanted to finish the game by not reading any of hints or tips from a walkthrough guide -and i succeeded-, because adventuring through the untold dullness of life is THE INHERENT core of Indy adventures. This game gives that unique feeling of being an Indiana Jones even with 1992 graphics and sounds. Because, the feeling of playing Dr. Jones does not rely on eye-candy graphics, but lies with finding whatever way to wrestle through life even if it goes somewhere that was not intended initially. \n\nOnce the game starts, be careful about your selected words towards other people -be it an enemy, comrade, or foreigner- because it affects the storyline.

If you stuck at a level and not finding a proper way to go further, i recommend NOT to rush a walkthrough guide quickly.

This my friends is how the adventure that is Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis begins....\n\n\nRelease in 1992 (on floppy disk and later CD-ROM with audio) from Lucas Arts, this is one of my all time favorite computer games. I have a real soft spot for the classic Lucas Arts games like this, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Day of the Tentacle and Sam & Max Hit The Road, the simple but effective point and click, puzzle games were things that quite grew on me... and something I remember how to play (as you can see in the replay video of a live stream covering the first third of the game over the period of two hours while going for the 'team path')\n\n\nSo what is it about this game from 24 years ago that makes it worth playing? Well for one it is an Indiana Jones adventure, it has the look and feel of something grand, even if the graphics don't really convey it, the story tells it wonderfully.\n\n\nThere is a lot of replay value, with various dialog choices that have different reactions, plus there are three different paths, one a team path with Sophia Hapgood, one where Indy is solo and is heavy on the puzzles, and one where Indy gets into fights along the way. While each path starts and ends the same, the middle portion of the story varies.I personally prefer to Team Path, because Sophia and Indy have great chemistry as characters, and when you think about it, all the Indiana Jones films see him with a sidekick. Plus it means taking breaks for some side-conversation and getting insight on what to do.\n\n\nAdding to the replay value is the 'random' factor, as if you play through the game once and play through it again with the exact same choices, some events happen slightly differently, such as herding the jungle rodent towards a snake (why did it have to be snakes) sees the rodent start off at a different point every time, the collection where the Lost Dialog of Plato is found varies not to mention the location (It could be in a wax cat, in a tipped over book case, behind a totem pole), what the shop keeper would wand in a trad for a Squab on a Stick and the combination of the Sun, Moon and World Stone can change.\n\n\nAnd because of all these things, I think the game has aged very well and the same could be said for a lot of the Lucas Arts point and click games. It's why I hope at some point more of them get ported to Steam at some point, because these are games that should be experienced and enjoyed in this day and age.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1461994448, "timestamp_updated": 1461994448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22563067": {"recommendationid": "22563067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216149252", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463398287}, "language": "japanese", "review": "I still remember this great game on CD-ROM for our good old Windows 3.1 when we got it.  This game, to me, is the epitome of LucasArts games.\n\nFor newcomers:  This game is a classic and debatably one of LucasArts' greatest games---if not THE greatest game, according to some fans.  The story, puzzles, appropriate amount of humor, atmosphere, and replay value are up to par.  It just never gets old.  Plus (though this is personal) I always thought the puzzles and solutions in FoA made so much more sense than any of the Monkey Island series.  \"Monkey wrench\" anyone???  Anyway, at first glance it will no doubt feel ancient for the current generation---Aesthetically it is very outdated and has aged badly---.  If, though, you can get over that part and appreciate the artistic/entertainment quality of the game, you will most certainly be glad to have experienced this game.  I still don't know why they made a HD remake of Monkey Island but not for Fate of Atlantis.\n\nFor those who played the old version:  While some remember the game before it had the voice talents, I was introduced to the version with voice actors.  So this is no problem to me.  In fact, it wouldn't be the same without the voices to me.  The only flaw in the Steam version is that the music is very different from the original.  The music is the same as far as score goes (I think), but the quality is different.  It sounds more digital and cheap.  For someone like myself who really enjoyed the sound/audio of the original, this sole flaw is a huge one.

The game looks great, for a classic LucasArt adventure game, and the voice acting is actually pretty spot on.  The puzzles can be a bit challenging, but luckily there isn't a moment where you have to start the game over because you didn't get that one item you were supposed to get in the last section (Shame on you, Last Crusade). Also, there are three different paths to beat this game: the Team Path, The Wits Path, or The Fists Path. I personally chose the Team Path, because then the puzzles aren't too demanding, since you have help, and you don't have to worry about the fighting system. Also, Indy has to have his lady :). The fighting system is greatly improved from Indy's Last Crusade, but thats really not saying much, since it couldn't have gotten worse. Not only are there multiple ways to accomplish tasks, but there are two different endings, depending on what kind of Indy you want to be. Overrall, this was a great game, that I know I will play again for the different paths. OH, and different paths mean visiting different locations! \nHonestly, this should have been the fourth movie. They would have to have tweaked it just a bit, but this should have been the film. The love/hate relationship between Indy and Sophia is real and genuine (I loved seeing Indy grab her for that \"we saved the world from the Nazis kiss\"). Also, its Indy against the Nazis, the ones we love to see him fight. The script is strong and believable.  Just a fun great game that all adventure gamers should pick up, at any cost.\n\nUPDATE: My play time is not accurate, since I played this game on the SCUMM engine.

Pretty much once every year. I've been playing since not long after it's release on my trusty old IBM 286. Hard drive was so small I had to choose between Windows 3.1 or Indy. So My Windows days pretty much started with 95... ;)\n\nAnyway, you are Doctor Henry \"Indiana\" Jones Jr. And as the title suggests, you're trying to find Atlantis before the Nazi's do. This is one of the best stories written for a game, in my opninion. A couple of hours into the game, you get to choose in which way you'll tackle the game. You can do it together with your 'partner in crime', Sophia Hapgood, or you can think your way through, or fight. This adds a lot of replay value.\n\nIf it's not on sale, it's a really good deal. Especially in a bundle with Last Crusade, Loom and The Dig. Last Crusade and Loom have never really been to my liking, but the Dig is also really worth it. With the help of Steven Spielberg, they've created another wonderfull classic adventure game.\nWhen it's on sale, it's really a no brainer. For less than a buck and a couple of cents you have a lot of quality gamplay!\n\nThe Steam version is not the best. The MIDI table they use in the emulator (haven't really looked into what it runs on), is God-awful. But you can just run it through SCUMMVM, and this works so well and easy.

I bought it on Steam because of the fond memories I have of playing it back then, and it's always been my favorite Lucas Arts title.  Being an adventure game, the pace is usually whatever you happen to play it as.  In addition, it was one of the earlier popular titles that featured a choice of play styles- one can choose fairly early on to play the puzzle, teamwork, or action pathways.\nThere are some things to poke holes in it.  The graphics are clearly from the early 90s and haven't held up as well as I'd hoped, although they are still servicable.  Some of the backgrounds are actually quite well done and it's only in detailed images that the quality is lacking.  In addition, the voice acting is not that good.  Since the subtitles are defaulted to on, though, one can simply put on some music and mute the actual game.\nThe biggest problem is that the controls on the Steam version don't work as well as those in the original version.  Since most of the time, you're simply going to be pointing and clicking, it doesn't make much difference.  However, fight sequences (which are much more common on the action pathway) may be difficult until you get the hang of the odd control scheme.\nThose issues aside, the story is comparable to the movies (and better than Crystal Skull).  Most players will likely be able to complete a playthrough in several hours, but there is a save game feature should you need multiple sittings.

Die Liebe und der Hype um dieses Spiel gehen sogar so weit das viele Indiana Jones-Fans sich lieber das als vierten Film gew\u00fcnscht h\u00e4tten, als den den wir dann letztendlich bekommen haben. \nIch f\u00fcr meinen Teil z\u00e4hle nicht zu den Leuten die diese Meinung vertreten und hier ist warum: Ich finde das sich dieses Spiel nicht wirklich nach einem Indiana Jones Abenteuer anf\u00fchlt, geschweige denn das der Charakter des Doktor Jones selbst, gut r\u00fcbergebracht wurde. Das ganze Spiel lang hatte ich nie das Gef\u00fchl den Mann auf seinen Abenteuern zu begleiten den ich aus den (von mir hei\u00dfgeliebten) Filmen kenne, sondern den Indy den wir bekommen h\u00e4tten wenn Tom Selleck den Part ergattert h\u00e4tte...\n\nNicht falsch verstehen...ich mag Tom Selleck.\n\nAuch hatte ich ehrlich gesagt nicht das Gef\u00fchl mich auf einem Abenteuer zu befinden, sondern eher in einer gro\u00dfen Old-School-R\u00e4tselkiste.\nUnd hier ist der Clu an der Sache...\n\nF\u00fcr alle die bis hierher gelesen haben und sich nicht abgewendet haben weil der Typ hier ihr Lieblingsgame kritisiert, kommt jetzt der Grund warum ich dieses Spiel trotzdem w\u00e4rmstens weiterempfehlen kann...wenn auch mit Einschr\u00e4nkungen.\n\nEs IST nunmal eine ziemlich gute Old-School-R\u00e4tselkiste. Ich habe zwar nur selten das Gef\u00fchl ein Indiana Jones Abenteuer zu spielen (weshalb ich den 4ten Film auch weiterhin verteidige, weil Story und Setting perfekt in die 50-iger passen und ich keinen Groll gegen Shia LaBeouf hege) aber das fantastische Gef\u00fchl nach stundenlangem \u00dcberlegen und Rumprobieren endlich auf des R\u00e4tsels L\u00f6sung zu kommen ist unvergleichlich!\n\nDas Spiel ist von 1992 und nutzt seinen 8-Bit Grafikstil super aus, alles wirkt immer noch detailliert und interessant, auch die Animationen sind ziemlich gut, ich w\u00fcnschte mir nur manchmal Indy k\u00f6nnte durch einen Doppelklick schneller laufen, weil die Wege auf den Screens schon recht lang sind, vorallem wenn man endlich wei\u00df wie man ein R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen hat, aber Stunden braucht um hinzukommen.\n\nDie Musik ist auch ziemlich gut und entwickelt sich gl\u00fccklicherweise, durch kleine Pausen,  nie zu einem nervigen Daurgedudel.\n\nDie Sprecher machen ihre Sache gut, auch wenn die Tonabmischung wesentlich besser h\u00e4tte sein k\u00f6nnen, zumal sie den Text sicher in einem Tonstudio aufgenommen haben. Nur der unpassend dunkelklingende Sprecher von Indy unterstreicht noch das Gef\u00fchl nicht den echten Mann mit Hut und Peitsche vor sich zu haben.\n\nDie Story ist Indiana Jones-typisch simpel: Indy muss vor den Nazis Atlantis erreichen. \nPasst gut in die Reihe, entwickelt sich aber (leider) nie zu einem wirklich spannenden Thrillride so wie die Filme und das gelegentlich pl\u00f6tzliche Auftauchen der Nazis ist zwar jedes mal \u00fcberraschend aber nie Spannend, weil man w\u00e4hrend den Zwischensequenzen sowieso nie in die Action eingreifen kann.\n\nNun zu Indys diesmaliger Begleiterin: Sophia Hapgood.\nAls Indy-Fan habe ich schon von kleinauf, viel von diesem Game geh\u00f6rt, aber am meisten von Miss Hapgood, die von vielen Retrogame-Fans, Spielezeitschriften, Onlinemagazinen und Internet-Critics als der gro\u00dfartigste Sidecharacter/ die gro\u00dfartigste weibliche Videospielcharakterin aller Zeiten gek\u00fchrt wird.\n\nAber warum? Ich versteh wirklich nicht was alle an ihr finden: \n1.Sie gibt das ganze Spiel lang nur Wiederworte und zwar nicht von der charmanten \"i\u00b4m a independent Woman\"- Sorte \n2. Zu jedem noch so unwichtigen Schei\u00df muss man sie \u00fcberreden, oder gar zwingen \n3. und sie wird \u00f6fter gefangen genommen, um von mir gerettet zu werden, als jeder andere Indiana Jones-Sidekick. \n\nAusserdem (ich wei\u00df nicht ob es an der Sprecherin, oder der visuellen Umsetzung liegt) wenn sie im Game \u00fcber \"Nur-Ab-Sal\" palavert und eine \"Seance\" abh\u00e4lt, wirkt das immer unfassbar nervig und aufgesetzt.\n\nZum Thema Gefangennahme, gibt es sogar ganze Stellen im Spiel die quasi aus J\u00e4ger des verlorenen Schatzes rauskopiert wurden. \n!SPOILER! Sophia wird gefangen genommen und auf ein U-Boot verfrachtet (wie Marion Ravenwood), Indy muss sich aus einem Untergrundgew\u00f6lbe rausschaufeln um sie zu befreien (wie im Film nur diesmal alleine), Indy klettert unbemerkt auf/in das U-Boot um sie zu Retten und den Nazis folgen zu k\u00f6nnen und am Ende (wenn man sich gut anstellt) stehen beide daneben, w\u00e4hrend die B\u00f6sen explodieren, oder so \u00e4hnlich. !SPOILER ENDE!\nIch meine selbst Shia LaBeouf hat wenigstens mal einen coolen Fechtkampf auf einem fahrenden Truck, also bitte!\n\nEs ist definitiv nicht so schlimm wie es klingt und ich hasse sie auch nicht oder \u00e4hnliches, genausowenig wie das Spiel an sich...ich verstehe nur diesen abnormen Hype nicht. \n\nFazit: Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis ist ein gutes und intelligentes Point and Click-Adventure. Es hat zwar meiner Meinung nach wenig von dem was die Indiana Jones Abenteuer so gro\u00dfartig macht, aber als reines Spiel ist es hervorragend.\n\n(Diese Empfehlung gilt allerdings nur f\u00fcr Spieler die bereits Erfahrung in diesem Old-School-Genre gesammelt haben, weil das Spiel keinerlei Hilfestellung leistet, an welche sich die meisten modernen \"Gamer\" bereits gew\u00f6hnt haben und man verdammt viel ausprobieren muss, ob es gerade Sinn macht oder nicht)\n", "timestamp_created": 1440081761, "timestamp_updated": 1440081761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629309", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17388219": {"recommendationid": "17388219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158273509", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476044141}, "language": "french", "review": "Un grand classique, qui a toujours son charme malgr\u00e9 son \u00e2ge :-) La jouabilit\u00e9 est bonne et un joueur qui aurait envie de r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir sans tricher en aura pour de longues heures.

Uns f\u00e4llt in den Archiven einer amerikanischen Universit\u00e4t, durch einen Auftrag, eine seltsame Statue in die H\u00e4nde. Diese kann historisch nicht zugeordnet werden. Wir bekommen kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter in unserem B\u00fcro, Besuch von einer \"Herrn Smith\", der sich als Spion des Dritten Reiches entpuppt und mit der Statue fl\u00fcchtet. Wir m\u00fcssen den b\u00f6sen Nazi Kerner verfolgen. Durch Hinweise ensteht eine Verbindung mit Sophia Hapgood, unsere ehemalige Geliebte und Assistentin, die Vorlesungen zum Mythos Atlantis h\u00e4lt. Gemeinsam gehen wir auf die Abenteuerreise um den Mythos Atlantis ein f\u00fcr alle Mal zu enschl\u00fcsseln und den Nazis das Handwerk zu legen.

You can play it as a standard graphical adventure (WITS path), as a graphical adventure with beat-em-up subgames instead of some of the puzzles (FISTS path), or as a graphical adventure but with commentary and assistance from the game, making it a little more like an interactive movie (TEAM path). It's nice to have these options, as the puzzles and dialogue change accordingly, so it's worth playing through again.\n\nIf you like other Lucasarts adventure games, you certainly can't go wrong with this.

La fatica fatta per completare questo gioco senza alcun tipo di aiuto mi \u00e8 rimasta ben impressa nella mente, cos\u00ec come la soddisfazione per esserci arrivato in fondo. Ad oggi per quel che mi riguarda \u00e8 ancora uno dei migliori titoli del genere ed incarna perfettamente tutto quello che cerco in una AG: Il Mistero, l'Esplorazione e l'Avventura.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis \u00e8 una avventura grafica, del tipo \"punta e clicca\", ovvero, il gioco consiste in una serie di puzzle da risolvere usando l'ingegno, i dialoghi con gli NPC e gli oggetti sparsi per le varie locations del gioco. Non star\u00f2 a fare un riassunto della storia, mi limito solo a dire che vedremo Indy, assieme alla sensitiva Sophia Hapgood alla ricerca della mitica citt\u00e0 perduta descritta da Platone, ovviamente inseguiti dai Nazisti, che vogliono impadronirsi dei segreti celati fra le sue rovine per costruire l'arma definitiva e portate in 3zo reich alla conquista del mondo.\n\nIl gioco presenta alcune caratteristiche interessanti, tra cui l'intro giocabile: In pratica tra un titolo di testa ed un altro potremo controlare Indy alle prese con una bizzarra avventura all'interno delle sale del Barnett College. Tutto ci\u00f2 \u00e8 un modo molto originale di implementare un tutorial per il gioco.\n\nL'avventura \u00e8 divisa in 3 capitoli, di cui il secondo pu\u00f2 essere giocato in ben 3 \"percosi\" diversi, a seconda della scelta che il giocatore far\u00e0 alla fine del primo capitolo: Ingegno (dove i puzzle fanno da padrone), Azione (Indy sar\u00e0 chiamo frequentemente a combattere) e Squadra (in cui si dovr\u00e0 collaborare con Sophia per venire a capo degli enigmi). Inoltre, molti dei puzzle del primo e del terzo capitolo cambiano da partita a partita, rendendo quini il titolo estremamente rigiocabile.\n\nSoffermiamoci un attimo su i puzzle del gioco: Come ho gia' detto in genere si risolvono utilizzando e/o combinandi fra loro gli oggetti che si trovano lungo il percorso o indovinando la giusta sequenza di linee di dialogo quando si parla con un NPC. Va pero' detto che non sempre la sequenza \u00e8 facilmente intuibile e non aspettatevi alcun tipo di aiuto da parte del gioco, o meglio: Gli aiuti spesso ci sono sotto forma di elementi dei fondali del gioco o di testo su libri e note.\n\nIl gioco in sostanza mette il giocatore di fronte alla necessit\u00e0 di pensare e sperimentare, spesso anche a tirare ad indovinare come poter aprire una porta o attivare un certo dispositivo.

Back then, I relied heavily on the Hint Book that came with the CD; then again, I was also 8 years old. \n\nThere are 3 paths that one can \"choose\" from based on early actions and dialogue in the game: The Fists Path, the Team Path, and the Wits Path. My favorite of these three is the Team Path, simply because it seems to provide situations privy to having the largest amount of sarcastic dialogue classic to the Indiana Jones franchise. It's the only path where Sophia Hapgood (the female character) joins you for the entire time, and thus gives you an AI teammate (who has a witty demeanor quite similar to that of Marion Ravenwood).\n\nI always feel like dialogue is the most enjoyable part of a point and click style game - especially the old DOS ones - and can definitely make or break it. This is one of my favorite games for this reason; it does a very good job staying true to the feel of the movies and really deserves it's unnoficial title of Indiana Jones 4.\n\nIf you're looking for a fast paced adventure game, this is not it. While a lot of the puzzler-type aspects can be very difficult without the use of the Hint Guide (obviously not included on Steam), fighting is optional and with the limited point-click method - not very engaging, so I wouldn't reccomend that. The puzzler aspects include using objects with one another from multiple locations and working out persuasive dialogue paths.\n\nAll in all, I would have given this game an 9/10 in the late 90's, but as it is 2014, (but I'm still nastalgic) I'd say it's a 8/10 (mostly because the DOS-style pixilizated art now drives me nuts).", "timestamp_created": 1398565255, "timestamp_updated": 1398565255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9935536": {"recommendationid": "9935536", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962016912", "num_games_owned": 549, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 86400}, "language": "english", "review": "A must-have adventure game.", "timestamp_created": 1398482634, "timestamp_updated": 1398482634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495328", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9893675": {"recommendationid": "9893675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004497083", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503168483}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't recommend this game enough.

Much like Point 'n Click games, I have a love-hate relationship with Indiana Jones. I love the movies, but hate the video games. Out of all the Indiana Jones games I've played, this and Staff of Kings were the only good ones. Coincidentally, I first played through Fate of Atlantis as part of the Wii version of Staff of Kings\n\nThe game captures the wonder and sense of discovery that the films have, and combine them with the quirkiness and lovable charm of other LucasArts Point 'n Click games (Monkey Island, Sam & Max, etc.). The iMuse music system is solid, giving ambient tone and texture to every area. The voice cast is great, featuring LucasArts veterans like Nick Jameson. Doug Lee does a great job as Indy, though his voice could be a better impression of him. \n\nThe game play is your standard affair of pointing at stuff and clicking on said stuff to solve puzzles. While fun and well paced, the game suffers from the problem that afflicts all early Point 'n Click games. Every puzzle has one and only one solution. I understand that this is likely to prevent logical fallacies and game killing bugs, but some of the puzzle solutions are so obscure and strange that it borders on the completely frustrating. When it comes to difficulty in games, there's a magical \"butter-zone\" where the game is frustrating enough to taunt you, but not so frustrating as to make you rage quit. You know a game is in that magical zone when you want to beat the game to teach it a lesson. This game (as well as other Point 'n Click games) has a hard time finding that \"butter-zone\" due to its slow pacing, but it comes closer than other games like Uninvited and Deja Vu. \n\nIf you love Point 'n Click games or Indiana Jones, this game is worth every penny if you can get past the vices of difficult puzzles and slow pacing.

The voice acting was well done in the original, and it sounds like the audio quality might be better in this Steam release. The music is also dated digital sequences, but still good enough to hold the immersion and also sounds as if it's been improved.\n\nUnlike many adventure games, there's a point where the story can take one of three routes: team up with Sophia, use your wits, or use your fists.  Each branch takes the story in a different direction and to different locations, often not accessable in the other branches.  Kids used to spread rumors of a different ending as well, but to my knowlege, no such thing exists.

Because LucasArts made what are quite possibly the best story driven point and click games. Where to begin? The graphics are as they were 20 years ago, and yet they still feel fresh, so nostalgia will hit hard with older gamers. I have not played the original, so I am not sure if this version is different in any way, but it has the original music, voice acting and graphics, so I assume it's the same. Even though i was born around the time where they started moving on to making more Star Wars games (which were mostly good, and one of them is one of my most favourite games of all time), I still wanted to try these. Last year, I saw a show with a segment about LucasArts' history, and they talked about games like Loom, Indiana Jones And the Fate Of Atlantis, Full Throttle, The Secret Of Monkey Island and many more. And I always like games with a big focus on story lines, and I decided to try them since it would be a break from Call Of Judy or whatever generic shooters are called these days. So I found a bundle with a few of LucasArts' games, and while the controls are a bit fiddly at first, I think Loom, The Dig and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis will keep me playing 'till the credits roll because of the stories that just make you reflect after the end. It's like reading a book, you say you will read one chapter, and then you read the whole book. It's games like these that make me wish I was born in 1990. Nowadays it's all about pwning n00bs in halozone with masterchef or something. Sorry for the long review about me saying how much i like the stories in these games, But after all, the one thing that sticks around in your mind about a game, is it's story.

I'd play a game like this in heartbeat if LucasArts, SCUMM, or anyone kept producing them. \n     Anyways, there *are* two major concerns for anyone wondering (this is my attempt at writing an unbiased review). One is the voice acting, which I didn't remember from my floppy disk copies when I was a kid. But you can mute them, or better yet laugh at the horribly outrageous \"German\" and \"French\" accents. Perhaps the worst are the \"Arabic\" accents although I confess I only heard one, cringed too hard at the delivery, and promptly muted the voice volume in the preferences section, whish I was relieved to find was possible because the background music is a definate selling point (especially the syncopated Indiana Jones theme, somewhat Atari-fied like it belongs in a pokemon game). The other main problem is the fighting mechanism, which is complicated, or, rather, just not fun.\n     Anyway, plenty of puzzles, hours of gametime, total replayability (hell, I for one attest to fifteen-years-later replayability). Please play this with your young son. Haven't even mentioned THREE DIFFERENT storylines to make it to Atlantis, with varying character allegiances, settings, and of course puzzles. Still haven't mentioned the art direction, perhaps the most understated selling point I've found when reading the other reviews. And multiple endings depending on prior actions once you make it to Atlantis. Refreshing alternative to the brainless droll of shooter games that seem to dominate the market (not that there's anything wrong with brainless droll). What happened to point and click adventure games? In a way they are to my generation as the Saturday Morning Matinee serials that inspired Dr. Jones in the first place, lost to an earlier period but their appeal lingers. And and Indiana Jones adventure is the perfect fit for this genre. Campy, but in a unique and exciting way. Plot twists a plenty.

Es gibt kein Hinweis- oder Hilfssystem, mit etwas Nachdenken sind aber alle R\u00e4tsel zu schaffen. \n\nMan k\u00f6nnte jetzt noch viel dazu schreiben, aber ich w\u00fcrde es mit folgenden Satz zusammenfassen: Die Geschichte und Aufmachung des Adventures h\u00e4tte damals locker das Zeug dazu gehabt als Vorlage f\u00fcr einen echten vierten Indiana Jones-Film zu dienen.", "timestamp_created": 1385416703, "timestamp_updated": 1479926117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.807154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7729635": {"recommendationid": "7729635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025511977", "num_games_owned": 7420, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1340175600}, "language": "english", "review": "The Indiana Jones game that wasn't based on a movie and that turned out to be better than the real Indiana Jones 4.

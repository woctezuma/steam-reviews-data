I purchased it as sort of a \"hey, this looks like a cute game to waste a couple hours on,\" but it very quickly grew on me as something much more. With bonus levels, unlockable cats, a collection book for us completionists, events, and Easter Eggs, Catateral Damage has proven itself to be so much more.\n\nIt's a bit reminiscent of the Katamari series, with the general gameplay being item collection in a human's world, but the differences end there. It's story telling capabilities aren't on Katamari's level - your cat does, however, sometimes wake up with different reasons to ruin the human's day, but it doesn't go much deeper. It doesn't really need to, though. The different events and things you come across in the world are enough to keep you interested.\n\nWhile it has no true multiplayer, I've booted it up with friends over and have had great positive feedback.

It's a first person action game with a cat. You have to jump and drop things on the floor, catch mice and laser dots. Most time you have to destroy things in a flat or a house (with different rooms). But there are bonus levels (like a Mewseum, a supermarket or a laboratory).\n\nThe levels are generated randomly. Also the number of things to drop down and the time limit is set randomly. That means it's sometimes too hard and sometimes too easy. But most times it's all fine.\n\nThe controls (mouse and keyboard) work fine. The tutoriral explains it very well. It also has nice comic graphics and really happy music. The music supports the game perfectly. It's never annoying. Playing this game can bring you in a happy mood.\n\nIf you have seen all levels there are still some challenges left. Getting all the achievements and pictures of cats will make you play the game again and again. There's only one thing to be critizised: most of the time you run, jump and throw things on the floor. That can become annoying.\n\npros:\n- you play a cat\n- OMG! You play a CAT!\n- nice graphics\n- happy mewsic\n- random levels\n- additional challanges (achievements and collectibles)\n- hidden references (movies and games)\n\ncons:\n- random levels\n- most of the time you only drop things down\n- no interaction with other cats or humans\n- no high score list (only one score saved for every mode)\n\nI can recommend this game to cat lovers and all people who ever wanted to play as a cat in first purrson purrspective. It's not a game you would play 100 hours ore more.

The concept of Catlateral Damage is basically you\u2019re a cat with the task of destroying as many as your owner\u2019s precious possessions before the timer runs out. The game boasts a randomized room system which means no two playthroughs are the same. I don\u2019t doubt this but I do doubt the replayability nonetheless.\n\nThe weakness to me of the game is the lack of direction. Although destroying things can be fun \u2013 there isn\u2019t much satisfaction in doing so. I am told there is collectibles and other goodies to find such as powerups but they alluded me in my playthrough and I did not notice any. \u201cObjective mode\u201d had absolutely no difference to me than \u201cLitter Box mode\u201d from what I could see. I was told no instructions nor any pop-up menus explaining any other nuances to the game so I assumed there wasn\u2019t any.\n\nGraphically and audio wise \u2013 the game looks good. The cartoonish/cute world fits well with the theme of the game. The sounds of a cat gets old but what do you expect in a game in which you play a cat. The different cats you can \u201cplay as\u201d change your paw colors which is a nice addition.\n\nFor $9.99, it\u2019s a mixed sell to me. Although I can see this being great for maybe a younger audience or far more casual gamers than myself \u2013 most serious gamers won\u2019t bother with this more than once. I admit \u2013 I am likely not the target audience but I was interested in the \u201csmall perspective\u201d mode after enjoying games like Toy Commander for the Sega Dreamcast. The question it comes down to \u2013 if you\u2019re buying this game for someone younger, it might be a decent buy. If you\u2019re buying it for a random destruction game \u2013 I feel like there is better choices at better prices.

The objects you knock down count as points and for each level there's a certain amount of points you need to get before the time runs out; there are also certain items you can knock down and collect - which vary from level to level - that earn you more points so you can complete your objective quicker. Upgrades are available as well which increase things like your speed, your swat strength and your jump so as you progress it's easier to tackle the increasingly difficult objectives.\n\nThere are two game modes: Objective Mode (the main mode I just explained) and Litterbox Mode. Litterbox Mode is a Sandbox Mode where you can knock down as much as you like with no time limit! You can choose your location and spend hours as a destructive kitty ^w^\n\nThe characters are very cute and the music only adds to the fun and optimistic environment; overall a very entertaining game which is easy to spend hours upon hours on :D\nAs for the price? For $11.99 I'd say it's certainly worth it as there are a lot of things to unlock and find, the achievements are rewarding and there's a large variety of levels and locations. It's also a wonderful gift :) though if you're patient enough to wait until Catlateral Damage is on sale, it's your choice and I hope you have fun playing it if you do have it OwO\n\nI really like this game and recommend it to those who love cute and happy things, and love to cause a bit of a ruckus in-game. It's surprisingly a really good stress releiver so if you're feeling a bit frustrated this game really cheers you up ^-^\n\n\nThank you so much for reading my review and I hoped it helped you out :3c\n~ Pet", "timestamp_created": 1493763528, "timestamp_updated": 1493763528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31437610": {"recommendationid": "31437610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041982901", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485001145}, "language": "english", "review": "Very silly and entirely enjoyable.

Your motives for doing this are announced in the beginning of each level, and are appropriately catty, including such gems as \"My wet food tastes terrible! Those humans will pay!\"\n\nYou're offered two modes of play - Objective and Litterbox. Objective Mode throws you a timer and a certain amount of objects to topple; a single campaign requiring a player to complete 5 objectives - or 5 houses - successfully before the time runs out. You can additionally play with \"cat toys\" (put in quotes because some of these include scratching posts and litterboxes; others are houseplants and toilet paper, which many people do not consider conventional toys for their feline) to earn power-ups that can make you jump higher, move faster, and swipe at objects harder. You're also encouraged to collect cat photos, as doing so unlocks new cats to play as and two achievements! \n\nLitterbox Mode, meanwhile, sets you loose in any house you desire to destroy stuff at your leisure. \n\nBoth modes are subject to randomized \"events\" that occur; these vary vastly, from \"Moon Gravity\" and \"Disco\" to \"Kill the red dots\" and \"Catch the mouse\". Every house is also proceedurally-generated, so there are different objects to wreck every time you play, although the layout of the furniture, as far as I can tell, stays the same. My only beef with the game is that there isn't more of it; there're only a handful of houses to run amok in currently, with four or so interesting add-ons, like the Mewseum and Supermarcat. The game is fun, but since it's so small, that can only go so far; if you're not very bored and very into cats and/or pure destruction, this probably isn't the game for you. \n\nTL;DR: This game is so good; the purest cat game you will ever get your hands on. Would probably wait for it to go on sale, though. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1480650271, "timestamp_updated": 1480650524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523294", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28115770": {"recommendationid": "28115770", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990288683", "num_games_owned": 1617, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478736500}, "language": "english", "review": "Play as cat  - check\nKnock stuff over - check\nChase red dot - check\n", "timestamp_created": 1480585055, "timestamp_updated": 1480585055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28085831": {"recommendationid": "28085831", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995789348", "num_games_owned": 1506, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490110540}, "language": "english", "review": "The best cat simulator on the market!

The concept is fairly well done and the game has a nice simplistic style to it, although this game is far from perfect and has so much missing potential.\nFor example: enemies, yes this game has no enemies. the lack of threat really gives you no danger, rush or challenge, while the \"time trials\" are giving a real challenge, it's not really fun and doesn't give off a true challenge. Please, devolopers, if you're reading this PLEASE add enemies or at least npcs, this game is in such dire need of them.\n\nAnother thing this game lacks is multiplayer, which really sucks, while multiplayer may seem like it adds to the game a lot, it doesn't need it too much. Those two flaws makes it -after a while of playing- a truely loney game, i get having no humans because, well, theres no humans because you have to mess up the house when your owners gone. But theres not even dogs/other pets. (I just remembered now that theres a mouse in the game in an event to get extra points, but to be honest I don't really think it counts)\n\nBut I've been saying the games main flaws, it is a good review after all, I'm gonna have to bring up positives:\nFirst of all: the litterbox mode, the litterbox mode is a randomly generated house for you to ruin, you type in the text to randomly generate it or it just randomly does one. This is the games best part, it prevents the game from getting stale and it rarely ever gets old. Theres also different unlockables that make it also less repetitive, but the unlockable items (based on what you knock down) (I think they're unlocks :\\ ) don't give you any real perks, kitten unlocks just look nice.\n\nAlso the game has VR mode, I'm a bit tempted to get a VR just to play it in VR mode, but I think I'd vomit like hell from VR mode alone. Seriously, while this isn't the games fault, it's nausating as hell, seriously if you have motion sickness or something, play it like an hour a day, I've played more sickening games (in the litteral sense) but this is still kind of nausating.\n\nI'd give it around a 7.5/10 I'd give it way higher if the devs updated it to include multiplayer and npcs/enemies.\nAlthough it really is worth it to buy it, I think the game is worth the money.", "timestamp_created": 1470852545, "timestamp_updated": 1470852545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24797639": {"recommendationid": "24797639", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968571261", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471899742}, "language": "english", "review": "This game succinctly encapsulates the majestic essence of the common housecat in all their curious glory. :)\n\nI enjoyed this a lot for some reason, despite its repetitiveness.

Well now you can fulfil your desires! Catlateral Damage is a casual first-person cat simulator in which your sole purpose is to cause mass destruction to your owner\u2019s home. Swipe books off shelves, plates out of cupboards and saucepans off stove tops! You are also able to swipe at portraits which, when knocked down, unlocks the image to view in the collections folder in the menu. You\u2019re able to unlock over 230 strange and wonderful varieties of animal photos, including (and my personal favourite thus far) a very solemn looking black dog wearing a cat birthday hat (what more could you want, right?)!\nThere are two game modes; Objective and Litterbox. In Objective mode, you have to knock down a certain number of objects within a time limit in a procedurally-generated house. Litterbox mode is slightly more relaxed; You have to knock down every object in the map that you get to choose (you can unlock more as you go along), but there is no time limit. My personal favourite is what I like to call \u2018Bah Humbug mode\u2019, where you get to rip open and destroy presents, knock over festive decorations and swipe all the ornaments off the Christmas tree! Wooh!\nThe game has unlockables, events and power-ups, including increased swipe, increased jump and increased speed. There is also a catnip unlockable which slightly distorts your vision and effortlessly enables you to swipe entire plates off a shelf with one brisk movement!\nSome of the events include moon gravity (did someone say floating cat?!) and disco, which turns the house into the ultimate par-tay destination!\nYou are also able to chase mice and lasers, which is oddly satisfying!\n\n[h1]Replay Value[/h1]\nThere are many different levels to play in Litterbox mode, providing hours of fun and destruction! Even after you\u2019ve completed them all, it\u2019s still a game I think you would easily open up again once in a while, as it really does provide plenty of amusement and entertainment.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe music throughout the game is very upbeat, but is very repetitive and can get pretty annoying after a while. Audio controls are your friend.\n\n[h1]Overall Verdict[/h1]\nCatlateral Damage is a very amusing game, and I can\u2019t help but get the urge to play it every now and again. It\u2019s also very decently priced considering the amount of gameplay available.\nSeriously, you don\u2019t know how much fun breaking things can be until you\u2019ve played this game. I now finally understand my cats.\n\n[h1]Overall Score: 7/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1470217996, "timestamp_updated": 1470217996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550991", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24661600": {"recommendationid": "24661600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051400813", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476251862}, "language": "english", "review": "It gets very repetitive very fast.", "timestamp_created": 1470097535, "timestamp_updated": 1470097535, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24648257": {"recommendationid": "24648257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063814243", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467899692}, "language": "english", "review": "Meow meow.", "timestamp_created": 1470038512, "timestamp_updated": 1470038512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24644191": {"recommendationid": "24644191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117535776", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479592364}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would unroll toilet paper again.\n\nIn all seriousness, this game was just one big bundle of joy.

You could make levels, cats, or other things (don't know. It's up to you, creator). Another thing is scratching curtains and peeing. I was really disappointed that I couldn't pee on anything or scratch any curtains. I also wish you could bite things like the flip flops. I also wish the tutorial would've mentioned how to pick items up (F while looking at it) because I got really confused on the level with all the boxes and the shop level.\n\nOne final thing I wish was available was to save progress on litterbox levels.

objects to topple, another downside is only if objects land on floor do they count as being knocked over, so if you knock stuff off a shelf and it lands on a chair/table or bed it doesn't count.\n\nExtreme button basher game it seems lol i have seen negative reviews saying about motion sickness which is strange, i have motion sickness issues however not with this game, also i the music does get annoying so just play your own xD whoever thought a small cheap game would have so much fun and replay value.\n\nI could see some more things being fixed and updated, i have seen some of the achievements which seem to be somewhat impossible for instance the complete 50 objective levels i have done 10 in a row but afterwards it instantly puts me back at the main menu without letting me try for it, another achievement being the max all levels to full even in what i call cat heaven mode which has all the boxs, plants and scratchng posts etc i cant seem to get the levels more than half full and of course everytime you start litterbox mode or campaigne mode your levels are reset to 0\n\nI know i do sound like i have said alot of negative however i'm still rating the game positive as

developers for creating such an amazing game, and now let's get into it!\nIf you REALLY love cats then look no further! Catlateral Damage is the perfect game for you, my dear cat lover friend!\n\nThe game's been created by Chris Chung in honour of his cat Nippy (1997-2014), and thanks to him we, you can now play as one of those furious cats whose owners made the mistake of leaving them home alone.\nAnd as I said, they're no normal cats! They were just waiting for the right moment to go on a rampage and knock everything they can knock onto the floor, that meaning all they can find, leaving nothing but a huge mess behind them... and imagine when the owner comes back home and finds his house completely messed up, everything's on the floor, something's even broken and his cat's quietly spleeping in his box... that would drive each and everyone of us crazy, wouldn't it?\nAnd that's exactly what YOU have to do! In this awesome first-person cat simulator you play as a cute kitten whose objective is to knock as much as possible right onto the floor, leaving a mess your owner is then supposed to clean up. Forget you're a human! You're cat now! You'll see the world from the perspective of a cat, you'll walk, jump, crouch, think and act like an annoying (but cute!) little kitten whose weapons are his paws, his little mouth and his furry soft body. Aside the main task you'll have to complete to complete the level, under the quest are shown two objects: the one on the left gives extra points when knocked onto the ground, while the right one will give you a free upgrade when a certain amount of it will be destroyed by your little paws.\nIn the levels there are games you can play with to obtain a perk for one of the three categories, which are jump, speed and swat. There are also events, such as free upgrades, glowing red dots, mice, disco, moon gravity, force shield and power outage. \nOh, and don't forget about those 267 (have fun ^.^) photos you can find while running through the levels, remember to knock them off the walls or the shelves in order to unlock them. Those photos portrait cats, dogs, and a few other house pets.\n\nThere are two game modes you can play: Objective Mode and Litterbox Mode:\n-In Objective mode you're given an amount of time and a definite number of things (such as 190 objects in 5 minutes) you'll have to knock onto the ground before the time runs out. Every game is composed of five levels during which you'll be given different tasks and optional objectives and.. don't tell anyone, but you can also find a christmas tree that will lead you to a special christmas-themed level, a tyrannosaurus that will lead you to the Mewseum where you'll have to destroy objects worth a certain amount of dollars, a shopping cart that will lead you to the Supermarkat where you'll have to destroy a couple of specific products, some kind of cat boxes that will lead you to the Cardboard Box Paradise and finally an object I haven't manage to unlock yet that will lead you straight to the Furightful Lab.\n\n- Litterbox Mode is quite different, you don't have time nor an amount of things to destroy, your box is already open, what you're supposed to do here is to knock onto the floor what you want to and then leave whenever you want. In this mode you can select the level you want to play and there'll be no events (I'm an idiot, there ARE events!), you can take all the time you want, no one's telling you to hurry, just: relax, take it eeeaaasy! (I love Mika ^.^)\n\nYou may be concerned there aren't a lot of levels and it's true, but! they change every time due to the procedural generation of the levels. You surely will play the same level multiple times but it will always have something different since last time you played it. Anyway what I liked the most about this game is the soundtrack. That has to be said, it's just f*cking awesome! You have to love it! It is at your side for all the time you'll be playing, it never bores you and what about those meows you can hear by pressing F? Ahhh so sweet, as soon as I'm done I'm going to pet my little Kitten. The cartoon-based graphic? Lovely, it really fits the game, you don't need anything too sophisticated to make a wonderful game and Catlateral Damage IS a wonderful game!\nOk.. I'm tired.. I've been writing for more than an hour.. you know what? I'm almost done, and I also believe you're tired of me already... ok let's end this.\n\nJust buy and enjoy this awesome game.\nEnd of the story.

You have two modes: Litterbox, that lets you \"free roam\" without time and Objective Mode, where you have X minutes to destroy X pieces. \n\nWhile you progression, you will unlock new cats, with some cats are easy to push objectos in to floor. Also you can collect pictures/paints off cats. The graphics are nice, is like someone used watercolor, i really liked, and the BGM is cool too. \n\nNow, i did love the game but lacks two features, third person (would be nice so you actually see the cat), and MP/Online COOP, MP on this game would be awesome, compete with your friend to see who get the best score. Well still amazing game. \n\nAlso the dev, did make the game VR capable, and you can DL it for free, as long you have the game.

Ligue o jogo, quebre coisas, fique instantaneamente feliz.\n- V\u00e1rios tipos de gato, voc\u00ea pode jogar com o doppelg\u00e4nger da bola peluda destruidora que voc\u00ea tem em sua casa.\n\nE o principal motivo:\n\nAp\u00f3s a leitura dos cr\u00e9ditos(O que garante uma conquista Steam, fique esperto(a)!), percebi que o jogo foi feito em homenagem ao gato do criador do jogo, chamado Nippy, falecido em 2014. Ap\u00f3s a leitura dos cr\u00e9ditos, voc\u00ea encontra uma foto dos dois com os dizeres \"In loving memory of Nippy(1997 - 2014). A wonderful friend & companion.\"\n\nQuem j\u00e1 perdeu um animal de estima\u00e7\u00e3o sabe que um peda\u00e7o da alma vai embora junto com ele, e a maneira que o criador teve de manter a mem\u00f3ria de Nippy viva, foi coloc\u00e1-lo como o gato principal do jogo. Isso \u00e9 espetacular.\n\nEu n\u00e3o tenho nenhuma vis\u00e3o negativa do jogo, principalmente porque o vejo como homenagem a Nippy. E uma das mais lindas que j\u00e1 vi.\n\nConclus\u00e3o: \n- Comprei para me divertir com um jogo simples, fui pego de surpresa por todos esses sentimentos.\n\n- 10/10\n\nR.I.P. Nippy. \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n[Review in EN]\n\nThe final game for those who love and live with cats.\n\nI usually do not do any kind of review, but this game in particular caught my attention for a few reasons:\n\n- Cat Simulator with the primary mission of cats on this planet: destroy things at will.\n- Extremely fun and relaxing. Activate the game, break things, be instantly happy.\n- Several cat types, you can play with the doppelg\u00e4nger of destructive hairy ball that you have in your home.\n\nAnd the main reason:\n\nAfter reading the credits (What guarantees an achievement Steam, be smart!), I realized that the game was made in honor of the game's creator cat named Nippy, who died in 2014. After reading the credits, you will find a picture of them with the words \"In loving memory of Nippy (1997-2014).. A wonderful friend & companion\"\n\nAnyone who has lost a pet knows that a piece of the soul goes away with him, and the way that the creator had to keep the memory alive Nippy, has put it as the main game cat. This is spectacular.\n\nI have no negative view of the game, mainly because I see it as a tribute to Nippy.

Sure, there are things to unlock, half a dozen levels, and a get-the-laser minigame, but at the end of the day you're just a cat pushing cel-shaded objects on the floor.\n\nThe game's Objective mode can be frustrating but is almost always fair, where you knock down a certain number of objects in either way too little or way too much time; the different time limts set a good overall pace where you don't have to be entirely frantic or bored the whole time. Sandbox mode is pretty much exactly what you'd expect, although perfectionists ought to be careful here as it can be difficult if not impossible to \"complete\" certain levels as there is zero leeway regarding object count and sometimes an object that has fallen on another object will not count toward your total. Although you can collect power-ups in both modes, they are not persistent except immediately between levels in the objective mode, so consider yourself starting from scratch in each session.\n\nI really like the collectibles aspect, where a list of everything you've encountered is archived and separated by item type.

The VR experience was mesmerizing enough to land me nearly an hour of gameplay in my first two tries.\n\nMy only complaint would be, having an extremely substandard amount of space to play in (to the point where Room Scale setup in SteamVR won't let me finish the config) that the teleport feature likes to land you too far away from objects, resulting in a few accidental *real* object battings :-) It might make the game slightly easier to allow us to land right next to stuff, but it'll also be more fun that way.\n\nI'll try to give this a good shot in a larger space at one point. I just WISH I had the room to go nuts and unleash the fury.\n\n* Thanks to every anti VR shill who indiscriminately downvote VR based reviews. <3", "timestamp_created": 1464799918, "timestamp_updated": 1464800009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 107, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837981", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23326081": {"recommendationid": "23326081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080178247", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464610943}, "language": "japanese", "review": "nyaaa~\n\n\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u8996\u70b9\u3067\u306d\u3053\u306b\u306a\u308a\u304d\u3063\u3066\u90e8\u5c4b\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u5927\u66b4\u308c\u3057\u3066\u3072\u305f\u3059\u3089\u6563\u3089\u304b\u3057\u3066\u904a\u3076\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3060\u3088\u3002\n\u3053\u306e\u624b\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u306fGoat Simulator(\u30e4\u30ae)\u304c\u6709\u540d\u3060\u3051\u3069\u3042\u3063\u3061\u307b\u3069\u30ab\u30aa\u30b9\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u51fa\u3066\u304f\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306f\u732b\u597d\u304d\u306a\u3089\u5206\u304b\u308b\u3082\u306e\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3002\n\u732b\u304c\u904a\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3092\u898b\u3066\u81ea\u5206\u3082\u904a\u3093\u3067\u307f\u305f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u306e\u3042\u308b\u4eba\u306f\u51c4\u304f\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3060\u3002\n\u79c1\u306f\u7ae5\u5fc3\u306b\u5e30\u3063\u3066\u904a\u3093\u3067\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3002\n\nnyaaa~\n\n\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u306f\u3001\u306d\u3053\u306e\u6a5f\u52d5\u529b\u304c\u9ad8\u3059\u304e\u30663D\u9154\u3044\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3002\nVR\u306f\u6b8b\u5ff5\u306a\u304c\u3089\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u306f\u51fa\u6765\u306a\u3044\u304c\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u306e\u3053\u3068\u3002\n\nnyaaa~", "timestamp_created": 1464784526, "timestamp_updated": 1464784526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684964", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23318135": {"recommendationid": "23318135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032530092", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464049707}, "language": "english", "review": "Really not worth any money, Fells like a weekend project by a high schooler.", "timestamp_created": 1464738332, "timestamp_updated": 1464738332, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495607", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23306137": {"recommendationid": "23306137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076093453", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490918498}, "language": "english", "review": "I finally got all the achivements to this game.

En effet m\u00eame si l'id\u00e9e de contr\u00f4ler un chat qui envole tout sur son passage est tr\u00e8s basique et assez farfelue elle n'est pas moins fonctionnel, d\u00e9s les premiers instants le jeu est tr\u00e8s amusant et on prend un plaisir fou \u00e0 d\u00e9truire tout ce que l'on peut. \n\nIl s'agit litt\u00e9ralement d'un jeu o\u00f9 le seul but est de s'amuser \u00e0 foutre le bordel, et c'est cool ! Alors certes le jeu ne vole pas bien haut, il n'y a pas d'histoire ou de r\u00e9el int\u00e9r\u00eat mais cela reste tr\u00e8s plaisant de sauter sur une \u00e9tag\u00e8re et de jeter la collection de DVD de son ma\u00eetre sur le sol comme un bon gros c**nard :P\n\nHonn\u00eatement le seul point faible du jeu c'est qu'il est tellement r\u00e9p\u00e9titif qu'il est difficile d'y jouer tr\u00e8s longtemps sans en \u00eatre totalement lass\u00e9. La seule chose qui peut \u00e9ventuellement vous donnez l'envie d'y jouer plus qu'une heure ou deux c'est de d\u00e9bloquer les succ\u00e8s que le jeu propose, autrement il n'y a pas vraiment de quoi s'\u00e9terniser dessus.\n\nBref pour moi ce titre est vraiment une bonne pioche, c'est tr\u00e8s sympa et puis c'est diff\u00e9rent des autres jeux. Cependant je ne recommande pas d'en faire l\u2019acquisition au prix fort ( 9,99\u20ac ) car sinc\u00e8rement rien ne justifie un tel tarif.

I like this game, a lot, I really do, but in its current state and at its current price I just can't fully recommend it. I bought it because I saw JoshJepson play it on YouTube, and it looked like fun... and it is! It really is! But it's just not enough fun and it's definitely not with $10! Thankfully I got it on a 50% off sale... but I still even hesitate to say it's worth $5. With the small amount of content and replayability it has now it's maybe worth $3.\n\nWhat would make it better, and push me to fully recommend it, is if it had more levels, with more objects and special elements, and more cats and maybe if the cats had different special abilities. Most of the varying events that happen and achievements things that you can unlock have little effect on the gameplay and are not very rewarding. Also, another big thing it's missing for me is multiplayer. I would love to be able to play in a map with friends playing other cats helping me knock stuff over, or in a race to see who can destroy the most stuff or whatever.\n\nSo in short -\n\n+ fun-sounding music\n+ fun idea\n+ fun to be a cat\n+ fun!\n\n- the fun gets old fast\n- not enough content to be worth the price\n- different cats have no special abilities\n- not much variation in gameplay\n- no multiplayer\n\nIf you really want it, get it on a sale.

Thanks, Ashen.)\n\nIf you ever wondered what it was like to be a cat or why cats made messes, this game is for you.

Those humans will pay.\"  \"My balls are gone.  Time to make a mess.\")\n\nThe moment I booted this game I fell in love with making a mess.  A simple game with a simple objective, you get points for knocking stuff onto the floor.  Starting out, it was difficult to find a way to get all the items on the floor in time.  The secret, though, is to know what the high-items are and where they're normally located.  If all else fails, just make a big mess.  That works too.\n\nPROS:\nBe a cat\nMake a mess\nCameo references\nMeow\nLevels randomly generate objects for you to make a mess with\n\nCONS:\nCan get old (You'll find yourself busy for 15-20 minutes)\nNot much variety in terms of levels (last I recall there were a total of 8-9 maps)\n\nIt's great to see that maps aren't COMPLETELY identical as the layout can change upon each boot (along with certain spawned items).  The game is currently priced at $10, which it does not feel like it's worth.  Wait for a sale before getting this one if you want your money to feel well-spent.  After a while, it will feel old.

See a shelf full of books? Knock 'em all on the floor. Big, expensive TV perched precariously on the edge of a table? Floor. A bunch of supermarket aisles filled with hundreds and hundreds of premium buyables? Yep, eeeeevery one of them, right on the floor. It's like I'm playing as Michael Douglas in Falling Down if he was a cat and the movie ended with him falling asleep in a cardboard box. I'm just really disappointed there were no toddlers perched up on highchairs in the game. Oh well.\n\nIn Catlateral Damage you'll play as a cat with the sole aim of knocking down a target number of items in a small handful of rooms within a certain amount of time. To begin with, your feeble, fuzzy paws will only be able to bat items ever so slightly (left or right click will do a left or right swipe while Q, E or middle mouse will jab), and you'll move kinda slowly and won't be able to jump very high, but playing with cat toys will reward you with an upgrade for one of those three attributes. And if you're particularly lucky, a random event such as catching a mouse, swatting a glowing red dot, or \"moon gravity\" will grant you a limited increase in abilities. By the end you'll be running at lightning speed, jumping almost the full height of a room and swatting away big, heavy objects with ease. That end actually comes pretty quickly, though, given the structure of the game.\n\nBy default there's only four stages to play through; what looks like a standard apartment, a log cabin (or possibly a summer camp?), umm, a slightly different apartment, and, uh... a really fancy apartment. There isn't really a massive amount of variety in the settings, I guess, and no additional floors to move up and down through, just a small handful of rooms where the collection of items you'll be knocking over are largely the same. But at least the actual layout of the rooms are procedurally generated so you'll never have exactly the same setup of rooms twice, for what that's worth. There's a chance that each stage may hide a collectible which will unlock an additional bonus stage (a museum, a box fort, a spooky lab or a single room decorated for Christmas) making for up to eight stages you could potentially play through in a single run. Failing to hit the target within the time limit on the default stages will end your run, while succeeding will allow you to continue to the next stage, with the overall goal being to score as many points as you can during a run. There isn't really a huge amount to it, and if I'm being honest the whole thing is pretty quick and shallow, but, damn, if I didn't have a whole lotta fun playing it.\n\nI enjoyed the simplicity of it, and there's something incredibly cathartic (no pun intended!) about leaping around and thrashing the sh*t out of a place and not having to care about it or feel the least bit guilty. It's a sense of contented joy that comes second only to exposing yourself to random joggers in the park. But just as with waiting in the bushes for the right moment, leaping out, helicoptering a bit, then running away and finishing yourself off, by the end, I still wanted more. I'd love to see a greater sense of meaningful, permanent progression. Like... for some reason I keep thinking of Crackdown as I play this - that itch you constantly have to scratch of seeing an orb, trying to get it, not being able to jump or climb high enough, then coming back later to get it when you've become more powerful. I'd really loved to have played something like that here... but with cats.\n\nI can imagine having an entire mansion to play with, where you start off only being able to jump small distances or knock over light objects, but as you gain more XP you grow stronger and gain new abilities. Maybe you can eventually see in the dark to explore the basement (and attic, once you can jump high enough to get in), or longer claws to scratch and damage items that were previously untouchable, as well as being able to climb special surfaces with them. Gain enough speed to eventually outrun the chain chomp-like dog guarding the tool shed, or enough height to jump up to the vents to reach other locked rooms... and so on. I know it's the easiest thing in the world to play backseat developer and say how great something would be, but that the reality is it's incredibly difficult to actually make an even remotely competent game, which is especially true if it's only a small team working with modest resources and budget. But, y'know... a guy can dream. To quote the girl in the trailer, I just want to cat, dammit!\n\n[Steam is being weird again and won't let me post the review properly.

You cause destruction as one of several different cats, most of which you have to unlock through gameplay. \n\nYou can play in two modes, objective mode and \"litterbox\" mode. Objective mode is where you are given a set of objectives to complete. You do this by knocking down or destroying the indicated items. You have a time limit in which to complete the objectives. You get bonuses for certain items, as indicated in your objectives.  If you complete your objectives, you get to move on to another level, up to four levels. There are special items you can knock down to unlock bonus levels which are added in to your four basic levels. \n\n\"Litterbox\" mode is an untimed mode with no objectives. You get to take your time and explore. You get one point per item destroyed or knocked to the floor. \n\nYou can level up your cat's abilities (Speed, Jump, Swipe) by finding upgrades. These consist of sparkling items that cats use or play with and by pawing at them, you can trigger an upgrade drop.  In objective mode, you have to decide whether or not you want to use your precious time to gather more upgrades while the clock is ticking. Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes it isn't, and you'll eventually start to figure that out.\n\nThere are collectibles and achievements, including secret achievements. I've played for over 17 hours and I still don't have everything.\n\nIt is reminiscent of Katamari Damacy. You are rushing around, causing chaos, knocking things down, and you have to get a certain number of items. It doesn't match up to Katamari in sheer variety of items and locales, or with an amazing soundtrack, but this is a much smaller scale game. It's still quite fun.\n\nI haven't had much issue with the camera angle, and I'm pretty picky with that sort of thing. I've seen a few minor graphics glitches, but that's it. It feels fairly well polished.\n\nI wish there was more variety in the soundtrack, but I can always turn down the music in the options and put on my own if I get tired of it.\n\nI hope the developer releases more content for this game down the line.

In Catlateral Damage, one plays as a cat, with the sole task of doing exactly what cats do best: knocking stuff on the floor.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is well done, with everything working as it should. It's a simple idea, literally all you do is walk and jump and swat. But the developers have done a fantastic job with this, the only problem is getting used to the jump height. Now, I don't know much about cats, but being able to jump more than half a metre off the ground seems like a lot to me. This means that you'll often mess up your jumps and fail to get onto ledges and tables. \n\nThe way everything falls seems very real and is wholly satisfying. The upgrades and power-ups are useful, but really only a minor thing in the game, and the developers have avoided making the aim of the game to be getting all the upgrades, something that just wouldn't seem right in a game like this. \n\nThe events are an extremely fun thing that just happen every so often, randomly. Things like moon gravity, or killing the little red lights, or a disco. They just make you laugh when they happen.\n\n[u]Aim of the Game[/u]\n\nThe aim of the game is to knock everything on the floor, and to unlock cat photos. And boy, are there a lot of cat photos. \n\nThe game is collection based, where you build a collection of items to drop on the floor. They are divided into multiple categories, such as appliances, clothes, etc.\n\n[u]Gamemodes[/u]\n\nThere are two gamemodes; Objective mode and Litterbox mode. \n\nIn Objective mode, you are placed into a randomly generated location, and you have to knock a set amount of items onto the floor within a time limit. \n\nIn Litterbox mode, you go to that location again, without the time limit. The aim is to knock [b]every single item[/b] in the location onto the floor. There is no time limit, but that doesn't mean it's easy, especially in the Supermarket and Mewseum, which have several thousand objects each!\n\n[h1]Level Design[/h1]\n\nThe levels are randomly generated, with the exceptions of the Supermarket and Mewseum. These two are the same every time, but are so big and awesome that you wouldn't notice.\n\nThe levels are well made, and you can always find some totally cat-like way of climbing up to every shelf or wardrobe. The feeling you get from succesfully parcour-ing up to the highest shelf in a room is immensly satisfactory. \n\n[h1]Graphics/Visuals[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are not great. They are simplistic and there are no fancy lighting effects. That is not to say it doesn't look nice, because it still does. It has it's own unique style, and I personally find that it is still aesthetically pleasing. \n\nThe texturing and modelling on the objects is very basic, just boxes with coloured rectangles, but you can always tell what the objects are meant to be. \n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\n\nThe game runs surprisingly well. I have two copies of it on two separate computers; one for myself and one for my sister. I play on a 2010 MacBook Pro with 4GB of RAM, a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo and an NVidia GeForce 320M. The game runs smoothly at the highest graphics settings (called Purrfect). For my other copy, I'm using a 2007 Intel iMac, with 2GB of RAM, a 2.8 GHz single-core processor and an integrated Intel graphics card. It lags on anything other than the lowest graphics setting, but runs them extremely smoothly, at roughly 35 FPS, solidly. The game will lag on occasion, but only when you're knocking around ten items into the air simultaneously (this usually only happens on bookshelfs).\n\n[h1]Misc.[/h1]\n\nThere are many random things about this which I like, but do not, however, fit into any of the main categories.\n\n[list]\n\n[*] Trading Cards - everyone loves Steam Trading Cards, right?\n[*] Achievments - a way to show how far you've come\n[*] The 'f' key - pressing it can do three different things: [olist]\n                                                                                             [*] On large objects, you bite them\n                                                                                             [*] On smaller objects, you pick them up in your mouth\n                                                                                             [*] Without an object, you just meow\n[/olist]\n[*] There are Atari 2600s - everyone's favourite games console\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b][u]THE CONCLUSION[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nThis games is fantastic for just messing around in, good for stress relief or if you're having a bad day and just can't quite complete that mission in Jedi Academy.

But I very much enjoyed what I've played of it so far, so I figured I may as well do a quick review post. \n\nIf you dont get the drift by looking at the store page or the trailer (how could you NOT get the idea of what it's like by looking at that trailer?), you play as a cat, albeit one who is missing a few screws... well... missing more screws than, ahem, \"normal\" cats are missing anyway (as if cats are ever normal.... not in my experience!)... and one who is very clearly bored, as this cat has decided to SWAT ALL THE THINGS.  \n\nWhich is pretty much what you're doing; in each level, you're simply given a number of objects to knock over, and a time limit in which to do this.  Fail to clear that number, and it's game over, as you'd expect.  You're also given some specific objects to find that can give a bonus, and some that are worth extra in that particular level; the game will point these out to you each time, so make a note of that and keep an eye out for the thing.  \n\nEverything of course is all filled with physics, which means that stuff is just going to go bouncing all over the place, exactly as you'd expect.  It's worth noting though that the objects have to hit the FLOOR to count; if they land on another piece of furniture, they dont do anything for you.  The game makes it pretty obvious when things have properly connected with the floor.\n\nMuch of the game uses procedural generation, so you cant just automatically head into a level and already know where the highest scoring spots are; that wouldnt be very interesting and I'm glad the devs didnt do that.  There are also random \"events\" that might happen.  You never know just what these might be.  They could help you, or just confuse.  You'll be running around, like \"Oh hey, here's another book shelf, time to swat these books, swat swat swat, hahaha, swat swat swa- OH GOD DISCO WTF?!?\" and there'll only be confusion remaining.  Or maybe the power in the house will go out.  Or perhaps you're told to go catch a mouse, and if you do so, you'll get a free upgrade item or even something else.  Upgrades are gotten usually by smacking around certain specific cat-related objects (like scratching posts) and will increase an attribute for your cat, like jumping or speed or whatever.  So you definitely want those.\n\nThere are also bonus levels that can be found in each of the main levels (4 main levels in one run), there's a \"litterbox\" mode where there's no objectives or anything and you just smack things around at your own pace, and about a bazillion cat (and dog?) photos to unlock, and who doesnt like those?  Sad, irritating little jerks, that's who doesnt like those.  There's alot of achievements to get, and many playable cats to unlock as well.\n\n\nOverall, it's a very arcade-y game, since it's fast paced and scoring points is the entire, well, point of it, and it seriously feels ALOT like Katamari, actually; if you liked that series, this is definitely one to try.  Not exactly a difficult game, but as with most score-focused games, the challenge comes from scoring high; not \"beating\" the game.\n\nI look forward to playing this quite a bit, it's definitely my sort of thing.\n\nBut for now, my arm hurts like heck from clicking the blasted mouse so much.

I remember some kinks in the early portion of the beta but it has come quite a bit of way now that we're getting closer to release  (beta until Sept. 1st as of the latest email from creator Chris Chung!). I periodically play in to see new development on the game and it has smoother swatting motions, fun challenges, and a lot more ease of movement than before. In the beginning, the motion aspect was the biggest target and then later came in meowing, additional achievements, mini challenges, litterbox mode, and the Kickstarter stretch goal levels such as the museum and grocery store. \n\nThus far, I have played Objective mode, Litterbox mode, and the bonus museum level. I don't have any complaints about the game because it is certainly satisfying to swat objects onto the ground, watching some of them shatter (like dishes & vases!), getting upgrades, and the disappointed feeling that comes when you jump and fail epicly. Objective mode features a timer and a goal to destroy a number of items within a timeframe while Litterbox mode allows you to destroy items at your leisure. After each level is completed whether through timer in Objective mode or casually through Litterbox mode, you can simply click continue to be taken to a whole new house/level. I really like how each house has a different design to keep things fresh. \n\nAs I've gotten older, I have become more of a casual gamer so I mostly play in Litterbox mode. I'd rather take my time destroying my owners' precious items than being rushed to do the job. I'm a cat, right? I'm gonna take my sassy-ass time then. The only problem I could see other people having, is the graphics, but what you see above is what you're getting. It is a simple, sometimes slightly stressful (Objective mode) game.

Then look no further! Catlateral Damage is a first-person destruction simulator where you play as a cat and knock as much objects to the floor as possible. Along with that, you can get powerups by using cat objects such as the litterbox, scratching post, cat tunnels, and more that help you knock objects faster and farther with one flick of the paw! But if you're not a fan of having a clear objective, try litterbox mode! In litterbox mode, you can freely knock down objects like its none of your buisness with as much time as you like.\n\n But if you think thats all, there is many more than just knocking down objects and collecting power ups. You can collect cats by unlocking achievements or doing other things or collect over 200+ real life cat photos for your own personal enjoyment. And so the game doesnt get repetitive, the houses are never the same and are always randomly generated so you wont get bored so easily! But the most cool thing that you can find in the game are the secret areas you can unlock such as the \"Mewseum\" or the \"Supermarkat.\" What you do in these places are a suprise... :3\n\nThe graphics in this game are not that bad in my opinion.

Chris Chung and Fire Hose Games have done all three of these things in the magnum opus that is Catlateral Damage. For centuries scholars have pondered over our feline friends \"What do they think about while we are away\" \"How do they keep themselves entertained\" and \"Why do they hate me\". Mr Chung has dug deep into the mind of the Felis Catus in search of such answers and revealed them to us throughout each unique handcrafted level \"because they hate us\". Perhaps it was stale water or tasteless food or maybe it was our poor choice in household furnishings, all questions become clear as you play as a simple household feline overcoming overwhelming odds... by wrecking everything in the house With tight controls and an amazing soundtrack the immersion is so \"life like\" you yourself will put off by stale water or a sudden change of diet. In the end you will find that these fuzzy jerks are justified when it comes to venting their rage and in many ways Catlateral Damage is more akin to \"Hatred\" than say Katamari Damacy.

A bit of destruction, a bit of cats and you are in a good mood again. Purrfect. \nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\n[h1]What is happening in the game:[/h1]\nYou are a cat, which is pretty obvious. This game is an advanced simulator of most frequent feline behavoiur: you get to throw things from shelves, closets, tables, chairs, out of wardrobes, fridges and knocking down plants. In other words, you do what cats do best.\nThere are a few different game modes to prevent the game from getting boring.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]A perfect relaxation. You can play sandbox mode is you want some stress to get relieved or normal mode for time-limited destruction for skill sharpening.\n    [*]Apartments that you are ordered to put in mess are procedurally generated. They consist of several rooms (bedroom, living room, kitchen ...)\n    [*]There are a lot of different big objects (bunk beds, wardrobes, tables) to push smaller object (pillows, coffee cups, plates, chlothes) from.\n    [*]There are powerups that makes you jump, run and punch better\n    [*]Random events like disco lights\n    [*]You can unlock different cats (like skins) by knocking down cat pictures from the wall\n    [*]Achievements for improved and a bit more meaningful gameplay\n    [*]You can punch from left and right using two separate buttons\n    [*]You can meow (F button)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Apart from knocking things down, there's not really anything else you can do. Not that this game advertised that it can do anything else. Yes, there are different game modes, but they're not [i]that[/i] different.\n    [*]This game is fun, yeah, but not $10 fun. Wait for at least 50% discount.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Suggestions:[/h1]\nLower the price, that's pretty much all that can be done. This game is great when it comes to messing up an apartment and nobody expects it to do anything else. But it's really not worth that money.\n\n[h1]The final verdict:[/h1]\nGreat game, great relaxation, great fun. Not very many different things to do, but the game is made well and you don't easily get bored of it. It's fun, but the price is high.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

You just end the level and the results appear on screen, that's it. I also see a few missed opportunities. If you as the cat can actually turn the faucet on, then why not flooding the room's floor?

In all honesty, I wasn\u2019t sure what I was expecting. Their video was pretty funny and definitely grabbed my attention. Ever wanted to be a cat and knock junk off of\u2026 well everywhere before your humans get home? Well, now there\u2019s a simulator for that! It\u2019s not a plain cat simulator, but it\u2019s a cat carnage simulator for sure.\n\nThere is not much to Catlateral Damage. It\u2019s simple premise of being a cat and knocking things off shelves pretty much describes the entirety of the game. There is an easy enough time-limit which does get a little hairy in the Museum (or Mewseum), but all things in time eh? That\u2019s Objective Mode in a nutshell where as Litterbox Mode removes the time-limit on your destruction and lets you run rampant throughout the rooms knocking things over at your leisure. Remember to pick up the power-ups to help you knock things over with more ease!\n\nThere are also a lot of unlocks to \u2026 unlock (for lack of a better word there) if that\u2019s your thing. You can get more cats to play as which basically gives you a different color paw to swat things with. There didn\u2019t seem to be a stat difference so I guess it\u2019s all up to color preference (I prefered Kratos I believe). Also, the pictures hanging off the walls are there for you to knock off and collect to keep in the out-of-game collection of funny cat pictures. It\u2019s nice to be able to go back to and giggle at them.\n\nScore: Meh...\n\nDid you want a cat simulator in which you knock things off the shelves? This game will deliver. It\u2019s a solid carnage simulator and seems to be created to just let the player have fun as a cat without breaking items in his/her own house. It\u2019s not overly challenging and has smooth controls so it could be pretty good for kids to better their hand/eye coordination. There\u2019s a lot of stuff to collect so if you\u2019re a fan of collect-a-thons, you may also find a home here. Maybe it\u2019s that it\u2019s too simple or that I just don\u2019t get it in its totality. Maybe I\u2019m just looking too deep for something that the game wasn\u2019t intended for, but I wasn\u2019t 100% sold on this.  Catlateral Damage is well made, but I didn\u2019t have that much fun playing it.

Catlateral Damage is simple but has its subtle nuances and charm to it. The goal is simple, knock stuff down and make a huge mess.

There is a sense of glee when you end up in a Meowseum and take down a 15 foot T-rex with just one swat of your paw. \nIs this a deeply complicated game? No. Is it a fun game? Yes. Last I looked that is what gaming is all about. Fun. \nWith procedurally generated levels, the designs, and layouts aren't always the same. With random events and secret levels it adds an even more satisfying reason to play this game over and over again. While the game seems easy enough at first. As you get deeper the timer gets smaller and the challenges become more specific. Hunting down one specific item in large supermarket. These are the things I enjoyed most about the game. Aside from the wanton carnage. Now there is ways to improve this game. Multiplayer would've sent this games appeal through the roof for me. I own 2 cats after all and 2 cats are always better then one. Adding more kinds of random events and even more crazy scenarios to put a cat in. Perhaps a level editor or platforming challenges. These are just some ideas. Nonetheless as a game.

There is an option to pick things up with your mouth (X on the controller), which also doubles as your meow button, you can simply push things with your nose (i.e. walk into them) or bat at them to the side (left and right trigger) or push them forward (LB/RB) with your paws, as well as crouch (B button). Knocking a new object to the ground adds it to your \"collection\". You can also knock cat photos to the ground to collect them as well. Sparkling items (scratching posts, toilet paper rolls, potted plants on the ground, etc) can be batted about a few times in return for upgrades, though the upgrades do not seem permanent for each cat, sadly (future update, maybe?).\n\nThe two game modes are Objective (knock X amount of points worth of objects to the ground in Y amount of time; bonus if you knock certain objects over) and Litterbox mode (a freestyle, relaxing mode). There are also secret areas to find, such as the Supermarkat (Go \"shopping\" within the time limit) and Meowseum (Break a certain dollar amount of priceless artifacts and displays within a time limit).\n\nCertain objectives (knocking over a certain amount of objects in certain modes, knocking over cat pictures, completing an objective with just your nose, playing on a \"Caturday\", etc) unlock new cats to play as.\n\nAll in all, a fun time, if a bit silly. Since there's no real end-state (no set story or stages) it's more of a fun time-waster, and also where the Katamari comparison breaks down. Also, you don't save progress in your Objective or Litterbox mode (it does remember how many houses you've trashed in Objective mode) so you restart at the beginning houses each time and work your way up to new random ones as you go.\n\nOverall, lots of fun, but maybe not worth the 10 bucks it currently is priced at (dependent on your penchant for wanting to be a cat, of course).\n\nFinal note: my wife calls it \"A-hole Cat Simulator\", if that makes any difference.", "timestamp_created": 1433093457, "timestamp_updated": 1433131737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632515", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16101977": {"recommendationid": "16101977", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998298163", "num_games_owned": 984, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463887343}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is insane.

That's pretty much the whole game. You can also unlock pictures of cats and more cats to play as, although they don't make much of a difference to jumping or swatting or bashing things off shelves. \n\nIt can be difficult to smash enough things to be able to move on to the next level, especially with the time limit, and if you knock a stack of objects over, like plates or towels, if they're still in a stack and only one touches the floor it counts as one item, you have to make the rest of the objects touch the floor too. Although a little annoying being close but not being able to move on, it's still fun. \n\nOne thing about this game is that I find the graphics make me feel a bit sick (maybe motion sick), especially as you have to spin around a lot to be able to knock everything over and rush around to do it all in the time limit. If it wasn't for that I would probably be playing this game more, but for now, I can only seem to handle one level worth of time without feeling too unwell. \n\nI do however like the fact the insides of the levels, although have the same general layout, have randomised items in them, and some things are in different locations, so you're not playing the exact same thing over and over, I found more rooms on one play through and in others there were less things to smash. I can remember areas and maps quite well and can get bored if games have the same paths and places to go if they're not big games, and although there's the same basic layout of the building every time, having different objects to knock over and a different colour pallet each time helps give it a little more variety.\n\nIt's probably a good thing each level is only a few minutes, I admit if a level was longer I could see the music start to get annoying, but in short doses it's fun and catchy and adds a playful mood to the game which goes nicely with its style and colours.\n\nWould I recommend this game? I kinda wish there was a more neutral option sometimes, I'd want to say yes and no. If you've ever wanted to knock tons of things over, look at cat pictures and be a little fluffball of [strike] destruction [/strike] fun, I'd say play the game.

Like rolling a katamari, the gameplay is simple but fun- it's oddly satisfying to swat things with your paw and watch them fall to the ground. There's a lot of different environments to play in, and the layouts never seem to be the same twice, though a lot of the same items are used. You can also play as one of about 20 different cats. I don't think your choice of cat affects your playing experience, but it's a nice choice.\n\nYou can collect power-ups to increase your speed, jump and swat power, participate in special events in the game's world for powerups or points, and collect special items to teleport you to event levels where the gameplay ranges from collecting items in a supermarket to destroying things in a museum. The low-poly aesthetic and chill soundtrack help make the game a relaxing experience.\n\nAlso, one of the collectibles is just pictures of people's cats.

The humans will pay for keeping me cooped up all day! \n\nCatlateral Damage is a new game where you play as a bored cat wreaking havoc on the everyday objects inside the house. We all know kitten thinks of nothing but murder all day so this game is a realistic simulation of what it's like to be a cat running around the house making mischief and taking care of cat business - knocking down items on shelves and tables, opening doors, hiding in boxes and tunnels, crawling above and behind everything and making a huge mess while you're at it.\n\nGreeting you at the main menu is a cheery jazz trio soundtrack which evolves to include some chip tune melodies and trumpets. There are two modes of play - Litterbox Mode and Objective Mode. Litterbox takes you to a level where there is no countdown timer, just tons of no-pressure fun. The objective mode has time and object objectives. The game begins with a cool camera flyaround to show off your kitty avatar and enter the first person view. The cel-shaded 3D graphics represent an array of common household items awaiting your destruction.\n\nUse a keyboard and mouse or a game controller to look, swipe at objects, run and jump around the house. There is also a nifty meow action that can also be used to bite and pick up objects when they are close to your mouth. The tutorial shows the controls onscreen which is handy as you get your bearings. After making your first mess, in true cat fashion, you hop in a box and take a nap. At the end of the quick tutorial, you know all you need to know and are given a summary of items you have successfully toppled as well as a breakdown as to which object you favored and what types of objects you went after most.\n\nAside from the Cat Training tutorial, each level is a procedurally generated house so you never know what you're going to get! On my first level, a timer runs while suggesting a total of objects and a couple specific objects to find and destroy. I found it hard to focus my attack on certain objects because it was just too much fun to knock everything down! While running around a random Event popped up and gave me a Force Field. This was fun because I gave my paw a rest and just ran into objects to send them flying. When an alert showed up for a New Upgrade, I had to hunt through the house to find the right room but was again distracted when I came across a Spinner Cat toy with a ball in it. I was mesmerized as I sat there swatting at the ball than spun around in circles. This is the life! When I got back on track and found my powerup, it was a box that took a couple of smacks then revealed a Jump Increase upgrade. When time was running out, the music increased tempo and the clock started flashing. I was having so much fun I'm not sure what my objectives were. Maybe I should go back to Litterbox Mode. Time to play again!\n\nWhether you need to vent your frustrations, assuage your OCD or just change your perspective, take some time out to attend to your cat business and play Catlateral Damage.", "timestamp_created": 1432790976, "timestamp_updated": 1432790976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16034681": {"recommendationid": "16034681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094432643", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499200504}, "language": "english", "review": "Super cute game, though motion sickness makes me suck at it... luckily there's a \"litterbox\" mode so I can knock stuff over at my leisure!", "timestamp_created": 1432789754, "timestamp_updated": 1432789754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463095", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16034412": {"recommendationid": "16034412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005162155", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432792849}, "language": "english", "review": "The most you can feel like an actual cat without surgery", "timestamp_created": 1432787633, "timestamp_updated": 1432787633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452900", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16034279": {"recommendationid": "16034279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015710197", "num_games_owned": 609, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 4803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516686681}, "language": "english", "review": "It's weirdly meditative - kind of like an indie take on Katamari Damacy, but with a way less harsh time limit.

There's something to just knocking everything all and about as a cat and causing massive chaos all over the place, even if the games variety doesn't stand up over a period of time. It's the perfect game in my mind to pick up on sale: or if you need a stress reliever right now, or ever really wanted to be a cat persay. There's some interesting elements for the genre like being able to open areas and the extra type levels like the super market, even if some of the areas are really really hard to get to. Overall, solid game that's worth taking a look at as a destresser tool. \n\n+:\n[list]\n[*] Lots of cat pictures. I mean, that's what you're here for in the end, right? \n[*] Good physics for what you want out of a game like this (not necessarily realistic, but goes to the side of fun)\n[*] Objectives add variety that the game desperately needed.\n[*] Love the findable missions like the supermarkat. \n[*] Randomly Generated Events keep things fresh and interesting. Particularly a fan of Moon Gravity \n[*] Like the openable cabinets and various items. \n[*] Great destresser. \n[*] Upgrades worth something. \n[/list]\n-:\n[list]\n[*] Some Strange jumping angles in particular with multi-layered overhead cabinets that can be frustrating to get to. \n[*] While it has procedurally generated levels, they start to feel the same rather quickly in terms of basic layout.\n[*] Really wish that one of the unlockable cats was a sabertooth tiger.\n[*] Not really much more then knocking shit over simulator.\n[*] Some reasonable bugs at times, like not being able to jump.\n[/list]\n\nFor Gameplay footage and more verbal first impressions: http://youtu.be/xWp40YM1AXc", "timestamp_created": 1432747747, "timestamp_updated": 1432747747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16027972": {"recommendationid": "16027972", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997012671", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497205349}, "language": "english", "review": "Much more refined and fun than the early access.

No, I won't say it in the first paragraph.  Just buy this game. I promise that your filthy perversion can happen in this game.  (And likely *WILL* happen in your first time playing!)\n\nOverview:\n\nOne Night Stand is a first person after-date simulator where you wake up with no memory of what happened the night before next to a woman named...  No, I'm not telling you her name.  You'll have to play this game and find out for yourself.  Thoroughout the game, the mysterious woman repeatedly leaves and enters the bedroom, and during that time, you can recover your own objects and dig through the woman's belongings like I'm sure you would do if you were ever in the same situation.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\n\nThe graphics are simple, yet I find them very aesthetically pleasing.  The mysterious woman is my kind of interesting, and it's nice to see that there's people left in the world who can make interesting women in games who aren't anime characters.  In fact, it's amazing that a game of this nature doesn't involve anime characters. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1223461452\n\nAll of the sounds are simple, but at least they sound realistic.  Music is limited, and while not good enough to be considered a soundtract, the few songs encountered do set the mood for the game.\n\nPositives:\n\nThis game makes a great conversation piece to where you can show off one particular action, and boast to your friends \"hey everybody, I just stole a woman's panties, put them on, and got caught wearing them\"!  But I'm pretty sure you're a filthy pervert who enjoys doing something like that.  Although it isn't hard to make up interesting characters, I do appreciate that... The mysterious woman (did you think I would really say her name?) comes across as interesting. (Believe me, I know it isn't hard to make up interesting characters; I've been doing it for decades in both video games and in tabletop RPG's.)\n\nNegatives:\n\nI'm sure anyone who plays this game is used to seeing short games with many choices for alternate endings in the many visual novels and short length casual games all over Steam for about five dollars.  While it's something to be expected, it doesn't excuse the fact the game is too short. Although I wasn't expecting an ending where the player gets married to...  The woman.  (Ha, fooled you!)  I was hoping for at least one romantic ending.  I would have been satisfied with that, even if there was no inference that you and....  Her, meet again and have sober sex.\n\nConclusion:\n\nJust like any other minuscule game with a large amount of endings, a player will probably put in a few hours so they can get all their card drops, and then get burnt out, and try again a few months later...  Unless they really do have that many friends to show that method of playing that involves getting caught wearing another woman's panties, then you're going to be doing plenty of showing-off!  But don't just stop with your love of being a panty boy.  Go and get this game.  Then see how many different endings you can get the first time around before you get quickly burnt out while you're waiting for all your card drops to come in, then forget about this game for a few weeks, but you'll be back eventually to see what other endings you can get when the need for an easy-peasy casual game strikes between difficult situations in FPS and management simulation games.", "timestamp_created": 1520256737, "timestamp_updated": 1520374611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40445387": {"recommendationid": "40445387", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966036503", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517694587}, "language": "french", "review": "One Night Stand est \u00e0 mettre dans la cat\u00e9gorie \u00ab  petit jeu atypique \u00bb.\nLe jeu propose une exp\u00e9rience rarement mis en avant dans les jeux vid\u00e9o.\nSi vous comprenez la langue de Shakespeare et que vous aimez les jeux \u00e0 fort pouvoir narratif, le titre de Kinmoku pourra bien vous occuper pendant une petite soir\u00e9e.\n\u00c7a vaut le coup d\u2019investir les 3\u20ac et encore davantage si vous attendez de voir le titre en promo un de ces jours sur Steam\u2026\n\nLire le test complet sur Caf\u00e9PC : https://www.cafepc.fr/test-one-night-stand-pc", "timestamp_created": 1519760643, "timestamp_updated": 1519760643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40428024": {"recommendationid": "40428024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031909167", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519687425}, "language": "russian", "review": "170 \u0440y\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0430\u043b, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441.", "timestamp_created": 1519695942, "timestamp_updated": 1519695942, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40365728": {"recommendationid": "40365728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166292169", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519453343}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a short, but fun game with the premise that you (a guy) wake up in strange woman's bed after a one-night stand. You have a short time before you will have to leave and what you do during that time is up to you. You can be nice, inconsiderate, try to make conversation, or snoop through her private things. At the end of each round you get the option to try again doing different things, with up to twelve possible main endings and a number of additional achievements. There is very little randomness, so the difference between playthroughs is all based on your actions.\n\nI love how there are not infinite possibilities: in many \"dating sims\" you can achieve any possible ending based on your actions. Here, the other character has feelings and thoughts, and you're both hungover, so there are limits to what you can achieve. Furthermore, while you can learn a lot about her based on the various playthroughs, you only learn of a fraction of her personality with hints of much more underneath. These limits actually make small achievements feel very meaningful [spoiler]Like when she asks for your name or plays a song for you. [/spoiler] Furthermore, there are mysteries (and perhaps hints of something darker) [spoiler]Did she drug me? Or maybe she has alcoholism/depression? Is her brother alive? Who came to the door? It seems likely that everything's innocent, but is it?[/spoiler].\n\nThe first few times I was able to really stay \"in character\" and feel like I was part of the story. But after that, completionism took over and it just kind of felt like a puzzle where I was trying to unlock all the different endings. This was unfortunate, because the ending with the most punch was the one I unlocked last, and by that time I was skipping through dialogue and not really as emotionally invested. I think I would have preferred more randomness in the dialogue and scenarios.

Gameplay mostly consists of selecting choices from branching dialogue trees and scavenging the room for clues whilst the girl is away. Despite its simplicity, the game had me coming back for multiple playthroughs until I had investigated every item and unlocked every ending. \n\nThe girl herself is an interesting and well written character, and I found myself wanting to learn more about her. While the game never completely satisfied my curiosity, the items strewn about the room and the information the girl offered in her conversations with the player character helped me imagine what kind of person she might be. \n\nBecause much of the dialogue remains the same regardless of your choices, after playing the game through a few times, it can become tedious clicking through the same conversations over and over again, although the fast forward feature mitigates this problem.\n\nIt's interesting to see the diverse ways in which the situation can play out, and unlocking all the endings will reveal a secret message that may change the way you see the characters. However, some mysteries remain unsolved, and if you're looking for a tidy resolution, this game isn't going to give it to you. \n\nShort, sweet, surprisingly heartwarming, and pretty funny at times, One Night Stand is much more than just its unique premise.

The animations/illustrations are very good, well done with believable and responsive actions from the female character - although it's drawn, the characters and objects you interact with feel 'realistic'. The characters are as personable as they could be in a 'morning after' interaction so, whilst things are certainly awkward (as they would be IRL in that situation), following certain paths in the conversation enables you to get some interesting information about the woman and to start to develop a real-feeling connection with her. In general, the whole concept is interesting, and this game does make you think a bit about a situation you may/may not have been in IRL and about human relationships more generally.\n\nThe game is however pretty short and repetitive if you're doing it several times over - in the end, I just wanted to get all the achievements so I found myself skipping through most of the dialogue to try out different combinations of answers and find all the endings. Even doing that, I've only managed to accumulate a couple hours of play time, and I think if you're just having a look at this for fun it'll probably only occupy you for half an hour/an hour. Mind, if you do take your time to try find every ending though there is a great plot twist revealed which completely changes the way you look at the situation you were just in (or at least it did for me!).\n\ntl;dr Intersting concept well executed.

It takes a familiar scenario and delivers the most entertaining morning after you've ever had. \n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack was carried mostly by sweet little guitar riffs that were a little too subtle for my liking. It gives a feeling of mystery but goes completely missing during dialoge. I have to add that it actually made the intentional awkwardness feel more authentic this way but some sort of alternative riff for those parts would have helped elevate the dialoge.\n\nGameplay\nAs with any VN you do a lot of reading in this game. The difference is that you have the opportunity to investigate your surroundings to use for conversation later which in turn changes up the dialoge. This gives you some surprisingly varied play throughs. I found it to be a much better approach than the traditional conversation pathing you normally see in a VN. Rather than each choice leading to an absolute path hidden behind multiples of text you've already experienced. You can dig up alternative dialogue which usually indicates you're onto a different ending but still end up in one you've already experienced. This led to me not useing the skip button as often as I would in most other VN's that I have played.\n\nStory\nThis game doesn't have much of a story. It just presents you with a scenario. One that plays out with a lot of humanity and takes the story to more realistic territory. In addition, there is a mysterious girl's bedroom for players to explore in order to learn more about her. The kicker is that the game only feeds you bits of the person she could be. Suggesting a lot but ultimately leaving the decision up to the player. Very effective stuff.\n\nGraphics\nThe art style of the game is charming. It's not the most cutting-edge but it just reinforces that authenticity in the game. I was expecting the character to be just still images that transition from one another but the way it is done here, although essentially the same has been presented in such a way that it distances itself from the traditional approach VN's normal take. There is a mix of actual animation between the image still transitions and that helps breath life into it. The washed out water color look suites the game. The only complaint is that the indicator in the main menu that is supposed to show which option is highlighted contrasts with the background way too much and makes it difficult to tell what option you are selecting.\n\nThis game is very down to earth and light hearted with some great endings and interesting dialgue and presentation. The price for the game is more than fair and honestly for what you get it's great value. I whole heartedly enjoyed the game and would recommend this to anyone even slightly interested in VN's. I think it's done better than most even if the story may not be as robust. If you're interested by the game in any way, I'd say that's more than enough justification here to buy it and again for such a cheap price it's hard to see anyone walking away dissapointed.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1511463429, "timestamp_updated": 1512613782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37094860": {"recommendationid": "37094860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000760544", "num_games_owned": 555, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481381588}, "language": "english", "review": "While it won't take you long to get through this game, you might find yourself impressed with all of the finer details along the way.", "timestamp_created": 1511449292, "timestamp_updated": 1511449292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36964708": {"recommendationid": "36964708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058090865", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511486016}, "language": "schinese", "review": "nice game", "timestamp_created": 1511420967, "timestamp_updated": 1511420967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36899647": {"recommendationid": "36899647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139094829", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502245083}, "language": "english", "review": "It is awkward that after you tried different possiblities of conversations and finally got swept out from her house.", "timestamp_created": 1511403672, "timestamp_updated": 1511403672, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479452", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36808255": {"recommendationid": "36808255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283270395", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511385187}, "language": "english", "review": "I was expecting a typical visual novel with an different illustration/atmosphere style from the common anime, but instead, [b]I got friendzoned in a videogame[/b].

You awake next to a naked stranger in her bedroom, with a terrible hangover and no memory of the past night. You'll have various short conversations with the girl, while both of you try to figure out how to deal with the situation. Occasionally she leaves the room, which gives you an opportunity to look around and discover things to talk about.\n\nCharacters and dialogue are realistic and believable, and the game handles its subject matter in a sensitive, mature way that felt refreshingly different from many other visual novels I've looked into. The game also does an excellent job in remembering even small details of your decisions, and having them affect the following parts of the conversation. Your choices really do matter a lot, and the game features 12 substantially different endings.\n\nThe game's graphics consist of simple, slightly animated drawings in mellow colors. I found that a very welcome change from the anime aesthetics of most visual novels. The soft visuals and the soothing music combine to a very pleasant aesthetic that turns the game into a particularly relaxing experience.\n\nOne Night Stand is a fairly short game - it is, in an interesting case of poetic justice, a game that can easily be experienced in a single night, with all its facets and all different endings. The shortness makes it easy and less tedious to hunt for endings one may have missed so far. The game's price reflects its shortness appropriately.\n\nI wish there were more visual novels with the courage to break the narrative and artistic conventions that most games in the genre seem to adhere to.

To get the full scope of it, you need to play it several times and that will, obviously, be repetitive. There is no voice-acting, so you'll have to read, which I know some people hate. Those are probably going to be the biggest turn-offs for some people, so I figured I would get them out of the way.\n\nWhat makes ONS great is how much it does with so little. Play-throughs go quickly, you're going to read the same dialogue a lot (there is a fast-forward option, though), it all takes place in one room with three screens and there's not a ton of objects to investigate. Still, the game builds this woman, who you know nothing about, into a real character. That's impressive. Most games can't manage to create a good, round character even with so much more time. There's nothing amazingly intriguing about her. She's normal, but you still want to know more. You still like her.\n\nThe writing feels very natural, very real. It's an awkward situation and it's written like that. It doesn't try to be more than it is. It's not going to tug at your heartstrings. There's multiple endings, some of them are funny, some have you being a dick or weirding her out. I felt like most of them were worth going through the game multiple times to check out.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the art and the animation of your mystery lady. The rotoscoping looks fantastic, but my favorite thing is how natural the character seems. It's my favorite thing and it's small stuff. The way she talks with her hands, little shrugs, she averts her eyes when things get awkward or plays with her hair. The way her mouth moves or the changes in her eyes. \n\nEvery one involved in this project deserves tremendous praise. It's not for everybody. You need to be able to enjoy games that don't have a lot of gameplay, that are narrative based. And the repetition does get tiring.

That seemed a better way of saying it than, 'Never remind me of this, for fear I should stick a knife in you.\u201d \u2015 Mary Renault, [i]The Persian Boy[/i][/b]\n\n[i]One Night Stand[/i] is the first VN coming from indie developer Kinmoku. It is a short and completely awkward experience as it should be. This short story holds plenty of mysteries, most sadly left unrevealed. Would it be worthy of your 3 dollars? Well, I'd say to grab it on a discount, 'cause even though it is a nice little game, there are quite so many 1 dollar games out there with more content and some more decent story revelations.\n\nWe wake up with the buzzing of our phone, mostly hammered from the other night and left with an impending hangover. Our buddy, Gary is apparently a bit angry at us, claiming that we ditched him pretty hard last night. When we regain our sense of sight, we notice that this is not our room. Wait, this is not our bed and we have no idea who would be the ashen blond girl sleeping beside us. Who is she? What actually happened the other night? What to do in this most awkward of situations?\n\nI do not know if anyone of you ever had a one night stand, but if enough alcohol is involved, this game presents a pretty good example of how you can end up by the morning. From that point onwards, you gotta make a choice: either to stay and endure an ordeal of gathering the pieces of what happened and try to attach some meaning into the messy results of animal instinct; or gather your belonging, take a run for the door, dodging any awkwardness that may be attached to a probable conversation and hope that your choice won't be making you a despicable human being. It's not an easy position, is it? This short game presents you this exact dilemma.\n\nFrom the moment you wake up, you are to make a series of choices, in this alien environment. There is no actual mission here. Depending on the way you decided to deal with this situation - you may run for the door, engulf in the awkwardness, act like a pervert or actually become interested in the girl - you'll pursue a different playthrough and get a different ending. The game harbors 12 different endings, and adding the option to skip already read text, you can complete the whole game within 2 hours or so.\n\nNow, the main problem with the game is that it lacks some probable content. Main mysteries of the game are never revealed, like her actual name, her relationship with her brother, whomever was writing her on FB, what exactly transpired between her and Gary etc. You gather some clues, act on instinct and go for an ending as heartwarming or as shameful it can be. Sure, the relationship between two parties is already superficial and it is more than logical that most details would not be revealed. But I'd love to see at least an epilogue to fill the blanks presented during the gameplay. I don't know, a \"they ended up like this\" scenario at least, or a new detail about her past revealed in each playthrough. That would be intriguing. As it is, it is not a bad game but it feels like the plot revelation is left halfway to maintain mystery. It might be just me, but I'm allergic to those.\n\nThe artwork and animations are really basic yet beautiful, by the way. They are presented in flowing sepia tones with pastel shade coloring. Our \"lady friend\" seems lifelike with all her emotions, her awkwardness, her sensuality and her fear that this might be a mistake. You can read all these from her body language and mimics. Soundtrack is rather nice, but I wouldn't call it exceptional.\n\nComing to the last word, [i]One Night Stand[/i] is a nice, short and semi-satisfactory VN - and a considerably well-done work for a first trial in the genre. I do expect to see more works coming from Kinmoku in the future.

Previously seen dialogue can also be skipped, making later play-throughs more streamlined.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for playing!\n\n"}, "30503721": {"recommendationid": "30503721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294456501", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488967451}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good d-bag simulator.", "timestamp_created": 1489478669, "timestamp_updated": 1489915012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30493902": {"recommendationid": "30493902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201101307", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488787799}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud3c9\ubc94\ud558\uac8c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud558\uc790\uba74 \ub9cc\ub0a8\uc758 \uc560\ub9e4\ud568\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub9fa\uae30\uc758 \uc560\ub9e4\ud568\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\uc57c\uae30\uac00 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uac8c \ud758\ub7ec\uac00\ub294\uac8c \uc990\uac70\uc6b4 \uac8c\uc784.\n\ubb3c\ub860 \ubc30\ub4dc\uc5d4\ub529\uc744 \uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4\uba74 \ub9d0 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \ubc30\ub4dc\uc5d4\ub529\uc774 \ub098\uc628\ub2e4. \ucc3e\ub294 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uac00 \uc3e0\uc3e0\ud568.\n\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub3c4 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub4e4\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc815\ub9d0 \ub204\uad70\uac00\uc758 \ubc29 \uc548\uc5d0  \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ubd84\uc774 \ub4e4\uac8c\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \ub354 \uc88b\uc558\ub2e4,\n\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc0c1 \uc870\uae08\uc740 \uc5b4\uc0c9\ud55c \uae30\ubd84\uc774 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\ub294\ub370 \uadf8 \ub290\ub08c\ub9c8\uc800 \uadf8\ub2e4\uc9c0 \ub4e4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \uc544\ub291\ud558\uace0 \ud3ec\uadfc\ud574\uc11c \uc77c\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubcf4\ub824\uace0 \uba87 \ubc88 \ub354 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud588\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1489425632, "timestamp_updated": 1489425632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30487610": {"recommendationid": "30487610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038668712", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489396934}, "language": "english", "review": "Moral of the story - Don't snoop.\nNice game though.

There\u2019s something joyous about escaping into mystical lands, having adventures and experiencing stories that are far away from the troubles and difficulties of everyday life. To come across One Night Stand, then, with its appealing pencil-drawn style telling the story of waking up in a stranger\u2019s bed with no memory of the night before... Well, it\u2019s not exactly the sort of escapism that most would be expecting. Yet surprisingly - It works.  \n\nIt\u2019s your first play through of One Night Stand that stands above and beyond the rest by a considerable margin.  The distinct unsettling feeling of not knowing where the conversation might turn next, the moments of awkwardness that filter through your screen and make you squirm in your chair, and the delicate selection of your next choice of words in a desperate bid to avoid disaster\u2026 They all combine to make quite a memorable experience, something that those who have found themselves in such a situation might be able to relate to (I myself am much too boring to be able to do so). It\u2019s this unique 20 or so minutes that honestly almost warrant the price of admission alone.\n\nThe first few repeat playthroughs also stand up fairly well, as you investigate what you missed the first time and seek out those endings that may not end up falling in your favour. There\u2019s some honestly funny moments to be uncovered (The best involving a certain pair of underwear\u2026) and the girl is so charming and well written you sort of want to keep going just to find out more about her. The appeal and enjoyment of doing this dwindles rapidly, however. As the same conversations are trotted out over and over, you can easily start picking apart the conversation tree; noticing how some of your choices never really matter, how many changes in behaviour can still lead to the same conclusions, and so on.\n\nIt\u2019s a god send, therefore, that you\u2019re able to fast forward through what you\u2019ve already read previously, but the process of trying to get the last few endings still turns into a bit of a chore. It doesn\u2019t help that some of them require a very precise set of choices to unlock - one ending in particular is a horrendous culprit of this, and a fair portion of my time with the game was as a result of wearily abusing the save system to try and obtain it. Some of the achievements try to pad out the lifespan a bit longer, but the chances are you\u2019ll be too fatigued by the repetition of everything at that point to care.\n\nOverall, though, despite the minuscule lifespan, One Night Stand is still worth the brief amount of time you have to give to it. It\u2019s a perfect example of the fact that an indie game made by a single person doesn\u2019t have to be like so much of the sludge that fills up Steam nowadays \u2013 it can be endearing, heartfelt, and a simple pleasure to play.", "timestamp_created": 1488905806, "timestamp_updated": 1488905806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

cute moments and a charming aesthetic and animation. You play as a young man who wakes up with a hangover in a stranger's bed and no memories. You're then tasked with examining the objects of her room for clues and small talk as she periodically engages you in conversation.\n\nThe game makes for a good read that doesn't overstay its welcome, making it ideal for someone who wants to kill a little time or cleanse their gaming palate a little. That said, it does make it rather brief and anyone looking for more investment will find it lacking in content. People looking for 100% completion, or to experience all the story, will also probably find certain segments repetitive after going through them so many times.\n\nUltimately it's worth the asking price, if only for the art style.

Ce jeu est une tr\u00e8s courte narration d'un mec qui se reveille chez une fille qu'il a bang la veille mais impossible de se rappeller de quoi que ce soit tellement il \u00e9tait bourr\u00e9. Ce sera \u00e0 vous de cliquer sur les objets cliquables dans des ordres differents pour comprendre ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 et faire naitre des situations pour se prendre la friendzone, ce qui cloture le jeu de 3 minutes.\n\n M\u00eame si le coup de crayon est assez joli, le contenu est tr\u00e8s pauvre. Il n'y a qu'une quizaines d'illustrations o\u00f9 sont ajout\u00e9s seulement 30 objets \u00e0 cliquer.. En gros, si vous avez regard\u00e9 les images si dessus, il ne vous reste plus que 5 illustrations \u00e0 decouvrir. Le scenario lui aussi est assez limit\u00e9 car m\u00eame si le concept de \"gueule de bois + black out+ reveil chez une inconnue\" laisse place \u00e0 un eventail de possibilit\u00e9 loufoque; il est utilis\u00e9 ici pour meubler les maigres petites bulles qu'on nous sert. En d'autres termes, on se retrouve avec les classiques \"je n'ai aucun souvenir\", \"j'ai mal \u00e0 la t\u00eate\", \"il est quelle heure?\", \"comment tu te sens toi\"; bref tout ce qu'on a vu et revu dans tous les films du genre. \nLes 30 autres secondes de conversations ne s'\u00e9toffent pas plus car la fille reste sur la defensive, un poil evasive et reagit au premier degr\u00e8s comme la bonne Social Justice Warrior de base si vous vous \u00e9loignez un peu si vous r\u00e9pondez un peu \u00e0 cot\u00e9....\nMais le plus frustrant est que peu importe vos choix, peu importe le fait que vous restez vous aussi evasif ou gentleman parmis les 3 r\u00e9ponses propos\u00e9es dans les dialogues; vous finirez quand m\u00eame par avoir la m\u00eame fin \u00e0 chaque fois: la meuf vous dit qu'elle se sent pas bien et vous vous sentez oblig\u00e9 de partir. Vous avez quelques tr\u00e8s rares combos pour faire des choix de psychopathe pour qu'elle vous mette \u00e0 la porte directe mais encore une fois, ces choix sont trop rares et trop lin\u00e9aires.\n\nCe jeu aurait pu \u00eatre tr\u00e8s bien si les dialogues avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 riches et profonds, qu'on puisse faire des choix digne du plus grand tar\u00e9, que les objets cliquables soient plus nombreux, qu'il y'aient des fins alternatives comme se mettre en couple avec la fille par exemple ou encore laisser place \u00e0 d'autres pieces  mais l\u00e0 on est clairement sur un echange digne de deux collegiens qui reviennent du CDI et qui souffrent de phobies sociales.\nLe jeu est integralement en anglais, sans aucunes voix (c'est positif pour les sourds, hein oui).

Este es el caso de uno de ellos.\n\n[h1] RESUMEN [/h1]\n\"One Night Stand\" o en espa\u00f1ol \"Una noche sexual\", es un juego en el cual uno toma el personaje de un adolecente que esta con una chica en la cama sin saber que paso la noche anterior y peor aun, sin saber quien es. Para saber mas de lo que paso, tenes que investigar la habitacion de la adolecente para recapitular lo que paso esa noche anterior.\n\nSi hay algo por lo que compre este juego es porque tiene muchisimas variantes y finales sobre esta historia, asi que voy a decir los \"Pros\" y \"Contras\" de este juego.\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*] Si hay algo que me gustan de los juegos es que vos tomes las decisiones y no que el juego tome las decisiones por vos, como bien dije anteriormente, este juego tiene exactamente 12 finales pero con cientos de variantes.\n\n    [*] Yo compre este juego por $2.99 USD y no me arrepiento ni un solo centimo sobre este juego, vale cada dolar que pongas, porque la gran mayoria de los juegos (o por lo menos para mi) de 3 dolares o menos son juegos de Puzzle en 2D.\n\n    [*] La inmersion en la historia es algo extremadamente bien logrado. La banda sonora te hace sentir en la piel del adolecente segundo por segundo. Me impresiona que las historias que hay en este juego tranquilamente podrian pasar en la vida real. Es por eso que insisto, esta mas que bien logrado.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] CONTRAS [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*] Como dice abajo, este juego solamente tiene un idioma, \"Ingles\". No digo que este mal y que sea un problema, simplemente si alguien no sabe nada Ingles no creo que pueda jugar este juego a no ser que tenga \"Google Traductor\" o algo por el estilo.\n\n    [*] Si bien me encant\u00f3 la historia, me parecio muy corta, insisto, no creo que el precio este mal. Aproximadamente una \"historia\" dura entre 10 o 15 minutos, agregando que tiene 12 finales como bien explique. \n[/list]\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\"Kinmoku\" y \"Lucy Blundell\" hicieron un excelente trabajo con este juego.

This is not a game about trying to hook up with someone. It's not some \"Leisure Suit Larry\" kind of deal where your endgame goal is to see this girl take her top off or something. Instead, \"One Night Stand\" is about exploring the different possibilities of what can happen during a strange and awkward situation, a situation many people will find achingly identifiable. \n\nThis game is perfect for those who emotionally invest themselves in virtual interactions. If you love forming relationships in games like \"Mass Effect\" or \"Dragon Age,\" you will likely find something to love about \"One Night Stand.\" Though very brief, this game is insanely re-playable for those who are tortured by \"what if\" questions. \"What if I said this?\" or \"What if I did that?\" People who find that kind of exploration satisfying will get the most out of \"One Night Stand.\"\n\nThe biggest drawback is that \"One Night Stand\" forces its own sense of morality a little too much. You are literally punished in the story for doing things the game itself makes you feel like you have to do. The young woman you are interacting with also forms negative opinions of you based off of things she has no way of even knowing that you did. This is a frustrating thing to learn through multiple playthroughs. It would have been far more interesting if the game was less concerned with judging your moral decisions, and even less so concerned with punishing those decisions. \n\nA worthwhile play overall, though I sincerely hope another game improves on the ideas that \"One Night Stand\" presents.", "timestamp_created": 1486846413, "timestamp_updated": 1486846413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29731414": {"recommendationid": "29731414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048212729", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486298978}, "language": "english", "review": "One night stand is a charming little adventure that puts you in the shoes of a man suffering alchohol induced memory loss who happens to wake up in the home of a mysterious girl.

Good thing you will be playing a game to simulate this!\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nYou wake up with a huge headache, which soon becomes clear it is a hangover, in an unknown bedroom. What's worse? Waking up by a naked woman and having no idea who she is. Navigate through the situation to find out what happened the night before. Or to see where this one night stand can go for you. Will you run? Get kicked out? Or will something spark between the two of you?\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nOne Night Stand plays like a classic visual novel game. Clicking to continue text, choose between a set of prompts you will say, and what you will investigate. You can change this in the options for it to go automatically or in later playthroughs skip over text you already saw. There is a base of text that will always happen, but as you choose different items or what to say new things will appear. \n\nThe set up is basic, talk to the stranger and look around the room to examine items. Each time she leaves the less items you have time to look at. The items serve as a way to give the stranger depth to her, bringing it up might have her go in deoth but some things are too personal. While the other side is involved with peicing together what happened last night. Your actions determine the ending. Will you stay, be kicked out, or leave? Will you find out what happened? What is up with this stranger? The writing is very well written and realistic, not falling into the well common cringey or overly dramatic dialogue that is easy \n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe visuals seperate One Night Stand from most other visual novels. Bathed in a rich, soft colors and hand drawn visuals. Even adding in short animations to the stranger to give her more life. It is quite interesting, as it shows subtle movements the stranger does or give them movement by the moving outlines. Which also accompanies the objects as you hover over them to show you can look at them.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThe background music is simple featuring a guitar. Areas having a certain rhythm depending where you are with it silencing at the right moments. There are also other sound effects mostly going with the certain item, such as the shuffling of clothes, while the others are for talking and choosing the prompt. This can be a hit and miss depending on how you see the music and sound effects.\n\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\nThe first playthrough usually can take 10-30 minutes depending on how fast you read or decide on your prompts. Showing what how you will deal with it first before going into \"what could of happened\". Going for all of the endings can easily go on for over an hour. And even than you might want to do things you haven't done to see all the possibilities that could of happened.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n+ Animation\n+ Visuals\n+ Writing\n+ Story\n\n+/- Music/sound effects\n+/- Skip can be annoying at times (either being too slow or stopping sometimes)\n\nOne Night Stand is a delightful visual novel that stands out from the rest. The one thing I see being a problem with players is that nothing is really revealed about the stranger even though all these clues telling otherwise. I do believe this goes with the theme, as you don't really get to know the person. You're not involved with the stranger other than the one night stand so she doesn't want to go into her past. She doesn't want to have a stranger find out everything about her to tell others. It's just an awkward mess that they are trying to survive from. Even though I personally haven't experienced a one night stand, it was interesting playing a game about it. \n\nWith the price of the game and the well rounded gameplay, it is hard not to recommend One Night Stand.", "timestamp_created": 1485566039, "timestamp_updated": 1485566110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29525992": {"recommendationid": "29525992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055561961", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485551710}, "language": "english", "review": "This game captured my heart and mind.

Just leave!\" In the moment you are trying to state that you just are grabbing your stuff and will leave... she throws you out on the street - naked. Because you clicked her teddy. What?

Do not expect a full storyline full of events and characters. On the contrary, it is a very short experience (about 15 minutes) to be played over and over. Perhaps you are familiar with Save The Date, albeit both play very differently.\n\nThere is a specific structure that the game follows: investigation \u2013 the girl comes back, talk with her \u2013 investigation \u2013 the girl comes back, talk with her, for a few cycles. Several things can be found in the girl\u2019s room, from an opened condom package to various items related to her hobbies. A few play-throughs are required to find the time to investigate everything. The player can choose whether to snoop around to find out her name, or to be respectful and keep prodding to a minimum while asking her opinion on things. Or steal her panties and make a run for the exit! They are frilly and comfortable, who could possibly resist?\n\nSeveral efforts have been made to portray \u201cthe girl\u201d as a believable character rather than a cardboard trophy. First, the art style with drawn animations is very warm and lively, making One Night Stand stand out relative to other visual novels. Secondly, she is her own person, she is opinionated and she will not hesitate to throw \u201cthe guy\u201d out if he misbehaves. The course of the interaction will lead to several turns of events and endings, and an objective might be to find out as many endings as possible (do not expect any real sexual content).\n\nTrying to unlock the endings introduces the very few negative criticisms I have towards the game. As is thankfully often the case in Visual Novels, there is a fast-forward button. However, the fast-forward speed might still be slightly too slow. And then, reaching the different endings sometimes seems to rely on a few hidden parameters that are related to what the character thinks rather than directly the interaction with the girl, which makes the search for the last endings a rather repetitive trial and error process. I cannot be 100% sure about those hidden parameters, but that is how it came across to me. Some others criticize that there are a few loose threads that are not completely explained (well, one thing in particular related to her identity). Keep in mind that these are really minor criticisms, I was impressed by how cohesive everything was despite the amount of potential interactions and ways to lead the story.\n\nIn conclusion, One Night Stand is a very polished little game that is all about curiosity. Curiosity towards investigating items in the room, the potential endings, elements as to what happened the previous evening and finally a very simple yet believable character at the center of the interaction. The game avoids surprisingly well being patronizing or being pretentious, there is no lack of subtlety despite the suggestive premises. Very cheap, get it if you are curious and looking for an interesting slice of life.

I love the sound effects like the heartbeat, the details like the cover of DVD and the book, and the gameplay that makes it hard to figure out what Robin wants and what to talk about. Also, I like the fact that there are multiple endings, so I can see how it goes from getting kicked out to becoming friends with her. 10/10!

I think as the main theme goes, it very much achieves immersion in this real life circumstance. But as far as other endings go there isn't quite enough here. It\u2019s as if it the game designer felt as if there needed to be all these multiple endings, hinting at other paths with exciting dramatic consequences that ultimately are only wrong turns. Some things are simply a distraction and searching for the other paths feel ultimately frustrating and fruitless.\n\nThere is clearly a main story that works really well, and it is fascinating to learn about characters and their seemingly real lives. But there are clues here that lead you to believe there is a big secret that really distract from a amazingly grounded narrative. And as a minor note it feels like a pain to try and go for the other endings because there are so few choices and the choices you do have are obscurely connected to their subsequent outcomes. What I mean here is that there is a lot of boring trial and error before you figure out where else you can go. \n\nI think the other endings firstly should only add to the grounded story of two people akwardly making their way through this. And I should say much of this was likely intentional, a sort of play on people's expectations of games with multiple endings. As you can see the only real frustration I had with this game is the other endings. I just wish I had more time with these characters rather than shooting for figuring out how to activate the achievements. Play it a few times with a few ideas in mind but only delve into everything else if you really want to. \n\nOther than that check it out, we should explore more small moments in people's lives and encourage game designers to do so.\n", "timestamp_created": 1479445780, "timestamp_updated": 1479445780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26627648": {"recommendationid": "26627648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118642578", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479301699}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u96be\u9053\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u6559\u5b66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e48\uff1f\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1479290821, "timestamp_updated": 1479290821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26627068": {"recommendationid": "26627068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060140639", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480831210}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game with a great art style, One Night Stand feels more like a puzzle/mystery game than a visual novel in my opinion but that might just be me.

But unlike the anime games, One Night Stand has a system of choices that have consequences in the short term. Despite being short, around 20min game, with the variety of reactions and consequences of our acts. It is compatible with controller too. In the game you need to click to advance in history and at certain times, have to choose objects to have specific information, the same ones that caused different reactions in the future.\n\n[h1]Graphic[/h1]\nGorgeous. The game is all drawned, including the animations of the characters. It has a sepia color texture, looks like a Instagram filter, makes the gameplay pleasant to the eyes and comfortable to be played for hours.\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nAvoiding spoilers, I'd say that was the thing that surprised me most in One Night Stand. Taking into consideration that it is a very short game, it has a rather deep history, with something that can happen with anyone. You wake up after a night out on the bed of an unknown girl. Your objective in the game is to find out who she is, what happened last night and what you both gonna be in the future. The game has 12 possible endings, which gives you a lot of freedom of choices. Right away, it's quite challenging to get good endings.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nOriginal, it has ambient music only in the menu and in some key moments.\n\n[h1]Rate: 10/10 [/h1]\nShort game, but incredibly addictive.

You wake up in a strange bed next to a girl with no recollection of what had happened the night before although it quickly becomes apparent that you had sex with the girl in question.\n\nThe game that follows is a visual novel/ point and click game that sees you searching for clues as to where you are or who she is as well as choosing how you interact with the girl in question. It is difficult to do the game justice without giving away plot spoilers but let me say that the game has multiple endings and the decisions you make massively change the outcome of the narrative.\n\nMy first playthrough I decided to play it as realistic as I could and was squashed when I wanted to see her again. The second time I decided to be a jerk and got a pretty frost reception. I am generally not a fan of visual novels and I approached this one with that mindset. Needless to say, at the time of writing this review I have played through the game 11 times and have still not seen a few of the possible outcomes to the story. \n\nThe game is charming and very well written with the interaction with the girl in question appearing very natural and realistic in the given situation. I really cared about the outcome and genuinely felt hurt when the events didn\u2019t go my way. I do not think I have ever felt as engaged in a visual novel before let alone one that takes such a relatively short time to complete and that really is a testament to how well Lucy Blundell has put this game together. Now at about 10-15 minutes a playthrough some may see it is as short but the length is what encourages multiple playthroughs and leaves you desperate to come back and see what happened if you made a slightly different decision. In fact I actually stopped writing this review to go and have 1 more go\u2026. It gets in you\u2026\n\nStrangely the game that I kept thinking of when trying to think of a comparison was actually the \u201cStanley Parable\u201d rather than any other visual novel due to the short replayable nature and the fantastic branching paths.\n\nOverall \u201cOne Night Stand\u201d is an outstanding little story based game that will suck you in for a good few hours and really not let you go. On the face of it I did not think I would give a game like this suck praise but at \u00a32.50 or your regional equivalent \u201cOne Night Stand\u201d is an experience that you would be foolish to miss.\n\nThis review was taken from our original video review on our site: [url=www.thegametutor.co.uk] The Game Tutor[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1478746843, "timestamp_updated": 1478746843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564972", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26507927": {"recommendationid": "26507927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096067158", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482193935}, "language": "english", "review": "\"One Night Stand\" is a cute little multipath VN style game. It is very short, but for what it lacks in length it makes up for in choices and options within the game.\n\nI bought this game just this afternoon as a little time-waster. The price tag of \u00a32.50 with a nice stack of possible achievements, along with the pretty unique plot (as far as Steam games go) made this a quick purchase. A stab in the dark perhaps, but a curious one at that. \n\nThe art style is pretty nice- it's warm and dazy, it fits in really well with the overall tone and theme of the game. The character design of your new sleeping buddy is simplistic, but well represents the \"average woman in her early twenties\". \n\nI've played the game for around a total of 2 hours as of this review. I have completed several of the endings and have unlocked 52% of the achievements. Some people might find it tedious to repeat the story over and over to get all the endings/secrets, but hey, that's what the skip and save buttons are for. I personally am having fun trying the various options in different sequences to yield different results- deliberately looking out for new clues and word cues with each playthrough. And as someone who has never been in the position of the main character, it's pretty fun messing around and seeing what happens if you act like a total ass to the girl.\n\nI recommend this short game as a good time filler for anyone who likes getting achievements- certainly for the current price tag :)", "timestamp_created": 1478721007, "timestamp_updated": 1478721007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26503319": {"recommendationid": "26503319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212432551", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478633303}, "language": "english", "review": "One Night Stand is a nice little game.

Overall, it left me really unsatisfied as it hinted at something epic, only to finish mildly.\n\nPerhaps the lukewarm nature of this all-too-shortlived experience was intended(its a game centred around awkwardness after all) but I have doubts about that. The intriguing mystery as to what happened the night before and who the woman is never really resolved in any of the endings and seems to me to be tacked on to hold a player's interest.\n\nTrying to get to all 12 endings also starts to become boring as quite a few of the options given to the player all lead to the same outcome-- which is not very good form in visual novels IMO. \n\nTLDR; I would say not enough content-- not enough choices, not enough depth, even for its relatively low price. For a dollar or two more I could easily buy a game that lasts 12 hours or more while this took me 1 hour to complete all endings and left me dissatisfied and wondering what the heck happened (perhaps this game is trying to induce a morning after hangover effect in the player :p)", "timestamp_created": 1478622530, "timestamp_updated": 1478625259, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645505", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26490629": {"recommendationid": "26490629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093666838", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478591065}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Ever wanted to know what it would be like to have a one night stand?

One Night Stand answers all those questions and more in all the awkward glory.[/h1]\n\nCheck out the video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dublb-044ac\n---------\n\nOne Night Stand by Kinmoku is exactly how it sounds.A visual novel about waking up to a complete stranger and the repercussions that follows.\n\nI played the Game Jam version of One Night Stand earlier in October and, upon first play through I found the game to be short with no real consequence to decisions despite the fact that the game revolves around a \u201cone night stand\u201d\u2014an awkward moment that should have invoked some sort of emotion (guilt, sadness, loneliness, etc). You didn\u2019t feel as all close to the person whose eyes you were looking through despite their predicament.  The moment wasn\u2019t charged with tension as it should have been and so the game felt artificial; empty. Just one character going through the motions.\n\nIn the full release, however, I felt awkward and weirded out. It made me think of how I would respond or if I even would. The game has a much more charged dynamic and it feels almost real in terms of how someone might react to specific scenarios. I cringed, I made disgusted faces and my jaw even dropped. It's safe to say that the full release hits it home just how awkward a one night stand can be.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nIt plays like most visual novels, you have your controls off to the upper right that allow you to speed up the text, save the game, exit or edit the settings. Every time she leaves the room, you have a small window of opportunity to look around and try to piece together what happened and who she is.\n\nThere is a lot to click on but you have to choose wisely as the time in which she returns gets shorter each time she leaves.\n\nShe will ask you about specific scenarios about what happened and based on how well you searched her room while she was out, you might be able to answer her questions correctly. If you answer wrong, however, she\u2019ll let you know and you can restart and choose differently or play it out and see what happens.\n\n[u]Visuals/Sound[/u]\nVisuals are quite lovely. The motion capture-esque animation of the mystery girl is nicely done. From the subtle glances to the brushing of her hair over her ear, it feels very organic. It drove home the decisions you made when you can watch her expression change or note her body language shift.\n\nThe music I felt was symbolic. To me, there was a reason the particular sound was chosen throughout the game. I won\u2019t spoil it, but if you search for specific items and ask the right things, you may find the connection I did.\n\nThe music is just a series of strums on a guitar, a few riffs here and there. It\u2019s subtle and doesn\u2019t add nor take away from the experience. It chimes in at the right time and fades out in others while you\u2019re left to your own devices. The music is a nice touch on an already touchy subject.\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\nOverall, I enjoy One Night Stand by Kinmoku and recomend it if you like VNs, multiple endings and an ever changing story that may leave you to interpret your own thoughts. It\u2019s simplistic in its execution yet it can leave you feeling guilty or happy or even sad. Depending on how you ask questions, how well you search, a single playthrough can be anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour.\n\nI found myself playing through a few times to see what endings I could get. I got 2 so far. But I\u2019m already thinking of different ways to answers, different things to search and different ways to do things. That makes for fantastic replay value.\n\nNiko~\n\nFind this review and more over on our blog:\n[url=ntkgaming.wordpress.com] Gaming with Need to Know[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1478620333, "timestamp_updated": 1478643038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504440", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26479913": {"recommendationid": "26479913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144763629", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478553546}, "language": "french", "review": "ouiiii je suis dans les premi\u00e8res \u00e9valuations !

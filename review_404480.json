S/he is an avid player of [i]StarCraft[/i], a real-time strategy game. However, hitting it big on the [i]StarCraft[/i] scene is not easy, especially for a foreigner.\n\nThis game is a visual novel, a game that is entirely story-driven. Despite the number of choices that are offered, the game is ultimately fairly linear. I only came across one bad ending during my play, but it gave me an instant redo. I would estimate it would take around three hours to read through this.\n\nTo start off, I thought that the art in this game is pretty good. All of the background art especially is pretty detailed and nice looking. The character sprites are well-drawn and distinctive. There are only a few CGs in the game, but their quality is on par with the other art in the game.\n\nThe story is a little difficult to review. As said earlier, the main premise of this game surrounds the South Korean [i]StarCraft[/i] scene, certainly a niche subject for a visual novel. Now, I will admit that I know nothing about [i]StarCraft[/i]. [i]SC2VN[/i] includes a short introductory video for those in a similar situation, but it is extremely superficial. Because of my lack of background knowledge, I honestly had no idea what was going on during parts of the game, mainly during the actual gaming scenes. There is a glossary included that explains some fanspeak terms, but it is inadequate. If you are like me, chances are you are going to find this difficult to enjoy if you are not already familiar with [i]StarCraft[/i].\n\nEven ignoring that issue, I found the story to be rather boring. It mostly boils down to characters talking about [i]StarCraft[/i], characters playing [i]StarCraft[/i], and some side story about Mach recruiting [i]StarCraft[/i] players to form a team. The characters themselves are another frustration with this game. They pretty much run the gamut from boring to annoying. The main character, Mach, for example, is so obsessed with [i]StarCraft[/i] that even s/he admits at one point it is difficult for him/her to talk to people about anything else. How does such a broken person even function? The other characters are the usual clich\u00e9s like Jett, the tough team leader, Reva, the Spock-like analytical one who only speaks in technical language, and Stunt, the overly obnoxious teenager that already thinks he is the best. There is hardly a likable or interesting character in the game.\n\nOverall, though the art is quite good, other aspects of this game fall short with a boring story and weak characters. Perhaps fans of [i]StarCraft[/i] or eSports might get some enjoyment out of this, but if you are clueless on those subjects it is best to skip this one.", "timestamp_created": 1501125613, "timestamp_updated": 1502810541, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33805655": {"recommendationid": "33805655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065258097", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501888372}, "language": "english", "review": "It had a lovely story and well written characters, even if they were a bit trope-y.

But first, some minor background to the expectations I had.\n\n\nI've been playing visual novel games for several years. In a similar comparison, I've also played JRPGs for years. On that note, there exists a well-known engine called RPGmaker that has slowly built itself a notorious reputation in the world of game development. What I mean to say is: most RPGmaker games are middling (which is the nice way of putting it).\n\nMost does not mean all. Likewise, I've been around the block with the world of VNs (which is largely a dark and esoteric extension of the anime fandom); there exists a similar engine created called Ren'Py that largely opened up the accessibility of VN creation; particularly on the international front. \n\nOn that note, there are a great many Ren'Py novels that are... not great. Let me be clear that creating a VN of any proportion is an incredible feat. It requires a great many resources just to make something complete, many of which may not be accessible to most typical indie developers. That being said; VNs are not exactly a thriving business in the west due to low demand and serious quality control.\n\nTo create something memorable is an extreme challenge and worthy of praise. Sorry for all the exposition, here's what you actually came for:\n\n\nSC2VN is unique for its subject matter, but does not immediately differentiate itself outside of its setting. The strongest part of this novel is easily its readability and pacing. It is just the right length for a kinetic novel, the kind that doesn't offer meaningful choices and generally reaches a singular ending. The story quickly identifies key characters and differentiates them enough to stand out in the player's mind. \n\nWhile it does not necessarily offer the most original or in-depth story, what really draws you in is how seamlessly the novel ties realistic reprsentations of the Korean eSports scene with meaningful plot progression. It is made to be very easily followed along, even for the casual reader. Whether you are an enthusiast of Starcraft or completely oblivious to the franchise, the writing easily carries the player along and allows you to enjoy even the more exclusive concepts of its theming.\n\nTo make things even easier, it even comes with an in-game glossary to offer definition for jargon and some Korean vocabulary used throughout the novel. This is a really nice feature.\n\nA powerful thing to make your VN really stand out is good presentation. Small attention to detail, especially in GUI, can make a huge difference in my experience. SC2VN applies this concept quite well; one of the nicer touches is how character names (and their appearances to an extent) are color coded to increase distinction from one another. On top of this, an especially nice touch is how there is a small icon next to the names that identify the race that each character plays. Even tiny things like this can go a really long way!\n\nThe standard features of a typical VN engine apply, thanks to Ren'Py's great versatility. You have your history log, easily accessible by scrolling up with the mouse wheel. Main menu is right click by default, mostly just the intuitive stuff you'd come to expect from reading PC novels. You think I wouldn't have to mention this stuff, but then you'd be wrong. A lot of Ren'Py novels keep the default options like having to scroll through previous text one block at a time. For perspective: even Key's 'Little Busters' does text history like this. That novel is the GOAT, but holy-muh-convenience dude. Having an actual log come up that you can leisurely scroll through and cancel at any time is doing it right, plain and simple.\n\nNo event skip/navigation menu, but this is a superfluous feature for a novel of this length. For the most part, save states are more than enough to secure and recall your favorite scenes if you are inclined to do so.\n\nThe visuals and sound are an influential part of this medium. The musical score doesn't sound at all out of place, but it isn't all too memorable. It does borrow tracks and SFX directly from Starcraft, which is a great thematic element. The character art and backdrops exceed the par for quality in indie novels. While it's not the type of work you'd jump to frame on your desktop, it's more than enough to promote the game and appeal its presentation. The art style is also fairly distinctive from your typical 'moe bishojo meta' spam, which is refreshing to say the least.\n\nI've been mainly positive so far, which is intentional because the novel is good. While I definitely recommend it, there are faults that I'm more than willing to address.\n\nThe plot is probably the weakest part of the novel. The characterization is fantastic, but I have little to say regarding \nthe actual story. In the novel's climax, it unwittingly spirals into a very clich\u00e9d scenario between the two rival factions. There are some character tropes established throughout, but it would be unfair to criticize this without nitpicking as archetyping is a fairly common approach nowadays (why fix what isn't broken?). Despite this slight defect, the novel promotes itself off of its theme alone, which it does very effectively. An honest glimpse into the Korean pro Starcraft scene makes this more than worth the read on its own.\n\nChoices are strewn throughout, but are more to elicit player interaction than any sort of actual influence on the game's outcome. I'd say this is a plus and a minus, because it serves its purpose well (it explains Starcraft to you. T H E M I N G B O Y S). It is simply not a gratifying way to present choices that the player can easily reload and correct, leading to what becomes more of a roadblock than actual gameplay.\n\nFinally, the length is just okay. Keep in mind that this is a free to play game, so that says a lot. You can complete the read in about 2-5 hours, depending on how meticulous you are. For some, this can be a negative. You could say, it's too short. Finishing the novel is quick, but then it feels like a letdown when you find out that its over. Of course, being short means that the chances of you actually finishing the novel are extremely high, which is a very strong feature in the VN market. It also cuts out a lot of the obligatory 'filler' you see in a lot of Japanese VNs. It's important to note that this game isn't a dating sim, so the construction and focus is quite different. It would simply be nice to prolong the experience, but such is the reality of indie content.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nPresentation - A+\n\nMusic/Art - B+\n\nStory - C+\n\nCharacters/Setting - A\n\n+ Strong thematic elements throughout.\n+ Memorable characters.\n+ Unique Design\n+ It costs the low low price of \"nothing but your time.\"\n\n+- Length\n+- Depth of plot. It's effective and realistic, though. Satisfying conclusion.\n\n- Obligatory choice gameplay.\n- Shallow route deviations.\n\nOverall, this is probably one of the best indie VNs I've ever read by a long shot. It's a very impressive offering, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the sequel has in store (Yes, there is a [pre]quel in development. Look up \"Don't Forget Our eSports Dream\"). A great glimpse into the Starcraft eSports culture in a clean, easy to digest visual novel format. \n\nApologies for the long review. If you made it this far, congratulations.\n\nAnd if you haven't read SC2VN yet, then what are you waiting for? It's free, buddy.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1497587575, "timestamp_updated": 1497587575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32374173": {"recommendationid": "32374173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019711668", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497102028}, "language": "english", "review": "Thoroughly enjoyed this VN.

Despite this, I really, really, loved this game. In short, it's simply beautifully made. Yes, you are not given a lot of choices (to be honest you're barely given any), but the story alone makes it worth it. Dialogue, characters, storyline, everything is great and will soon get you hooked. Unfortunately, the story is short, about 4 hours, which will probably leave you wanting for more, and will definitely not bore you. \n\nI liked the story as it gave you some insight on the world of esports in South Korea, the country of esports. Also talks about how hard it is for a top player to find a team, how hard it is for someone to actually make a team even if with the right players. \n\nNot having played SC before hasn't made it less enjoyable (well, probably a bit, but not too much). There were some jokes, strategies, unit names etc., that I didn't understand or I had to Google (liquipedia helped A LOT, by the way), but in the end the experience was still very positive. The parts with SC games are very well explained and easy to understand.

You play as Mach, a foreign semi-pro trying to make it in eSports who soon learns that success in StarCraft takes more than in-game strategy.\n\nWhile I like the premise of the game, it is rather short and fails to live up to it's hype. The real dealbreakers though for me is the fact that aside from a couple of choices that would instantly lead to a game over is that this is basically a linear kinetic novel rather than a visual novel, as well as how the final \"battle\" was done. I was excited I was thinking of what kind of choices and strategies to do, then nothing. You win. That's it. The final scene would work well for the end of the first part of a VN but rather hanging as an ending.\n", "timestamp_created": 1489268722, "timestamp_updated": 1489268722, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30401363": {"recommendationid": "30401363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053209065", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 171, "last_played": 1516329967}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid plot, interesting characters, a protagonist with an internal conflict anyone could identify with, and an indepth peek into a world with a steep barrier to entry: this VN has all the working parts for a good story.

SC2VN is a great VN (Visual Novel), but unfortunately isn't much of a game in my opinion (ironic really, considering how its about esports). There are only a handful of choices that affect the games, but I feel the game compensates and even rises above those cons.\n[*]The artwork and art style is amazing; Beautiful, detailed, and very comfortable to look at.\n[*] The music was pretty decent, not something to brag about, but definitely nothing I can complain about.\n[*] Like I said earlier, gameplay isn't that big of a factor, but does enough to make me feel like Im actually controlling what happens; Though I'd appreciate more choices in future games.\n[*] The story is actually pretty great, Its shockingly accurate and realistic. There's intense tension during practices, fun jabs between characters like they've been friends their whole lives, some hints of romance, vengengeful rivalries, dramatic actions, stressful turning points, and strategic but friendly \"hang outs\".\n          \n(*Though about eSports, don't be afraid of missing something. Theres a ~2-3 minute \"tutorial\" about the background of eSports in the main menu; I mean theres even a damn Glosasary in-game if you miss anything. Regardless, its made to be comfortable and understandable by everyone: StarCraft fan, basic gamer, VN activist, or just any regular ol' joe.)\n\nOverall I'd rate a 9/10. Only reason its not a 10/10, is the \"game\" is way too short. I uinderstand its a relatively small developer team with limited resources and such conditions, and granted it took me ~4 hours to finish, but it ended right where the story was getting good;  right when you felt invincible, already subconsiously thinking \"Oh man oh man, now I gotta practice. Oh! what are we going to do now? Are we going to become famous? Can't wait to tell everyone back home. Should I talk to Mr. Yeon and thank him?\". But as you finish processing what just happened, you come to a slow, but sad realization: the game's already over and the credits are running. Like, DAMN!  \n\nBut anyway: 9/10 for outstanding characters (woo Reva <3), beautiful art style, intriguing, passionate, and relatable storyline, and great execution making it an enjoyable and understandable game for anyone to purge in.", "timestamp_created": 1487640769, "timestamp_updated": 1487640963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29931023": {"recommendationid": "29931023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034254695", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498791472}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent VN.

It would have been also great to have dialogue choices, maybe to form your own character a bit (to be an a-hole to people or to be nice, stuff like this), even if it doesn't have much effect on the ending. It was about characters and their interactions as much as about the competing so I really missed this. I know it's a VN but many VNs do it and do it well. \n\nAnyway, I enjoyed myself.

You also get to choose your gender which doesn't really change much, as there is no romance or along the lines like that. The characters were interesting, I have to say, and the game feels like a motivational thing to do your best in competetions, even if its at gameing events. Very user friendly i.e, press this button to save and such. You also make choices that ultimately changes the outcome of the story and depend whether or not you get a gameover. Didn't like that system; make one wrong choice and you get a bad end. Though one thing that really puts all these good points to waste is that it ended WAY to early. Like, when the story just got really interesting. It ended right at the middle of where a good movie or book should be. And it felt like all the progression you made just to get where you wanted suddenly didn't matter.

Look at The Last of Us, no one complained about the lack of a branching story.\n\nThis does capture nervousness and thrill of competitive sc2 pretty well, as well as the brutal realities of life. Once you get to a certain point in competitive gaming, its not fun anymore, as with everything else in life.\n\nThe story excludes many anime-styled deux ex machinas, with TEH POWA OF FRIENDSHIP overcoming all obstacles. I was overjoyed to find it missing. A story that sticks closer to reality makes it more relatable to the audience.\n\nCharacter designs and personalities were very well done.

As someone who played Brood Wars and SC2 a ton, I have to say it was filled with feel good moments, even if some of it was a little rushed and clich\u00e9.  It is really accurate with the terminology and general demeanor of the Starcraft scene for dedicated players.  I have to admit, I felt really nostalgic reading it -- always a plus.  Because it is relatively short, the story progresses at a totally unrealistic pace, but that\u2019s Ok in my opinion as I assumed that going in, and be considered a plus to some people who want a quick and good story\n\n  I am really torn between Positive and Negative, but I chose to go with positive because that is a reflection of the content, however I will explain my negatives.  After reading more reviews, I learned that this game was on Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vogue/sc2vn-the-esports-visual-novel/description) and raised $8,370.  \n\nAs copied from reviewer \u201cburning.phoenix\u201d, here are some ways it fell short of what it promised \n\n1. Game will be finished in 6 months: Failed. It took 2 years\n2. Game will have romance options: Failed. No romance options exist\n3. Game will have multiple paths: Failed. It's an absolutely linear story\n4. Game will allow you to choose training partners: Failed. There is no choice in the storyline. There are no \"stats\" to train.\n5. Game will allow you to choose which team house to train in: Failed. There is only one team house and it's simply a backdrop to an end-of-game scene\n6. Game will allow you to enter online amateur tournaments to test your character's skill: Failed. There are no tournaments in the game.\n\nIn the end I chose to give it a positive review, because in my opinion it was worthwhile and enjoyable content.  \n\nPros\n      -\tEasy to read / relatively short (1-3hrs depending on pace)\n      -\tNostalgic feel\n      -\tAccurate terminology \n      -\tLikeable characters (albeit one-dimensional)\n      -\tFree\n\nCons\n      -\tSituations are pretty clich\u00e9, as are characters\n      -\tOnly about 2 choices and both were pretty inconsequential \u2013 didn\u2019t care that much because I enjoyed reading it, but some people may want more options\n      -\tFailed to deliver on the Kickstarter end, which is important to me.

Not everyone will realize that right away. Second, you don't need to be familiar with StarCraft 2 at all to enjoy this Visual Novel. A great tutorial is provided at the beginning, giving the necessary knowledge about what SC2 is and how its professional scene works.\n\nI only knew about StarCraft superficially when I began this VN. I knew that it is very big in Korea and the best pro-gamers there are as famous as rockstars, with legions of fans. I knew it was like Warcraft 3, but in a futuristic setting. I've never been a fan of RTS, MOBA or anything of the sort. Yet, I was thoroughly captivated by this VN, because it's not about StarCraft and its technicalities nearly as much as it's about being a pro-gamer in general, with all the difficulties it entails. In fact, one could go as far as to claim this is a visual novel about trying to make it big in any sport, virtual or real-life. They could have substituted SC2 for other sports and the core aspects of the story would remain the same.\n\nThe characters are well-written and the dialogue is very witty and funny at times. The character's psychological conflicts and doubts are well portrayed, and their personalities are all very different. Despite this variety, I liked every single major character, which is a difficult thing to pull off and shows how much love and hard work went into designing and writing them.\n\nOverall, this ranks among the best VNs I've read (the best would be Katawa Shoujo, which is also free and also developed by a non-japanese team), and I highly recommend the play even if you've never heard of StarCraft.

The story felt kind of rushed or just made on bullet points. Random nobody goes to South Korea to get good and is constantly depressed? Check. Random nobody is our PC? Check. PC finds multiple high-profile eSport gamers and gets noticed? Check. PC impresses them, despite getting SQUASHED at least 3 times IN THE SAME DAY BY 3 DIFFERENT PEOPLE? Check. PC gets high-profile person X to leave their team? Check. The story just hits bullet point after bullet point and it sucks, because it hides some interesting issues and nuances with eSports and professional gaming. (e.g.: Accel, AKA: Anime-Chill-Bro, mentions that his Brood War team was forcibly disbanded by sponsors not paying and the players couldn't pool enough dosh together to sue for damages.)\n\nCharacters: 3/10 (Bad)\n\nAccel is an emotionless walking male cliche. Jett is the hothead bitch that hates life. Mach (the PC) is the \"I regret every decision I ever make\" idiot. Stunt is the brat with an ego that could rival the Milky Way Galaxy for size. Rega is the emotionless walking anonymous cliche. Bolt is basically Shadow The Edgehog, except eSports. It just hits cliched character after cliched character that make you wanna slam your head on the desk when you talk to them. Multiple times, while playing, I asked myself \"Now, WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE? We met them in PC Bangs and all of a sudden, we're acting like we're soul mates? WHAT?!\"\n\nArt: 6/10 (Fine)\n\nArtwork's fine. Nothing to write home about. Each character has a max of 4-5 poses each.\n\nSuspension of Disbelief Held: 3/10 (Bad)\n\nSo, let me get this straight. There are 3 HIGH-TIER PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS (Accel, Jett, AND Bolt) conveniently hanging out in the exact same PC Bang, that you just so happen to wander into (after probably passing at least 3-5 others) and they just randomly make time to talk to Mach, the random nobody? AND Jett just so happens to be bailing on her team, wanting to start one with Mach, besides only knowing him/her no more than a week?...I don't buy it.\n\nGameplay: N/A (No Rating)\n\nThere is none. It's a visual novel, you expected something to do besides stare at the same anime poses for 3 hours?\n\nOverall Rating: 5/10 (Average)\n\nPlay it once and you'll likely forget about it after. Potentially entertaining with some prophetic allusions to eSports nuances and issues, but the characters are cliched, stupid, and forgettable.

This is a really solid story about a foreigner trying to make her (or his) way in the competative world of Starcraft 2 leagues. The characters are entertaining, the conversations sound authentic, and I really got caught up in the story.\n\nIf there's a downside it's that this is a fairly linear visual novel, rather than one of those decision tree ones. There's a few decision points, but mostly they determine what characters say to you further in the tale.

Inhaltlich geht es um die E-Sport Szene in Korea, insbesondere im Blick auf Starcarft und Starcraft 2. Abgesehen von zahlreichen Informationen \u00fcber den Alltag der professionellen Spieler, der E-Sports Kultur und \u00e4hnlichen wurde das ganze auch noch in eine nette Story gepackt, in welcher der/die Hauptcharakter/in versucht selber ein professioneller Spieler zu werden und ein Team zu finden. Insgesamt fand ich die Story sehr gelungen und unterhaltsam. Es gibt viele am\u00fcsante Unterhaltungen, insbesondere das Trinkspiel in der Kneipe. Zudem sind die einzelnen Charaktere nicht nur relativ unterschiedlich sondern auch alle sehr glaubhaft, was die Geschichte nicht nur nachvollziehbarer sondern auch interessanter macht.\nSchade finde ich allerdings, dass es relativ selten Entscheidungen zu f\u00e4llen gibt und man von der Masse an Text teilweise doch ziemlich erschlagen wird. Zudem ist es bedauerlich, dass die wenigen Entscheidungen die man treffen kann keine wirklichen Auswirkungen auf den Spielverlauf haben. Lediglich 2 der etwa 7 Entscheidungen (hab nicht genau mitgez\u00e4hlt) bewirken ein fr\u00fchzeitiges Ende, wobei man dann sofort die Option erh\u00e4lt kurz vor der Entscheidung neu zu starten und die richtige Wahl zu treffen.\nGrafisch ist das Spiel meiner Meinung nach herausragend. Jeder Charakter sieht m\u00fchevoll und detailreich gestaltet aus. Nur die Hintergr\u00fcnde h\u00e4tten ein paar mehr Details vertragen k\u00f6nnen, da einige doch relativ leer aussehen. Allerdings vermitteln sie einen guten Eindruck von der Lokalit\u00e4t, wo sich die Charaktere gerade befinden und oft wird ein Gro\u00dfteil des Hintergrundes ohnehin von den Charakteren verdeckt. Zudem fand ich sehr positiv, dass die Szenen die sich um die Starcraft Matches selbst drehten, nicht einfach nur beschrieben, sondern auch mit richtigen Screenshots (zumindest sah es sehr danach aus) verbildlicht wurden.\nDer Sound ist ok bis gut, besonders gefallen hat mir der kurze Musiktrack vom VSL Hintergrund. Eine Vertonung der Charaktere w\u00e4re noch ganz nett gewesen h\u00e4tte bei der Menge an Text sicherlich des Budget gesprengt.\nEine Anmerkung noch zum Englisch des Spiels. Dieses ist schon etwas anspruchsvoller aber jeder der ein normales Schulenglisch kann sollte klar kommen und sich das wenige was er nicht versteht anhand des Kontextes oder der Bilder erschlie\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen.\nInsgesamt eine wirklich gute Visual Novel die ich jedem der mit dem Genre etwas anfangen kann empfhelen w\u00fcrde, ebenso jedem der sich mit E-Sports und/oder Starcarft besch\u00e4ftigt oder sich zumindest f\u00fcr die Thematik interessiert, zumal es kostenlos ist.", "timestamp_created": 1454254773, "timestamp_updated": 1454254773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20849283": {"recommendationid": "20849283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115986386", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453414510}, "language": "english", "review": "Great entry VN with suprisingly realistic story regarding the life of a Pro-Gamer.

After I finished it, I found myself wanting more. \n\nThe story works because it takes the familiar chase of a difficult dream and sets it in fresh territory, the deep and rich world of competitive E-Sports in South Korea. The setting and game are rich enough to feel like a lore all their own. As a novice to the game and scene, it was actually more interesting for me. I felt like I was discovering a fictional world... That just happened to actually exist.\n\nGive it a download.

My only two major gripes were technical ones - the Ren'Py engine (my poor, poor CPU core, also it doesn't register as a game so it's not accelerated property and it has terrible resolution and aspect ratio support) and the fact that the game sometimes had delayed text that would be skipped if you pressed the mouse button.

Anyone who has tried to play any game at a competitive level will be able to relate, though most people won't have experienced circumstances like those in the story. The beautiful artwork and flawless music tie everything together to make a unique experience.\nIn SC2VN you follow the adventures of Mach, foreign trash extraordinaire, as he takes a probably misguided trip to South Korea to determine, once and for all, whether or not he can go pro. A couple fortuitous meetings in the local PC bang- a cyber-cafe of sorts, to make a really poor analogy- get him into much more than he bargained for.\nThere are two things to keep in mind: first, SC2VN is free. All it asks is your time (approximately three or four hours of it), and I think it's worth the price. The characters aren't the most complex, most of them seeming fairly archetypal, but they're fun to hang out with and have nice dialogue, anecdotes and backstory tidbits. The antagonist didn't strike me as being very realistic, though, even compared to the protagonists. However, the rollicking, fourth wall-breaking extra material unlocked after finishing the story gives a bit of justification for his... intensity.\nSecond, note that as far as I can tell (after one playthrough) the VN is completely on rails. There's a couple choices that affect dialogue (maybe a few more than I give it credit for, come to think of it), but none of them do much. Further, [spoiler]a bit of tinkering reveals that Mach is guaranteed to lose his first two matches, and while winning the third is possible, failing to do so counts as losing the game and simply requires the player to go back and pick the right option. As for the fourth, I think failure is an option there as well, though just in the 'game over' sense.[/spoiler] Finally (big spoiler coming up), a certain set of options is fake. [spoiler]The opponent is guaranteed to strike first, before a choice is made, and Mach is guaranteed to win the set. Initially I thought it was a neat quicktime event- at this point Mach is facing a veteran who wants to stomp him, after all- but quickly picking an option simply led to the same events. Amusingly, the timer was still active, causing the sequence to restart a second or so in. Considering the reader is allowed to fail elsewhere,[/spoiler] I found this unacceptable. If you ask me, it's the VN's single great failing- though if one isn't bothered by the story's overall lack of choice this statement is high praise, considering what else could have gone wrong.\nAll in all, while SC2VN is much more something one reads than plays, its wonderful atmosphere and fun, inspiring story more than make up for its shortcomings.\n\"Strive to win, Mach.

I enjoyed my time in it and I didn't waste any money so why the negative review?\n\nBecause this game raised 8000$ on Kickstarter to deliver a VN that can be finished in around 3 hours that's completely 100% linear. Two choices in the game lead to a bad end and every other choice has almost no bearing on the story. The two choices take place during the SC2 battles where you select your strategy, and the game often has these \"battles\" that seem to be a sort of minigame (You get a popup regarding the known info of your opponent and his strategies) but they're literally SC2 screenshots with a single choice in the middle. Two of these choices don't matter and the other two have a possibility of a game over. The very final battle of the game was hyped up in the story with a lot of the characters giving you tips, info and advice to use against your opponent. I thought it was gonna be a multiple choice strateg-a-thon and took notes so I can remember all the info.\n\nIn the end, there was absolutely no choice whatsoever in the game's ultimate clash, contrary to nearly every main match up to that point. The game ends just as you become a full fledged pro gamer. (ie when you think it's about to get good)\n\n\nThat disappointment was the final motivation to write this review.The game promised so much more during kickstarter, it was almost gonna be [i]Pro Gamer Simulator 2015[/i] but it delivers on not a single promise:\n\n1.

Game will allow you to choose which team house to train in: Failed. There is only one team house and it's simply a backdrop to an end-of-game scene\n6. Game will allow you to enter online amatuer tournaments to test your character's skill: Failed. There are no tournaments in the game.\n\nThere's no reason in 2015 to take 8000$ and deliver what is essentially a free fan made game made in a free VN engine.\n\nKatawa Shoujo was made with literally Zero dollars by a bunch of autists on 4chan and each of that game's multiple paths is longer and deeper in every way than SC2VN's single one.\n\nSo really, the best thing I can say about this game is: It's free and a decent waste of a couple of hours.", "timestamp_created": 1447179722, "timestamp_updated": 1447180218, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 190, "votes_funny": 51, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607162", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18980161": {"recommendationid": "18980161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028190124", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447118988}, "language": "english", "review": "This was the first visual novel game I've ever played. Before I played this game I had a generally negative view of VNs. However, I also played starcraft and playing a VN that was about something I enjoyed also allowed me to give this game a chance.\n\nThe story is overall, very well crafted and thought out. Character development is good, and the game avoids useless sideplots and instead takes interesting paths in developing the main plot and the characters along the way. No character is wasted, or simply exists to fill some hole in the story. Each and everyone of them has a purpose and represents the many different backgrounds that Starcraft players come from.\n\nIt also reveals the amount of hardwork and drama that goes on in the professional esports scene. It's not all glamour and fun. There's hardwork involved, and just as much luck and fate as well. Some make it, but many do not. Overall one gets to see that it is a serious industry with serious people with serious dreams no lesser than your own. They have many of the same challenges that we face, like disapproving family, stiff competition, self-doubt, and uncertain futures.

You meet people and try to build a team. The story is well-written. Characters have consistent and distinct personalities. Occasionally you get into the main protagonist's head and get to see his deepest anxieties and fears. Also, when the protagonist is playing a SC game, you get to choose between some strategic options, which would most likely affect the game's ending.  Overall it's a very intriguing and unique game.

Your choices pretty much don't affect the story 90% of the time and the story itself isn't amazing either... BUT I still totally recommend it. Why would I? Well, there are some reasons:\n\nFirstly, for a free Visual Novel it's good enough in story, art and length.\nSecondly, even though you'll feel that your choices don't affect the story and that you're reading a book instead of playing a VN, I have to say that I was greatly surprised by how informative the VN was and how surprisingly easy I put myself into the character.\nLastly, the novel is well written and gives you a pleasent feel of satisfaction once you've finished it.\n\nIf it's a masterpiece?

There's some concessions of realism for the sake of story, but they don't hinder the game in any real way, and I found myself actually interested and even caring for/about the characters.\n\nThe interface is clean and responsive, and the medium is put to good use, as there's little things that happen, like interruptions which wouldn't be possible with a non-interactive book. Do note, however, that while you do get to make a few decisions here and there, this is less of a game than an experience, so the emphasis is on telling the tale of Mach and his/her journey. That's standard for many VNs, but it has to be noted, because this is a genre that will be new to many players.\n\nI personally feel it's a better experience with the female protagonist, as then the issues of discrimination and sexism are more relevant, as well as some of the bonds formed between characters feeling more true to life,  but it's not heavy-handed with either player choice.

Another year, another Call of Duty, an Assassin's Creed. Yet this year isn't just like any other for the world's favourite console football game. Most obviously, it's the first where EA Canada has really got to grips with Steam, resulting in a mass of changes to the graphics and animation engines. Some are merely cosmetic, and some so subtle as to be almost unnoticeable, but many have a genuine impact on the gameplay.\n\nLess obviously, SC2VN 5 seems to have moved away from the focus on ball control and the defensive game of SC2VN 3 and SC2VN 4, and towards a more dynamic, aggressive and - frankly - exciting style of play. If you played the last two  SC2VNs tired of getting mired in the midfield, bored witless by the slow, methodical pace, then you'll probably find this year\u2019s SC2VN the best since the glory days of SC2VN 2. It's still a game built by people hell-bent on reflecting every aspect of the beautiful game, but this time they\u2019ve remembered that SC2VN can also be fun. \n\nStructurally, it's pretty much identical to FIFA. The single-player campaign remains dominated by Career mode, where you can take either a player or a manager through several seasons, hoping to take your team to league and tournament success, or build a fantastic national and international career.\n\nIt's still basically a combination of the old Be a Pro and Be a Manager modes, where you roll through the season playing matches, dodging or accepting loan and transfer requests and getting the odd rollicking for your behaviour on the pitch, and as before, you can choose whether to play matches from the viewpoint of just the one player or play with the whole team. The latter will be most people's choice, but playing in just the one position can be interesting, really making you think about where you need to be and what you need to do to make the most of every opportunity, while creating opportunities for others.\n\nThis game is also a First Person Shooter, like Call of Duty, or Counter Strike, even Skyrim with guns.

You get a short introduction to the game and the scene by Day9 if you want, and that most likely is enough to help you understand everything. On top of that there is a glossary ingame that explains a couple of Korean words that get mentioned, and I only ever had to tab out and go to Wikipedia once, in order to find out what the gang was drinking at the bar they went to, haha.\nAll in all, please check this thing out if you are interested in eSports and don't mind visual novels.

In my opinion, its even beat the [spoiler] Gender Bender DNA Extreme visual novel[/spoiler] effort.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nLike any other free visual novel, its story is not that long and it can be continue by it sequel. But I am very impressed how they manage the animation, zooming on some image, it really bring some curiosity on the image or a nice break from clicking. The story is about a guy/girl (depending which you choose from) from a failure at MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) to a champion. Though the story is not that finished, you will be satisfied by the ending. \n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nThe music in this game is a really great mood changer from being funny, serious, or even awkward. Even though sometime the music cant match the situation (especially at awkward time), It's still a catchy song, oh and the ending music in my opinion is the best.\n\n[h1]Art[/h1]\nThe art are the most impressive thing I have seen in visual novel lately, though sometime the art of character model changes on some screen. I admire the Korean City drawing and sky from above, and some enviroment are really detailed which make this visual novel stands out from other visual novel.\n\nConclusion\n+ Great art, enviroment and character, many sprite too\n+ Music is fun to hear\n+ A Great Story driven game\n- Some music dont match the mood\n- Some scene change the character model\n\nMUST TRY", "timestamp_created": 1444987986, "timestamp_updated": 1444987986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18494336": {"recommendationid": "18494336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138161856", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444958139}, "language": "schinese", "review": "gg", "timestamp_created": 1444958139, "timestamp_updated": 1444958139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18494158": {"recommendationid": "18494158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000563429", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444872468}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and well made.

Note : I do not understand Starcraft and frankly I did not play this game to understand SC2, I only played because I waanted to have an insight about the life of a professional eSports player, so I will not talk about the SC2 aspects in this review.\n\nWell anyway, here goes my review :\n\nThis game tells the story about Mach, a foreign player from the West (maybe USA) who came to Korea to 'play Starcraft' and go professional. Throughout the course of the game, it told you how a professional eSports player creates a team and how they interacted/practised with their teammates (the game mainly focus on this), how the players' emotional condition affects their motivation, and what was required to succeed in eSports asides from talent and skill. I really think the game captures and retell those moments to the player perfectly and I do believe these process were similiar to some (if not most) professional eSports player's experience, I think it really gives you insight about competitive gaming life and how uneasy it is to live as an eSports player. \n\nHowever, the game is not without it flaws though. There were moments that the game made seems very easy (which I was sceptical) :\n1. The first was when Mach got scouted by Accell a renowned pro player. He instatenously agreed to play against him after watching him played one game, oh boy how would I love to be able to got scouted so easy like that and become a pro player also :O\n\n2. Accell, Jett, Stunt and Reva seems to settle in with their team very quickly and looked very motivated. They literally became 'close friends' who trusted each other within one week since the team were established. Trust me, it is very rare to find a player who is not only skilled, but motivated and full of commitment, let alone being able to trust each other within that short amount of time.\n\nAll in all, it is a good VN that worth reading and you would not regret trying it out since it's also free.

F\u00fcr mich aber war es einer der besten, die ich bis jetzt gespielt habe.\nKurzgefasst geht es um den Versuch eines ausl\u00e4ndischen Starcraft 2 Spielers, seine F\u00e4higkeiten in Korea zu verbessern und sich so einen Namen zu machen. Es gef\u00e4llt mir, dass man zu Beginn die Wahl des Geschlechts hat.\nAlle Charaktere hatten ihre eigene Pers\u00f6nlichkeit, sodass man sich bereits nach kurzer Zeit mit ihnen verbunden gef\u00fchlt hat.

I really felt a need to make sure I got the good ending; to not fudge up, for the sake of the team. Even though I have never played StarCraft, I have found a new interest in thanks to this VN. It made SC seem more understandable to me than it ever has been before. In the end I was left wanting more and a tad dissapointed that it ended where it did. It gives me hope that I might one day see a sequel. Not many things leave me that way, save the occasional seasonal anime masterpeice. The artwork wasn't the best, but it was still a pleasure to observe. The characters weren't anything overly unique, but they all inspired a large amount of affection from me. Except for one; one just inspired hate. You'll know the one if you play. Anybody who likes short anime, StarCraft, or Esports in general, I recommend you play (read? whatch? idk) this.

In fact, I never have. But I feel this VN desrves one. It is rather short and doesn't have the most elaborate story, but I ended up enthralled faster than I have ever been before. I really felt a need to make sure I got the good ending; to not fudge up, for the sake of the team. Even though I have never played StarCraft, I have found a new interest in thanks to this VN. It made SC seem more understandable to me than it ever has been before. In the end I was left wanting more and a tad dissapointed that it ended where it did. It gives me hope that I might one day see a sequel. Not many things leave me that way, save the occasional seasonal anime masterpeice. The artwork wasn't the best, but it was still a pleasure to observe. The characters weren't anything overly unique, but they all inspired a large amount of affection from me. Except for one; one just inspired hate. You'll know the one if you play. Anybody who likes short anime, StarCraft, or Esports in general, I recommend you play (read? whatch? idk) this.

My brother used to play SC 1 for years. Ofc he was not even half good as koreans getting stack up on around C rank on battlenet. He was always mentioning back then stories about how great few players from our country were: \"Draco\", \"Dunaj\". He was pumped up to play and play only this game, organising sparrings with his clan, for most time. Although he ended up as an smart guy in society not related to games, getting a good job, opening buisness, soon propably mariage too.\n\nInto the thing I am getting is that gaming aswell as anything others demands sacrifices to make money for it, gaming is an passion that's why if it comes only to income, then progaming is not good spent time. SC is propably at least for me, the most competive game from all demanding skills in every aspect. I was never good at it, but I appreciate the players. This VN is an tribute to all competive gamers for now. Its something fresh. It has incredible graphics, great music combined with classic SC tracks. Dynamic story telling. Decisions even if not that many. I am surprised that noone wanted a money for that hard work.\n\nI recommend this game with pure assurance, that you will find here something for yourself here.

I also don't like eSports in general and this game made me interested in competitive Starcraft. It is truly remarkable how this simple game kept me both invested in story and relaxed at the same time. The idea was there for quite some time but until now I didn't see someone take it and make into a story of a game. Shame as this one proves that eSports make fantastic topic for \"social story\".\n\nIt is hard to critique this game, I mean, come on - its FREE. Devs don't have any profits from it. However as I both enjoyed it and was disappointed by some parts, I would like to offer some feedback which may lead to improvement of this one or the sequel (which of course WILL BE RELEASED SOON, RIGHT? RIGHT?!).\n\n[Small spoilers may occur after this point]\nPros:\n+ way more natural dialogues that in typical VN\n+ diverse and likeable characters\n+ great way to learn about competitive Starcraft\n+ simple but involving story about trying to get into eSports\n+ quite realistic vision of Korean society and eSports community (for a noob like me at least)\n+ assets form Starcraft 1 (that music!)\n+ nice graphic\n+ nice music\n+ short (for some)\n+ lack of romance (for some)\n+ IT'S FREE\n\nCons:\n- lots of graphic and music assets re-use\n- lack of meaningful choices (and choices in general)\n- lack of different endings\n- lack of main character self-development\n- some characters and scenes are really clich\u00e9\n- short (for me) - it ends right where the real story begins\n- lack of romance (for me... I mean some! Not me. Some.)\n- minor bugs\n\nFINAL NOTE: 7/10\n\nThe game is doing what it does very well bearing the fact that it is crowd-funded and given for free. I feel bad that I didn't hear about it and didn't back it up when Kickstarter was on. But I really hope that Devs will come back with the sequel - longer and better in all the ways I listed and those I didn't notice.

It's a VN that's mostly reading and little gameplay. Don't expect meaningful choices. It's pretty mediocre as a VN but is somewhat special because it deals with a topic not used so much (esports/SC2) rather than generic school life.\n\nAfter recently playing Telltale's Walking Dead I can't help but feel how unsatisfying this storyline is. There is no branching, no twists, just conversation options that either don't matter or immediately lead to a game over. I don't expect the same quality but was hoping for at least a little depth. I doubt they'll continue developing this but at the very least it would've been nice to have multiple people to recruit (and see changes based on who you recruit).\n\nYou can choose gender for the main character but (as they say) it only affects character appearance and every once in a while dialogue is added (that has no impact on the game). The SC2 ingame pictures were a very nice (and necessary) addition to help show the action moments. They also threw in a random fanservice hot springs pic in the extras which was unnecessary but I think many people will enjoy and expect from a VN.\n\n[quote]This game is written for all players who want to live the dream. No previous knowledge of StarCraft and eSports required.[/quote]\nThey have a Day[9] do a quick skit and glossary that helps a little but I do think you need previous knowledge to really enjoy and understand everything that goes on in the VN. It's also very useful to know the basics of SC2 which are glossed over in the VN (unit names/purposes, building names/purposes, basic strategies). Otherwise it could be hard to follow the actual SC2 action. One example line: \"My hellions make a beeline for his natural expansion's worker line\". I'd recommend watching Day[9]'s old introductory videos (not the extra skit) if you don't know at least that much.\n\nIt also helps a lot to know common shortcuts of visual novel games because it doesn't mention anything in-game (like R-click for menu/back, ctrl/tab for skip, mouse scroll up for chat log and more). You can find out a lot by pressing random keys on your keyboard and hoping for the best (that it doesn't exit out/quickload and ruin your progress).\n\nI couldn't figure out the purpose of red text until I randomly noticed the glossary on the ingame menu late in my playthrough (and it doesn't show up on the main menu). I tried hovering over the word and right/left clicking it and gave up.

I just can't promise you'll enjoy your time learning.\n\nIf you do like VNs, but not SC2/eSports, give it a try. It's a thoroughly charming, well written and surprisingly dramatic take on a part of gaming most people never get a look at. \n\nIf you like Starcraft 2, but have never tried/do not like VNs, it'll cost you two hours of your time and I found enough amusing references and in-jokes to the scene to keep me smiling all the way through. It's worth a look for those alone(especially the extras scenes.)\n\nIf you like Starcraft and VNs... why are you still reading? Play it. You will not be disappointed.\n\nSpoliers ahead: As someone with a somewhat in-depth knowledge of SC2, I did find a few things that bugged me. Some of the stuff mentioned was not really relevant anymore in SC2, talking specifically about mechanics and the like, and I was kind of disappointed that you couldn't make any significant choices in the final showdown... but the story was well enough told it had me biting my nails at the very end. Remember, the premise is that only about 2% of people who try to break into eSports make it at all... but some do make it. \n\nI also like how, if you pick a female Mach, it does touch on some of the issues faced by female progamers that their male counterparts don't have to deal with... but does so very even-handedly, without being crusading or in-your-face about it. I honestly wish it would have touched a bit more on the true toxicity of the community at times, but I can understand how the authors wanted to go with a more positive approach to things. All in all, I'm definitely looking forward to/hoping for a sequel. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1443135541, "timestamp_updated": 1443135541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502240", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18177619": {"recommendationid": "18177619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081047109", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443655537}, "language": "english", "review": "A good visual novel and a great plot especially to the peoples who likes starcraft 2, they can really relate this game.", "timestamp_created": 1443130893, "timestamp_updated": 1443130893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18177612": {"recommendationid": "18177612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079374641", "num_games_owned": 709, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443130876}, "language": "english", "review": "Like VN?

There was a slight bit of novelty starting out, but from there, everything about it was really intriguing and built in a way to keep you reading.\n\nThe story is written by someone who definitely sounds like they know what they're talking about, in terms of culture and gaming. This can result in it being a bit hard to grasp at times, but there's still a lot of genuine writing and emotion, and not just someone writing about video games because they think it's \"cool\" or \"hip\". The characters as well are written in a sincere way, not coming off as caricatures or stereotypes, but as actual human beings.  There's nuance and layering to them.\n\nThe way the story paces itself is also done in a smart manner. There's not too much dumping of exposition and action, yet you don't stall in the story for too long as well. It's a great way to get you accompanied with the setting, the characters, and the playing field as well. And, as an aside and small bonus, you can pick whether you play as a male or female protaganist, which doesn't change the story much (and if it does, it's not too noticeable).\n\nWhich is another good thing about this game! Occasionally, you get to play in some mock Starcraft 2 battles,  Rather than actually controlling the battles yourself, you're given action trees to decide which way the story goes and how the characters react. What help is that these options are rarely designed to make you super awesome or unbeatable; they're how a player who's in a bit too over their heads would think and react. The game and story, then, doesn't require you to be a hardcore fan of SC2 or eSports to really get it. You can start right out of the gate and still feel connected with everything.\n\nThere are a couple drawbacks though. The first one only really applies if you don't know much about the subject matter going in beforehand like I did. The dialog and jargon around the game can be confusing, and you'll likely not know what's going on because of it. The game tries to combat this by giving you a glossary when opening the menu, and updating it with terms bolded in-game whenever you encounter them. It still doesn't help too much though, as I had to google some of it in order to really pick up on it. The game tries to combat this by giving you a tutorial video accessible when you first start the game, or on the extras menu. It's voice-acted which... which makes it really cringeworthy at times. It got annoying enough to where I quit out of it early because I didn't think I'd make it through. And finally, while the game has some nice music at times, at others... it sounds too stock-music-esque and a touch unfitting to really sell itself.\n\nStill, this doesn't detract from the game majorly. At heart, the story is a simple one; someone who wants to make the most of their talent and is willing to risk their finances and reputation to pursue it, even in a field where fame and longevity is uncertain. Make no mistake; though the game can be a bit silly at times, it doesn't treat its subject matter in a non-serious way, and that gives the game a much-needed breath of fresh air that most visual novels recently can't give you. Also, it's free and has low requirements, so any competent computer should be able to run it.", "timestamp_created": 1443042004, "timestamp_updated": 1443042004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18164304": {"recommendationid": "18164304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018663090", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443041343}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a stupid basic visual novel about a dumb kid who chases his dreams into a foreign country and it's to play videogames for a living and become number 1 (which means number 1 in Korean).

Hell, my last serious RTS was Age of Empires 2, and that in of itself should normally make a specialized VN like this outside of my place to play, much less review. But hell, I gave it a try when it claimed I could make due without knowledge, and it did not lie. So if the only thing keeping you on the fence is whether you'll understand anything, relax. The game has a glossary, for crying out loud. \n\nWhere else to rank it... Well, I'll be as blunt as I can be. It's a free Renpy VN, after all. \n\nGameplay boils down to your typical faire of making choices at select points, as you might imagine. You can play as either a male or female lead, but it makes little difference. Still, props for the option even existing. My point is gameplay isn't the main focus here... Though I do hope to see innovation in anything going forward. \n\nVisuals are smooth, nice, and right where they need to be. Likewise on the sound, everything from silky smooth tones to alt rock, everything blends pretty damn well in setting the scene right where it needs to be for the player. The game also shifts to something different just enough times to keep the player surprised without becoming expected, which I applaud. \n\nStory and characters are compelling in their own way, too. Even without knowing squat about SC personalities, I was more than amused by the faces shown here. Even if half the fun was figuring out the archetypes early on, and watching how they'd be played out. Speaking of, game's clean. Save for a tame extra scene, there is no fanservice or anything of the sort, much less romance to worry about, so don't expect that. I will say I enjoyed what bonding scenes we did get, and caught myself questioning what relationships other characters had before I showed up... A mark of good narrative delivery in my eyes, considering I actually was interested. \n\nThree things of note. First, no auto/skip functionality, so prepare to experience SC for yourself... When you feel like you need 300 APM just to get anywhere. (See? Wouldn't have known that before this game. Ahem.) This is swiftly dealt with by the second note, that the game is... Relatively easy to get the good ending on. It's no Sakura Spirit, there are numerous choices and -presumably- bad endings, but ah... I didn't get one. Yeah, somehow I got what could only be classified as a good/true ending on my first run, blind. No guides, just two google searches to find out what the hell Protoss even played like (and learning they were expensive as hell) and another to look up a term. All I did was play smart with basic logic from what the game showed me, and things played out flawlessly. So either I'm a natural SC2 player in the making, or the game's rather easy to complete unless you're a bonehead with this sort of thing. Third and finally, I was outright disappointed the ending I got, well... Ended so soon. It's a short game. But. \n\nThat is actually a good thing, I suppose. For as many minor (and they are minor) gripes as I have, they are tremendously outweighed by the positives the game provides. Hell, I'm listening to the credits song on repeat because it's just that good wrapping things up. The game's short, the game's small, but it's free and packed with personality and warmth. Let me put this in no uncertain terms, okay? \n[b]I actively want a bigger, more full, more packed sequel, and I want to pay for it. I want to see this story through to a full end, I want to watch these characters progress, I want more, and I want to support the creators for it.[/b]\nSC2VN is a short experience, but it's one I don't regret taking in the slightest, and actively want more of.\ng freakin g.

On the other hand, if you're a big Starcraft eSports fan, then you'll instantly recognize some players & personalities which are homages to other popular figures from the eSports scene. As well as some call backs to old strategies that were once viable in the competitive scene. Unfortunately this game doesn't have any branching paths, and choice isn't too much of a factor with a very short story. Simply talking and listening to your team's advice can get you the \"good\" ending without having any real prior knowledge of Starcraft. This game is also built on Ren'Py so you can litterally run it on just about anything.\n\nPros: \n* Solid Story\n* Excellent Glossary for Terms\n* Enjoyable and well written characters \n* Great intro movie for players unfamiliar with Starcraft\n\nCons\n* Very short, 2 hours at most. \n* No Branching pathes (just success or fail states.) \n\nOther Thoughts\n* Not fully voice acted\n* Gender choice available but not terribly relevant to the story.", "timestamp_created": 1443032032, "timestamp_updated": 1443032032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18161890": {"recommendationid": "18161890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028119858", "num_games_owned": 922, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443031651}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud6c4\uc18d\uc791...\uc874\ub098\uac8c \ud070 \ud6c4\uc18d\uc791\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4!\n\n\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \ub178\ubca8\uc774\ub2c8\ub9cc\ud07c \uc5b4\ub290\uc815\ub3c4\uc758 \ubbf8\ud654\ub294 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uaf64\ub098 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801 \ubaa8\uc2b5\uacfc Esport\ud310\uc774 \uad74\ub7ec\uac00\ub294 \ubaa8\uc2b5\uc744 \uadf8\ub824\ub0c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc2a4\ud0c02 \uad00\ub828 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ub2c8\ub9cc\ud07c Esport\ubc0f \uc2a4\ud0c01,2\uc758 \ud32c\uc774\uba74 \ub354\ub354\uc6b1 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc9c0\uae34 \ud558\ub2e4.\n\n\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2a4\ud0c01,2\ub97c \ubaa8\ub974\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub3c4 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc5c6\uc774 \uc990\uae38 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uad6c\uc131\uc784.\n\n\ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud558\ub2e4 \ubcf4\uba74 \ud574\uc678 \ud32c\uce35\uc758 \ubb34\ud55c\ud55c \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud310 \uc0ac\ub791\uc744 \ub290\ub084 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc88b\uc740 \uac8c\uc784.\n\n\uac70\uae30\uc5d0 \uc774\uc815\ub3c4 \ud004\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0 \ubb34\ub8cc\ub77c\ub2c8! \uc194\uc9c1\ud788 9\ub2ec\ub7ec \uc774\uc0c1 \ubc1b\uace0 \ud314\uc544\ub3c4 \uba39\ud790 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4.\n\n\uc81c\ubc1c \ud6c4\uc18d\uc791\uc744 \ub0b4\uc8fc\uae38 \uc82d\ub77c\uc82d\ub77c \u3160\u315c", "timestamp_created": 1443030516, "timestamp_updated": 1443030680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505700", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18161750": {"recommendationid": "18161750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066875409", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443025438}, "language": "english", "review": "Everyone loves free stuff.\n\n\nThe length kinda short and no branching parts. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1443029930, "timestamp_updated": 1443029930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437407", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18161599": {"recommendationid": "18161599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027483587", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443029471}, "language": "english", "review": "A visual novel about StarCraft pros.

As great as it is, is too beholden to an attempt to maintain historical accuracy to become an esport. But, I love the esports community; I'm engrossed specificlly in the Smash circuit, doing locals and following the exploits of legends like Mango, Hungrybox, and Mew2King. In those regards, I can easily relate to the culture of the scenerio, while also exposing differences in how certain comptitive circuits.\n\nFor a free game, this is actully pretty damn good. I love the art style, and the designs of the characters are really distinctive and good-looking (I especially like female Mach and Jett's designs). The characterization is a little one-dimensional, but then again the game is short and free; they only have so much time they can focus on. The music is ok; didn't really like the credits song to be perfectly honest, but the other songs combine electronic beats that mirror the Starcraft soundtrack almost perfectly.\n\nI also loved the Day9 cameo and how Jett was basiclly a genderswapped IdrA (definitly my favorite character in the story by far). I knew enough about starcraft to appreciate those. The extra scene also shows how much love the developers have for the series, pointing out many other nuances that completely went over my head.\n\nMy biggest problem, is that the game feels, and I quote what I told a friend, \"more railroaded than transport tycoon\". There's no branching paths, no romance, nothing that really involves meaningful player interaction in the visual novel. Even the starcraft playing segments is a binary \"win-fail\" choice, leaving the player to have very little agency in the story as a whole. Yes, I know this a debut, free game, but it really kills any interest in replaying in the game. There's so little choices, there's only two bad ends that I even know of, near the beggining of the game!\n\nIn all, this is a solid effort and I think most elements of what makes a good visual novel is there. Before playing, I probably wouldn't have bought it if I had to pay for it, but afterwards I'd be more than glad to have the option of supporting the developers. If the hinted at sequel happens, I really hope that the game becomes more interactive. Let the player specialize in strategies, make matches actually engaging, manage relationships, or even offer a zerg/protoss route if all things fail, SOMETHING which allows the player to influence the game.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I reccomend giving this a shot.

So he/she goes to Seoul, Korea, to try vs some of the best and learn. And then it begins....\n\nLet's take a look at the good about this novel, and the bad. I will do my best to leave any spoilers out. I will, however, say that I've played through this novel twice before it came to steam - its existence was well known to SC2 fans well in advance and many wanted to try it out - as it was kickstarted and the author made it clear that it will be free for all (SC pun intended).\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. A valid representation of the international Stacraft scene.\n2. Good writing and pleasant pictures to look at.\n3. The writer obtained permission from Blizzard to use the Terran Starcraft + Brood War music, which I really love.\n4. Any fan of Starcraft will easily recognize that the fake player and team names actually have real ones behind them, often with a single letter or so swap. If I am not mistaken (as I watch SC2 matches only leisurely and for fun), VSL is ESL, Enoch is Epoch, Jett is probably IdrA, Accel should be Flash, etc.\n5. You get to play matches, and even have choices how to proceed, which will determine its outcome.\n6. Over 2 hours of \"gameplay\".\n7. It's FREE!!!\n\n\nThe BAD:\n\n1. Some strategies used on the screenshots are clearly outdated.\n2. There could have been more choices during the matches.\n3. Some gameplay representations are not close to the reality (even in my meager knowledge from watching ESL games and other streams).\n4. I was hoping for a more in-depth, action ending, but it is serviceable and fits the story well.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't download and play this free visual novel. It's nice, it's well written, and it portrays the Starcraft universe both in-game and outside of the game really well with all the trash talkers, nice guys, events, and so on. It is nice short experience that in my opinion, one shouldn't deny oneself.

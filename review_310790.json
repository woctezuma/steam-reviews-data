First off is Map design. There is some maps which really shouldnt be in the game. Its those pesky square formed maps. More precisely its those with sharp angles between planes. Its nice that the edges are soft but it doesnt really solve the problem. When you use a camera which is using perspective projection theres bound to be angled planes which cant be shown. That is fine as long as they arent adjacent to the plane you are on.  Because that creates situation where you go from one plane to another and get insta killed from enemies who you couldnt see or predict they were there. For example I shot to plane I plan to go to and I expect there arent any there but right when I go there spawns one and I get instakilled. This is the second problem spawning enemies. This is less of a problem and more of a difficult aspect of the game. The problem is that enemies spawn and you happened to ignore it and where were it spawned and got killed. Its a bad feeling knowing enemies can spawn right under you and you cant help it for example if you get swarmed or something else. Luckily you can deal with it with a limited blast. I think the better solution would be to make it not possible for example by delaying or make the spawn pushable. If you think this is wrong tell me why?

I thought it was mostly a casual shooter about math. Yknow. Childlike innocence. And then I got home and played it. For the most part, I was right. It is a pretty simple game about shooting geometric shapes, but it was really fun. Now for this game? This game feels like..like a bit of a rushed one.\n\nI'll give it that it LOOKS beautiful. the game is one that uses a bit of wireframe-style artstyle in combination with calling itself geometry wars, it just feels like that combination was brilliant.\n\nIn the Wii version of Geometry wars, called Galaxies, you traveled around various solar systems to different planets and suns, fighting enemies for a big score on them with different types of drone functions you could upgrade. Now, Dimensions adds a bit to the drones, giving them super moves; these add a different ability along with the passive effect, such as firing missiles for a small time or becoming a black hole to suck all the enimies in range. For the levels, instead of various planets with levels, you've got kind of an adventure-style, liner path through the game, with bosses at various points.\n\nNow, the addition of bosses was cool, and the linear story-like gameplay is neat, but there are two other modes that have this aspect, but increase the difficulty a bit; Hardcore, and Ultimate. With Ultimate it's a little different, and you usually have less amounts to use your super-powered drone ability, and Hardcore is where you have no drone. But..really..these are just modes that could have been switched with a button, or even more levels on Adventure, just harder difficulty. It's seerate menus that make the game SEEM like it's longer than it is.\n\nThat's not to say I didn't have a blast trying to beat all the bosses and get 3 stars on each level; I'm still working on getting the stars, but my idsue is the AMOUNT of levels. There's only so much I can play on it, and each level has a simple objective; usually just survive and get a high score. There's 110 levels to beat, but after each end boss of each mode, the end end boss, a strip of lined color acts like I can keep going; like there's more secrets, but having me get ALL the stars just to see that? I'm an avid player of this game, but it's difficult to do.\n\nOnto the ship..The ship got a downgrade. Now, it always shot in 2 little tiny peashooter shots, then it got an upgrade to shoot more, usually either in a spread or machinegun-like fire. Now it only shoots 3, has a somewhat larger spead, with the introduction of 'super states' which include both the time-based switching or the weapon from the other games, alomg with new ones, but here's my problem; THE WEAPON DOESN'T STAY. It's a time-based ability, and this ability isn't allowed on bosses, severely ramping the difficulty when at the harder levels and trying to get those 3 stars. I would rather have the survival-based weapon upgrades than a 'super mode'. The ship itself is still the same while the multiplayer mode gives you a look at the others; when will we get to play single-player as ome of the others? Just gibe us a choice! I personally like player 3's ship better than the default.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's a good game to push how good you are at twin-stick shooters. I'd see if you could het it on sale, though..it's not a lot of new content in comparison to Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, and that was an Xbox 360 arcade game.

The stages are short, challenging, and significantly different from each other in most cases:  you could say that this is perfectly designed to soothingly accomodate your standard millenial gaming-induced adult ADD.\n\nThis iteration of the series has a couple of features that really extend replayability.  One:  incremental plus-up-your-drones-and-supers skinner box works exactly as planned,  Two:  knowing what I really want out of a leaderboard, it displays your Steam friends' scores -first-, so you have a sense of meaningful competition against other mere mortals (and instantly deployable bragging rights.)  Three:  I'm a sucker for three-tiered score challenges, I guess.\n\nAnyway, it's my favorite game in the arcade genre.\n\nSome mild criticism:  The soundtrack is extremely limited.  I like all the music I've heard, but I feel like I've only heard about four tracks, three of them very same-y.  There's one (1) boss level track, but the game seems to be pretty into its gem-themed array of bosses.  The soundtrack for the DS was excellent, so this is an unexpected letdown.\n\nCriticism the second:  I've played about two thirds of the bosses, and they don't feel especially different from one another.

Unlike other arcade shooters where you play on a 2D plane, this game allows you to play on a 3D plane. This drastically changes how the game is played to where you can easily wrap around the stage without having to akwardly run into enemies and projectiles, although that can still happen but just for other reasons. You don't need to play the games before this one to like it, and you'll likely have a hard time finding them on Steam anyways. \n\nAlthough the main focus in this game is the 3D planes, you can also play on the classic 2D planes with all of the same gimics by going into classic mode. Also there is a story mode witch is just a long string of levels with certain gimics in them like: survival, enemy waves, limited ammo, time trails, ect. with most of the levels in story modes using 3D plane of some sort You earn stars based off of how well you perform in each stage with the maximum stars per stage being 3. \n\nThese stars will add up to your overall total where you will slowely unlock boss stages that are manditory for progressing further in the mode. Once you complete story mode you will unlock a harder story mode called \"Ultimate\" which is essentially new stages in themselves. After that are three bonus levels basically using the gimics mentioned above with the added benefit of being an endless mode. Finally there is multiplayer where you can play online (there's nobody online) or you can play local coop with a friend and go through a string of levels like in story mode.\n\nThere is no shortage of content here and you will likely get you're money's worth if you decide to try out everything the game has to offer. This game is no doubt hard, but satisfying granted that you are good or just get better over time.

Enemies vary in their AI / movement speed / health and are easily identified because they are distinct shapes and color-coded.  Initially the game can seem quite easy but you'll find that a lot of the endless modes can get downright insane.  Also there's a big difference between barely finishing Adventure Mode once... and 3-starring every level like I did for the achievement.  Make no mistake, you get a lot from this game for the price.  The graphics are amazing, but the music is only so-so.  I recommend turning it down and playing your own music instead: that enhanced the experience for me.

Ausser man macht bestimmte Teile platt, dann bekommt man kurzzeitig einen anderen (oder man spielt im klassichen Modus).\n\nDas einsammeln von kleinen P\u00fcnktchen um den Multiplikator zu erh\u00f6hen kann man so oder so sehen. Ich mag das nicht so wirklich. Vorteil ist nat\u00fcrlich, das der Punktemultiplikator sehr schnell nach oben gehen kann. Nachteil ist nur, das man st\u00e4ndig in die Viecher reinfliegen muss, da man es ja einsammeln darf. Und das auch noch unter massiven Zeitdruck, da die Dinger sehr schnell sich aufl\u00f6sen. Es ist nicht gerade mein Spielstil, mitten in einen Pulk zu fliegen und dabei draufzugehen. Ich spiele da eher sicher, was das Spiel mir nicht erlaubt. Schlie\u00dflich will der Adventure Modus zum weiterkommen bestimmte Punktevorgaben erf\u00fcllt haben.\n\nInsgesamt ist es ein nettes Spiel f\u00fcr zwischendurch, das man in einem Sale, Schlussverkauf, andere Anbieter oder sonstwie sich g\u00fcnstig holen kann. Der Vollpreis ist meiner Meinung nach, auch in Anbetracht des Alters, nicht gerechtfertig.

But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn\u2019t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paci\ufb01sm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne.

If you play on your own, there's some fun stuff to keep you occupied for a bit  - you can try out the different modes, beat your high score, race the clock to get enough points, go through the different challenges, etc. *However*, I don't think that there's enough single-player content to justify the asking price. If you don't have any folks to play with, this isn't worth the money. You can get it on sale or in a bundle, but full price is way too much. Even if you do have some pals to play with, you should still know that the online options really begin and end with competitive leaderboards. There's no online co-operative multiplayer, which is rather surprising and a real shame.\n\nThat being said, why am I still recommending this game? If the single player content is solid but lacking for the price, and there's no online co-op, what's to recommend? Let me tell you where this game really shines: local co-op is a blast. It's so fun to zoom around the maps, blasting all these psychedelic shapes, as your friends zip around next to you. It's hilarious to swoop in and steal their green bits or to snatch a power-up right out from under somebody's nose. There are enough game modes with enough variety so that your group will have plenty to move on to when they want to switch things up. The game is a really great way to start off a night of gaming with your group of friends.\n\nSo, this is a recommendation that comes with a caveat. If you've got a regular gaming group that plays co-op games around your PC, this game is practically a must-buy. It's still a little expensive for what it is, but it's tons of fun and your gaming buddies will love it. If you don't have a local gaming group, though, Geometry Wars 3 is much less exciting. The single-player content is definitely nice (and addictive at times), but it's not enough for you to shell out the full price, and remember that there's no online co-op feature. It comes down to how and why you like to play...it's all going to depend on what genre of games your gaming group likes, whether or not you have a regular gaming group, etc. If you and your friends like arcade-style shooters, there's no question, go for it!", "timestamp_created": 1486762917, "timestamp_updated": 1486762917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578397", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29770006": {"recommendationid": "29770006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061750921", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518308986}, "language": "english", "review": "'member project gotham on the 360 ?", "timestamp_created": 1486503622, "timestamp_updated": 1486503736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29750065": {"recommendationid": "29750065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024340713", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470887598}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was made with psychadelics in mind. 10/10 and SO crazy fun.

From the series\u2019 birth as an Easter Egg in Project Gotham Racing 2 (2003) to finding its home on the early Xbox Live Arcade, Bizarre Creations\u2019 Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved (2005) made few drastic changes but by its second numbered iteration had refined its twin-stick, neon arcade-shooter score-chase into a neo-retro diamond. Aside from perhaps Pac-Man Championship Edition DX (2010) (which borrowed indiscriminately from Geometry Wars aesthetics and leaderboard systems) no game has greater exemplified the arcade game rebirth of the last decade as greatly as Geometry Wars 2 (2008).\n\nWith Geometry Wars 2 Bizarre Creations had achieved near perfection and it is difficult to imagine how they would begin to follow up such a monumental release. But six years later what remains of the studio, now reformed as Lucid Games, attempted to do just that with the release of Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved (2014), a direct sequel that pulls ideas from both Geometry Wars 2 and the royally overlooked Wii spinoff Geometry Wars: Galaxies (2007), as well as liberal inspiration from the adjacent Super Stardust series.\n\nThe first question with a sequel like Dimensions Evolved is not \u201cwhat\u2019s changed\u201d but \u201cdid they ruin it?\u201d Though the return of one of XBLA\u2019s biggest hits is more than welcome, it is hard not to see the surprise release as potentially suspect after a six-year gap and developer shuffle. The answer to that question, however, turns out to be far more difficult to answer than expected.\n\nAt first glance, Dimensions Evolved is still indisputably Geometry Wars. Bright geometric shapes zoom around spitting off particle effects as they attempt to collide with your ship, a reckless spacecraft zipping through levels shooting at anything within reach. Geometry Wars has always expertly balanced visual chaos with a focused design similar to the best bullet-hell shooters, and Dimensions Evolved hasn\u2019t gotten sloppy in the downtime between releases. Few shooters of any variety (or hell, games in general) could claim to match the sort of sensory experience that has personified Geometry Wars\u2019 since its inception, the act of shooting a glowing quadrilateral ranking with the likes of bopping a Goomba on the head or eating a Pac-Man ghost in regards to pitch perfect video game moments.\n\nLike each sequel and spinoff before it, Dimensions Evolved seeks to expand upon Geometry Wars\u2019 foundation while preserving prior games\u2019 additions. As its title somewhat subtly implies, Dimensions Evolved sees the series expanding from its flat origins into full 3D (one can only imagine how overwhelming the game would be when viewed through a pair of anaglyph glasses) placing it far closer to Super Stardust HD (2007) than Asteroids (1979). Compared to past games Dimensions Evolved is almost blinding, the presentation a visually arresting assault of colors and explosions. But for all its technical prowess, Dimensions Evolved\u2019s irreconcilable oversight is allowing its graphics to infringe upon its gameplay.\n\nGeometry Wars has kept the same visual style for all of its releases, but aside from being characteristic of the series the stripped-down presentation also served a practical purpose of keeping the frantic action readable. It was never a challenge to understand what was happening or where enemies were coming from in Geometry Wars 2, but in its third iteration, this key design philosophy has been forgotten in favor of visually interesting but functionally impractical levels which the game\u2019s rudimentary camera is incapable of compensating for. Levels range from simple spheres to peanut-shaped to curved planes and levels which move and evolve as you play through them. There is undeniably more going on in any given level of Dimensions Evolved, but very little of it feels as if it is adding something necessary.\n\nThe tone of every addition to Dimensions Evolved is a blunt \u201cmore.\u201d More levels, more game types, more enemies, more stuff. It\u2019s a predictable, if unexciting approach to a sequel, but what is so unfortunate is that additions that would have fundamentally benefited the series \u2013 such as auto-recorded replays ala-Pix the Cat (2014) or cross-platform leaderboards \u2013 are completely absent. What is present is an embarrassment of riches, different elements tacked on like a gaudy painting by an artist that doesn\u2019t know when to quit.\n\nPerhaps most remarkably frustrating is Dimensions Evolved\u2019s recycling of Galaxies\u2019 drone feature, effectively different power-ups which can be equipped and upgraded to give you extra fire power, collect multipliers, or defend your ship from enemies. These drones provide Dimensions Evolved with its one source of player augmentation, which in most games would be a welcome source of variety but in a game so heavily focused on score chasing upsets the playing field and renders most scores irrelevant. Geometry Wars works so well as an arcade game because it grasps that leaderboards are most compelling when they are tightly focused. Dimensions Evolved introduces so many variables between levels and drone loadouts that attempting to gain the top spot on its hundred or so leaderboards feels like a completely hopeless and pointless pursuit.\n\nLucid Games seems to have realized this on some level, as alongside Dimensions Evolved\u2019s additions, a near 1-1 replica of Geometry Wars 2 has also been included as a \u201cclassic\u201d mode. Unfortunately, the same visual problems that plague the rest of the game persist here, rendering standbys like \u201cdeadline\u201d and \u201cwaves\u201d mechanically identical but distinctly less playable than in past games. These classic stages are undeniably (and perhaps unsurprisingly) the most tuned to score chasing, and in turn the portion of the game most destined to replace Geometry Wars 2\u2019s brutal quest for leaderboard dominance, but it is disappointing that even when it adheres so closely to its predecessors Dimensions Evolved can\u2019t quite measure up.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that despite all its missteps, there is still nothing quite like Geometry Wars and even a lesser version is still among the best arcade games in recent memory. Dimensions Evolved\u2019s biggest strength is serving as a reminder of what an amazing series Geometry Wars has always been, and providing a reason for people who long ago boxed up their 360 to jump back in and reclaim their spot on the leaderboard. Whether that means acclimating to Dimensions Evolved\u2019s questionable changes or returning to Geometry Wars 2 or Galaxies, the result is a net win.\n\n[b]You can find more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2016/12/17/geometry-wars-3-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1482003851, "timestamp_updated": 1482003879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631730", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28318421": {"recommendationid": "28318421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094896490", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482007332}, "language": "english", "review": "Spawn kill the game.", "timestamp_created": 1481497113, "timestamp_updated": 1481497113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28155468": {"recommendationid": "28155468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006067879", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480926149}, "language": "english", "review": "$15 for a shooting game that actually was more intended to destroy shapes.\n\nI remember the old days when I accidently found this game inside Project Gotham Racing 2 as an Easter Egg.\n\nIt was a great game!

The visuals, gameplay and leaderboard score-chasing drew me in and made it a game that I could play for just a few rounds or hours at a time.\n\nI can firmly say that this game takes all of what made the previous game great and makes it that much better. The added complexity that the 3-Dimensional environments present is a welcome addition to the series in my mind. The game also allows you to play the diffferent game modes on \"Classic\" stages, which are flat areas reminescent of the previous games in the series. In this way the game caters to both players who want something knew and those who are looking for the original experience but with new graphics and gameplay.\n\nThe flashy visuals are just as great as the previous games and really bring out the aracade feel of the game. Leaderboards are just as present as well and I'm glad they're still there, even though I don't think I'll ever come close to topping them. To my knowledge, the game retains all (or most of) the classic game modes while offering some new twists in the linear progresion path of the \"Campaign\" mode.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game to series veterans and newcomers alike. It manages to cater to both audiences without butchering what made the series great or adding too much to dilute the formula.

It's a twin-stick shooter where the only goal is to shoot shapes, and yet it's exceedingly entertaining. Why shapes anyway? Besides the fact that this is the Geometry Wars series, I believe the importance of using shapes can't be understated. Speaking in terms of twin-stick shooters: shapes are simple, easy on the eyes, and players are immediately able to recognize the behavioral differences between them.\n\nWhy would \"Zombie Wars\" not work? Zombies, despite their lack of functioning grey matter, are really complicated. They're walking moaning hunks of undying flesh. Let's say you want to have a zombie with a gun in your twin-stick shooter. How will the player know the zombie has a gun? In the middle of chaos, nobody is going to notice the few pixels or couple polygons that's supposed to represent a gun. So here's an idea: Let's give the gun-toting zombies police-hats. Since everything is seen from an overhead perspective, the blue octagon-shape clearly indicates that these zombies have guns. Those fire-breathing zombies? Give them red oval-shaped fireman hats. \n\nAnd just like that, we're right back where we started. In the time it takes to read that inane scenario, every single enemy shape & color in Geometry Wars can be memorized. The basis of a great arcade game is in presenting everything that is necessary to the player's survival, within seconds of pressing the start button. The sequels to Geometry Wars expand upon its simple concept, but never to the point where they endanger what makes it work. The adventure mode in Geometry Wars 3 is liable to be where most players begin. Each stage has a specific goal, and there's usually a factor to consider such as contracting walls, a boss, or a complete lack of weapons. However, none of these stages ever go as far as to contradict how the game is meant to be played. You survive by dodging shapes and improve your score-multiplier by collecting geoms.\n\nAlongside its classic 2D stages, Dimensions Evolved adds numerous 3D stages. At times these can be interesting, such as the \"rainbow\" stages that require players to destroy painters. The painters can spawn on the other side of the field, or tucked away into corners just out of sight. However, there are those rare moments where the perspective can be distracting. It's like the designers are running dangerously close to visually overloading the game. Either that, or I'm just prone to looking for excuses when I fail.\n\nThis edition also adds load-outs such as drones and mines because... eh. I don't dislike their inclusion, but it's really not something that feels necessary. In these games, strategies are usually come up with \"on the fly\". As the in-game situation constantly changes, the gears in your head are spinning, and the intent is to always stay one step ahead. Load-outs add pre-game strategizing, so you might find yourself saying \"I bet if I used the sweep drone, I would have beat my friend's hi-score.\" Everything about Geometry Wars is strong enough to stand on its own, it doesn't need load-outs. On the bright side, if you lack the \"mad skillz\" to succeed, then the load-outs are only a band-aid. Besides, it's not like everyone on the leaderboards isn't using them either.\n\nAlso, there is a degree of cleverness to the drones that I have to applaud. The aforementioned sweep drone flies in a full circle around the player, but it can bounce off of walls. During one stage, I discovered this quirk, and then used it to get out of tight-spots. \n\nGeometry Wars 3 features a wealth of content. The adventure mode is 50 stages, and a couple of free expansions tack on even more. These aren't the \"play once and forget about them\" kind of stages either. Although, there are a few that can be annoying or dull. There's one stage that involves destroying giant snake-shapes. It was so easy I had to destroy myself, just so I could move on. Still, the occasional boring stage is forgivable. There are also a handful of classic modes, which are 3D & load-out free for the purists. Everything you play has a leaderboard attached to it, with solid friend support to boot. There's also a co-op mode. I assume it's nice, but I'll probably never play it. \n\nThanks to a recent humble bundle, this game has likely recieved a large influx of new owners. My advice is to give this game an immediate look. As a Geometry Wars fan, I'll say that this entry nails everything that it needs to. Some of the new ideas don't click perfectly, but at least I know where they were going with them. All too often, sequels make the mistake of adding something completely different, and it takes away from the core game. Even in the fully 3D stages, Dimensions Evolved's core is still very apparent and fantastic.", "timestamp_created": 1473705909, "timestamp_updated": 1473718532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5,

Spawn time seems a little 'off': I lost count of the amount of times that I'd been killed by an enemy with no conceivable warning. In the previous games there would usually be an audio cue to signal an incoming enemy but there's no such luck here. \nSome of the three dimensional level shapes, while looking incredible, do impede the fast-paced nature of gameplay; for example, not seeing an enemy hiding on the edge of a cube.\n\nThe one addition that really rankles me, though, is loadouts. In previous games the joy would be in simply bettering your own score. Here, you're constantly wondering what combination of perks will enable you to absolutely merk that particular level. It seems each level has been designed to have one 'correct' way to play. Even more infuriatingly, certain modes, levels and perks are hidden behind a fairly arbitary unlock system.

The extra dimension that they add to this game really spices it up, instead of just fighting on a flat surface like the previous games, you will also be fighting on Cubes, spheres, peanuts and much more. All the original classic modes return such as pacifism, but alos others are introduced as well. Their is a story mode with a wide variety of diferent challenges as well as boss fights that are quite challenging if not done properly. Their is an Ultimate and a hardcore mode for hardocre veterans of the games. Their is a leaderboard that keep track of your rank against friends as well as your position on the global leaderboards. The controls feel tight and movement is just as smooth as ever, which you would expect from a Geometry Wars game. Their is a COOP mode as well so you can play with a buddy. The soundtrack is amazing just like the previous 2 games. Easily one of the best arcade games on the market, I own it on 3 different platforms(Vita, Xbone, PC) and can be very competitive between friends.

I absolutely loved it. It did everything right, and let me tell you using a stylus to shoot did not make things easy, especially for a lefty.\n\nYears later, I bought this game (shortly after its release if I remember correctly). It was a decent price and I knew the graphics would have my eyes sparkling and my mouth puking rainbows. And I was right. Visually, this game is absolutely stunning. The many game modes and three-dimensional levels make it a huge step forward from Galaxies. Plus now my drone has awesome special attacks (called supers), and Super States give me a chance at getting a huge edge, if only very briefly.\n\nSo why can't I recommend this game?\nIt's a lot of things, but it mostly boils down to the fact that in this game, death means that you have to restart the level, either because (depending on the game mode) you only have a single life, or because while you have infinite lives, you have an extremely short time limit. Combine these issues with the following:\n- Enemy spawn animations are very brief and easy to miss, especially when you're focusing not directly on your ship where they're spawning, but on the enemies you're currently shooting at.\n- A lot of the levels, due their 3-D design, give you almost no visibility around you.\n- There are many enemies whose speed makes them hard enough to dodge even when you can see them coming a mile away.\n\nIt doesn't help that you need those impossible-to-earn stars to actually progress through the game's single-player adventure mode.\n\nIn short, while the action is fast-paced and gorgeous, I can't recommend a game that has you spending hours on end just to make next to no progress. It would have been nice to include a few levels that worked like Galaxies, where you start with three lives, one bomb, one super, and can earn more of each by scoring enough points.

It took the gameplay of Robotron and expanded it, while at the same time simplifying it.\nThe action was frentic. The enemies, while simple in their AI, had a tendency to gang up on you and cause your inevitable demise. And games usually lasted short time enough that you could always just restart to have one more go at the high score.\nGeometry Wars: Galaxies for the Wii expanded upon this by adding different shaped levels, medals to set you some goals and some mutators like certain types of waves in the levels to give you some variety over the classic Retro Evolved. \n\nI hear Geometry Wars 2 did rather well as well, adding game concepts like checkpoints or bubbles in which you need to stay in order to shoot. Expanding on the original to add some flavour.\n\nAnd now there's Geometry Wars 3. The main draw over GW2 seems to be the 3D angle, it's right there in the title. The graphics look a lot more futuristic and flashy. Gone are those silly vectorlike wireframes. Hello flat shaded 3D backgrounds, blurry lighting effects. The works.\n\nSadly this is what really soured the experience for me. The art looks really good, especially in motion. But instead of the lines coming together to form newly spawned enemies, you just get a faint intensifying glow before the enemy is there. Instead of having a good view of the playfield, suddenly you're limited in how far you can see, especially on the cubes and spheres where enemies will seemingly out of the blue turn a corner and ram into you, because the camera wasn't showing you that angle.\n\nAt its heart, this game is very much an extension on Geometry Wars. With game modes from GW2, and slicker graphics. But for me it just turned to frustration to once again get spawnkilled by a powerup because I missed the slight glow. Or to get run into by an enemy coming around the corner I was moving towards. The third dimension, for as awesome as it seems, almost completely ruins the game for me. \n\n80% of the deaths I died felt like a graphical gotcha. I died not because I lost track of where the enemies were, not because I stupidly wandered into something because i was looking at where I was, or because the enemies had surrounded me. I died because of something I didn't have a chance to see before it was too late. Or because I missed a bit of coloured light in the middle of multicoloured explosions.\n\nIt's a pity really. I really wanted to like this game, and on the flat levels this game is almost as much fun as the old incarnations of the game. But as it is I can't recommend getting GW3. Go play the old ones instead, they're hard enough without falling back on optical trickery to kill you.", "timestamp_created": 1461684480, "timestamp_updated": 1461684480, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562448", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22639855": {"recommendationid": "22639855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113063519", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507437980}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun game, it has EVOLVED over the years.

The bulk of the game consists of \"Adventure\" mode, a linear progression through 50 maps.  Lucid Games did an admirable job injecting an impressive amount of variety into each of the levels.  The result is that you usually won't feel like you're trying to achieve the same objective over and over again (for 50 maps).  There are a few duds in the mix--I've never been a fan of the missions where you see how long you can prevent enemies from completely \"painting\" the arena--but the game makes up for it with a lot of missions that are genunely fun to replay.\n\nReaching certain goals and milestones unlocks upgrades for your ship (like buddy drones and super weapons) while obtaining higher scores grants you a sort of currency that can be used to improve these upgrades.  While you'll ultimately have more points to spend than things to invest them in, you can only take one of each type on a given mission with you, so you need to think about the level you're going in to and what will benefit you most.  Maybe a defensive buddy is important for a 1-life survive-as-long-as-you-can mission, but a gem (point) collector drone is better for a timed mission.  Similarly, certain super weapons are better on certain maps than others.  The ability to customize your loadout helps add some depth to the game.  \n\nIn addition to \"Adventure\" mode are three other main modes:  \"Ultimate\" mode, which plays like a crazier, 40-level version of \"Adventure\" mode; \"Hardcore\" mode, which is primarily levels from \"Adventure\" and \"Ultimate\" modes, minus the ability to use drones/super weapons, and \"Classic\" mode, which is simply the ability to choose from the 6 primary mission types featured in previous Geometry Wars installments.  \n\nAs the game is all about stars, points, and high-scores, it can really create a \"one more time\" itch for people who like seeing how high they can get on the leaderboards.

So for accurate aiming, [b]you need to know where your cursor is[/b]. Somebody might argue that you can just keep shooting and adjust the angle. The problem is, since the distance between your ship and your cursor isn't fixed (the cursor can be anywhere on the screen), most of the time the adjustment is super inaccurate if you do not keep an eye on your cursor position.\n \n[b]However, keeping an eye on the cursor is quite distracting in GW3.[/b] Most of the time you might focus on the enemies, especially those fast and/or small ones. Meanwhile, you should also locate the geoms, which is tiny green gems that increases your score multiplier. Geoms are dropped from enemies and will disappear after a few seconds, It is essential to catch enough geoms, otherwise you might even find it hard to get 1 star out of 3. If using a controller, it is acceptable to focus on these stuff. But if you are using the keyboard and mouse, you should also focus on the cursor, which is very distracting.\n\nPersonally, I feel frustrated while playing GW3.

Goddamn, am I glad I did too, because this game is fantastic.\n\nI\u2019ve played the 1st [i]Geometry Wars[/i] game, though not the second. This game is a huge step up from the first, and from what I can tell, a huge step up from the second as well. If you like the old games then you should love this one too. If you\u2019re new to the series then this is the best place to start. It has the classic mode from the first game, and I think it has all the modes from the second as well. At the least, it has about a half dozen other classic game modes in addition to the main game. I won\u2019t spend any more time on these classic modes since they aren\u2019t the main focus of this game, but suffice it to say that they provide added entertainment to the game.\n\nIf you do get this game, I highly recommend getting an X-Box controller for Windows, as this game is unplayable with just a keyboard, or with a keyboard and mouse. For this review, when I refer to the controls I\u2019m referring specifically to when using a controller.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very simple, you control a highly maneuverable ship that can shoot in any direction, you use one joy stick to move, and the other to shoot. One of the shoulder buttons will release a bomb that clears the screen of enemies, while the other will release a special attack depending on the drone you picked, (more on the drones later). How many times you can use a bomb or special attack depends on the level. Usually just once per stage, sometimes up to three, and sometimes none.\n\nThe meat of the gameplay is done in adventure mode, which is a series of levels featuring a variety of different modes. Each level is completed by earning enough points to get a 1 star rating. You can earn up to 3 stars for each level by further surpassing higher and higher score thresholds. (I\u2019ll talk more about the stars later). Different levels have different maps, while some of them are flat, most of them are various 3 dimensional shapes that you can cruise across the entire surface of.\n\nSome of the different game modes include scoring enough points under a certain time limit, in which you have infinite lives. Other modes you have only one or three lives and must reach the score before you exhaust your lives. There\u2019s a mode where you can only attack from inside domes that spawn and disappear from the map. The game also features bosses, and a handful of other game modes to play.\n\nEarning points in a level is as simple as destroying your enemies, which consist of different geometric shapes that each behave in a different manner. Each time you kill an enemy they drop green gems, known as geoms, that increase your score multiplier. You pick up the geoms simply by piloting near them.\n\nWhen you pick a level you can also choose your loadout, which consists of a drone and a drone super. The first affects the ship you pilot, such as increasing your attack spread, or having a drone that automatically seeks and collects geoms for you. The super gives you another attack to use in the level, such as dropping a turret that shoots for a short period of time, or a black hole that sucks in all the enemies for a short while. When you complete a boss level you unlock a new drone super, though you must purchase it first. You purchase it with the stars you earn by completing levels, so earning more stars than needed per level has more benefit than just bragging rights. You can purchase upgrades for both drones and the drone supers with geoms. Each time you finish a level, regardless of if you complete it successfully or not, all the geoms you collected  are added to the funds you can spend towards upgrades. Upgrading your drones and supers will make the game a bit easier, though you\u2019ll still need to figure out the best combination of drone and super for a level.\n\nAll that is well and good for the game, and certainly worth the price of purchase, but about 4 months after the game was released it received a massive update. It\u2019s the sort of update that was loaded with enough quality content that I wouldn\u2019t mind throwing a few bucks at it for DLC, but the developer\u2019s instead went the commendable route of including it as a free update. If you already owned the game, you got all the new content for free. If you purchase the game today, then you\u2019ll get all the new content with it.\n\nThis new content featured over 40 new levels, a new drone, a new super, new game modes, and new enemies. The new levels are split between two new game modes. One is essentially a hard mode for adventure, featuring new levels (some of which feature new game modes themselves). The other is a hardcore mode, which serves as another adventure mode, but this time you cannot use drones or supers. It\u2019s essentially an adventure mode, but with just the abilities of the old games. (You could view it as a \u201cclassic\u201d adventure mode).\n\nThe new update also slightly tweaked the original adventure mode. Originally, when you played through the game you had to earn a certain number of stars before you could fight a boss. For example, the first boss was the 10th level, and I think it required 15 stars; meaning that you had to earn higher than just 1 star on the 9 levels before it. The update required this star requirement. The star requirement was an unnecessary obstacle that sometimes lead to replying levels more than was enjoyable, just to earn enough stars to advance further. That\u2019s the only tweak to the base of the game that I\u2019m aware of, and I\u2019m glad that it was one that fixed one of the game\u2019s flaws.\n\nI sunk about 20 hours into the game to complete all the base content and the added levels of the update. The game can be completed faster than that given the removal of the star requirement, meaning one will only replay levels when they actually want to. I also spent a lot of time trying to get 3 stars on as many levels as possible just because of how much fun it was. So while I\u2019m not sure exactly how long would be needed to finish the game (I\u2019d guess around 12-15, but I could be off), I was able to thoroughly enjoy it for over 20 hours.\n\n[i]Geometry Wars 3[/i] is a fantastic twin shooter.

Trails of light danced across my mind's eye and faded from existence, into the dark endless void of my memories. I had been here before, in another time and place, but not quite like this.\n\nI recall a vision of a simpler time, when stages were 2D and there was only one large box shape to choose from. Enemies would spawn from all around, different colors and shapes each with their own personalities and behaviors. Yes, those were simpler times. But simpler times only give way to more advanced versions of themselves in the future, and the future is now!\n\nI began my journey back into the war of shapes and vertices, raging since the dawn of xbox360. My ship handled comfortably and was just as I had remembered... moving, shooting, and high energy disintegration bombs. But what's this? New and improved technologies have given me advanced weapons of war, multiple companion drones to choose from, each with their own deadly abilities. On top of that I had been given a second special attack slot, and an arsenal of fantastic devices to choose from.\n\nI jumped into the fray, determined to give these multifaceted miscreants a reminder of who I was. A veteran of the old war, bringing my enemy not only memories of defeat and despair, but the chance to experience these things all over again. At first it was a breeze, wave after wave of neon polygons fell to my superior prowess.\n\nA pattern of dots appeared on the map, shiny and chrome, glistening in the psychedelic hues that enveloped the world around me. Blaster fire proved an effective solution as usual, and I was rewarded with upgraded firepower. Now golden bolts of justice were being dispensed in all directions, the map was nearly mine. Retaliations were to be expected, and sure enough they appeared on the horizon. Glowing blue homing cubes, followed by more evasive green tesseracts converged from my starboard side. But as they sought to conquer my life I had found in me greater resolve to live, and my supercharged blasters had a wide enough spray to lay waste to them all. Are they even trying? Nothing can stop me now, their defeat is to me but a simple game.\n\nSuddenly I was aware that my vigilance had failed me, I was not in a game, I was in a battle for survival, and the slightest lapse of attention would be met with fatal repercussions. A tear in space-time opened in a nearby corner of the map. Out from that inter-dimensional orifice poured dozens of cancerous glowing peenises. Their neon blue heads throbbing and probing their environment for supple spacecraft to penetrate, their long red shafts, engorged with hatred and blood-lust trailing behind them. The others had all been attacking from one direction and lulled me into a false sense of confidence. I snapped back to reality only to click my smartbomb trigger and hear the sound many valiant souls before me had heard, the sound of doom, of the inevitable and immediate return to the void, ammunition depleted.", "timestamp_created": 1441488451, "timestamp_updated": 1441489654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17887090": {"recommendationid": "17887090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161181642", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479265328}, "language": "english", "review": "Epic Game, play with xbox controller (or whatever other controller you prefer) when possible.

V\u00e9ritable chef d'oeuvre dans le genre Shoot them up dans un espace d\u00e9limit\u00e9. Geometry Wars c'est avant tout du challenge, du scoring et des musiques \u00e9lectroniques qui d\u00e9chirent ! Ne cherchez pas de sc\u00e9nario, de personnages charismatiques \u00e0 incarner et de morale en fin d'histoire. Non. ARCADE ONLY IS THE RULE !\nOn ne change pas une recette qui gagne, on retrouve les modes et les ennemis classiques depuis le premier volet \"Retro Evolved\" sorti en 2005 mais \u00e9galement de nombreuses nouveaut\u00e9s dont un mode coop\u00e9ration en ligne (pas trop fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 par la communaut\u00e9, h\u00e9las). Le principal apport de cet opus est, comme son nom l'indique, des niveaux en trois dimensions. La surface plane n'a pas disparu pour autant mais le concept est maintenant surann\u00e9, il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, pour le renouveau de la s\u00e9rie, de proposer quelque chose de la sorte. Il faut dire que l'id\u00e9e est g\u00e9niale maintenant votre petit vaisseau peut arpenter la surface d'une sph\u00e8re, d'un cylindre, d'un cube, d'une \"peanut\" g\u00e9ante et autres formes indescriptibles. Cela rajoute du piment dans des parties qui sont toujours ultra prenantes si vous aimez le genre et le scoring hardcore. \u00c0 chaque fin de partie, votre score est \u00e9valu\u00e9 par rapport au classement mondiale, \u00e7a motive toujours (en tout cas pour moi \u00e7a marche). J'ai d'ailleurs obtenu sur un niveau la 33e place, je suis fier comme un bar-tabac ! Haha Donc, je disais que les surfaces en 3D sont int\u00e9ressantes \u00e0 jouer et apportent une vraie plus-value au gameplay car il faut d\u00e9sormais se m\u00e9fier des ennemis hors-champs qui vous tombent sur le blair sans sommation ! L\u00e0 est la principale difficult\u00e9. Pour \u00eatre tout \u00e0 fait honn\u00eate chers lecteurs, 70% de mes morts en pleine partie (et je suppose que \u00e7a doit \u00eatre le cas pour les autres joueurs) proviennent d'un ou des ennemis hors-champs qui me foncent dessus ou que je percute sans avoir fait attention.\nLe mode aventure, sur lequel j'ai pass\u00e9 pas loin de 15 heures, est super sympa. Il s'agit d'un encha\u00eenement de 50 niveaux dans lesquels il vous faut d\u00e9bloquer au minimum une \u00e9toile sur trois pour passer au suivant. Je ne vous ferai pas l'affront de vous expliquer que pour avoir trois \u00e9toiles, il suffit de faire le meilleur score possible... Non, je n'oserai pas ;) D'ailleurs, vu que je suis un champion et que le monde se doit de le savoir, j'ai r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 remporter trois \u00e9toiles sur les 50 niveaux...\nBref, tr\u00eave d'humilit\u00e9, ce jeu est une tuerie pour les personnes qui appr\u00e9cient les jeux d'arcades purs, qui aiment recommencer des niveaux pour battre des records, qui aiment la difficult\u00e9 (pas insurmontable) dans une ambiance electro.

You also have power-ups in the form of drones and special pickups granting temporary enhanced shots. I found the difficulty fair if at times a bit on the hard side. The game is an excellent PC port that runs fluidly with pulsing bright, colourful and smoothly flowing graphics all punctuated by excellent music setting the tone for the frenetic gameplay. I read reports of people encountering technical issues but I never experienced any myself, most likely since the game has been patched since release. Speaking of patches, the developers released a free content pack several months after release along with a patch that many recent games would try and sell as DLC, just shows that they actually respect their players and they really deserve to be supported. If you like arcade shooters and like good value (hours upon hours worth of content here) you really should try out this game.

Jede Form bewegt sich anders und hat andere F\u00e4higkeiten, auf die man sich einstellen muss. Es gibt zwei M\u00f6glichkeiten, Feinden zu entgehen: Ausweichen und Ballern. Am besten gleichzeitig mit einem \"twin stick\" Controller, z.B. von Microsoft. Mit Maus und Tastatur ist man in vielen Leveln sonst einfach aufgeschmissen.  \n\nGenial ist das Score-System: Um einen Level erfolgreich zu bew\u00e4ltigen, muss i.d.R. ein bestimmter Mindest-Score erreicht werden. Gegner bringen beim Abschiessen Punkte f\u00fcr den Score, und hinterlassen f\u00fcr ein paar Sekunden lang \"geoms\", die man aufsammeln kann. Damit erh\u00f6ht sich der Multiplikator f\u00fcr die Punkte. \nUm den Score f\u00fcr jeden Level zu verbessern, muss man also sowohl st\u00e4ndig Gegner abballern, als auch Geoms aufsammeln. Umso mehr, als jede Ber\u00fchrung mit Gegnern kritisch f\u00fcr einen ist, d.h. man muss zwar Geoms aufsammeln, aber sonst allem ausweichen.... Man ist also ganz sch\u00f6n besch\u00e4ftigt. \n\nDas Spiel hat ein sehr hohes Tempo, sehr fl\u00fcssige Graphik und sch\u00f6ne Kontraste und Effekte. Dadurch kommt man schnell in einen meditativen Spielfluss. Die Level sind schwierig, man kann aber unbegrenzt oft (und sehr schnell) wiederholen, so dass sich die Frustration anfangs in Grenzen h\u00e4lt. Dazu sp\u00e4ter. \n\nIch spiele derzeit bevorzugt Geometry Wars 3, obwohl ich Witcher 3 und ein paar andere Games noch fast ungespielt im Account habe. GW3 hat drei entscheidende Vorz\u00fcge: \n1. Es ist sehr schnell erlernbar. Man muss keine Handb\u00fccher lesen und keine In-game Tutorials absolvieren. Einfach starten und fast alles andere ist intuitiv. \n2. Egal, ob man gerade nur 5 Minuten oder eine Stunde Zeit hat - GW3 kann man schnell starten, spielen, und auch schnell wieder aufh\u00f6ren. \n3. Erfahrungspunkte, Guides und In-game equipment sind fast v\u00f6llig unwichtig, bei GW3 z\u00e4hlt Skill: und zwar Reaktion, Voraussicht und Taktik. \n\nLeider zeigt mir das Spiel auch auf, dass ich kein Teenager mehr bin. In vielen Situationen ist meine Reaktionszeit einfach nicht mehr ausreichend - bei den meisten Level ist eine \"Drei Sterne\" Punktzahl f\u00fcr mich beim ersten Anlauf fast immer unerreichbar, und \"Adventure\" Level 50 habe ich bisher noch gar nicht geschafft. Von daher ist abzusehen, dass ich irgendwann GW3 wieder entsage und mich wieder ruhigeren Games zuwenden werde :-)", "timestamp_created": 1434317790, "timestamp_updated": 1434317790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16396277": {"recommendationid": "16396277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088022907", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510789105}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr: Everything I liked about Geometry Wars 2: Retro Evolved, but better.

Or the bot that adds additional firepower (same as having double the firepower) of our mighty paper clip.   \n\nThe addition of playfields being 3 dimensional is an awesome and frustrating add.  As well as two abilities you can deploy once in each given round.  Do I recommend?  Yeah, it's pretty freakin fun. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSZa7nVVww", "timestamp_created": 1430698729, "timestamp_updated": 1430698729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15675415": {"recommendationid": "15675415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138069636", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474576366}, "language": "greek", "review": "Just amazing.\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1430683768, "timestamp_updated": 1430683768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15675229": {"recommendationid": "15675229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008078129", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467189095}, "language": "english", "review": "By far greatest twin stick shooters out there!", "timestamp_created": 1430683067, "timestamp_updated": 1430683067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15674709": {"recommendationid": "15674709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065971713", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512375666}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and addicting game!!

There, I said it. This game has usurped Super Stardust HD\u2019s throne. The various drones and supers you can upgrade create a variety and freedom of choice unparalleled in any other twin stick. The developers have clearly gone back to the drawing board again and again to wring out every possible level variety they could imagine \u2013 you will not find the same basic arena over and over in this game, no siree. Enemy variety is abundant enough, as well \u2013 you will learn to hate some and taunt others. Plus, boss fights! \n\nI admit, I was frustrated with the level progression until they nerfed it in a recent patch, and now the game is perfect. There is massive replay potential in the variety of loadouts you can choose, and going for three stars in every level will keep you challenged for a long while. I haven\u2019t even tried the co-op yet \u2013 looking forward to it. Not to mention, the graphics are gorgeous \u2013 pay close attention as the levels morph into gridlined 3D maps at every start. The music is pure pulse-pounding techno goodness, as glittery as the neon-soaked graphics.  This game oozes polish. \n\nTo top it with a cherry, the devs have thrown in modes that ape the previous entries in the series all for free, basically giving you the entire series in one game. How cool is that?  \n\nIf you are new to twin stick shooters, look no further. If you are fan of the series already, you must be playing it right now rather than reading this. \n\nThis is the best shooter on Steam. Hearing that robotic voice intone \u201cbonfire\u201d as you grab a super and hose off every enemy on the screen into neon shards is one of the most satisfying moments in instant-gratification gaming ever.

I go on benders with this game so long that the brightly colored shapes burn into my brain and I see them behind closed eyelids. I've been a fan of the series since the first one (the mini-game) and watched it grow, and this iteration is leagues ahead of its predecessors as well as any similar titles you might find on Steam. The production values are top-notch and the gameplay is finely tuned and addictive & varied enough to keep you playing for hours and coming back for more. From the slick menus to the creative, psychedelic 3-dimensional level designs and variety of ways to approach them, it's clear the developers put a lot of love and effort into this. However, what impressed me most wasn't the polished presentation, but rather the variations on the basic types of gameplay modes and how they translate over to 3 dimensions. There are still flat-surfaced levels, but on the 3D stages, you (and your enemies, the types and behaviors of which are vast) have command of the entire surface which is sometimes covered with stragetically placed walls and other interactive objects. This opens up worlds of new possibilities, and the developers clearly explored a large amount of them. In fact, a recent free update (in which \"Evolved\" was added to the game's subtitle) introduced even more level designs. With the attention to detail and sheer amount of gameplay elements - some of which are continually being added - you really get the feeling that this is a labor of love for the folks at Sierra.\n\nI'd like to address a very common complaint I've noticed: the difficulty. When I first started playing this, I agreed that it was insanely difficult and the learning curve too steep, but after spending a few hours with it, I felt increasingly comfortable and began to advance quite quickly through the adventure mode. In fact, a few days after getting this, I revisited those early stages I initially had so much trouble with and wound up getting the full 3 star score on all of them with relative ease. It's true that the amount of enemies on screen at one time and the frantic pace at which the game operates can be extremely overwhelming to people not used to it (as can the cheesy techno soundtrack), but it is not impossible. If you have at least decent hand-eye coordination and a twin-stick controller (and I cannot stress how important it is to use a modern, dual analog stick controller like the Xbox 360's with this game), rest assured, you'll get the hang of it.

As a past player of all three games, Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions hits the mark and goes a mile beyond offering a very solid game on all planes. Gameplay, visuals, music and all, it has risen to my top pick of the Geometry Wars series.\n\nThe gameplay is snappy, responsive and most importantly: intense. The contents is the same as per Geometry Wars -- shoot varius geometric shaped enemies with defined characteristics in a given plane. The number and diversity of enemies increases as you fend yourself off, which will have you clenching your input device as you weave yourself around the plane. As well as an array of classic modes found in past games, Dimensions has also included a story mode.\n\nThe nature of story mode might seem a bit head scratching at first, but its execution makes it feel like a natural extension of the game's experience. Each mission tweaks the contraints of the level and offers a unique twist to the game's original gameplay. What kind of plane you play on, the enemies you may see/how they spawn, and other quirks vary from level to level, which offers some good variety. Also seen is a feature called drones which is little bot that assists you in story mode missions. This feature is a neat addition as it allows the player to change its behaviour and upgrade its abilities using points accumulated through playing missions.\n\nLeaderboard support is also well implemented. Every mode in classic has a leaderboard as well as every single mission in story mode has its own leaderboard -- both global and friends. For anyone who loves to score attack and compete with friends or others around the globe, this game has you covered.\n\nAll in all, Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions is absolutely amazing. It takes the elements of what makes Geometry Wars immensely enjoyable then builds upon it and gives it a refreshing polish.\n\nNotable features:\n-Addictively intense gameplay\n-Responsive controls\n-Loads of leaderboards\n-Great visual polish\n-Music that fits the mood\n-Online Multiplayer and Local 4 Player\n\nShortcomings:\n-Many story mode gameplay mechanics and enemies are exclusive to that mode\n-Leaderboards are not available through Steam Community web interface\n\nRating: pineapple/10 (aka RTFR: Read the fine review)", "timestamp_created": 1427952552, "timestamp_updated": 1443409592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15164961": {"recommendationid": "15164961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039235805", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512270831}, "language": "english", "review": "Its like a sci fi movie with better bbq's.

I played the original on Xbox 360 but that's about it, so I can't really compare the mechanics to other games, but I've mostly enjoyed my time with GW3 so far.\n\nIts quite a simple game, with no story to speak of. The player controls some kind of spaceship and has to shoot a variety of differently coloured enemies while trying to earn a high score. Destroyed enemies will leave behind \"geoms\" which can be collected to increase the score multiplier. You die instantly if anything touches you and there are usually dozens of enemies on screen at a time, so its all about learning the movement pattern and speed of each enemy type, to avoid them.\n\nThere are 50 levels in adventure mode, which give you star ratings based on your score. Bosses are locked until you earn enough stars on previous levels, which normally I would consider to be a cheap way of extending a game, but GW3 gets away with it because most levels only last 2-3 minutes so replaying them isn't a massive inconvenience. There are also 5 \"classic\" modes that only have 1 map each, so their only goal is to set a high score.\n\nThe controls are designed to work best with a gamepad, so I used my 360 controller. You move with left stick and aim with right stick, and have super weapons on the two triggers which can be used a couple of times per level. You've got a supernova that instantly destroys everything on screen, and one other which the player chooses from a range of options. I liked the homing missiles because when the action gets really crazy, I didn't want to worry about aiming. I tried the mines and black hole but didn't really find a good use for them.\n\nYou can also choose between several drones that fly around and help you. The attack drone shoots enemies, and is useful when you need a bit of extra firepower, but I mostly used the drone that automatically collects geoms because the score multiplier is absolutely essential for earning stars.\n\nThe big feature for GW3 is the 3D design of the levels. While it looks impressive, it can sometimes have a negative impact on the gameplay. What I found is that many enemies spawn in places I couldn't see, so on small maps, fast moving enemies could kill me before I could react, and on large maps that have a time limit, hunting for an unseen enemy wastes valuable seconds.\n\nThe music is a good match for the fast paced action and I didn't notice any major bugs. Value for money is good. I finished the adventure mode in around 8 hours, and genre fans could probably spend countless more hours chasing high scores on the leaderboards for every map. And just before I was ready to post this review I've seen an article on IGN saying more levels will be released as a free update towards the end of March.\n\nOverall I think Geometry Wars 3 is a pretty good game, and worth checking out if you're in the mood to just turn off your brain, relax, and shoot stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1426633923, "timestamp_updated": 1426633923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14939368": {"recommendationid": "14939368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090526112", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480890671}, "language": "spanish", "review": "peor que la droga, podes estar 4 horas en un nivel para mejorar tu puntuacion y te parece que paso un minuto 10/ fuking 10", "timestamp_created": 1426628323, "timestamp_updated": 1426628323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14935016": {"recommendationid": "14935016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016003941", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474488508}, "language": "english", "review": "the layout of the menu (or lack of) within this game frustrates me. not a bad little game but man...finding the options, knowing how to apply a loadout?!?!?

I was a big fan of the original GW and even played a ton of it when it premiered as an easter egg in Project Gotham Racing. I didn't play the subsequent sequels (I think GW2 and another one?), so my experience with the new mechanics in this is about as fresh as can be.\n\nI like the variety and challenge of the main campaign mode: 50 levels of increasing difficulty, each with their own theme. The introduction of a little helper that can shoot extra bullets or help collect geoms is a welcome addition, as well as the new types of bombs available. I feel like the boss fights are well done and interesting as far as trying to get multiple stars on for unlocking later levels. Revisiting them with new power ups makes for a different experience as well. Some levels that can seem overwhelming at first make a lot more sense when you approach them with new or upgraded gear.\n\nThe other two campaign modes are also fun in their own right. Ultimate mode introduces a lot of new enemies and types of arenas to play in, as well as some interesting new game modes. Hardcore mode doesn't allow for the use of an alternate super or a helper; just you, bombs and super-states. Both new campaigns feel just right in their length and don't overstay their welcome with repeated or uninteresting game modes.\n\nThe re-introduction of evolved classic with the Evolved update is a welcome sight. No geoms to worry about and mostly classic enemies make for a simplified, albeit lower scoring experience. The old strategy of black hole management still works too!\n\nThere are local co-op modes available, which is a welcome sight to see for PC games. Even if co-op and the 'story' modes (there isn't really a story, just numbered levels, which is fine for this game) modes aren't your jam, there are still 5 different modes you can play in an arcade-style fashion to beat your friends scores at.\n\nLike any game that has online leaderboards, the global top spots are sometimes riddled with hackers, so it's best to just compare how you do against your friends. I don't think the new campaigns have been hit by people hacking their scores into impossibly high numbers yet, so those might be more worthwhile to try to get a top 10 world record score.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic game, even at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1424913077, "timestamp_updated": 1430533347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14603175": {"recommendationid": "14603175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004421245", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506796102}, "language": "english", "review": "In this review I'm focusing on comparing this game between Geometry Wars 2 so this review for you - like me - had tons of fun with the second one and are trying to figure out if this one is worth a buy. \nWhy not compare to the first one? Because the second one was for me a direct follow up, improving the first one and not so many added features. This one should be approached as something completely different - mostly...\n\nGeometry Wars 3: Dimension introduces \"dimensions\", which is not as fun as it sounds. Instead of shooting these bastard flying alien geometry-forms in a fenced rectangular area, you are doing the same but on 3D objects (/maps), sometimes a wavy format of the \"original\" rectangular map. \n\nDon't get me wrong here, the concept is good, but in practice this get annoying to say the least. Problems like visability is encountered constantly on many, if not all maps. MAINLY because the map must always be just big enough so it can fit your screen, which often leaves out 40% of the screen for a wallpaper. And i get that if you don't have the \"shape\" of the map visible there would be problem to navigate. A fix to this could be to scale down everything on the map, but no, they have not even considered scaling anything down, maybe because of the PC-release with smaller monitors.\n\nExcept from this the theme of \"dimension\" is within every inch of your screen from the moment you start the game which unfortunatly came in the way of the beautiful background on the second game and replaced it with a moving grid which is just one annoying thing that draws your attention away from the basic gameplay.\nYou are (on every map i think) in this kind of pit or hole in the ground which is meant to reflect your impact on the surface of the map.

The developers found it prudent to actually open up the majority of the game to scrubs like me.\n\nThis merits giving it another chance, and I've already switched my recommendation from \"no\" to \"yes\".\n\nEDIT AGAIN:\n\nNew first impressions are...surprising? I seem to be doing considerably better than last time. I two-starred the first two levels on my first attempt of each, which I don't seem to recall doing until at least a handful of attempts last time around. This isn't really with any memory benefit either; the extent of my memory of the game mechanics is \"left stick to move, right stick to shoot, and the green guys dodge your shots\". Given that a major update has been released since my last foray (which, of course, is the entire reason for the revisit), I'm honestly not sure if I've gotten better or the game has just gotten easier.\n\nThe twin-stick shooter is still as fun as its ever been. It's high-octane fun at all times. There's not much that compares to blasting a wave of enemies down in a single second and eating up their multiplier boosts. On the flip side, there's not much that compares to blasting down all but one enemy in a wave, swooping in to collect multiplier boosts, then getting killed by the aforementioned straggler.\n\nThe multiplier boosts, paired with their quick de-spawn time, makes for high-risk, high-reward gameplay, since picking them up almost always means you have to get uncomfortably close to enemies.\n\nEDIT ONCE MORE:\n\nFinal notes: Geometry Wars 3 is still pretty hard, but it has thankfully left the realm of near-impossibility. This game has an [i]extremely[/i] high skill cap; you could probably play a level ten thousand times and still be able to eke out a few more points if you did things slightly better. (It's just [i]begging[/i] to be TAS'ed)\n\nAs far as design goes, Geometry Wars is masterclass. It does a lot of things right, including things that most players aren't going to notice are things done right. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better twin-stick shooter.\n\nThere are a few things I'm tempted to complain about, but all of them are things that make Geometry Wars, Geometry Wars. For example, how frustrating some of the \"Score X points in one life\" levels are, given that a single mistake means failure. Most of the levels are short, and retrying is quick, so while frustrating, it's not intentionally frustrating.\n\n(Original unedited review below.)\n\n\n\nThis game is [i]****ing impossible[/i].\n\nIt's not a badly designed game. It's not a poorly controlled game. It's just impossible.\n\nThe \"adventure mode\" contains a total of 50 stages. In each stage, you can earn up to three stars based on your score. The one-star score is a reasonable score, and you might be able to reach it on your first attempt. The two-star score is a very difficult score and will require at least a few attempts, as well as near-perfect play for at least the first half of the game (this is due to the way your score multiplier works; pump it super high early on and you can afford a couple mistakes later). The three-star score is a hyper-difficult score that theoretically requires perfection; I'm not a perfectionist, and I never got a three-star.\n\nNormally, all you have to do is reach the one-star score on a stage and you can proceed. However, every fifth stage is a boss stage, and you need to have a certain number of stars (in addition to clearing all stages up to it) in order to enter. The 10th stage requires 16 stars. Because 9 stages preceed it, you can earn a maximum of 27 by then. You'll need to attain 7 out of 18 \"extra\" stars. I managed a total of 13 stars before I was ready to throw the controller.\n\nOh yeah, there's also the classic modes, virtually identical to those found in Geometry Wars 2.\n\nLOST STORY SHORT:\n\nAre you a total bad***, an arcade god, a sheriff of the sticks? (Or a TASer?) Get this game.\n\nAre you looking for a good dual-stick shooter, but aren't in the top 1% of gamers? Get Geometry Wars 2, which is pretty much just as hard, but at least lets you access the entire game.\n\nNeither of the above?

Sure, you can go slay dragons in another game and feel perhaps a greater supremacy and satisfaction, but there's no denying the satisfaction you gain when you finally finish a level with 3 stars you've been retrying for the past hour or so. Sometimes you just have to take a step back from the world on the inside of your monitor, and enjoy a game for what it actually is: a bunch of shapes.\n\nOh, I should actually explain what you're getting? Well, for a measly 15 bucks (almost 20 in AUD) you get a twin stick shooter with you as a measly little shape, armed with a laser against hordes of geometry shapes. Battle will happen on a multitude of single player challenges, where you fly about and destroy everything you possibly can, scoop up the green scraps and destroy even more for more green scraps. Blowing stuff up gives you points. Green scraps gives you multiplier. You can't do without either. And if that's not enough, you can even bring some friends along with you to make your war against the shapes easier... or perhaps more interesting, as you steal both kills and geoms from your rivals. Your score is the only thing that matters. Oh, did I mention there are some boss battles?\n\nBut I'll admit, the game won't last you as long as some of the bigger games of today. Or maybe it will? Alas, the thrill of beating scores over and over will eventually burn out. There's no denying that. But for a mere fraction of the price of bigger titles, you really shouldn't pass this up.

Now it\u2019s running properly - it does feel like a whole new game!\n\nResponsiveness is spot on, fast, instant, allowing your reflexes to kick in. I felt right at home like I was playing the same Retro Evolved in gorgeous neon high definition, three dimensional landscapes. No longer is it a flat grid, it bends & warps and also introduces other fully 3D geometric shapes (such as spheres, cylinders, squares & many more). These are awesome fun to play & cannot be overstated enough how much positive impact they have in the game design. Each of these offer a unique challenge, requiring different tactics or strategy as you adjust your shooting around the shapes/curves. Makes it harder, but keeps it interesting.\n\nSpeaking of harder .. [b]Dimensions[/b] is one of the toughest shooters I have played in a long time. In the Adventure mode [i](series of 50 levels to unlock, including power-ups & bosses)[/i], I got stuck on the first level for quite some time [i](can't remember the last time I got stuck on the first mission on a game :lol:)[/i]. I like to consider myself a little above average with my shooters but this one I am finding is hardcore! Its too early to see if the high difficulty will discourage longer term, repeat play [i](or perhaps have the opposite effect)[/i], but for now I am still making progress. Along with the Adventure mode, you also have a bunch of classic modes [i](e.g. King, Pacifism, Deadline, Evolved)[/i] to try from previous Geometry War titles, local co-op & an online multiplayer mode. Good variety & certainly more than previously offered in the series.\n\nEnemy designs remain largely the same & you will notice many classics that you love to hate. There are some new enemies too. Each has a unique pattern, unique shape & colour making them instantly recognisable even when things get hectic. There are times though, were things get too crazy with all the enemies, fireworks & geoms on the screen but it\u2019s at the right intensity & is balanced well.\n\nThe overall quality [i](technical issue aside)[/i] can be seen throughout, from the eye-popping gorgeous graphics, energetic music & effects to the little refinements like being able to press 'X' straight after your last life to restart level instantly [i](no menus needed)[/i]. Results are a real joy to experience, one that I think has raised the bar for twin-stick shooters for 2015; much like Waves did in my view a couple years back.\n\nWorthy addition to the Geometry War series.\n\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TrueBlueReviews#curation]If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow [u]True Blue Reviews[/u] for more recommendations![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1420864427, "timestamp_updated": 1453688007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785541", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13908205": {"recommendationid": "13908205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011658620", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516982409}, "language": "english", "review": "A game where you shoot random shapes with a ship that is itself made of shapes.

You basically control a little ship flying along  a 3-dimensional map while shooting brightly neon colored enemies and collecting small little gems(that the game calls \"geoms\") that increase your highscore and give you multipliers. Along the way you can defeat bosses(that are pretty interesting in their own right, and serve to break up the 'shoot this and get this score' pretty well), play other game modes(pacifism is my favorite) and play online. \n\nGeometry Wars 3 is a fun arcade style shooter with a colorful retro artstyle, great gameplay, and a pretty dope techno soundtrack, for 15$ it's a steal and would make a great gift for any gamer or steam user(if you've avoided getting your holiday shopping done until the last moment.)\n\nPROS:\n\n-Artstyle, the game just looks good \n\n-Soundtrack\n\n-Some of the best feeling arcade style controls I ever got from a keyboard and mouse.\n\n-Gameplay is immensely enjoyable, you don't even have to like video games to enjoy it since it's basically an arcade game(and everyone loves arcade games) My father and mother(who are both well into their 50's) were able to play this with ease and enjoy it because of how simple it is\n\n-Great use of 3D maps, the cylinder one is especially trippy and the first one most people run into that breaks up the gameplay so well\n\nCONS: \n\nThe game doesn't have much in ways of direct faults, but however things that should be noted and things I felt that could have been improved that aren't necessarily bad.\n\n-This game is very much a 'quckie game' this is not something you buy and expect to have a full varied expierence with or be able to play for a couple of hours. Geometry Wars 3 is something you boot up in windowed mode and play when you want to kill 30 minutes before closing it, and for 15$, that's ok.\n\n-After a week of playing and going through classic mode and all of the other game modes, the game becomes pretty boring. There's achievements and highscores, but that's it. Expect this game to start gathering dust in your Steam Library under your games that have much more meat to them after a month or so.\n\n-Whenever I played, no one was ever playing the online mode(up to you if this is a con or not, depending if you even care about online modes in games or not)\n\nOverall, I would give it a solid 8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1419211919, "timestamp_updated": 1419212066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465587", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13501519": {"recommendationid": "13501519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162091837", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456032083}, "language": "english", "review": "So great to have Geometry Wars back!

Its flaw is that it comes across as unfair.

That or you run the high risk of dying immediately after switching sides due to running into an enemy you could have easily avoided if you could have seen him. The signal you get that an enemy is about to spawn is pretty short too, so more than a couple times I died just because an enemy spawned on top of me. There are also special abilities such as having a minion that collects geoms (the green diamonds that increase your multiplier) or placing mines on the battlefield. This sounds cool too, but it just makes the screen too busy. In Geometry Wars 1 &2, it was easy to make snap judgments on where it was safe and where it wasn't; the green geoms are safe to grab, nothing else. But now you have your geome-collecting minion flying around on his own, and your mines place around the battlefield, and in the heat of battle it is too difficult to make out what 3 things on the battlefield are okay to run into out of the 20 things on screen.\n\nFrustrating is part of the genre, but feeling like your death was unfair and out of your hands is not fun.", "timestamp_created": 1419037036, "timestamp_updated": 1419037036, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467840", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13435679": {"recommendationid": "13435679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122106169", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497439307}, "language": "german", "review": "wieder mal ein gelungener teil der geometry wars saga lob an die entwickler.

Almost whole - the devs seem to have taken out local co-op from it, for some reason, and you should absolutely hold it against them*.\n If you haven't played it and don't have access to a console, and a score-attack twin-stick shooter set on small arenas sounds like something that you may even marginally enjoy, you should consider it essential. The feel of the game is perfect, and the mechanical flourishes for the different modes are absolutely brilliant.\n\n That's classic mode. As for this new sequel: The new modes are ok; some bits are good fun- otheres, not so much. The main change was to map the arenas to a 3D shape, a couple of new modes, a (non-story-based) campaign linking short levels, upgradeable companion drones from a Wii-only version of the game, and... boss battles.\n\n I have a theory on how boss battles were introduced. There's this high-profile consultant - let's call him Pat - who's brought in whenever a game studio doesn't know what to do with a beloved franchise.\n \"So, Pat,\" they'll say, \"we're terrified of screwing this up what's essentially a perfect arcade experience. How should we go about this?\"\n Pat tuts paternally, and responds \"What you need to do is to make the game yours.\"\n The developers nod enthusiasthically; \"We've actually got a few ideas we can introduce organically-\"\n \"Hold it.\" Pat says, and it stops them cold. \"Don't be timid. How do you mark something as yours?\"\n Silence.\n \"You piss on it!\" Pat screams. \"You spray it with your urine until it's soaked through!\"\n \"Well,\" the devs say, \"I don't know if we want to...\"\n Pat's adamant. \"How can you piss on this game? How can you get it good and wet and yellow and pungent with the sweet, sweet aroma of ammonia?\"\n \"Hmm, we did talk about putting in boss battles...\"\n \"Excelent!\" screams Pat. \"Make them multi-stage, long, and really annoying!\"\n \"Annoying?\"\n \"Sure - frustration creates attachment! Our studies show that that's the reason people like Dark Souls.\"\n \"OK!\" The devs are on-board now, and excited. \"What about gating progress behind star ratings, so that players need to replay levels to be able to progress?\"\n Pat takes a drag from his cigar, and almost purrs. \"That's some grade-A weewee, son.\"\n\n\n*: Unless I'm being thick and I missed it.

I feel like in their little office they were just coming up with ideas for marketing ploys and said \"hey why don't we take geometry wars make a sequel and make it totally way over digitalized for the younger generation.\" By this, I mean they went out of their way to make some different songs all that have the standard bass beat line you would hear in any normal techno song. For some it might not be bad, but compared to the music they have put into this game to the original Geometry wars (they remixed that too, btw they should have just kept that one alone I can't even get into the remix version) music it just gets irritating. I don't like how in arcade mode even though you have just the flat 2d square they have to make the camera all warped. Really, I played this for thirty minutes, then bought Geometry Wars retro evolved for $4 (But please, read more)\n\nGoing on to positive side now.\n\nOnce you get to levels 10 and up in adventure mode, the get actually gets pretty hard. Which I am sure will entertain old veteran Geometry Wars fans. It takes some getting used to but it is great fun. I admit I had my doubts, I did buy retro evolved shortly after purchasing this game out of dissapointment. But then I gave this game more of a chance, I got to the first boss battle, then the second, and then things got interesting. I won't spoil much of it but I will say if you are an old old geometry wars veteran then you should consider buying both this game and the retro evolved version as you will find yourself wanting to play both version. This game has a good amount of replayability but I still think people will crave the old retro evolved version time to time, as at times you will get frustrating with the difficulty of having to unlock stars for further stages.\n\nAll in all, it is a good game and I don't regret my purchase.

In all seriousness its more Geo Wars that you love with a whole new adventure mode thats basically 50 smaller game modes in one with their own leaderboards PLUS all the Geo Wars 2 game modes (dubbed \"Classic\" modes).  The adventure mode also allows you to have one of 5 types of drones that can be paired with any one of 5 \"special\" abilities, its pretty cool.  The dollar spent per hour ratio should be pretty low with this one if its your type of game (twin-stick shooter).  A gamepad is necessary to play to maximize your scores.  My only three minor complaints are:\n\n1) that the graphics are not as nice or updated as I would have hoped,  In general the graphic style is more understated and less colorful and flashy, like pastel colors or something.  This does generally create better contrast when stuff gets crazy but it still just doesnt look as cool and trippy as you would have hoped waiting 6 years for a sequel to Geo Wars 2.\n\n2): Theres an enemy type they brought back from Geo Wars 1 (the little purple triangular shaped things that swarm you by the thousands from the 4 corners of the screen), except now they are orangey yellow color and can be hard to distinguish from geoms, thus you can be collecting geoms and BAM a single little triangle thingy is in the mass of geoms and you dont see it and die.\n\n3) On the 3-d levels I found the camera to be kind of stiff (especially on cubes) and something off about it since you can see a background behind the plane or shape you are fighting on and thus the camera isnt as locked to your ship as before and somehow at first I found the game to be almost nauseating looking at stuff, took me an hour or two to get used to it.  Im sorry Im having a hard time describing it.  In general though, I also feel Stardust HD on the ps3 did a better job with 3d battlegrounds.

The classic play types are still there, and the rest of the game is fun, but you'll spend hours grinding the same levels for just a few more points so you can get enought starts to continue the game.  Besides the 3D twist, and some modes like infection (I think that's what it's called), the mecanics aren't really as solid as the previous versions because they still rely on assumptions that were true when the playfield was 2D.  Have fun dying 10,000 times because some enemy you couldn't have possibly seen comes flying around the corner of the cube and the camera angle is fixed overhead.\n\nI respect that the creators had a tough task to expand the series, but there are a lot of places where the older games (esp. 2) were a lot more *fun.*  I found myself saying \"this isn't fun\" too many times while trying to play the single player campaign.  There are some creative and fun modes, but having to play the same level 10 or 15 additional times to squeeze out 10,000 extra points or whatever to advance puts a huge damper on it.\n\nDespite this, it is still geometry wars, and it still touches on a lot of the right notes, but do yourself a favor and have your kid brother/cousin whatever play through all the single player levels so you can go back and pick and play just the ones that are fun.\n\nOne last gripe: the PC port is lacking.  If you're playing with the keyboard, why can't you set space bar to bomb?  Why does the game show you what buttons to hit as if you're playing with an XBOX One controller?  Good luck figuring out what keys are left and right trigger & bumper.  Also, resolution is fixed, etc., rabble rabble rabble...\n\nIf you're a fan of the series like I am, go buy this because you have to and you were going to anyway.

That clone isn't available any more, so I am extremely happy to buy and play the official Game, third installment.\n\nI read through various reviews, especially negative ones, and understand the criticism. But to me as a casual player who would be happy with only the classic mode and needs games that run on Linux, this is probably one of the best shooters I can get.\n\nThe gameplay is basically always the same, there is a limited number of enemies, but I don't care. For me, this game is about hand-eye coordination, being able to read complex and hectic situations, and getting in the \"zone\". I can't say I have reached that level yet, it will probably take many many hours to be able to make millions of points in a zen-like state, and maybe at that level I will also notice the supposedly sluggish controls and inaccurate hitboxes. So... if you're a pro gamer, or familiar with the geometry wars series, read the negative reviews I guess.

If you never played Geometry Wars, you should probably fix that right now.\n\nDimensions has a lot of different ways of playing. 5 out of 6 modes from GW2 are found in Classic mode, and Adventure mode is where the new 3-D playfields, support drones, and drone 'supers' are found. The first drone you get is a little ship that supplements your main ship with a bit of extra firepower. The first super drops mines all over the field for enemy shapes to run into. Every other drone and super all do something along those lines. \n\nNew fields are nice, but present some challenges that take a bit of getting used to. It can be hard to see around an edge of the playfields (like the cube), but luckily you can prefire around the edges and be at least a little safer. \n\nI am finding the playfields harder for me to read than previous Geometry Wars games. It helps that you have a bit more time to see a spawning enemy before it actually spawns, but the way even 2-D fields tilt a little bit can be, well, tilting.\n\nGeometry Wars is also the only game where I actually care about leaderboards. The game isn't predictable, so replaying a level over and over is not a chore. It helps that every GW game is a masterclass in escalation of challenge. \n\nNot much else to say. I love Geometry Wars a lot, and I haven't been able to play it since being separated from my Xbox. If you enjoyed it in the past, this is an excellent way to fill 5 minutes or 5 hours.

Each level has a certain classic mode attached to it; sometimes you'll be playing Deadline, sometimes Evolved, sometimes stuff like Titan where you have to break up large versions of shapes that break off into clusters of smaller versions of themselves. The levels also take on shapes other than a flat board, such as a sphere, a cylinder, a board with windows or walls that spin, and such.\n\nThe worst part of Adventure Mode are the bosses. The conditions for beating a boss are as follows; you have only one life and must survive and you must defeat the boss in a limited amount of time. You start with a certain amount of time (30-ish seconds) to drain the boss's lifebar. Once you do, it pulses a ring that will kill you if you are too close and the boss becomes invulnerable for a short time before going to its next phase. Enemies will spawn during this entire time. It's a little irritating and they're required if you want to unlock drones and supers and continue into the later stages.\n\nEach stage also has 3 stars you must earn to continue beyond a certain point. You can only get these stars, however, if you upgrade your drones and supers so that you can score faster. Drones can shoot, lay mines, collect score multipliers, and do a few other things for you. This can be annoying, as sometimes you probably can't finish a level with 3 stars unless you spend time grinding geoms to upgrade your stuff (and you WILL have to do so unless you're highly skilled).\n\nIn the end, Adventure Mode is a cool bonus that will add a lot of replay time. I didn't get a chance to try multiplayer, however, as there were no games open when I tried.\n\nIf you've read this review and you're still on the fence, try out Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved.

You find yourself constantly replaying levels going \"I can do better.\" I love everything about it. Not only is the score-chasing a thrill, but the actual twin-stick shooting mechanics have always been the best in the genre. If twin-stick shooters were ecstacy, Geometry Wars would be molly. Pure bliss.\n\nBoth Geometry Wars 2 and 3 have added new things to the series. Geometry Wars 2 added several new modes, and they started to include Geoms to increase your multiplier. This was probably created to attempt to get players to not do the strategy that was pretty much required to do well in the first game, which was just flying in a circle and kiting the enemies behind you. It wasn't very dynamic, but adding Geoms into the mix makes it to where you can play riskier to increase your multiplier before they disappear. Now the third game comes along and adds this adventure mode where tons of new modes are added, AND all the previous modes from Geometry Wars 2 are available as well.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and I can't wait to sink even more hours into it.

As for me, I regard Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved [1] as the gold standard of the franchise (and all twin-stick shooters). I ultimately did not like Geometry Wars 2 for its departures from GW:RE1, and I don't like GW3 for the same reasons and more. If you have never played Geometry Wars, you will probably like GW3, but I recommend Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, instead. It is available here on Steam for just $4 full price. Unfortunately there are no online leaderboards, but the gameplay is far superior to GW3.\n\nHere are the pros and cons of GW3:\n\nPros\n[list]\n[*]Good PC port. I didn't have any performance issues even at high levels.\n[*]Creative leaderboard stuff. Giving an indication on the overworld when a friend beats your score is brilliant. It is missing an \"overall\" leaderboard, however.\n[*]Inclusion of classic modes. For the purists out there.\n[*]Drones. I lked this feature in the lesser known Geometry Wars: Galaxies, and am glad to see a bit of customization return to GW.\n[*]The 3D maps are a good addition and work well. It actually isn't any harder to navigate or see what's going on than the 2D maps.\n[/list]\n\nNeutral:\n[list]\n[*]I would list online multiplayer as a pro, but I haven't been able to find a match as of this writing. The description of the Summoner mode sounds like a good implementation, though.\n[*]The quick restart button. This is a great feature, but why in the world is it ONLY available at the end of levels? This isn't a new idea; other games have instant restart buttons available to the player at all times. It's not like the X button does anything else during gameplay. It's as if they did extra work to make a \"great\" new feature just \"OK.\"\n[/list]\n\n\nCons\nThe gameplay changes made from 1 to 2 apply to number 3 as well, so I will first list my gripes with GW:RE2 that also apply to GW3.\n\n[list]\n[*]The gun's firepower is much narrower, fires fewer bullets per shot, and fires fewer shots per second than in GW:RE1. The number of enemies you can potentially keep away is therefore much smaller, even if you play perfectly. It is therefore artificially difficult.  GW2 and GW3 prioritized pretty 3D graphics over maximizing gameplay--style over substance.\n[*]I like the idea of geoms, but they are not implemented correctly. I don't like that 1 geom = 1x multiplier. They should be like points in GW:RE1--every so many geoms, your multiplier goes up by one up to a limit. Making the scoring system so exponential rewards the end game too much at high levels. You are able to collect geoms from enemies when you use a smart bomb, but not when you die. This is the opposite of how it should be. This way greatly rewards you for giving up and using your last resort bomb and severely punishes you for sticking it out as long as possible.\n[/list]\n\nAnd here are my gripes that are new to GW3, in order of most to least egregrious. Some are patchable without a leaderboard wipe. I will update my review if these issues are addressed.\n\n[list]\n[*]None of the new modes is any fun.\n[*]There are no extra lives to be earned in any level in Adventure Mode. Every level is either a set number of lives (usually just 1) or timed. This is not in the spirit of Geometry Wars. For all intents and purposes, you cannot earn extra bombs either (I noticed one extra bomb in one level).\n[*]There is a 5-second-long, unskippable animation before every game. I have probably wasted half an hour just waiting for my games to start. Any \"feature\" that keeps the player from playing is a terrible idea.\n[*]Super States disappear if you die. This means dying a second after a Super State spawns is punished much more severely than dying 2 seconds earlier. I don't think the player should punished for pushing game without a bomb.\n[*]Bullets expire before hitting an enemy or wall, even in Classic Mode. There is no reason for this on wall-bound levels.\n[*]There are no new enemy types to speak of.\n[*]Poor visual fidelity. Mayflies and crosses strongly resemble geoms. You can easily mistake your drone for an enemy, too. Black holes can camoflauge pinwheel spawns. White Diamond and Pink Square spawns look very similar. I have not had these problems with previous games.\n[*]No in-game VSync option. You have to be clever and edit your graphic card settings to disable VSync (to reduce effective input lag). \n[*]Black holes make no sound at all. The black hole sound used to be either very satisfying (if you destroy it) or alarming (if it blows up). This was not the case in GW2 as far as I can remember. Again, it's like work went into undoing a good thing.\n[/list]\n\nTL;DR Read the first paragraph. The gameplay changes made since GW:RE1 make Geometry Wars 3 unnecessarily frustrating and artificially difficult. Before you dismiss me as a noob complaining about difficulty, check my leaderboard scores in this or other GW games, or watch this video of me getting a Global #1:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5eXW8tg9Vs", "timestamp_created": 1417232266, "timestamp_updated": 1417360681, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13132373": {"recommendationid": "13132373", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996125051", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485922835}, "language": "english", "review": "Not the same kind of experience as the previous two. \n\nAll of the new modes are trapped within the adventure mode, and you need to grind through them in a specific order to unlock them. The other reviews will tell how difficult it is to progress through the first batch.\n\n The progression system fosters more of a sense of \"oh crap I didn't get a good enough score to move on\" or \"about time I got that score\" rather than the \"ooh I didn't beat my highscore, better try again\" or \"wow that's a great score!\" that GW 1 and 2 had. \n\nIf you need progression systems to feel like you've accomplished something in a game, then GW 3 will do you just fine. But if you're self-confident enough to simply get better enough for the sake of getting better, than do NOT buy this game. It will take all the intrinsic motivation right out.\n\n\n\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\nI'm one of those people who has always wondered why each game in a series doesn't have every single option or gamemode the previous one had. It bothered me tremendously when halo 3 didn't have any variant of blood gulch. \nI feel kind of the same with this game; Geometry Wars 3 seems to have omitted some things which I considered central to the second game. \n\nAs far as new content, Geometry Wars 3 has the 3-dimensional playing spaces, such as spheres or peanut shaped things of some sort. That's neat, and I'm interested to play them all. However, the game is trying to get some sort of campaign/unlock system implimented, which I honestly thoroughly despise. Instead of just having a menu where you choose which gamemode and which shape you want to play on, you need to progress one by one through various combinations of game type/shape in the \"adventure mode.\" I used to be excited to play on these new shapes, but I in NO WAY wanted to ever have to unlock anything in a Geometry Wars game. Now I have to. I'll be playing the game anyway, but now it feels like a chore, and will probably take away a lot of the intrinsic value I originally got from simply playing.\n\nCo-op options such as one player piloting and the other shooting are missing, and again, you need to progress through an adventure mode before you have any control at all over what game type/shape you play co-op on. I find this irritating because I have really always considered this franchise to be an arcade-style dual stick shooter, and now it feels more like a mobile game. It even implements the star system from angry birds or cut the rope.\n\nIt seems there's no way to do custom games modes of any kind, which is annoying considering that there's so many different factors now. Instead of just gamemode, you also have different geometric shapes to play on. When combined with the original 5 gamemodes, it seems like a no-brainer to just have a menu to select shape, select game, and get going. Granted, you can unlock many of these different combinations by playing through the main adventure mode, but working for it takes some of the joy out of it for me. You COULD play any of the 5 game modes from Geometry Wars 2 in \"classic\" mode, but you can only play on the classic rectangular playing field. So that's a waste of my time. I already own Geometry Wars 2 and frankly it works better.\n\nThe UI is clunkly and needlessly slow, and I think that the art style is a bit distracting. Honestly I don't like it, but that's just a personal thing. I miss the vector lines and the way I felt like I was in cyber space in the original two games. Everything is too blue now and the parts of the grid on the playing field change color to make it look like it's \"reflecting\" or something. It just clutters the screen.\n\nTL DR: there's a progression system in a game I don't really think needs one, and the only step forward (3 dimensional playing fields) seems to have forced a step back in a few other areas. It's still geometry wars. But it's basically the same geometry wars I owned on xbox, with all my favorite features removed.\n\n6/10 only because the elements it kept from the previous games are still fun.", "timestamp_created": 1417223496, "timestamp_updated": 1422553753, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543594", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13132056": {"recommendationid": "13132056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093760033", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511039533}, "language": "english", "review": "An epic game!\nAbsolutely a must get!", "timestamp_created": 1417222061, "timestamp_updated": 1417222061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13129666": {"recommendationid": "13129666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000452945", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519516390}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good and worthy update to GW2:RE, enough \"retroness\" to have some nostalgia of the previous games but also brough bang up to with new graphics and 3d boards. i would like to see the classic modes be playable on the new 3d boards though.", "timestamp_created": 1417212004, "timestamp_updated": 1417212004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.990954", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13127466": {"recommendationid": "13127466", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989857481", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486834191}, "language": "french", "review": "G\u00e9nial !!!\nLe 1 \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 super, ils ont r\u00e9ussi avec le 2 \u00e0 redonner un plus \u00e0 ce titre avec ses diff\u00e9rents modes et la coop.\nDifficile de croire qu'on puisse faire mieux avec un concept de jeu aussi basique...\nEt pourtant , ils l'ont fait !

The title screen alone with its swirling colored auras and a strange vector grid stretching out infinitely before you, the soothing electronic tones of the background music shimmering in and out like waves. Before even getting into the game I can already tell a tremendous amount of work has gone into the look, the feel, and the sounds of the game and have been focused on much stronger in this iteration of the series.\n\nThe progression of adventure mode is much more varied in levels than any of the classic games which will be a welcome addition to new players who craved a more content heavy experience. Across the adventure mode map you'll advance through levels of increasing difficulty and each with an important three star rating based on score. Aside from stars you'll earn points in order to purchase upgrades for your various drones, a newcomer to the Geometry Wars series that offers a number of abilities including back-up fire, mines, or magnetized pickups for the Geoms to keep your score multiplier going and let you focus on the action. \n\nEach new level features a different mode ranging from classic 'Evolved' to new additions like 'Rainbow', with a variation of differently shaped 3D landscapes dotted with rotating pillars, red life stealing walls, and various other obstacles thrown into the mix. Aforementioned stars will be needed to access the various boss stages that break up adventure mode, and they can be quite hard to collect especially if you're not a diehard twinstick player. Bosses feel like a strange and not very Geometry Wars-like addition, but they are nonetheless very intense and flashy with their chaotic bullet hell-like patterns.\n\nThe classic enemies players will remember from the last games are adapted to this new 3D playstyle very well, and their movement patterns flow almost more naturally than before on the spherical landscapes you fight on. The straight-moving arrow enemies wrap around the globe-like levels and criss-cross past each other, while the quick and sporadic square enemies sneak up on you from either side of the rotating stages. In addition to the classic geometrical enemies we've come to love/hate, there are a couple new enemies with unique behavior that spice up your old strategies.\n\nThe shapely structure to the stages that changes with each one gives a more strategic and tactical approach to the twin-stick formula forcing you to adapt to the area and its hazards each time, keeping certain players more engaged than before. Old schoolers will likely miss the euphoric rush and focused score attacks missing in this new iteration, but I've more than warmed up to it, come to terms with the differences and have found new excitement in taking my place on the boards for what is a different kind of game.\n\nGeometry Wars 3 has the variation, gamified progression, and massive content that some people felt was missing from the originals but older fans will more than likely miss the pure and calculated arcade action as well as the minimalistic neon visuals that the first two were known for. While GW3 may not bring the same-old-same-old that those fans were wanting, [b]it does exactly what it's supposed to by pushing boundaries in the twin-stick medium and setting a new standard just as its predecessors did.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1417196026, "timestamp_updated": 1421205872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 180, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857988", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13124079": {"recommendationid": "13124079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016467835", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489782023}, "language": "italian", "review": "Comprato al day one, consiglio questo gioco a tutti coloro che hanno giocato al primo e alla versione \"evolved\", e anche ai neofiti che vogliono un gioco arcade da sala giochi che nella sua immediatezza vi far\u00e0 passare sicuramente ore e ore di divertimento, anche se tutto \u00e8 fuorch\u00e8 un gioco \"semplice\".

This vortex seemed innocuous at first. Nothing seemed to be happening. The farmer had made a small sum charging people to come see it, but people got bored. \"Hey, that's a boring vortex.\" they would say. So they let it be, sitting there quietly humming.\n\nIt would be years before we discovered the horrifying truth. The vortex was in fact syphoning all colour from our video game entertainment. We didn't notice at first because the 1990's had brought a shameful bout of \"Grimdarkness\" to our media, and so we attributed this lack of colour in games to words like \"gritty\", and \"Batman\". We were fools. FOOLS!\n\nLuckily someone did notice, and that person was Sierra, who is not actually a person. They are an old video game company that died and was mysteriously revived from the grave.

For everyone one else, you are in for an Aficionado treat.\n\nAfter 6 long years, the moment I thought never possible is here, as \u2018Lucid Games\u2019 releases to us the next chapter of intense arcade action with Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions. This is the epitome of \u201carcade\u201d gaming, the reason why kids everywhere stood around a cabinet, converted their lunch money into quarters and pumped them into a machine to top each other\u2019s score. If you ever wondered what a \u201cTwin Stick\u201d game is, this is the perfect definition.\n\nWhen \u2018Lucid Games\u2019 announced their latest production, a flood of 2 stick nostalgia and excitement hit me with the force of a round-house kick to the face. The day Steam posted Dimensions for presale, my twin stick senses were tingling as I couldn\u2019t pay for the game fast enough. Waiting for release day, the hardcore fanatics were ranting and raving in the forums and this gave me a minute to reflect as I wondered if I wasn\u2019t over-hyping myself with high expectations for this sequel.  Which lead me to ponder the possibility of disappointment in a game that has a long history, a strong cult following, is a standard model for a Twin Stick Shooter, and a title I\u2019ve dedicated a lot of time to in subsequent versions.\n\nIt was these doubts that made me nervous going into the game and it wasn\u2019t until I started playing it when that familiar flood of nostalgia and excitement came back with the force of a pile-driver. Wow, this is the Geometry Wars that the PC always deserved. The simplistic game play and tight control was always and still is a twin stick enthusiasts dream but for the PC twin stick enthusiast that has been neglected the content the consoles were blessed with by \u2018Bizarre Creations\u2019, Dimensions makes those dreams, a wet one.  \n\nWith that, so you are now aware of where I\u2019m coming from, and as I review this game I will attempt to give it to you as straight factual without the euphoric bias opinions, as much as an enthusiast can be possible. Though, the simplistic game play doesn\u2019t require a complex description as Lucid still used the same model of Geometry Wars gameplay and used a lot facets from the prior versions of the game. Several game modes from the 360\u2019s \u2018Retro Evolved 2\u2019 were used in modes of game play, drone usage, some power ups, and variants of arenas from Nintendo\u2019s \u2018Galaxies\u2019 were also included in this new release. Dimensions does have its uniqueness as the graphics were revamped, they added some 3D mapping, added a couple new enemy models, some new power-ups, a little online team play, and long awaited boss fights. Viola! Now you have Dimensions!\n\nLucid breaks these up in several different modes. Adventure, Classic, Online, Local Co-Op, and Bonus which are outlined below:\n\n[list]\n[*][b]Adventure mode:[/b]\n[/list]\nThis feels like Galaxies though maps are different, even giving us 360 degrees of mapped environmental movement and shooting in some. It take Geometry to new worlds (the 3rd one!) adds a new difficultly to the game, especially for some enemies like those green one\u2019s that were easier trapped on a wall to kill. Going from a 2D arena based shooter the 3D 360 degree mapping arena was aspect I had to get used to, but I was destroying polygons within no time. This mode also adds boss fights which takes Geometry Wars to a whole new level and something I\u2019ve always wished for. Also new to Geometry Wars are some power ups and awesome new types of game play. Overall from the whole game, Adventure mode feels like the most time, thought and effort were put into it. \n\n[list]\n[*][b]Classic mode:[/b]\n[/list]\nStraight from the 360\u2019s \u2018Retro Evolved 2\u2019, you get Deadline, King, Evolved, Pacifism (defying the \u201cshooter\u201d genre) and Waves. Evolved is a slightly different version than the PC version found here on Steam and Waves is also pretty much the same thing that can be found on Project Gotham Racing 3 as a sub-game. The modes are nothing new as they all seem like they were ported straight from the 360 and given a face lift. \n\n[list]\n[*][b]Online mode:[/b]\n[/list]\nAnother first for Geometry Wars and is a limited offering of 2 game modes of play called Stock and Summoner. Both are online team based consisting of 4 players each team. The objectives are simple. In Stock, the first team to destroy the boss wins. In Summoner, teams take over towers for control and the team with the highest score wins. A little disappointing but I\u2019m sure there are more modes coming and being an Activision product, you can almost expect it to be a DLC you will need to pay for. I\u2019ve got my thumbs crossed!\n\n[list]\n[*][b]Local Co-Op mode:[/b]\n[/list]\nThis is basically a variant of Adventure mode, except you play with another player on your PC. It is only 10 missions long and that includes one boss. Again, a little disappointing and likely, another upsell from our friends at Activision. \n\n[list]\n[*][b]Bonus:[/b]\n[/list]\nThese were additional maps that were provided for presale participants. You get 3 and they are basically just variants of existing 3D maps in Adventure mode. Though they have additional features like moving walls, portals and enemies. It\u2019s a minute disappointment but still something I will gladly accept.\n\n[list]\n[*][b]Problems:[/b]\n[/list]\nAll of that is not to say that this game didn\u2019t have its problems. The black holes and explosions are a little lackluster compared to prior versions but my issues with the design are petty. However, the graphic issues are not. Upon first loading the game I noticed some line flickering in the menus. Prior to actual gameplay I always check the settings to verify that they are good for my rig. This part of the menu the graphic options are limited and though I thought no changes were needed, I jumped into game play. The controls felt sluggish, the character sprite movement felt slow, and the overall resolution off compared to the videos and what I was used to with subsequent Geometry Wars. I also confirmed this among other enthusiasts using both AMD and Intel CPU\u2019s as well as Radeon and nVidia GPUs. After tweeking the few graphic options made available, changing the display mode setting from \u201cFull Screen\u201d to \u201cWindowed \u2013 Borderless\u201d fixed the problems and running both windows and Dimensions at 1080, basically looks \u2018Full Screen\u2019 without the problems of \u2018Full Screen\u2019 mode. A minor issue but still one that shouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nOnce the graphic issue were fixed those familiar tight controls felt solid again, the 3D mapping more crisp, the frame rate higher, the game play more \u201caction-y\u201d, and the deaths felt less cheap. \n\n[code]\n[h1][b][u]Overview[/u][/b][/h1]\n[b]Game Play:[/b] Twin Stick 3D Arena Shooter\n[b]Graphics:[/b] Great \u2013 once you get past the issues.\n[b]Sound:[/b] Good \u2013 Dimensions has that familiar but revamped techno thumping sound track, though the sound effects of picking up Geoms gets a little old after a while.  \n[b]Controls:[/b]Freaking Awesome! \u2013 A good, comfortable controller is highly recommended. Dimensions does offer the keyboard and mouse control combo but you lose a lot of the movement angles that that are needed in some modes with the keyboard and is not recommended. \n[b]Replayability:[/b] OMG Yes! I find myself playing one mode over and over, knowing there are over 50 other modes that I love, just to top my friends score. Arcade addiction at its finest!\n[b]Overall: 10/10![/b]\n[/code]\n\nBeside the limited modes and fixable graphic issues, Geometry wars 3: Dimensions is an all-around awesome experience and one I cannot recommend enough to everyone!

Geometry Wars was revolutionary. Geometry Wars 2 brought new modes, new ways to play, and an overall more involved gameplay. Geometry Wars 3 is as revolutionary as the original game, bringing all sorts of gameplay changes, awesome music, sweet visuals, and an outstanding game to play. Be warned though, this game is not easy if you want to just clear through the adventure mode. It is a difficult game, made even more difficult by the graphical changes. The game is not perfect however. The game is not quite as sharp in collision detection, making it close to impossible to pull of the crazy escape tactics in the previous games. Also, the speed of everything has definitely been tweaked, leading to slightly faster speeds and better tracking from enemies as well as a slight slow down of the player. All in all, those are really just my nitpicking, not true cons of the game. It still amazes me that this game exists at all considering the company that developed the previous games has been gone for quite some time. If you are looking for a way to waste many hours or just play a fun game with some awesome music and graphics, check this game out. And one last thing, this game runs outstandingly even on my laptop with a mobile i7 processor and integrated graphics (no frame drop, no lag, no problems at the highest graphical settings, and it looks absolutely glorious).", "timestamp_created": 1417034566, "timestamp_updated": 1499310113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13094226": {"recommendationid": "13094226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049855236", "num_games_owned": 465, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483669028}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the best iteration of Geometry Wars and maybe even the best twin-stick shooter ever", "timestamp_created": 1417034148, "timestamp_updated": 1417034148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13093695": {"recommendationid": "13093695", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968651528", "num_games_owned": 998, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422281910}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been a Geometry Wars fan since the day it released on Xbox Live Arcade.

I can recommend this to anyone that likes Geometry wars even though i do have a few issues with the game but they are just nitpicks because overall the game is fantastic. I do wish that they would have made it more like Geomety Wars Galaxies for Nintendo DS which is the best release to date imo. This is simmilar in a lot of ways but i sitll believe that the DS release is the top GW game out. Adventure mode is fun but the timed stages i'm not to fond of, i'm more of a classic style guy, give me 3 lives and let me go at it but it's still not enough to hurt the gameplay. You get to unlock support drones after beating bosses and upgrade them along the way which is one of my favorite features taken from GW Galaxies. Besides aadventure mode there's a ton of other game types to play including classic, coop and bouns stages.

You also get a companion helper that is slightly more helpful than useless ,who can kill stuff for you or increase your attack power. \n\nThe graphics are obviously much better, as the game is now 3D, but it's a bigger, more challenging version of Geometry Wars 2, with new game mechanics.\n\nMy only complaint is that, being an arcade game, they seem to have developed it on the assumption that it actually takes .25 cents out of your wallet every time you have to restart - some of the difficulty is ridiculous.", "timestamp_created": 1416972676, "timestamp_updated": 1418690481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.324424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13084370": {"recommendationid": "13084370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043972346", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422385313}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addictive!

Don't get me wrong, it's not so bad that it's killing my enjoyment but for some reason the ship just feels a bit more sluggish than usual to control.\n\nThat being said.

I'm running a 4790k/GTX970/16GB DDR3 so nothing should be dropping but I am. It's some minor stutter here and there. It's not enough to completely screw up the game because it happens really fast but you can notice it and it does hurt the flow a bit. The game is also locked to 60FPS so those with 120/144hz monitors keep that in mind (although I have read about a workaround using the NVidia Control Panel to unlock it).\n\nOh and it has Borderless Window mode so if that's a thing you look for it has it! Always great to see that.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nAdventure Mode doesn't seem to have the minor stutter at all. Odd, there is a lot more going on in that. The game is gorgeous too.

That says it all right there, but let me go into finer detail.\n\nGeometry Wars 3 is similar to #2 in a lot of ways, but the biggest addition is 3-D arena shapes rather than the standard 2-D rectangle. Spheres, tubes, globes, warped rectangles and more; It reminds me of Super Stardust HD at times, as well as the '80s arcade classic, Tempest. Also new is the ability to upgrade your ship (only in the Adventure mode) with different helper drones and abilities, and it's rather necessary to do this to achieve three stars on most levels, as well as adding an extra layer of depth in tinkering to come up with the best \"loadout\" to ace a level.\n\nThere is also a classic mode which is quite similar to Geometry Wars 2, which did not receive a PC port, unlike the original. I believe five of the six game modes from Geo Wars 2 are present here, but it's been a few years and I don't quite remember all the modes. Of course there are leaderboards for all these modes, as well as each separate level on Adventure, and leaderboard jockeying is a core part of the Geo Wars experience.\n\nThe controls felt a slight bit sluggish at first, but switching the video mode to 'windowed borderless' made the controls feel instantaneous, every bit as quick as the first two versions if not better. If your controls feel sluggish, read the forum where people are posting various tips and fixes.\n\nGeometry Wars 1 and 2 are among my favorite games of all time, so I had a lot of personal stake in this latest, announced-out-of-nowhere version, hoping it wasn't going to be a quick knock-off based on name alone.

First of all, I must have been late to the party because I've only just found out about the game; let alone being developed by Lucid Games (a company I have no idea on their track record). Alright fine, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt that Sierra can provide good quality control over this game. I wasn't wrong either.\n\nFirst off, I'd recommend you start with Adventure Mode. Why? Because classic mode is pretty much untouched as far as I can see it; sections include Deadline, King, Evolved, Pacifism, and Waves. Sequence? Not this time around, we have Adventure mode to fill that in. And I believe the game shines it's best with this new addition.\n\nSo the first thing you'll notice from the wacky screenshots is the 3D stages. Does this work? Yes, it does and from your first hour it's not hard to see why. First off, they went with the 3D style on everything as opposed to the bright eye-burning sensation that started this series and overloaded in 2 (that was still fun). But saving your eyes will be the least of your worries as you'll try over and over to get that 3rd star in each level. Honestly, the game is pretty simple enough to get the first, if not the second star. But it really hits you when you aim for the last one.\n\nAs you're playing through, you'll notice a few things. First off is the powerups. How will you notice, well visually there is an attackable structure that appears on the map for your ship to fire at. Coupled with that is the voice calling \"super state\" (at least that's what I hear) that blends in well with the music. These super states, which were found in Geometry Wars 2 multiplayer, range from fast attack, double or triple shot, guided shot, or a combination if you destroy two when one's timer isn't used up.\n\nFor those looking for a real nostalgia trip, then rush to the 3rd stage in Adventure Mode. Right there is where you get your \"ah ha\" moment helping you to remember the old game you knew and love. Not to mention the stellar music you'll soon be humming to (don't lie, we all do it!).\n\nOverall, this game is a blast. I personally haven't tried the multiplayer mode (unsure how online will work. Local will be later on) but I assume it's pretty well polished, if not, especially for the local.

It is easy to pick up and play but difficult to master, which is a concept that I absolutely adore. That being said, I was excited to hear that there was going to be a new installment. However, does it live up to the previous installments?\n\nGW2 was in my opinion the best installment in the series. It brought new gameplay modes, updated visuals, and even tighter controls. I'm happy to say that GW3 delivers on all of that and takes it to the next level. There is a new adventure mode that breathes fresh air into the gameplay by introducing the first change to the playing field by having you play on a variety of different shapes. This also carries into the visuals which are as sharp as ever and are NOT for those with a history of epileptic seizures. The controls are even better than that in GW2, which is incredibly important in a game that is this fast paced and intense. As for the diffuculty, this is the easiest GW title for beginners to jump into yet, but it is still as maddening as ever. As I mentioned earlier, this game is easy to pick up and play, but to really start knocking down some higher scores you need to put some serious time into this game. So this game is not for the faint of heart, but I encourage you to not be intimidated. \n\nWhat are some things that I didn't like? There seems to be an issue with performance and optimization. I don't have the strongest system in the world (i3-2100, GTX 560 Ti, 14gb RAM), but it is more than capable to still run many modern games at 1080p at a smooth 60fps. Surprisingly, that is not the case with GW3. As important as tight controls are in this game, a steady framerate is important as well. I experienced frame drops that have led to me bumping into enemies and throwing off my groove. This is an issue that may not matter to some, but to people who have spent a lot of time with previous titles of this game, all of them will agree that a smooth framerate is incredibly important in this series. I was able to remedy the problem by disabling v-sync in my Nvidia control panel with little to no screen tearing as a result. A simple fix that to a problem I hope will be fixed in later patches. Aside from that, there is not much to hate here. \n\nSo to go back to the question of whether this lives up to the previous titles in this series, I am happy to say that it does. It inludes the gamemodes that made the orginals so great, and builds upon that strong foundation into something fresh and new. Anyone who enjoyed the previous games in the series, particularly GW2, you will feel right at home with this title and have an absolute blast.

If you loved any of the past games, you'll love this one. It does not fail it's past predecessors, and is extremely good. The classic modes are good, but there was one thing that surprised me the most: the campaign is actually REALLY GOOD.\n\nPros:\n+ Great campaign\n+ Crisp, fun gameplay on all ends\n+ Beautiful sountrack (however, sound quality in a few (very few) areas is subpar)\n+ Classic modes still have their charm (no wax off? :P)\n+ Beautiful graphics\n+ Runs extremely well, I can get good framerates on the highest graphics setting available on a mid-range machine\n+ Great amounts of replayability\n+ Co-op is great (no online co-op)\n+ Online modes are creative\n+ Something for everyone (levels ranging from fun and easy to challenging and difficult)\n+ SPAWNING IS VERY OBVIOUS. YES.\n+ Leaderboards are outstanding, but even better if you have friends who play\n\nCons:\n- Sound quality is lacking in some areas (but very few)\n- Definitely not for anyone who can get frustrated quickly\n- The game will randomly minimize at times. This might just be a little day 1 bug, and it happens very uncommonly.\n\nGameplay: 11/10\nCampaign: 10/10\nMusic and Sound: 8/10\nOverall: 9/10\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who loved the previous games or is looking for a new arcade game to pick up.

Although you can play on keyboard and mouse technically, don't even bother unless you have an Xbox or other high quality gamepad with analog sticks. Your score will be WAY higher on the gamepad.\n\nHonestly if you own Geometry Wars 2 already, $15 for this game is a hard sell since there isn't really that much new. Adventure mode is a just like a shuffle mode with warped maps of the different familiar gametypes with the occasional boss match. And the music is a lot worse than 2, in my opinion. The music here is more soft while 2 is more aggressive and cool sounding.\n\nI'd consider this a must buy though, overall, since my Xbox and Geometry Wars 2 is ultimately going to collect dust or be sold whereas my PC collection always stays with me :P", "timestamp_created": 1416946101, "timestamp_updated": 1416946101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13081359": {"recommendationid": "13081359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060044348", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501009374}, "language": "english", "review": "A whole new version of Geometry Wars with an added layer of frustration.", "timestamp_created": 1416944183, "timestamp_updated": 1416944222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532649", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13081226": {"recommendationid": "13081226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024947442", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478261837}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't recommend this at the moment, as it crashes back to the desktop as soon as it tries to load.", "timestamp_created": 1416943431, "timestamp_updated": 1416943431, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.157756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13080889": {"recommendationid": "13080889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025483256", "num_games_owned": 712, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503475339}, "language": "english", "review": "First things first. The thing everyone is wondering, is it as good as past geometry wars? I would say yes, and in fact a lot better. It is perhaps the best geometry wars game out yet to date. *GASP*  I have played all of the geometry wars, from the first one to even the Wii and Ds games. Love the series. Many long time fans were worried  since this wasn't developed by the Bizzarre creations guys that it just wouldn't be the same. But fear not, much of the old staff has transitioned to the newly formed Lucid Games (after they disbanded from making Blur) which in turn created this masterpiece!\n\nFor any of you that wanted the classic gameplay, those modes are in with the updated snazzy visuals.  There are many classic modes to choose from, from pacism mode, to the tried and true three stock mode, to the waves mode just to name a few. So if you are an old time fan of the series, you will love the updated visuals paired with the classic gameplay.  Along with these modes is a local co-op mode for you and a buddy to tackle head on together!\n\nOn top of the geometry wars you have all grown to know and love, there is a new adventure mode, something similar to what you might have seen in the Wii version. There are a multitude of maps and different traps to conquer on Lucid Game's newly envisioned 3d playing field. The new and unique 3d playing field brings on for exciting gameplay challenges that haven't been seen in past iterations. No longer are you shooting on a flat surface, but now you are traversing through spheres or other geometrical shapes. Not only does each map have a leaderboard, but it also has a three star system for you to aim for if the top score is not your preference. You can ignore the star system just like the leaderboard scores, but as your point score racks up, you see the star meters guage fill up, just teasing you to three star each map. You are always left with the feeling, \"One more run and I can finish that last star!\" Another exciting addition inside the adventure mode are boss fights where you have to tackle a boss with its own unique set of traits.  These boss fights are not for the feint of heart and are quite difficult for even the seasoned veteran like myself. \n\nOne of the first things you notice about this game are the visuals. They are beautiful and have that eye popping look accompanied by bright neon explosions.  Along with the vibrant visuals, the soundtrack has a thumpy electro vibe that matches the fast and frenetic nature of Geometry Wars, a perfect fit!\n\nPerhaps one of the coolest features I am really excited for and hopefully the Steam community for geometry wars gets big enough is the multplayer mode.  You might be asking, \"What? Multiplayer in my Geometry Wars?\" There is a matchmaking mode online where you can compete against other players.  You go around shooting, competing for ammo, upgrading your ship, and taking down bosses. Whoever can score the most points/take down the bosses wins. A nice challenging and new creative way to play Geometry Wars.\n\nFrom the updated beautiful visuals, the new 3d playing field, adventure mode, to the classic and new matchmaking modes, for any old or new fan, Geometry Wars 3 will be an addicting game that will consume us for hundreds if not thousands of hours again. If Lucid games had just ported the classic modes without any of the graphical changes, that alone would have made it a great game, but there is a whole bunch more here than just that!\n\nBrb, back to playing!", "timestamp_created": 1416941560, "timestamp_updated": 1416984329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617747", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13080857": {"recommendationid": "13080857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135241254", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503386667}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game,perfectly captures the GW athmosphere!\n\n10/10 BUY!", "timestamp_created": 1416941363, "timestamp_updated": 1416941363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13080780": {"recommendationid": "13080780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066642237", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518577502}, "language": "english", "review": "The graphics are amazing! it runs so smoothly and would recommend this as one of the best \"arcade\" games on steam :D \n\nAsteroids; on crack.", "timestamp_created": 1416940946, "timestamp_updated": 1417015123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464645", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13080606": {"recommendationid": "13080606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111520467", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484286250}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun, yet hard to play at first.", "timestamp_created": 1416940066, "timestamp_updated": 1416940066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433009", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13080570": {"recommendationid": "13080570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034547108", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477626921}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth 14.99$ for sure. I have only been playing for 20 minutes and I love it. The game looks amazing, runs amazing, and feels amazing. My analog stick is off and in most games I constantly move left, but they must have deadzone support because I don't move at all unless I move the analog stick myself. They have the original game types (King, Pacifism, Deadline, Evolved), Adventure Mode, Online, and tons more. I love the music, SFX, and 3D elements. I strongly recommend this to fans of the previous installments and to anyone who is debating whether to purchase the game.\n\nI thought I would post some more notes.. so here we go. I am not the best at Geometry Wars and it has been a while since I played, but so far, the game isn't very easy. It isn't like Angry Birds when you can easily get 3 stars on every level.. you have to really know what you are doing and play the level multiple times, and I really like that. I reached the first boss and was pleasently suprised. It took me multiple tries to defeat it, but was really an awesome experience. You have to watch for the enemies, fight the boss, and get Geoms all while under a time limit.\n\nThe game is super intense and is honestly really fun.\n\nEdit: If you have any questions on the game, feel free to comment or PM me and I can try to answer!", "timestamp_created": 1416939927, "timestamp_updated": 1416942378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 108, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814730", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 860, "total_negative": 90, "total_reviews": 950}}

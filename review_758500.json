Not sure what else you expected from this game really...\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nSo, what can you expect from Loot Box Quest that isn't already shown in the trailer? Well really that is all that the game has to offer, and that's by no means a bad thing. Considering that the game is basically a parody of Loot boxes (*cough* probably something to do with EA's Starwars Battlefront 2 loot box system *cough*) it portrays what it wants to in the time that you put into the game, and considering that there is actually an end to the game there is a goal to reach to make you keep playing. \n\nFor a clicker game it's adds a slight bit of complexity more near the end game, but obviously things start off slow like in most clicker games. As you progress the game makes you upgrade your gear, making automation possible to help get money faster, pretty standard for most clicker games. As you progress you will start creating your own games to make money, and will slowly start adding micro-transactions to your games. This is where the complexity starts to go up a bit, you have to pay devs to make your game analysts to improve the next game you create. You'll have to manage how many you hire, the more you hire the higher their cost will be but the faster they will create games/improve upon your next game. It makes for some interesting game play, being slightly strategic about how many you hire, although not at all that difficult. \n\nEventually you'll get to the point where you will build your own company and have to manage your budget, what percentage of the budget goes into what category, and the assets which is what you need to upgrade further. A small nitpick I had was when this new mechanic was introduced nothing was really explained, only took a few minutes to figure out what everything did, but I would've liked a small explanation on what each budget percentage did.  Eventually you ill get to the end, maybe in like 3 - 4 hours and if you're feeling very adventurous then you could complete it in one sitting, but I would recommend coming back to it every now and then throughout a day or two.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nClicker games seemed to be divided into two different categories, those that are humorous but simplistic art style, or those with decent graphics and even though this one has simplistic graphics it's humour defiantly makes up for it. The layout of everything looks very clean, nothing too fancy but at the same time is still easy to look at and doesn't overload you with numbers of information about the game.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nGenerally the in-game music is a bit annoying in my opinion after playing it for a while, but there's always an option to turn it off, and even better you can listen to the music you have on steam to play in-game so that's pretty neat. Don't really see a lot of games do that nowadays\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Great parody game about loot boxes\n+ Great complexity that goes slightly beyond normal clicker games\n+ The game has a great humour throughout\n+ Simplistic graphics\n+ Custom Steam music that you own can be played in-game\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Nearer the end, the game doesn't really help you all that much with how key performance indicators work, although after a few minutes of analysing what each indicator percentage\n\n[h1]Result / Final Thoughts[/h1]\nLoot Box Quest is a great little clicker game that is funny, has simplistic graphics and can be completed in a day or so. For the price it's asking for, I think it's defiantly worth it, but hey even if you don't like it the developer tells you after playing the game for 90ish minutes that you can refund it if your not enjoying it. A gem of a game, highly recommended, even if it's for sh*ts and giggles.\n\n[quote]For more reviews on indie to AAA games, go and follow [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/_YoloArmy]Yolo Amry[/url] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6095538/]curator group here[/url].

The ending is rewarding enough and evokes a bit of a Paperclips-but-loot-boxes feel.\n\nLike most incrementals it's not a 'hard' game and not progressing, while technically possible, is easily avoided. The pacing makes it a fun experience with shifting paradigms every 15 to 45 minutes. It goes through more than five distinct stages of gameplay and each is thought out and well designed. Most incrementals have the draw of doing something else and coming back to the game every once in a while. Loot Box Quest will keep you actively clicking and managing for the first hour or so and then let you wait more towards the end.\n\nIn total, the game takes around 3 hours to complete and the only real replay value is finishing off some achievements that can be missed along the way.\n\nHaving played shorter, more story focused, incrementals like \"A Dark Room\", \"Paperclips\" or \"Spaceplan\" and more long-running mechanicals ones like \"Kittens\", \"Trimps\", \"Factory/ReactorIdle\", \"Realm Grinder\" and \"Sharks\" this one definitely falls towards the side of a tightly paced, finish-in-one-sitting experience but has a comparable level of polish to the early versions of those games. \n\nIt's a new entry for my short list of incrementals to recommend to people that might not be too familiar with the genre and a wholehearted recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1513974726, "timestamp_updated": 1513974816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38510580": {"recommendationid": "38510580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031350775", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513948664}, "language": "turkish", "review": "First time in my life I bought a game with it's full price , and worth it.\n\nMin 1 : Well I think I'm going to click a lot\nMin 3 : I swear I had an old mouse somewhere in the room\nMin 6 : *Carpel tunnel risk increases %900*\nMin 10: Runs in the background while I'm studying", "timestamp_created": 1513904284, "timestamp_updated": 1513904284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38497610": {"recommendationid": "38497610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074624155", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513878632}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0435\u043c", "timestamp_created": 1513878683, "timestamp_updated": 1513878683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38488000": {"recommendationid": "38488000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070150336", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513915880}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a bit on the fence about this one.

But if you can't buy loot boxes then you're just making money for the sake of making money.
